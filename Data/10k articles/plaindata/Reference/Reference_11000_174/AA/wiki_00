Classified as building number 33 of the Alcatraz Island National Historic Landmark, its historic name variants were \"Alcatraz Dock\" and \"Alcatraz Pier\". It is the main access point to Alcatraz. Another dock on the island's northwest side was only used for rock loading.<ref name=\"nps.gov/goga\"></ref> The wharf contained many of the islands historic buildings, including Building 64 (Alcatraz Defensive Barracks), the Bombproof Barracks, Chinatown, Ranger Office, Garage, Dock Tower, Storage Vault, and Firebox #3.\n\nThe wharf, or boat dock, was established on Alcatraz in the 1850s to permit the landing of men and building materials to construct a fort, completed in 1859. In 1867, the \"General McPherson\" was built to serve the island and other military institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area, as Alcatraz became a long-term military prison from 1868. The steamer towed officers, prisoners and food and water supplies to island between 1867 and 1886, landing at the dock twice daily before being replaced. \n\nDuring the time as a federal penitentiary, a prisoner once attempted to escape on a boat from the boat by dressing as an officer. The Sally Port led from the dock to the original citadel on Alcatraz along a walkway, 12 ft above a dry moat. Today the dock meets visitors to the museum on the island and is served by boat trips daily. Building 64 lies in front of the dock, built in 1905.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, work on the wharf area was undertaken to repair it and to create coals sheds and a boathouse. The Alcatraz Citadel's saltwater engine house was located on the wharf. The oil steamer \"Rosecrans,\" owned by the Associated Oil Company, was destroyed by fire above the water line and sank in deep water off the wharf in the early 1910s. Her crew of forty-two men escaped by jumping into the bay and swimming ashore.\n\nSeismic rehabilitation of the wharf occurred in the early 2000s. The retrofit to the existing wharf and its facilities consisted of concrete demolition, excavation, and installation of tiebacks. Reinforced steel and concrete were added to a new deck. Work was also done on the deteriorated piles under the wharf deck.David Finney is the youngest person to swim the South End Rowing Club Alcatraz Swim when he swam it in 2015 at ten years old.\n\n"}

In reality, the congressmen who were assembled in Tucumán declared the independence of the United Provinces of South America, which is still today one of the legal names of the Argentine Republic. The Federal League Provinces, at war with the United Provinces, were not allowed into the Congress. At the same time, several provinces from the Upper Peru that would later become part of present-day Bolivia, were represented at the Congress.\nThe 1810 May Revolution followed the deposition of the Spanish king Ferdinand VII by the Napoleonic French. The revolution ended the authority of the Viceroy Cisneros and replaced it with the Primera Junta.\n\nWhen the Spanish monarchy resumed its functions in 1814, Spain was determined to recover control over its colonies in the Americas. Moreover, the royalists from Peru had been victorious at the battles of Sipe-Sipe, Huaqui, Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, in Upper Peru, and seriously threatened the United Provinces from the north.\n\nOn April 15, 1815 a revolution ended the mandate of Carlos María de Alvear as Supreme Director and demanded that a General Congress be summoned. Delegate deputies, each representing 14,000 inhabitants, were sent from all the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to the sessions, which started on March 24, 1816. However, the Federal League Provinces did not send delegates: the Argentine \"littoral\" Provinces (Santa Fé, Entre Ríos, Corrientes and Misiones), and the Eastern Province (modern-day Uruguay).\n\nThe Congress was inaugurated in the city of Tucumán, with 33 deputies. The presidency of the Congress would be rotated monthly. Because the Congress had the freedom to choose topics to debate, endless discussions ensued.\n\nThe voting finally ended on July 9 with a declaration of independence. The Declaration pointed to the circumstances in Europe of the past six years—the removal of the King of Spain by the Napoleon and the subsequent refusal of Ferdinand VII to accept constitutional rule both in the Peninsula and overseas. The Document claimed that Spanish America recovered its sovereignty from the Crown of Castile in 1808, when Ferdinand VII had been deposed, and therefore, any union between the overseas dominions of Spain and the Peninsula had been dissolved. This was a legal concept that was also invoked by the other Spanish American declarations of independence, such as Venezuela's (1811) and Mexico's (1810), which were responding to the same events. The president of the Congress at the time was Francisco Narciso de Laprida, delegate from San Juan Province. Subsequent discussions centered on what form of government the emerging state should adopt.\n\nThe congress continued its work in Buenos Aires in 1817, but it got stopped in 1820 after the Battle of Cepeda, which deepened the differences between the Unitarian Party, who favored a strong central government, and the Federales, who favored a weak central government.\n\nThe house where the declaration was adopted has been rebuilt and is now a museum and monument: the House of Tucumán.\n\n\n\nThe Declaration of Independence of the United Provinces of South America was written in Spanish and then translated into Quechua and Aymara. The version in Aymara is attributed to Vicente Pazos Kanki (1779-1852).\n\n\n"}

It offers synchronization of calendars using Microsoft Exchange Server, Outlook.com Apple's iCloud calendar service, and Google Calendar. It supports the popular iCalendar format.\n\nMicrosoft first included a Calendar app in Windows 1.0, which was included until Windows 3.1, and was replaced by Schedule+ in Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT 3.1. Schedule+ was later moved from Windows to the Microsoft Office suite, and Windows did not include another Calendar application until Windows Calendar in Windows Vista. Calendar had been created by Beta 2 of Windows Vista.\n\nThis version supports sharing, subscribing, and publishing of calendars on WebDAV-enabled web servers and network shares. It has always supported .ics files, and the subscription feature enables syncing with Google Calendar. Its interface matches Windows Vista Mail's, but the two apps are not connected in this operating system. The default calendar can be renamed.\n\nA new version of Calendar with a text-heavy was added to Windows 8 as one of many apps written to run full-screen or snapped as part of Microsoft's Metro design language philosophy. It is one of three apps on Windows that originate from Microsoft Outlook, the other two being Mail and People apps. Structurally, the three apps are one and are installed and uninstalled as such. But each has its own user interface. Calendar in Windows 8 originally supported Outlook.com, Exchange, Google Calendar, and Facebook calendars. Because of API changes, Facebook and Google calendars can no longer be directly synced on Windows 8. Like many Microsoft apps introduced for Windows 8, many of the features are hidden in the charms or a menu at the bottom of the screen that is triggered by right clicking. Different calendars can be labeled with different colors.

Users can set it to use the system theme or choose a custom accent color, background image, and light/dark preference. Windows 10 Calendar has multi-window support for viewing and editing events. Different calendars can be labeled with different colors, and events can be rearranged by dragging and dropping. The default interface is Month View, but users can also use Day, Week, and Year views and print these views. The Windows 10 app also uses a flyout settings panel and a mini Ribbon interface in the viewing pane. The day of the year and calendar events show on the live tile. Like the Vista version, the important controls are readily visible and use icons to match the system's. Accounts can be grouped and relabeled, but folders cannot be edited from within the app. .ics support was added to this version in time for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.\n\n"}

{"id": "1507752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1507752", "title": "DNS spoofing", "text": "DNS spoofing\n\nDNS spoofing, also referred to as DNS cache poisoning, is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt Domain Name System data is introduced into the DNS resolver's cache, causing the name server to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an IP address. This results in traffic being diverted to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).\n\nA domain name system server translates a human-readable domain name (such as codice_1) into a numerical IP address that is used to route communications between nodes. Normally if the server doesn't know a requested translation it will ask another server, and the process continues recursively. To increase performance, a server will typically remember (cache) these translations for a certain amount of time. This means if it receives another request for the same translation, it can reply without needing to ask any other servers, until that cache expires.\n\nWhen a DNS server has received a false translation and caches it for performance optimization, it is considered \"poisoned\", and it supplies the false data to clients. If a DNS server is poisoned, it may return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to another computer (often an attacker's).\n\nNormally, a networked computer uses a DNS server provided by an Internet service provider (ISP) or the computer user's organization. DNS servers are used in an organization's network to improve resolution response performance by caching previously obtained query results. Poisoning attacks on a single DNS server can affect the users serviced directly by the compromised server or those serviced indirectly by its downstream server(s) if applicable.\n\nTo perform a cache poisoning attack, the attacker exploits flaws in the DNS software. A server should correctly validate DNS responses to ensure that they are from an authoritative source (for example by using DNSSEC); otherwise the server might end up caching the incorrect entries locally and serve them to other users that make the same request.\n\nThis attack can be used to redirect users from a website to another site of the attacker's choosing. For example, an attacker spoofs the IP address DNS entries for a target website on a given DNS server and replaces them with the IP address of a server under their control. The attacker then creates files on the server under their control with names matching those on the target server. These files usually contain malicious content, such as computer worms or viruses. A user whose computer has referenced the poisoned DNS server gets tricked into accepting content coming from a non-authentic server and unknowingly downloads the malicious content. This technique can also be used for phishing attacks, where a fake version of a genuine website is created to gather personal details such as bank and credit/debit card details.\n\nIn the following variants, the entries for the server ns.target.example would be poisoned and redirected to the attacker's name server at IP address w.x.y.z. These attacks assume that the name server for target.example is ns.target.example.\n\nTo accomplish the attacks, the attacker must force the target DNS server to make a request for a domain controlled by one of the attacker's nameservers.\n\nThe first variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the name server of the attacker's domain to the name server of the target domain, then assigning that name server an IP address specified by the attacker.\n\nDNS server's request: what are the address records for subdomain.attacker.example?\n\nAttacker's response:\n\nA vulnerable server would cache the additional A-record (IP address) for ns.target.example, allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire target.example domain.\n\nThe second variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the nameserver of another domain unrelated to the original request to an IP address specified by the attacker.\n\nDNS server's request: what are the address records for subdomain.attacker.example?\n\nAttacker's response:\n\nA vulnerable server would cache the unrelated authority information for target.example's NS-record (nameserver entry), allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire target.example domain.\n\nMany cache poisoning attacks against DNS servers can be prevented by being less trusting of the information passed to them by other DNS servers, and ignoring any DNS records passed back which are not directly relevant to the query. For example, versions of BIND 9.5.0-P1 and above perform these checks. Source port randomization for DNS requests, combined with the use of cryptographically-secure random numbers for selecting both the source port and the 16-bit cryptographic nonce, can greatly reduce the probability of successful DNS race attacks.\n\nHowever, when routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices perform network address translation (NAT), or more specifically, port address translation (PAT), they may rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. When modifying source ports, PAT devices may remove source port randomness implemented by nameservers and stub resolvers.\n\nSecure DNS (DNSSEC) uses cryptographic digital signatures signed with a trusted public key certificate to determine the authenticity of data. DNSSEC can counter cache poisoning attacks, but as of 2008 was not yet widely deployed. In 2010 DNSSEC was implemented in the Internet root zone servers.\n\nThis kind of attack can be mitigated at the transport layer or application layer by performing end-to-end validation once a connection is established. A common example of this is the use of Transport Layer Security and digital signatures. For example, by using HTTPS (the secure version of HTTP), users may check whether the server's digital certificate is valid and belongs to a website's expected owner. Similarly, the secure shell remote login program checks digital certificates at endpoints (if known) before proceeding with the session. For applications that download updates automatically, the application can embed a copy of the signing certificate locally and validate the signature stored in the software update against the embedded certificate.\n\n"}

{"id": "65724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65724", "title": "Dome of the Rock", "text": "Dome of the Rock\n\nThe Dome of the Rock ( \"Qubbat al-Sakhrah\", \"Kippat ha-Sela\") is an Islamic shrine located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nIt was initially completed in 691 CE at the order of Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik during the Second Fitna, built on the site of the Roman temple of \"Jupiter Capitolinus\", which had in turn been built on the site of the Second Jewish Temple, destroyed during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE.\nThe original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23. The Dome of the Rock is in its core one of the oldest extant works of Islamic architecture.\n\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces, although its outside appearance has been significantly changed in the Ottoman period and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine Church of the Seat of Mary (also known as \"Kathisma\" in Greek and \"al-Qadismu\" in Arabic) built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.\n\nThe site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and to the belief that the Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey to heaven started from the rock at the center of the structure.\n\nIn Jewish tradition the rock bears great significance as the Foundation Stone, the place from which the world expanded into its present form and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human, Adam; as the site on Mount Moriah where Abraham attempted to sacrifice his son; and as the place where God's divine presence is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, it has been called \"Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark,\" along with two nearby Old City structures, the Western Wall, and the \"Resurrection Rotunda\" in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of the Temple of Solomon and the Jewish Second Temple, which had been greatly expanded under Herod the Great in the 1st century BCE. Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, a Roman temple to \"Jupiter Capitolinus\" was built at the site.\n\nJerusalem was ruled by the Christian Byzantine Empire throughout the 4th to 6th centuries. During this time, Christian pilgrimage to Jerusalem began to develop. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built under Constantine in the 320s, but the Temple Mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the Jewish Temple under Julian the Apostate.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock is now mostly assumed to have been built by the order of Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik and his son and successor Al-Walid I. According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, construction started in 687. Construction cost was reportedly seven times the yearly tax income of Egypt.\n\nA dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome. The date is recorded as AH 72 (691/2 CE), the year historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed. In this inscription, the name of al-Malik was deleted and replaced by the name of Abbasid caliph Al-Ma'mun. This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by Melchior de Vogüé in 1864. Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under Heraclius (r. 610–641).\n\nIts architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces. The two engineers in charge of the project were Raja ibn Haywah, a Muslim theologian from Beit She'an and Yazid Ibn Salam, a non-Arab who was Muslim and a native of Jerusalem.\n\nShelomo Dov Goitein of the Hebrew University has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: \"The very form of a rotunda, given to the \"Qubbat as-Sakhra\", although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes.\" K.A.C. Creswell in his book \"The Origin of the Plan of the Dome of the Rock\" notes that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The diameter of the dome of the shrine is and its height , while the diameter of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is and its height .\n\nThe structure was basically octagonal. It comprised a wooden dome, approximately in diameter, which was mounted on an elevated drum consisting of a circle of 16 piers and columns. Surrounding this circle was an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns.\nThe building was severely damaged by earthquakes in 808 and again in 846. The dome collapsed in an earthquake in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23. The mosaics on the drum were repaired in 1027–28.\n\nFor centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem (Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who ordered the destruction of the Holy Sepulchre, was an example) instigated the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the Al-Aqsa Mosque became a royal palace. The Knights Templar, active from c. 1119, identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the Temple of Solomon and set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century. The \"Templum Domini\", as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official seals of the Order's Grand Masters (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and soon became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe.\n\nJerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine. The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent, and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below.\nSaladin's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock was the focus of extensive royal patronage by the sultans during the Mamluk period, which lasted from 1250 until 1510.\n\nDuring the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566) the exterior of the Dome of the Rock was covered with tiles. This work took seven years.\n\nThe interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion. It also contains Qur'anic inscriptions.\nSurah Ya Sin (the \"Heart of the Quran\") is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the 16th century by Suleiman the Magnificent. Al-Isra, the Surah 17 which tells the story of the \"Isra\" or Night Journey, is inscribed above this.\n\nAdjacent to the Dome of the Rock, the Ottomans built the free-standing Dome of the Prophet in 1620.\nLarge-scale renovation was undertaken during the reign of Mahmud II in 1817.\n\nIn a major restoration project undertaken in 1874–75 during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz, all the tiles on the west and southwest walls of the octagonal part of the building were removed and replaced by copies that had been made in Turkey.\n\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British during the 1917 mandate of Palestine, along with Yaqub al-Ghusayn, implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock was badly shaken during the 11 July 1927 Jericho earthquake, damaging many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.\n\nIn 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey. The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain. In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior. Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened lead. In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with gold leaf.\n\nA few hours after the Israeli flag was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the Six-Day War, Israelis lowered it on the orders of Moshe Dayan and invested the Muslim \"waqf\" (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif, in order to \"keep the peace\".\n\nIn 1993, the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of USD 8.2 million by King Hussein of Jordan who sold one of his houses in London to fund the 80 kilograms of gold required.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock has been depicted on the Obverse and reverse of several Middle East currencies:\n\nThe Dome is maintained by the Ministry of Awqaf in Amman, Jordan.\n\nUntil the mid-twentieth century, non-Muslims were not permitted in the area. Since 1967, non-Muslims have been permitted limited access; however non-Muslims are not permitted to pray on the Temple Mount, bring prayer books, or wear religious apparel. The Israeli police help enforce this. Israel restricted access for a short time during 2012 of Palestinian residents of the West Bank to the Temple Mount. West Bank Palestinian men had to be over 35 to be eligible for a permit. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem, who hold Israeli residency cards, and Palestinians with Israeli citizenship are permitted unrestricted access.\n\nSome Orthodox rabbis encourage Jews to visit the site, while most forbid entry to the compound lest there be a violation of Jewish law. Even rabbis who encourage entrance to the Temple Mount prohibit entrance to the actual Dome of the Rock.\n\nAccording to some Islamic scholars, the rock is the spot from which the Islamic prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel. Further, Muhammad was taken here by Gabriel to pray with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.\nOther Islamic scholars believe that the Prophet ascended to Heaven from the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nMuslims believe the location of the Dome of the Rock to be the site mentioned in Sura 17 of the Qur'an, which tells the story of the Isra and Mi'raj, the miraculous Night Journey of Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to \"the farthest mosque\", where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from Allah. The Night Journey is mentioned in the Qur'an in a very brief form and is further elaborated by the hadiths. Caliph Umar ibn Al-Khattab (579–644) was advised by Ka'ab al-Ahbar, a Jewish rabbi who converted to Islam, that \"the farthest mosque\" is identical with the site of the former Jewish Temples in Jerusalem.\nThe Foundation Stone and its surroundings is the holiest site in Judaism. Though Muslims now pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, they once faced the Temple Mount as the Jews do. Muhammad changed the direction of prayer for Muslims after a revelation from Allah. Jews traditionally regarded the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies during the Temple Period.\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the stone is the site where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac.\n\nOn the walls of the Dome of the Rock is an inscription in a mosaic frieze that includes an explicit rejection of the divinity of Christ, from Quran (19:33–35):\n33. \"So peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!\" 34. Such is Jesus, son of Mary. It is a statement of truth, about which they doubt. 35. It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should take himself a child. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is.\n\nAccording to Goitein, the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against Christianity, whilst stressing at the same time the Qur'anic doctrine that Jesus was a true prophet. The formula \"la sharika lahu\" (\"God has no companion\") is repeated five times; the verses from Sura Maryam 19:35–37, which strongly reaffirm Jesus' prophethood to God, are quoted together with the prayer: \"Allahumma salli ala rasulika wa'abdika 'Isa bin Maryam\" – \"O Lord, send your blessings to your Prophet and Servant Jesus son of Mary.\" He believes that this shows that rivalry with Christendom, together with the spirit of Muslim mission to the Christians, was at work at the time of construction.\n\nThe Temple Institute wishes to relocate the Dome to another site and replace it with a Third Temple. Many Israelis are ambivalent about the Movement's wishes. Some religious Jews, following rabbinic teaching, believe that the Temple should only be rebuilt in the messianic era, and that it would be presumptuous of people to force God's hand. However, some Evangelical Christians consider rebuilding of the Temple to be a prerequisite to Armageddon and the Second Coming. Jeremy Gimpel, a US-born candidate for Habayit Hayehudi in the 2013 Israeli elections, caused a controversy when he was recorded telling a Fellowship Church evangelical group in Florida in 2011 to imagine the incredible experience that would follow were the Dome to be destroyed. All Christians would be immediately transported to Israel, he opined.\n\nThe Dome of the Rock has inspired the architecture of a number of buildings. These include the octagonal Church of St. Giacomo in Italy, the Mausoleum of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in Istanbul, the octagonal Moorish Revival style Rumbach Street Synagogue in Budapest, and the New Synagogue in Berlin, Germany. It was long believed by Christians that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, as can be seen in Raphael's \"The Marriage of the Virgin\" and in Perugino's \"Marriage of the Virgin\".\n\n\nCitations\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2030612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030612", "title": "Gene Okerlund", "text": "Gene Okerlund\n\nEugene Arthur Okerlund (born December 19, 1942) also known by his ring name \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, is a semi-retired American professional wrestling interviewer, announcer and wrestler. He is best known for his work in the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006 by Hulk Hogan. He is currently signed to a lifetime contract with WWE and works for promotional programs, mostly WWE Network programming and occasionally TV. He is the co-host of \"Vintage Collection\".\n\nAfter studying broadcast journalism, Okerlund landed a job as a disc jockey at KOIL, a popular radio station in Omaha, Nebraska. Okerlund would later move to Minneapolis working for a local television station working in the front office.\n\nOkerlund left the radio industry for a position at the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1970, where he occasionally filled in for ailing ring announcer and interviewer Marty O'Neill, eventually becoming O'Neill's permanent replacement by the end of the decade.\n\nHe would stay with the AWA until the end of 1983, when he was one of many AWA personnel to join the expanding World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He would stay with the WWF for nine years as their top interviewer, and was host of such WWF shows as \"All-American Wrestling\" and \"Tuesday Night Titans\".\n\nIn 1984, Okerlund and Hulk Hogan faced Mr. Fuji and George Steele in Minneapolis. He was supposed to stay on the apron and let Hogan fight, but when Hogan gave him a high five, the referee mistook it for a tag. Okerlund had to go in, but before his opponent touched him, he quickly got out of the way and tagged Hogan back in. The result: Okerlund pinned Mr. Fuji for the victory.\n\nOn March 31, 1985 Okerlund became the first person to sing the National Anthem at WrestleMania doing so at\nWrestleMania I.\n\nOn November 12, 1985, Okerlund, along with Hulk Hogan, Bobby Heenan, Ricky Steamboat, Davey Boy Smith, Corporal Kirchner, Dynamite Kid and Big John Studd, appeared on \"The A-Team\".\n\nOkerlund was also part of one of the most infamous bloopers in pro wrestling history at WWF SummerSlam 1989. Okerlund was set to interview WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude and Rude's manager Bobby Heenan prior to Rude's title defense against The Ultimate Warrior when the SummerSlam backdrop fell backwards. The shot of the SummerSlam backdrop falling can be seen in the video induction of Mean Gene at the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006. Okerlund then turned around and said, \"Fuck it,\" along with some other words with no audio. The cameras then cut away to a live shot of the crowd, with play-by-play announcer Tony Schiavone and color commentator Jesse Ventura attempting to restore order. After a short while, Okerlund's interview with Rude and Heenan went as planned. According to a shoot interview with Okerlund, conducted by RF Video, the SummerSlam 1989 blooper was actually taped beforehand. Okerlund explained that the wrong tape was aired during the live broadcast. Meanwhile, a frantic Vince McMahon was on a headset instructing Jesse Ventura to cover for Okerlund. Ventura instead made fun of Okerlund's on-air gaffe and jokingly regarded Okerlund as a \"troublemaker.\"\n\nOkerlund also made another unscripted gaffe when on live TV near the end of the 1992 Royal Rumble PPV he, while doing his interview, famously turned towards someone off-camera and said \"Put that cigarette out!\", then went right on with his announcement.\n\nOkerlund appeared at SummerSlam 1993 and made his final WWF appearance on the September 18, 1993 edition of \"Superstars\". He then left the WWF entirely when his contract expired. He stated in an RF shoot interview, that although he probably could've re-negotiated a new contract, he was never actually offered one, thus opting to become an interviewer for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He claimed at the time of his hiring with WCW that he had not been on speaking terms with McMahon for the past few years he was working in the WWF. He debuted on the November 6, 1993 edition of \"WCW Saturday Night\". Three years later, his contract expired with WCW and he was off television for two months in the fall of 1996. His final appearance was at WCW Fall Brawl on Sunday 09/15/1996. He returned on Monday 11/11/1996 on WCW Monday Nitro. Okerlund had reached out to the WWF once again to be re-hired but they passed on him. Mike Tenay took over Special Interviews and the Pay Per View Reports. After that, he was with WCW until it was sold on March 26, 2001 to the WWF.\n\nDuring an interview with Booker T, Stevie Ray, and Sister Sherri at Spring Stampede (1997), Okerlund was involved in another infamous botch when Booker T accidentally shouted out during an interview: \"Hulk Hogan, we comin' for you, nigga!\" (with Booker T noticeably immediately regretting his use of the epithet and Sherri trying to hold back laughter after the error).\n\nAlways considered a neutral commentator throughout his career, he was given a \"dirty old man\" gimmick by Vince Russo in WCW, where he would stare at the breasts of the women he interviewed and make inappropriate, lustful comments toward WCW interviewer/announcer Pamela Paulshock.\n\nOkerlund wrestled twice in WCW. The first was in mid-2000 when he and Buff Bagwell faced Chris Kanyon and fellow announcer Mark Madden, with Bagwell and Okerlund winning. However, Madden wanted Okerlund back in the ring the next week in a one on one match-up. The two did wrestle again and Okerlund won the match with the assistance of Pamela Paulshock.\n\nOkerlund then returned to the WWF (renamed WWE in 2002), as his first post-WCW assignment for the company was as a commentator for the Gimmick Battle Royal during WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, 2001, along with Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan. He would go on to host \"WWE Confidential\" in 2002, which lasted for two years. Today, Okerlund still makes occasional WWE appearances.\n\nGene also hosts \"WWE Madison Square Garden Classics\", a weekly series, airing on the MSG Network, featuring classic WWE matches that took place at Madison Square Garden from the last four decades. He's also the host for the WWE Classics On Demand Hall of Fame section, which takes a look at a different WWE Hall of Famer each month.\n\nOkerlund was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006 by Hulk Hogan. During his acceptance speech, he quoted a Bobby Knight speech and requested to be buried face down upon his death so his critics can \"Kiss my ass\".\n\nIn June 2008, Okerlund began hosting \"WWE Vintage Collection\", a program which showcases archive footage from the extensive WWE video library.\n\nOn April 4, 2009, the night before the 25th anniversary of WrestleMania, Okerlund inducted longtime WWE ring announcer Howard Finkel into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nOkerlund conducted the interviews on the three-hour \"Old School\" episode of \"Raw\" on November 15, 2010, where he interviewed John Cena, Randy Orton, members of The Nexus and Mae Young in similar fashion as to how interviews were done in the 1980s. Okerlund also appeared in a few Old School merchandising segments, promoting WWE's new Old School merchandise line.\n\nOkerlund made an appearance at Wrestlemania XXVII in a segment with The Rock and Pee-wee Herman.\n\nOn April 10, 2012, during the \"WWE Smackdown: Blast from the Past\", Okerlund teamed with World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, in a winning effort, against the team of Daniel Bryan and Alberto Del Rio.\n\nOn the December 17, 2012 edition of \"WWE Raw\", Gene Okerlund appeared alongside Jim Ross and Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat to announce the winner of the Slammy Award for \"Match of the Year\".\n\nOn March 4, 2013, Okerlund appeared at the second \"Old School Raw\" for Mae Young's 90th birthday party which was interrupted later by CM Punk.\n\nOn January 7, 2014, Okerlund made an appearance at the third \"Old School Raw\", in which he made references to the premium rate \"wrestling hotlines\" of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOkerlund inducted Mr. T into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2014.\n\nFrom April to June 2014, Okerlund was a regular cast member on the WWE Network original reality show \"Legends' House\".\n\nIn November 2016, Okerlund became the narrator for the WWE Network original animated series \"WWE Story Time\".\n\nOn January 22, 2018, Okerlund appeared on the 25th anniversary episode of \"Raw\" to interview A.J. Styles.\n\nOkerlund was one of the professional wrestling legends on the WWE Network's show \"Legends House\".\n\nOkerlund appeared as a \"Celebrity Prognosticator\" on ESPN Radio's The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz on November 27, 2013.\n\nIn 2018, Okerlund appeared in a Mountain Dew Kickstart commercial featuring Kevin Hart who during the commercial semi-impersonated Randy Savage.\n\nForming a band in his high school days, \"Gene Carroll & The Shades\" were based out of Sisseton, South Dakota, recording a single in 1959 \"Red Devil / Do You Remember\" (M&L 1001). A second single was released in 1962 \"Is It Ever Gonna Happen / Holly\" (Wausau C-1100) as \"Gene Carroll\". They played parties throughout the Midwest and the Dakotas, and in 2009 were inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Music Association's Hall of Fame.\n\nIn his AWA days, Okerlund was given the nickname \"Mean Gene\" by Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura – an irony, considering that throughout the years many wrestlers and promotion staff considered Okerlund the friendliest person in the game. Okerlund is close friends with Bobby Heenan, Hulk Hogan and The Iron Sheik. Okerlund served as best man at the Iron Sheik's wedding.\n\nHis name has been associated with fast food concept, Mean Gene's Burgers, the brainchild of food-distributor Orion Food Systems (headed by two of Okerlund's nephews), which appeared on college campuses including Duke University and West Virginia University, as well as a chain of pizzerias located within bowling alleys, Mean Gene's Pizza. These are owned by Hot Stuff Foods, which was headed by two of his nephews. Early in 2006, Okerlund and Hot Stuff split. Okerlund and one of the nephews were planning to start their own food company on the brands, but Hot Stuff sued, claiming they had \"Mean Gene\" trademarked. Okerlund lost, with the judge saying that Okerlund can't use the name \"Mean Gene\" for his new food company. Okerlund succeeded in canceling the trademark registrations held by Orion, but remains enjoined from competing with Orion.\n\nOkerlund has been married to his wife Jeanne since March 27, 1964 and has two grown children. Gene's son Todd starred on the University of Minnesota ice hockey team from 1983 to 1987. Todd played on the 1988 United States Olympics team that competed in Calgary. He played four games with the NHL's New York Islanders. A chronic knee injury ultimately forced his early retirement.\n\nOkerlund has had two kidney transplants, his first in 1995 and his second in 2004, one of which he received from his wife.\n\nHe spends most of his time in Sarasota, Florida.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6142588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6142588", "title": "Glass disease", "text": "Glass disease\n\nGlass disease, also referred to as sick glass or glass illness, is a degradation process of glass that can result in weeping, crizzling, spalling, cracking and fragmentation.\nGlass disease is caused by an inherent instability in the chemical composition of the original glass formula. \nProperties of a particular glass will vary with the type and proportions of silica, alkali and alkaline earth in its composition.\nOnce damage has occurred it is irreversible, but decay processes can be slowed by climate control to regulate surrounding temperature, humidity, and air flow.\n\nGlass disease is caused by an inherent fault in the chemical composition of the original glass formula. \nGlass contains three types of components: \"network formers\" establish basic structure, \"network stabilizers\" make glass strong and water resistant, and \"flux\" lowers the melting point at which the glass can be formed.\nCommon formulations of glass may include silica (SiO) as a former, alkali oxides such as soda (NaO) or potash (KO) for flux, and alkaline earth oxides such as lime (CaO) for stabilizing.\n\nStructurally, glass is composed of a network of SiO-tetrahedrons. In addition to the \"network former\" silicon which establishes its principal structure, glass contains \"network modifying agents\" such as the alkali ions Na+ and K+ and the alkali earth ions Ca+ and Mg+. Glass does not have a defined stoichiometry, rather the network is flexible. It can incorporate other ions, depending upon factors such as the main composition and firing conditions of the glass. This causes almost all glass to be chemically unstable to some extent.\n\nElectron charge differences of ions within the structure form the basis of its bonding. Both viscosity and transition temperature are related to the availability of oxygen bonds in the glass's composition. Modifying agents tend to lower the melting point of the silica. Higher contents of SiO increase acidity of the glass. Higher contents of CaO, NaO, and KO increase basicity.\nThe chemical stability of glass decreases when only NaO and KO are added as flux, because bonding becomes weaker. The chemical stability of glass can be increased by adding CaO, MgO, ZnO, and AlO. To be stable, glass composition must balance temperature lowering agents with stabilizing agents.\n\nExposure of a glass surface to moisture, either in solution or from humidity in the atmosphere, causes chemical reactions to occur on and below the surface of the glass. The exchange of alkali metal ions (from within the glass) and hydrogen ions (from outside) can cause chemical and structural changes to the glass. When alkali metal cations in the near-surface layer are replaced by smaller hydrogen ions, structural differences between the affected surface layer and the unaffected lower layers of glass cause increasing tensile stress, which in turn can cause cracking.\n\nThe likelihood of degradation due to glass disease depends on the amount and proportion of alkaline compounds mixed with silica, and on surrounding conditions.\nInadequate calcium oxide causes the alkalis in the glass to remain water-soluble at a low level of humidity. Exposure to higher levels of relative humidity during storage or display causes alkali to hydrate and leach out of the glass. Repeated changes in humidity can be particularly damaging. It is important to realize that any glass object can deteriorate if it is exposed to unsuitable environmental conditions. Crystal, historic glass, or treasured family items should never be exposed to the high temperatures and water pressure of a dishwasher.\n\nEnergy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) can be used to study exchange reactions in different types of glass. By quantifying and studying chemical structure and reactions at the near-surface layer, the mechanisms of glass disease can be better understood. \nMeasurement of the pH of glass surfaces is particularly important if glass objects have a matte surface, or have been exposed to kaolin or other substances. In the case of extremely small objects such as glass beads, pH measurement may be necessary to determine whether alkaline salts are present and changes in the glass are occurring.\n\nThe processes involved in glass disease can reduce the transparency of the glass or even threaten the integrity of the structure. Glass disease causes a complex disintegration of the glass which can be identified through a variety of symptoms, including weeping, crizzling, spalling, cracking and fragmentation.\n\nThe following description of glass beads from an object in the collection of the British Museum, effectively illustrates the range of symptoms that can occur with glass disease: \nThe initial stage of glass disease occurs when moisture causes alkali to be leached out of the glass. This becomes apparent when hygroscopic alkali deposits on the glass give it a cloudy or hazy appearance. \nThis may occur within as little as five to 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. \nThe glass may feel slippery or slimy \nand tiny droplets, or \"weeping\", may be seen in high humidity (above 55%). \nThe hydrated alkali can form fine crystals on the surface of the glass in low relative humidity (below 40%).\n\nAt this stage, it may be possible to gently wash the glass and remove the surface alkali.\nThis will help to stabilize the glass by reducing the surface pH, and by removing dust, soiling, and hygroscopic components that attract further moisture.\n\nIf alkali builds up due to ion exchange, and remains on the surface of the glass, the decay process will accelerate. The presence of sodium or potassium ions in the alkali build up will increase the pH on the surface of the glass, causing it to become basic. This will dissolve silica from the glass as well as releasing more alkali ions.\n\nThe haziness seen on the glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks like tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible. A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks. The cracks are caused by the loss of alkali, which leaves microscopic gaps in the structure of the glass.\n\nAs higher amounts of alkali leach from the glass cracks are likely to become deeper. \"Crizzling\" is a distinctive network of fine cracks in the glass which is visible to the naked eye.\nIn some cases, the crazing can gain a more uniform appearance. However, crizzling may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass.\n\nDistinct cracks may appear on the surface of the glass, and surface material may flake or chip, a process referred to as \"spalling.\"\n\nIn the most severe stage of deterioration, the structural integrity of the glass has been lost and the glass may separate into pieces.\n\nA survey of glass objects at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, in 1992, found that more than 1 in 10 objects in the collection were affected by crizzling, ranging from 16th century Venetian to 20th century Scandinavian glass. \nVenetian glass is particularly susceptible because artisans minimized the use of lime, to make the glass as clear as possible. \nThe works of modern glassmakers who experiment with their glass formulas, such as Ettore Sottsass, can also be at high risk for damage.\n\nMuseums such as the National Museum of the American Indian may find glass disease an issue of great importance because many of the Native American cultural materials in their collections incorporate glass beads.\nSmall ornamental glass beads were often made cheaply, using recipes with a high flux to silica ratio. This makes them more susceptible to glass disease. Blues, reds, and black are often affected by glass disease. The combination of glass beads with other materials (cordage, fabric, leather, metal, bone, surface colorants, ceremonial substances, and kaolin) complicates deterioration and conservation of ethnographic objects.\n\nIn the earliest stage of glass disease, it may be possible to wash the glass to remove the surface alkali. The Corning Museum of Glass recommends washing with tap water (tepid, not hot) and a mild (non-ionic) conservation detergent. This should be followed by rinsing with de-ionized or distilled water, and careful drying to remove moisture. Careful washing can remove surface deposits, restore the appearance of clearness to the glass, and help to slow further deterioration. \nEthanol has also been suggested for cleaning, particularly for glass beads, depending on the surrounding materials that may be affected.\n\nOnce more serious damage has occurred, it cannot be reversed. Climate control of humidity and temperature is a possible intervention. Because crizzling results from the reaction of components of the glass with water vapour, controlling humidity and temperature can slow its occurrence. At the Corning Museum of Glass, items in the collection are kept at stable levels of relative humidity, between 40 and 55 percent. \nFans may be used within a case to encourage the movement of air and minimize adsorption of moisture on the glass surface. Deterioration is more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow which allow moisture to remain on the glass. Chemical methods for retarding corrosion rates and stabilizing surfaces are being investigated. \n\nWhen a composite object contains a variety of materials, one of which is sick glass, the considerations involved in conserving and displaying the object become more complicated. For example, the British Museum chose to conserve and display a Siberian shamanic apron made of leather, glass and other materials. They weighed the likelihood that it would decay more quickly if shown against the desirability of making a unique object visible and the inevitability of its eventual degradation. \"Its conservation and display ensures that access to this beautiful and unique object is maximized before the pale yellow beads, which are intrinsic to the object, are inevitably lost beyond repair.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "52074166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52074166", "title": "Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)", "text": "Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)\n\nThe Guardian is a hereditary office of the Bahá'í Faith that is first mentioned in the \"Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá\". Shoghi Effendi was named as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, and future Guardians were to be appointed from among the male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh. However, since Shoghi Effendi died without having named a successor Guardian, no person could be named to fulfill the position after his death on November 4, 1957, and he remains the only individual acknowledged as Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, but his guidance remains in the written record of his many writings.\n\nBeing `Abdu'l-Bahá's eldest grandson, the first son of `Abdu'l-Bahá's eldest daughter Ḍiyá'iyyih Khánum, Shoghi Effendi had a special relationship with his grandfather. Zia Baghdadi, a contemporary Bahá'í, relates that when Shoghi Effendi was only five years of age, he pestered his grandfather to write a Tablet for him, which `Abdu'l-Bahá obliged.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá's family physician, a German doctor who later became a Bahá'í, would relate that in 1910, when Shoghi Effendi was thirteen years old, `Abdu'l-Bahá named him his successor, referring to him as his \"future Elisha.\" Shoghi Effendi remained close to his grandfather during his years as a student, first at the LaSallian Collège des Frères in Haifa and later as a boarder in Beirut, first at a Catholic school and later at the Syrian Protestant College. Shoghi Effendi was to accompany his grandfather on his journeys to the West but was unable to proceed after port authorities in Naples prevented Shoghi Effendi from continuing due to illness. At the end of World War I, after he had received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Beirut, Shoghi Effendi spent nearly two years of constant companionship with `Abdu'l-Bahá before proceeding to Oxford to further his studies and improve his English.\n\nAt the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in Acre on November 28, 1921, Shoghi Effendi was a twenty-four-year-old student enrolled at Balliol College, Oxford. Upon reading the telegram announcing `Abdu'l-Bahá's death, in the home of Wellesley Tudor Pole who was Secretary of the London Local Spiritual Assembly, Shoghi Effendi passed out. After spending a few days with John Esslemont, Shoghi Effendi left England on December 16, 1921, accompanied by Lady Blomfield and his sister Ruhangiz, and arrived in Haifa on December 29. `Abdu'l-Bahá's \"Will and Testament\", addressed to Shoghi Effendi, was read a few days after Shoghi Effendi's arrival in Haifa.\n\nThe \"Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá\" was written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on three different occasions, and the text remains in three parts. In his \"Will\" ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addresses the Bahá'í Covenant and the role of Mírzá Muhammad `Alí as a Covenant-breaker; outlines the obligation and responsibilities of the Hands of the Cause of God; explains the election of the Universal House of Justice; and defines the institution of the Guardianship as a hereditary office with its essential function as Interpreter of the Bahá'í writings. Shoghi Effendi describes the \"Will\", along with the \"Kitáb-i-Aqdas,\" the \"Tablets of the Divine Plan,\" and the \"Tablet of Carmel\", as one of the charters of the Bahá'í Administrative Order.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá's will provided a framework for the Guardian within the Bahá'í administration including:\n\n\nAlthough in the \"Kitáb-i-‘Ahd\" Bahá'u'lláh designates Mírzá Muhammad `Alí as `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, in his \"Will,\" `Abdu'l-Bahá reprimands his brother as \"The Center of Sedition, the Prime Mover of mischief\" and establishes the institution of the Guardianship, appointing Shoghi Effendi to this newly created office:\n\nAs Guardian, Shoghi Effendi held a new and distinct role. Building on the foundation that had been established in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's will, Shoghi Effendi elaborated on the role of the Guardian in the developing Bahá'í Administrative Order in several works, including \"Bahá'í Administration\" and the \"World Order of Bahá'u'lláh,\" in the chapter entitled \"The Administrative Order.\"\n\nIn those works, Shoghi Effendi goes to great lengths to emphasize that the Guardianship is a distinct station from that of Manifestation or Center of the Covenant: Shoghi Effendi also was critical of Bahá'ís referring to him as a holy personage, asking them not to celebrate his birthday or have his picture on display. Furthermore, he did not refer to his own personal role as an individual, but instead to the institution of the Guardianship. In his correspondences, Shoghi Effendi signed his letters to Bahá'ís as \"brother\" and \"co-worker,\" to the extent that even when addressing youth, he referred to himself as \"Your True Brother.\" Instead, Shoghi Effendi goes to great lengths to emphasize the significance of the \"Institution of Guardianship,\" which he calls the \"head cornerstone of the Administrative Order of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh,\"\n\nIn his writings, Shoghi Effendi delineates a distinct separation of powers between the \"twin pillars that support this mighty Administrative Structure—the institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice.\"\n\n\nAlthough the Kitáb-i-Aqdas requires every Bahá'í to have a will, Shoghi Effendi did not have one when he died unexpectedly of Asian Flu on November 4, 1957 in London, England. Shoghi Effendi did not have any children and had not designated a successor Guardian. With all living male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh having been declared Covenant-breakers by either `Abdu'l-Bahá or Shoghi Effendi, no suitable qualifying candidates remained for appointment to the office of Guardian.\n\nOn November 19, 1957, nine of the Hands of the Cause issued an \"Official Statement\" after searching through Shogi Effendi's personal affects in Haifa, Israel, affirming that \"the safe and desk have been opened and searched and the non existence of a Will and Testament executed by Shoghi Effendi was definitely established.\" A subsequent \"Unanimous Proclamation of the 27 Hands of the Cause of God\" on November 25 confirmed that Shoghi Effendi had died \"without having appointed his successor.\" The Hands of the Cause unanimously voted it was impossible to legitimately recognize and assent to a successor. The Bahá'í community was in a situation not dealt with explicitly in the provisions of the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá. Furthermore, the Universal House of Justice had not yet been elected, which represented the only Bahá'í institution authorized to adjudicate on matters not covered by the religion's three central figures.\n\nThe Hands of the Cause of God elected from among their own nine individuals who would serve as Custodians to help lead the transition of the International Bahá'í Council, whose members had previously been appointed by Shoghi Effendi, into the Universal House of Justice, whose members are elected by all the members of each Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in the world.\n\nOn April 8, 1960, Mason Remey one of the Hands of the Cause and president of the International Bahá'í Council, issued a written announcement claiming that he was the second Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith. He based his claim on the idea that by appointing him as President of the International Bahá'í Council, the embryonic form of the Universal House of Justice which would be led by the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi had in fact implicitly named him as the second Guardian. Mason Remey's claim was largely rejected with several notable exceptions, including five members of the National Spiritual Assembly of France led by Joel Marangella. The remaining 26 Hands of the Cause unanimously declared Remey and whoever followed him Covenant-breakers.\n\nThe Universal House of Justice later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor Guardian to Shoghi Effendi. The Universal House of Justice also determined that it could not appoint any further Hands of the Cause, whose work is now carried out by other appointed institutions such as the Continental Counsellors and the Auxiliary Boards.\n\n"}

The site is referred to by the site owners as an \"aspeklaria\" (), which means in Latin \"mirror\", as it is a re-edited edition of the Hebrew Wikipedia. \n\nThe site was launched on January 11, 2015. As of August 9, 2018 the site contained 111,466 articles for a total approximating half the number of articles found on the Hebrew Wikipedia.\n\nAs of August 9, 2018, the site's Alexa's ranking was 1,359 in Israel.\n\nIn 2014 the Israeli Hasidic rabbi Yosef Kaminer founded the Institute for Literacy and Proper Knowledge () through which the site would be produced. According to the site owners the site is intended to be used by the (ציבור שומר תורה ומצוות), and especially by the \"Haredi\" (Ultra-Orthodox Jewry) whom are very conservative and refrain from using Wikipedia's content according to their stringent interpretations of \"halakha\". Hamichlol aspires to be \"the largest Jewish encyclopedia in history, which includes articles on all issues pertaining to the Torah, Jewish values and the history of the Jewish people, but also knowledge pertaining to mankind and from all the secular\" ( [transliteration: \"hulin\"]) \"fields–written in clean language according to the Jewish worldview.\"\n\nIn order to create the site's foundation, the creators of the site chose, as part of the initial development of the site, to import the entire Hebrew Wikipedia and re-edit or delete the content which is not proper for the Torah-observant public, and specifically the ultra-Orthodox readers. The content is imported from the Hebrew Wikipedia in accordance with Wikipedia's free license, which enables editors to perform such a \"split\". Since much of the existing content is copied from Wikipedia and re-edited it is easy to find information which was omitted by comparing specific articles on the site with the parallel articles at the Hebrew Wikipedia. Examples of such differences include:\n\n\nAs of August 25, 2018, out of the 121,929 articles imported from Wikipedia, 22,791 of the imported articles currently are not accessible to the readers as long as the editorial team hasn't yet produced a censored and/or re-edited versions of these articles. The owners of the website explicitly state that in the instances in which imported articles from Wikipedia contain content deemed \"problematic\", the editorial team of the website will gradually review all of these articles and determine whether the content is appropriate - problematic articles with proper content will be rewritten while problematic articles with inappropriate content will eventually be permanently deleted. As of August 25, 2018 of all temporarily blocked imported articles awaiting to be reviewed, some of the articles that are most sought-after at the Hebrew Wikipedia include: YouTube, Gal Gadot, Ten Commandments, Eyal Golan, Harry Potter, Ofra Haza, Sigmund Freud, Christianity, Independence Day (Israel), Judaism, New Testament, Sports, Racism, Academy Awards, Human evolution, Woman, Status quo (Israel) Age of Enlightenment, Breast cancer, Tower of Babel, Muslims , The Simpsons, Apocalypse, Hell, Table tennis, Homo, Platonic love, Sport in Israel, Bourekas film, Handball, Race (human categorization), Jewish and democratic state, Maccabiah Games, Catholic Church, Satire, Paganism, Samaritanism.\n\nAll content on the site which was originally imported from Wikipedia is provided under the free license CC-BY-SA.

Letters have several different types: Formal letters and informal letters. Letters contribute to the protection and conservation of literacy. Letters have been sent since antiquity and are mentioned in the \"Iliad\". Both Herodotus and Thucydides mention letters in their histories.\n\nHistorically, letters have existed from the time of ancient India, ancient Egypt and Sumer, through Rome, Greece and China, up to the present day. During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, letters were used to self-educate. Letters were a way to practice critical reading, self-expressive writing, polemical writing and also exchange ideas with like-minded others. For some people, letters were seen as a written performance. For others, it was not only seen as a performance but also as a way of communication and a method of gaining feedback. Letters make up several of the books of the Bible. Archives of correspondence, whether for personal, diplomatic, or business reasons, serve as primary sources for historians. At certain times, the writing of letters was thought to be an art form and a genre of literature, for instance in Byzantine epistolography.\n\nIn the ancient world letters were written on a various different materials, including metal, lead, wax-coated wooden tablets, pottery fragments, animal skin, and papyrus. From Ovid, we learn that Acontius used an apple for his letter to Cydippe.\n\nAs communication technology has diversified, posted letters have become less important as a routine form of communication. For example, the development of the telegraph drastically shortened the time taken to send a communication, by sending it between distant points as an electrical signal. At the telegraph office closest to the destination, the signal was converted back into writing on paper and delivered to the recipient. The next step was the telex which avoided the need for local delivery. Then followed the fax (facsimile) machine: a letter could be transferred electrically from the sender to the receiver through the telephone network as an image. Today, the internet, by means of email, plays a large part in written communications; however, these email communications are not generally referred to as letters but rather as e-mail (or email) messages, messages or simply emails or e-mails, with only the term \"letter\" generally being reserved for communications on paper.\n\nDue to the timelessness and universality of letter writing, there is a wealth of letters and instructional materials (for example, manuals, as in the medieval ars dictaminis) on letter writing throughout history. The study of letter writing usually involves both the study of rhetoric and grammar.\n\nLetters are a way to connect with someone not through the internet. Despite email, letters are still popular, particularly in business and for official communications. Letters have the following advantages over email:\n\nHere is how a letter gets from the sender to the recipient:\n\nThis whole process, depending on how far the sender is from the recipient, can take anywhere from a day to 3–4 weeks. International mail is sent via trains and airplanes to other countries.\n\nHowever, in 2008, Janet Barrett from the UK, received a RSVP to a party invitation addressed to 'Percy Bateman', from 'Buffy', originally posted on 29 November 1919. It had taken 89 years to be delivered by the Royal Mail. However, Royal Mail denied this, saying that it would be impossible for a letter to have remained in their system for so long, as checks are carried out regularly. Instead, the letter dated 1919 may have \"been a collector's item which was being sent in another envelope and somehow came free of the outer packaging\".\n\nThere are a number of different types of letter:\n\n"}
{"id": "238216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238216", "title": "Letters patent", "text": "Letters patent\n\nLetters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \"practice\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.\n\nThe opposite of letters patent are \"letters close\" (), which are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents. Letters patent are thus comparable to other kinds of open letter in that their audience is wide. It is not clear how the contents of letters patent became widely published before collection by the addressee, for example whether they were left after sealing by the king for inspection during a certain period by courtiers in a royal palace, who would disseminate the contents back to the gentry in the shires through normal conversation and social intercourse. Today, for example, it is a convention for the British prime minister to announce that they have left a document they wish to enter the public domain \"in the library of the House of Commons\", where it may be freely perused by all Members of Parliament.\n\nLetters patent are so named from the Latin verb \"\", to lie open, exposed, accessible. The originator's seal was attached \"pendent\" from the document, so that it did not have to be broken in order for the document to be read.\n\n\"\" in Latin meant \"that which is written\" or \"writing\", in the sense of letters of the alphabet placed together in meaningful sequence on a writing surface, not a specific format of composition as the modern word \"letter\" suggests. Thus letters patent do not equate to an open letter but rather to any form of document, deed, contract, letter, despatch, edict, decree, epistle etc. made public.\n\nThey are called \"letters\" (plural) from their Latin name \"\", used by medieval and later scribes when the documents were written in Latin. This loanword preserves the collective plural \"letters\" (\"litterae\") Latin language uses to denote a message as opposed to a single alphabet letter.\n\nLetters patent are a form of open or public proclamation and a vestigial exercise of extra-parliamentary power by a monarch or president. Prior to the establishment of Parliament, the monarch ruled absolutely by the issuing of his personal written orders, open or closed.\n\nThey can thus be contrasted with the Act of Parliament, which is in effect a written order by Parliament, approved by the monarch whose signature gives it force. No explicit government approval is contained within letters patent, only the seal or signature of the monarch.\n\nParliament today tolerates only a very narrow exercise of the royal prerogative by issuance of letters patent, and such documents are issued with prior informal government approval, or indeed are now generated by government itself with the monarch's seal affixed as a mere formality. In their original form they were simply written instructions or orders from the sovereign, whose order was law, which were made public to reinforce their effect.\n\nFor the sake of good governance it is clearly of little use if the sovereign appoints a person to a position of authority if he does not at the same time inform those over whom such authority is to be exercised of the validity of the appointment.\n\nAccording to the United Kingdom Ministry of Justice, there are 92 different types of letters patent. The Patent Rolls are made up of office copies of English (and later United Kingdom) royal letters patent, which run in an almost unbroken series from 1201 to the present day, with most of those to 1625 having been published.\n\nThe form of letters patent for creating peerages has been fixed by the Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992 (SI 1992/1730). Part III of the schedule lays down nine \"pro forma\" texts for creating various ranks of the peerage, lords of appeal in ordinary, and baronets.\n\nThe following table organises the text from the letters patent by columns for each rank, with common text spanning multiple columns, depicting some of the similarities and differences among the proclamations. Gender-specific differences are highlighted in italics.\n\nThe words \"may have hold and possess\" to \"his heirs male aforesaid successively\" and \"have heretofore used and enjoyed or as they\" (shown in brackets above) were deleted for Dukes and Duchesses, Marquesses and Marchionesses, Earls and Countesses, Viscounts, and hereditary Barons by the Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) (Amendment) Order 2000.\n\nIn Commonwealth realms, letters patent are issued under the prerogative powers of the head of state, as an executive or royal prerogative. They are a rare, though significant, form of legislation which does not require the consent of parliament. Letters patent may also be used to grant royal assent to legislation.\n\nThe primary source of letters patent in the United States are intellectual property patents and land patents, though letters patent are issued for a variety of other purposes. They function dually as public records and personal certificates.\n\nIn the United States, the forgery of letters patent granted by the President is a crime subject to fine, imprisonment up to ten years or both (). Without letters patent, a person is unable to assume an appointed office. Such an issue prompted the \"Marbury v. Madison\" suit, where William Marbury and three others petitioned the United States Supreme Court to order James Madison to deliver their letters for appointments made under the previous administration.\n\nUnited States letters patent generally do not fit a specific form, except for the eschatocol, or formal ending:\n\n"}

{"id": "20202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20202", "title": "Meir Kahane", "text": "Meir Kahane\n\nMeir David HaKohen Kahane (; ; August 1, 1932 – November 5, 1990) was an American-Israeli ordained Orthodox rabbi, writer and ultra-nationalist politician who served one term in Israel's Knesset. His work influenced most modern Jewish militant and far-right political groups.\n\nKahane spent years reaching out to Jews through published works, weekly articles, speeches, debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows. He was an extreme advocate for Jewish causes, such as organizing defense squads and patrols in Jewish neighborhoods and demanding for the Soviet Union to \"release its oppressed Jews\". He supported violence against those he regarded as enemies of the Jewish people, called for immediate Jewish mass migration to Israel to avoid a potential \"Holocaust\" in the United States, supported the restriction of Israel's democracy to its Jewish citizens, hoped that Israel would eventually adopt Jewish religious law, and endorsed the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\n\nKahane proposed enforcing Jewish law, as codified by Maimonides. Non-Jews wishing to dwell in Israel would have three options: remain as \"resident strangers\" with limited rights, leave Israel and receive compensation for their property, or be forcibly removed without compensation. While he was serving in the Knesset in the mid-1980s Kahane proposed numerous laws, none of which passed, to emphasize Judaism in public schools, do away with Israel's bureaucracy, forbid sexual relations between non-Jews and Jews, and end cultural meetings between Jewish and Arab students.\n\nIn 1968, Kahane was one of the cofounders of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) in the United States. In 1971, he co-founded Kach (\"Thus\"), a new political party in Israel. The same year, he was convicted in New York for conspiracy to manufacture explosives and received a suspended sentence of five years. In 1984, he became a member of the Knesset, when Kach gained its only-ever seat in parliamentary elections. In 1988, after polls showed Kach gaining popularity, the Israeli government banned Kach for being \"racist\" and \"anti-democratic\" under the terms of a law that it had just passed.\n\nKahane was assassinated in a Manhattan hotel by an Arab gunman in November 1990.\n\nMartin David Kahane was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1932 to an Orthodox Jewish family. His father, Yechezkel (Charles) Kahane, the author of the \"Torah Yesharah\", studied at Polish and Czech yeshivas, was involved in the Revisionist Zionist movement, and was a close friend of Ze'ev Jabotinsky.\n\nAs a teenager, Kahane became an ardent admirer of Jabotinsky and Peter Bergson, who were frequent guests in his parents' home. He joined the Betar (Brit Trumpeldor) youth wing of Revisionist Zionism. He was active in protests against Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary who maintained restrictions on the immigration of Jews, even Nazi death camp survivors, to Palestine after the end of the Second World War. In 1947, Kahane was arrested for throwing eggs and tomatoes at Bevin, who was disembarking at Pier 84 on a visit to New York. A photo of the arrest appeared in the \"New York Daily News\". In 1954, he became the mazkir (director) of Greater New York City's 16 Bnei Akiva chapters.\n\nKahane's formal education included elementary school at the Yeshiva of Flatbush, and he attended high school at both Abraham Lincoln High School and the Brooklyn Talmudical Academy. Kahane received his rabbinical ordination from the Mir Yeshiva, in Brooklyn, where he was especially admired by the head Rabbi Abraham Kalmanowitz, and he began going by his Hebrew name, Meir. He was fully conversant in the Tanakh (Jewish Bible), the Talmud, the Midrash and Jewish law. Subsequently, Kahane earned a B.A. in Political Science from Brooklyn College, a Bachelor of Law - LL.B. from New York Law School, and an M.A. in International Relations from New York University.\n\nIn 1956 Kahane married Libby Blum, with whom he had four children: Tzipporah, Tova, Baruch, and Binyamin. In 1958, he became the rabbi of the Howard Beach Jewish Center in Queens, New York City. Although the synagogue was originally Conservative rather than strictly Orthodox, the board of directors agreed to Kahane's conditions, which included resigning from the Conservative movement's United Synagogue of America, installing a partition separating men and women during prayer, instituting traditional prayers, and maintaining a safe and kosher kitchen. At the Jewish Center, Kahane influenced many of the synagogue's youngsters to adopt a more observant lifestyle, which often troubled parents. He trained Arlo Guthrie for his bar mitzvah. When his contract was not renewed, he soon published an article entitled \"End of the Miracle of Howard Beach\". That was Kahane's first article in \"The Jewish Press\", an American Orthodox Jewish weekly for which he would continue to write for the rest of his life. Kahane also used the pen name David Sinai and the pseudonyms Michael King, David Borac and Martin Keene.\n\nIn the late 1950s and the early 1960s, Kahane's life of secrecy and his strong anticommunism landed him a position as a consultant with the FBI. According to his wife, Libby, his assignment was to infiltrate the anticommunist John Birch Society and report his findings to the FBI. Later, Michael T. Kaufman published an article claiming that Kahane then confided in him that he had been in a relationship with Gloria Jean D'Argenio. According to these allegations, Kahane allegedly sent a letter to D'Argenio in which he unilaterally ended their relationship. In response, D'Argenio jumped off the Queensboro Bridge and died of her injuries the next day.\n\nAt some time in the late 1950s, Kahane assumed the persona of a Gentile individual, along with the pseudonym Michael King. Kahane began openly expressing his anticommunism. He and Joseph Churba created the July Fourth Movement, which was formed to counteract widespread opposition towards U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Subsequently, they coauthored the book \"The Jewish Stake in Vietnam\", an attempt to convince American Jews of the \"evil of Communism\". The introduction states that, \"All Americans have a stake in this grim war against Communism... It is vital that Jews realize the threat to their very survival [should Communism succeed].\" Churba had a major falling out with Kahane over the use of paramilitary activities, and they parted ways permanently. Churba went on to pursue his own career, joining the U.S. Air Force, writing many books on the Middle East, and eventually becoming one of Ronald Reagan's consultants. Kahane chose to fight for Jewish rights, and was willing to use extreme measures. He even attempted to acquire and grow biological weapons to use on a Soviet military installation. He began using the phrase \"Never Again\" and conceived the Jewish Star and fist insignia, a symbol resembling that of the Black Panther Party. Howerver, Kahane himself opposed the Black Panthers because they had supported anti-Jewish riots in Massachusetts and had left-wing views.\n\nThe Jewish Defense League (JDL) was founded by Kahane in New York City in 1968. Its self-described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of anti-Semitism. The JDL said it was committed to five fundamental principles:\n\n\nThe JDL favored civil rights for blacks but opposed black anti-Semites and racism of any form. In 1971, the JDL formed an alliance with a black rights group in what Kahane termed \"a turning point in Black-Jewish relations\". Despite the JDL's anti-racist positions and its inclusion of individuals of all colors and faiths, the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Kahane \"preached a radical form of Jewish nationalism which reflected racism, violence and political extremism\" that was replicated by Irv Rubin, the JDL's successor to Kahane.\n\nA number of the JDL's members and leaders, including Kahane, were convicted of acts related to domestic terrorism. In 1971, Kahane was sentenced to a suspended five-year prison sentence for conspiring to manufacture explosives. In 1975, Kahane was arrested for leading the attack on the Soviet United Nations mission and injuring two officers, but he was released after being given summonses for disorderly conduct. Later the same year, Kahane was accused of conspiring to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the Iraqi embassy in Washington, and ship arms abroad from Israel. He was convicted of violating his probation for the 1971 bombing conviction and was sentenced to one year in prison. However, he served most of it in a hotel, with frequent unsupervised absences, because of a concession over the provision of kosher food.\n\nIn a 1984 interview with \"Washington Post\" correspondent Carla Hall, Kahane admitted that the JDL \"bombed the Russian [Soviet] mission in New York, the Russian cultural mission here [Washington] in 1971, the Soviet trade offices\".\n\nIn 1971, Kahane emigrated to Israel. At the time, he declared that he would focus on Jewish education. He later began gathering lists of Arab residents who were willing to emigrate for compensation, and eventually, he initiated protests that advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Occupied Territories. In 1972, Jewish Defense League leaflets were distributed in Hebron, calling for the mayor to stand trial for the 1929 Hebron massacre. Kahane was arrested dozens of times. In 1971, he founded Kach, a political party that ran for the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, during the 1973 general elections under the name \"The League List\". It won 12,811 votes (0.82%), just 2,857 (0.18%) short of the electoral threshold at the time (1%) for winning a Knesset seat. The party was even less successful in the 1977 elections, winning only 4,836 votes.\n\nIn 1980, Kahane was arrested for the 62nd time since his emigration, and he was jailed for six months after a detention order that was based on allegations of him planning armed attacks against Palestinians in response to the killings of Jewish settlers. Kahane was held in prison in Ramla, where he wrote the book \"They Must Go\". Kahane was banned from entering the United Kingdom in 1981.\n\nIn 1981, Kahane's party again ran for the Knesset during the 1981 elections, but it did not win a seat and received only 5,128 votes. In 1984, the Israeli Central Elections Committee banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the ban on the grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy. The Supreme Court suggested for the Knesset to pass a law that would authorize the exclusion of racist parties from future elections, and the Anti-Racist Law of 1988 was passed.\n\nIn the 1984 legislative elections, Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, enough to give the party one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard oath of office and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from Psalms to indicate that national laws were overruled by the Torah if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the Land of Israel, revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations. It was based on the Code of Jewish Law compiled by Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah.\n\nAs his political career progressed and his popularity in the streets began growing, Kahane became increasingly isolated in the Knesset. His speeches, boycotted by nearly all Knesset members, were often made to an assembly that was empty except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected by fellow Knesset members. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"Hellenists, a reference to Jews who assimilated into Greek culture after Judea's occupation by Alexander the Great. In 1987, Kahane opened a yeshiva (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class Sephardi Jews. Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.\n\nIn 1985, the Knesset passed an amendment to the Basic Law of Israel, barring \"racist\" candidates from election. The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the 1988 legislative elections. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by Alan M. Dershowitz.\n\nIn November 1990, Kahane gave a speech to an audience of mostly Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn, where he warned American Jews to immigrate to Israel before it was \"too late\". As a crowd gathered around Kahane in the second-floor lecture hall in Midtown Manhattan's New York Marriott East Side, Kahane was assassinated by El Sayyid Nosair, an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen who had trained in Pakistan. He was initially charged and acquitted of the murder. Nosair was later convicted of the murder in U.S. District Court for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Prosecutors were able to try Nosair again for the murder because the federal indictment included the killing as part of the alleged terrorist conspiracy. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and later made a confession to federal agents.\n\nSome researchers, such as Peter Lance, consider Kahane one of the first, if not the very first, American victims of the new group Al Qaeda, since his killer is believed to have links to Osama bin Laden's network. The cell that Kahane's assassin belonged to had been training in the New York Metro system since mid-1989.\n\nKahane was buried on Har HaMenuchot, in Jerusalem. His funeral was one of the largest in Israel's history, and approximately 150,000 participated. He was eulogized by a number of prominent supporters in both the U.S. and in Israel, including Rabbi Moshe Tendler and the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, Mordechai Eliyahu, who spoke of how little the people understood of Kahane's \"true value\".\n\nKahane argued that there was a glory in Jewish destiny, which came through the observance of the Torah. He also noted, \"Democracy and Judaism are not the same thing.\" Kahane also stressed the view that a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\" \"Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\n\nKahane proposed an \"exchange of populations\" that would continue the Jewish exodus from Arab lands: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\". He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"\n\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed. However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"the southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern Sinai, including Yamit. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the Jordan River, hence part of what is now Jordan. Eretz Yisrael also includes part of Lebanon and certain parts of Syria, and part of Iraq, all the way to the Euphrates River. When critics suggested that following Kahane's plans would mean a perpetual war between Jews and Arabs, Kahane responded, \"There will be a perpetual war. With or without Kahane.\"\n\n\nFollowing Kahane's death, no leader emerged to replace him in the movement although the idea of transferring populations, which was attributed mainly to Kahane, was subsequently incorporated into the political platform of various political parties in Israel, such as Moledet (applying to Arab non-citizen residents of the West Bank) and Yisrael Beiteinu (in the form of population exchange). Two small Kahanist factions later emerged; one under the name \"Kach\", and the other under the name \"Kahane chai\" (Hebrew: כהנא חי, literally \"Kahane lives [on]\"), the second one being led by his younger son, Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane. Neither one was permitted to participate in the Knesset elections by the Central Elections Committee.\n\nIn 1994, following the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre of Palestinian Muslim worshippers in Hebron by Kach supporter Baruch Goldstein, in which 29 Muslim worshipers were killed, the Israeli government declared both parties to be terrorist organizations. The US State Department also added Kach and Kahane Chai to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.\n\nIn the 2003 Knesset elections, Herut, which had split off from the National Union list, ran with Michael Kleiner and former Kach activist Baruch Marzel taking the top two spots on the list. The joint effort narrowly missed the 1.5% barrier. In the following 2006 elections, the Jewish National Front, led by Baruch Marzel, fared better, but it also failed to pass the minimum threshold. A follower of Kahane who was involved with Kach for many years, Michael Ben-Ari, was elected to the Knesset in the 2009 elections on renewed National Union list. He stood again in the 2013 elections as the second candidate on the list of Otzma LeYisrael, but the party failed to pass the minimum threshold.\n\nIn 2007, the FBI released over a thousand documents relating to its daily surveillance of Kahane since the early 1960s.\n\nIn 2015, Kahane's grandson, Meir Ettinger, was detained by Israeli law enforcement. He was the alleged leader of the radical Jewish group \"The Revolt\". In an online \"manifesto\" echoing some of his grandfather's teachings, Ettinger promotes the \"dispossession of gentiles\" who live in Israel and the establishment of a new \"kingdom of Israel\", a theocracy ruled by Halacha. Ettinger's writings condemned Israel's government, mainstream rabbis, and the IDF, and also have denounced Christian churches as \"idolatry\".\n\nIn 2016, Kahane's widow claimed that modern Jewish extremists in Israel are not following the ideology of her late husband, Rabbi Meir Kahane. She justified that claim by arguing that unlike modern Jewish extremists, Rabbi Kahane had a more mature approach that did not encourage illegal activities.\n\nIn 2017, \"The Forward\" reported that some of Kahane's followers were aligning themselves with white nationalists and the alt-right. Other Kahanists declared that such moves did not reflect Kahane's teachings, and they supported that declaration by arguing that Kahane worked together with African Americans.\n\n\n\n"}

Examples of these situations include:\nCentral to the charter of any metadata management programme is the process of creating trusting relationships with stakeholders and that definitions and structures have been reviewed and approved by appropriate parties.\n\nA metadata registry typically has the following characteristics:\n\nBecause metadata registries are used to store both semantics (the meaning of a data element) and systems-specific constraints (for example the maximum length of a string) it is important to identify what systems impose these constraints and to document them. For example the maximum length of a string should not change the meaning of a data element.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published standards for a metadata registry called ISO/IEC 11179 and also ISO15000-3 and ISO15000-4 ebXML registry and repository (regrep) EbXML RegRep\n\nThere are two ISO standards which are commonly referred to as metadata registry standards: ISO 11179 and ISO 15000-3. There are some who believe that ISO 11179 and ISO 15000-3 are interchangeable or at least in some way similar. e.g.\n\n\"Of interest is that the ISO 11179 model was one of the inputs to the ebXML RIM (registry information model) and so has much functional equivalence to the \"registry\" region of the ISO 11179 conceptual model.\" \n\nThis is however incorrect. Although the specification ebRIM v2.0 (5 december 2001) says at the beginning in its Design Objectives: \"Leverage as much as possible the work done in the OASIS [OAS] and the ISO 11179 [ISO] Registry models\" \nby the time of ebRIM v3.0 (2 May 2005) all reference to ISO/IOEC 11179 is reduced to a mention under informative references on page 76 of 78. \nIt was recognised by some team members that the ebXML RIM data model had no place to store \"fine grained artifacts\" ie. the data elements which are at the heart of ISO/IEC 11179, but not until 2009 can an explicit and definitive statement from the team be found. \n\nISO/IEC 11179 says that it is concerned with \"traditional\" metadata: \"We limit the scope of the term as it is used here in ISO/IEC 11179 to descriptions of data - the more traditional use of the term.\"\nOriginally the standard named itself a \"data element\" registry. It describes data elements: \"data elements are the fundamental units of data\" and \"data elements themselves contain various kinds of data that include characters, images, sound, etc.\"\nIt also describes a registry with an analogy: \"This is analogous to the registries maintained by governments to keep track of motor vehicles. A description of each motor vehicle is entered in the registry, but not the vehicle itself.\"\n\nThe ebXML RIM says about its Repository and Registry that it is\nIt also says that it is\nIt also describes itself with \"...this familiar metaphor.

The repository items in the repository are like book (sic) on the bookshelves.\" It goes on to say \"The registry is like the card catalog … A RegistryObject is like a card in the card catalog.\"\n\nWhat should be immediately apparent is that something which holds catalogue cards is not \"like\" a catalogue, it IS a catalogue.\n\nUnfortunately for a number of organisations that have implemented ebXML RIM to satisfy a requirement for an ISO/IEC 11179 registry, ebXML RIM\nIt is\n\nA metadata registry is frequently set up and administered by an organization's data architect or data modeling team.\n\nData elements are frequently assigned to data stewards or data stewardship teams that are responsible for the maintenance of individual data elements through a secure system.\n\nMetadata registries frequently have a formal data element submission, approval and publishing approval process. Each data element should be accepted by a data stewardship team and reviewed before data elements are published. After publication change control processes should be used.\n\nMetadata registries are frequently large and complex structures and require navigation, visualization and searching tools.

It is built in a niche at the eastern edge of the rock and most of it lies beneath the level of the hilltop, making it largely invisible. It was considered one of the major archaeological museums in Athens. Due to its limited size, the Greek government decided in the late 1980s to build a new museum. The New Acropolis Museum is now built at the foot of the Acropolis. In June 2007 the old museum closed its doors so that its antiquities could be moved to their new home, which opened on 20 June 2009.\n\nThe museum was home to many of the Greek world's ancient relics found in and around the Acropolis of Athens since excavations started.\nIt was designed by architect Panagis Kalkos and was constructed between 1865 and 1874. It was expanded in the 1950s to a modern design executed by Patroklos Karantinos, a Greek modernist architect.\n\nThe Acropolis Museum housed stone sculptures and bronze remains from the monuments of the Acropolis and some artifacts that are excavated on the site. The building is located in the south-east corner of the Acropolis. In 1974 prime minister Konstantinos Karamanlis proposed the construction of a new museum. Initial plans were made under Melina Mercouri and the ground of the Makrygianni former military hospital and Gendarmerie barracks was chosen. The first competition was criticized and a new competition proclaimed some years later. In 2007 the old building was closed to prepare the move to the new building.\n\nA new building was designed by Bernard Tschumi and Michali Fotiades, and constructed from 2002-2007 on Areopagitou Street.

Contemporary Turkish includes Ottoman Turkish loanwords—mostly of Persian and French, but also Arabic, Greek, and Italian origin—which were officially replaced with their Turkish counterparts suggested by the Turkish Language Association (, TDK) as a part of the cultural reforms—in the broader framework of Atatürk's Reforms—following the foundation of Republic of Turkey.\n\nThe TDK, established by Atatürk in 1932 in order to conduct research on the Turkish language, also undertook the initiative to replace only Arabic loanwords with their Turkish counterparts. The Association succeeded in removing several hundred Arabic words from the language. While most of the words introduced into the language in this process were newly derived from existing Turkish verbal roots, TDK also suggested using old Turkish words which had not been used in the language for centuries; like \"yanıt\", \"birey\", \"gözgü\". Some words were used before language reform too but they were used much less than the Persian ones. Some words were taken from rural areas but most of them had different meanings, like \"ürün\". Mongolian also played an important role too, because Mongolian preserved the old Turkic borrowings, such as \"ulus\" and \"çağ\". \n\nThere are generational differences in vocabulary preference. While those born before the 1940s tend to use the old Arabic-origin words (even the obsolete ones), younger generations commonly use the newer expressions. Some new words have not been widely adopted, in part because they failed to convey the intrinsic meanings of their old equivalents. Many new words have taken up somewhat different meanings, and cannot necessarily be used interchangeably with their old counterpart.\nMany of the loanwords (especially the Arabic, Persian and French ones) are still widely used today, though decreasing in tendency.\n\nHistorically, Arabic was the language of the mosque and Persian was the language of education. Its deliberate usage (eschewing the usage of a \"western\" word) often implies romanticism or a religious subtext, respectively. Similarly, the use of European words may be favored to impart a perceived \"modern\" character. The use of \"pure Turkic\" words may be employed as an expression of nationalism or as a linguistic \"simplification\".\n\nThe 2005 edition of \"\", the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by Turkish Language Association, contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin. Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are Persian, French,\nItalian, English, and Greek.\n\nMost of the new Turkish words are derived from other words with thematic suffixes. For example:\n\n' is the root of the verb ', which means \"to sink\" or \"to set\". The derived word ' means \"west\" or the cardinal direction in which the sun \"sinks\". Another example would be ', which means \"salary\" as well as '. This is derived from the word ', which means \"moon, month\".\n\nHere are some other examples of derivations:\n\n\nSome of the Turkish words are also compound words, such as:\n\n\nFor more information, see the \"related article: Turkish vocabulary\".\n\nThe list gives the Ottoman Turkish word, the modern spelling of the word in Turkish (as suggested by TDK), the modern Turkish equivalent, and its meaning in English.\nArabs also used the following words as loanwords for their language.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Old words that are still used in modern Turkish together with their new Turkish counterparts.\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> New words that are not as frequently used as the old words.\n\nThe French words started to infiltrate the Turkish language in the 1800s, when the administrative reforms (\"Tanzimat\") started taking place in the Ottoman Empire. The extent of French influence was so much that the number of French loanwords was close to 5,000.\n\nMost of the French loanwords are still widely used in today's Turkish.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Words that are still used in modern Turkish together with their new Turkish counterparts.\n\nThe list gives the Ottoman Turkish word, the modern spelling of the word in Turkish (as suggested by TDK), the modern Turkish equivalent, and its meaning in English.\n\nMost of the original Persian words are still widely used in modern Turkish. In fact, there are over 1,500 Persian words in Turkish. However, for many of the Persian words (unlike Arabic words), there is no TDK-prescribed equivalent. TDK did not put as much effort into replacing Persian words as it did for Arabic words, largely because the Persian words were better assimilated into the language. Arabic language and culture is general perceived by Turks to be more \"foreign\" than Persian language and culture, which had a native presence in Anatolia since the time of the Achaemenids, and was patronised for millennia afterwards by other dynasties with a presence in Anatolia such as the Sasanians, Seleucids, Seljuks, Sultanate of Rum, and lastly, the Ottomans, amongst others.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> New words that are not as frequently used as the old words.\n\n\"*\" Words that are still used in modern Turkish together with their new Turkish counterparts.\n\n\n"}

SWORD is a profile (specialism) of the Atom Publishing Protocol, but restricts itself solely to the scope of depositing resources into scholarly systems.\n\nThe first version of the SWORD protocol was created in 2007 by a consortium of UK institutional repository experts. The project to develop SWORD was funded by the JISC and managed by UKOLN. An overview of the initial development of SWORD is given in \"SWORD: Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit.\" The standard grew out of a need for an interoperable method by which resources could be deposited into repositories. Interoperable standards existed to allow the harvesting of content (e.g. Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) or for searching (e.g. OpenSearch) but not for deposit.\n\nBetween the original release in 2007, two subsequent projects were undertaken until 2009 to further refine the version 1.0 specification and perform advocacy work. The resulting release was numbered 1.3. Further descriptions of the work is available in Lewis et al., \"If SWORD is the answer, what is the question?

She is one of the seventy members of the patriarch's family who emigrated from Canaan to Egypt, and her name occurs in connection with the census taken by Moses in the wilderness. She is mentioned also among the descendants of Asher in I Chronicles vii. 30. The fact of her being the only one of her sex to be mentioned in the genealogical lists seemed to the Rabbis to indicate that there was something extraordinary in connection with her history; and she became the heroine of several legends.\n\nThere are two mentions of Serah in the Torah. The first is in Genesis, 46:17, in a passage that begins “These are the names of the Israelites, Jacob and his descendants, who came to Egypt,” and continues to mention all of Jacob’s sons, his daughter Dinah, his grandsons, and one granddaughter—Serach. The passage reads “The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beri’ah, with Serach their sister.” This sentence is repeated later in the Hebrew Bible in Chronicles, 1 Chronicles 7:30. One would suppose that, since the Torah mentions 53 grandsons and only one granddaughter, she was a person of significance.\n\nThe second time Serach is mentioned is in the Book of Numbers, 26:46, in the listing of Israelites who escaped from Egypt, where it simply says “And the name of the daughter of Asher was Serach.” Since Serach is mentioned both as Jacob’s granddaughter and also as one of the people who escaped from Egypt 210 years later, Serach is often referred to as the oldest woman in the Torah.\n\nAccording to The Book of Jasher, Asher married Adon bat Aflal ben Hadad ben Ishmael. She died before bearing children. \n\nAsher then married Hadurah bat Abimael ben Heber ben Shem, the widow of Malkiel ben Elam ben Shem. Hadurah bore one daughter to Malkiel, whom he named Serach. After Malkiel died, mother and daughter returned to the house of Abimael. Upon Asher's marriage to Hadurah, he adopted Serach and brought them to Canaan to live in the house of Jacob. This text praises Serach for her beauty and intellect, and notes she was raised as an Israelite.\n\nA number of midrashim have been written about Serach.\nAccording to one midrash, Serach was not Asher's daughter, but his stepdaughter. She was three years old when Asher married her mother, and she was brought up in the house of Jacob, whose affection she won by her remarkable piety and virtue. The best known of the midrashim about her tells of how she was the first to inform Jacob that his son Joseph was still alive. Fearing that the news would be too much of a shock for the old man, however, she informs Jacob while he is praying, and sings in rhyme that Joseph is “alive and living in Egypt, and has two sons, Menassah and Ephraim.” (Egypt in Hebrew is Mitzrayim, which rhymes with Ephraim.) In return, Jacob blesses her, saying “May you live forever and never die.” According to this midrash, Serach was eventually permitted to enter Heaven alive, something achieved only by Enoch and Elijah and a scant few others. When Moses appeared to the Elders of Israel, they went to Serach to confirm that he was truly the redeemer. She recognized him by the code phrase \"God has surely remembered\" (Exodus 3:16 and 4:31) that had been passed down, according to the Midrash, from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and to his sons. These are the same words that Joseph speaks on his deathbed (Genesis 50:24)\n\nJoseph makes his brothers swear that they will bring his bones from Egypt to be buried in the land of Canaan (Genesis 50:25). The Midrash relates that Moses addressed himself to Serach when he wished to learn where the remains of Joseph were to be buried. Without Joseph's bones, the Israelites could not leave Egypt, so the Pharaoh had Egyptians put him in a lead coffin and throw it into the Nile. Only Serach remembered where to find Joseph's bones. According to the Midrash, Serach was \"the wise woman\" who caused the death of Sheba ben Bichri.\n\nAnother story in the Talmud relates that Rabbi Yochanan was discussing the parting of the Red Sea and wondered what the walls of water looked like. At that moment, Serach bat Asher peered into the window of the study hall and attested, \"I was there. They were like lighted windows.\" According to another legend, Serah lived until the tribe of Asher was exiled by Shalmaneser V, went with them into exile, and died there, nearly 1,000 years old. According to the legend, her grave is located in Pir Bakran, a small town about 30 km southeast of Isfahan. The site consists of a small synagogue and a huge cemetery which is probably 2,000 years old.\n\nSome consider her the guardian of Israel’s communal memory.\n\n\n"}

It is located on the eastern side of the palace, and connected to The Hermitage by the smaller Apollo Room.\n\nThe colourful, neoclassical interior design of this great hall, executed by Giacomo Quarenghi between 1787 and 1795, was lost in the fire of 1837 which gutted much of the palace's interior. Following the fire, Russian architect Vasily Stasov was commissioned to oversee the restoration and rebuilding of the palace. While he retained the architectural features dictated by the exterior of the palace, he completely redesigned the interior in a more simple classical style. He replaced the columns of polychrome marble with those of white cararra marble. The original painted ceilings, depicting allegorical scenes, had been entirely lost in the fire, allowing Stasov to introduce a plain ceiling with gilded embellishments.\n\nSt George's Hall, which served as the palace's principal throne room, was the scene of many of the most formal ceremonies of the Imperial court. Most historically, it was the setting of the opening of the First State Duma by Nicholas II, in 1906. The Tsar was forced to agree to the establishment of a Duma as a concession to his people in an attempt to avert revolution. However, the Imperial family saw it as \"the end of Russian autocracy\".\n\nIt was the first time that ordinary Russians had been admitted to the palace in any number—a surreal experience for both the peasants and the Imperial family. The Tsar's sister, who stood with the Imperial family on the steps of the throne, recalled of the masses of ordinary Russians who packed the hall: \"I went with my mother to the first Duma. I remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people. The peasants looked sullen. But the workmen were worse: they looked as though they hated us. I remember the distress in Alicky's eyes.\" Minister of the Court Count Vladimir Frederiks commented, \"The Deputies, they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats. I will never again set foot among those people.\" The Dowager Empress noticed \"incomprehensible hatred.\"\n\nLocated behind the throne is the small Apollo Room. This anteroom is in fact the upper floor of a bridge linking the palace to the Hermitage. This room has a caisson ceiling adorned with stucco work.\n\nToday, as part of the State Hermitage Museum, this room retains the decorative scheme created by Stasov.\n\n"}
{"id": "901672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=901672", "title": "Starkad", "text": "Starkad\n\nStarkad (Old Norse: Starkaðr or Störkuðr; Latin: Starcaterus; in the Late Middle Ages also Starkodder; modern Danish: Stærkodder) was a legendary hero in Norse mythology.\n\nStarkad appears in numerous accounts, and the stories of his adventures relate to different Scandinavian traditions. He is most fully treated in \"Gesta Danorum\" but he also appears in Icelandic sources. He is portrayed as a great warrior who performed many heroic deeds but also many crimes.\n\nA cognate of the Starkad legends can be found in the Anglo-Saxon poem \"Beowulf\".\n\nIn \"Beowulf\", the feud between the Danes and the Heaðobards was to be ended with the marriage of Ingeld, the son of the fallen Heaðobard king Froda, and Freawaru, the daughter of the Danish king Hroðgar. During the wedding an unnamed old warrior reminded the Heaðobards of their defeat and encouraged them to revenge. That is the origin of Starkad's admonishing speech to the Danish king Ingellus, son of Frotho (see the account given in \"Gesta Danorum\" below). Sophus Bugge derived the name \"Starkaðr\" from originally meaning \"the strong Heaðobard\". Modern research is more reluctant, however, as the Gothic root \"stark-\" ('strong') might be connected with several possible suffixes.\n\nA version of the legend of Starkad can be found in the prologue of the U-version of \"Hervarar saga\", and in a shortened form in the H-version of the Hauksbók.\n\nIn this version a Starkad Ala-Warrior lived in northern Norway at the waterfalls of Alufoss. He descended from the giants known as the \"þursar\" (jotuns), and his father's name was Storkvid. Starkad was very much a jotun himself and had eight arms, but he was betrothed to a girl named Ogn Elf-burst. One day, when Starkad had gone north across the Élivágar, another giant named Hergrim kidnapped Ogn. Starkad challenged Hergrim to a holmgang, a duel. Starkad used four swords at the same time and slew Hergrim. Ogn did not wish to be Starkad's wife and committed suicide by stabbing herself with a sword. Starkad contented himself by taking everything Hergrim owned, including his son Grimr.\n\nÁlfhildr was the daughter of king Álfr of Álfheim (modern Bohuslän) and like the people of Álfheim, she was very beautiful. One autumn, king Álfr performed the Dísablót, a sacrifice to the goddesses, and Álfhildr took part in it. As she was reddening the horgr (altar) with blood, Starkad kidnapped her. King Álfr called on the god Thor to help him rescue his daughter. Thor granted his wish by killing Starkad and rescuing the girl.\n\n\"Gautreks saga\" continues the account found in \"Hervarar saga\". It is tells among other things the adventures of Starkad, the son of Stórvirkr who was the son of Starkad Ala-warrior, whom Thor had killed. \n\nIt tells that young Starkad was raised at the court of Harald, the king of Agder, together with Harald's son Vikar. One day, Herþjófr, the king of Hordaland, made a raid and killed king Harald. He also took Vikar hostage to ensure the loyalty of the people of Agder. When Vikar had grown up, he assembled a warband, including Starkad and avenged his father by killing Herþjófr with thirty of his warriors. Vikar was then king of Agder, Hordaland, and Hardanger.\n\nStarkad took part in Víkar's many battles for the hegemony of the petty kingdoms of southern Norway, one of the battles where Battle at Lake Vænir and he was Víkar's greatest warrior.\n\nAfter all these victories, when sailing north from Agdir to Hördaland with a large army, Víkar was becalmed. Divination showed Odin required a sacrifice of one person chosen by lot and Víkar's lot came up each time. The decision was put off till the next day. Then Grani Horsehair, Starkad's foster father, took Starkad to a secret council of the gods and revealed himself to be Odin. Odin bestowed on Starkad the blessings of living three lifetimes, of possessing the most excellent of weapons, an abundance of riches, victory in battle, the gift of poetry and always to be held in the highest esteem among the rich and powerful. Thor, however, who hated Starkad because of his jotun origin, denied Starkad the blessing of having children and cursed him to commit a crime every lifetime he lived and never to possess real estate. Thor further cursed Starkad never to feel that he had enough property, always to receive dangerous wounds in battle, never to remember his skaldic poems and ever to be hated by commoners. After blessings and curses laid on Starkad alternately by Odin and Thor, Odin asked Starkad to send him King Víkar in payment for Odin's blessings. Starkad agreed and Odin gave Starkad a spear which Odin promised would appear to be only a reed-stalk. So Vikar met his death.\n\nAfter Vikar's death, Starkad fled to Sweden and the kings Alrek and Eirík at Uppsala. Starkad served them first as a companion on their viking expeditions and then, after Alrek and Eirík had settled down, he went on further Viking expeditions alone.\n\nStarkad is said to have composed poems himself which appear in \"Gautrek's saga\". Thor's hate of Starkad because of his jotun origins is mentioned in \"Skáldskaparmál\", where there is a \"lausavísa\" by Vetrliði Sumarliðason praising Thor for having killed giants and giantesses, and for having defeated Starkad:\n\nHowever, it could also be a reference to Starkad's grandfather, Starkad Ala-Warrior, whom Thor killed for having kidnapped Álfhildr, the princess of Alfheim.\n\nIn the \"Ynglinga saga\", Snorri Sturluson tells what happened a few generations after the deaths of Alrek and Eirík.\n\nThe Swedish king Aun was not a warlike king and had been chased away from his kingdom by Halfdan. When Halfdan had died, Aun returned to Uppsala to rule his old kingdom. After having sacrificed one of his sons to Odin, the god let him live for another sixty years. However, when twenty-five years had passed, a Danish prince named Áli the Bold appeared and chased Aun to exile in Götaland. Áli ruled for twenty-five years until Starkad appeared and killed him. Then Aun could return to his kingdom and ruled it for another period of twenty-five years.\n\nThe \"Sögubrot\" deals with events taking place in the 8th century, a long time after Starkad killed Áli the Bold. \n\nWhen the Swedish king Sigurd Hring prepared for the Battle of the Brávellir against the Danish Harald Wartooth, a much later king Áli the Bold appeared with seven other kings to help him in the battle. These kings were accompanied by a great many champions, and among them Starkad the Old, the son of Stórverkr. Starkad would later compose a poem about this battle that would serve as a source for the sagas.\n\nWhen the battle had begun, a formidable champion named Ubbi of Friesland charged against Ragnvald the Good Councilor the foremost champion in the wedge formation of king Sigurd. After a fierce fight, Ragnvald died and Ubbi pushed on killing champion after champion.\n\nWhen king Sigurd Hring saw this he encouraged his warriors and said that it was not possible that no one could defeat Ubbi. He then asked \"where is Starkad?\". The old warrior answered \"it is difficult to win sire. However, I will do my best and do what I can, but Ubbi is a tough fighter\". Starkad engaged with Ubbi and a fight began that was long and the most fierce of the entire battle. Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that no one had been closer to kill him before. The two champions were separated by the pushing throng of warriors, and Ubbi finally fell riddled with arrows from the archers of Telemark.\n\nThe shieldmaiden Vebiorg took on the Swedish army. First she killed the champion Söti, but then Starkad attacked her. After giving Vebiorg a number of slashes, she cut his mouth so that his chin fell. Starkad had to bite his beard to keep his chin in place. She was killed by Thorkil the Bold.\n\nBiting his beard and ignoring his wounds, Starkad charged the Danish army, killing man after man, until he met the shieldmaiden Ursina who carried the banner of king Harald Wartooth. She told him that he had met his last opponent, but he cut off the hand that held the banner and killed her. Starkad continued killing warrior after warrior, until he finally was so severely wounded that he had a large gash on his neck and a large gash on his chest that made his two lungs hang out. On his right hand, he had lost a finger.\n\nThe battle ended with Swedish victory.\n\nIn \"Norna-Gests þáttr\", the account of Starkad takes place not long after the victory at the Battle of the Brávellir. The account deals with a meeting between Starkad and the hero Sigurd Dragonslayer. The old Norna-Gest told that during the time when he was with Sigurd Dragonslayer, the Swedish king Sigurd Hring demanded tribute from Sigurd and his people. When Sigurd refused, the king of Sweden sent an army to subdue him, led by the sons of Gandalf.\n\nIn the Swedish army, there was a man who was even bigger and stronger than the sons of Gandalf. The giant man killed both men and horses and nothing could defeat him. Sigurd and Gest approached the huge warrior and asked who he was. He answered that he was Starkad the son of Stórvirkr.\n\nWhen Starkad learnt that Sigurd was the same Sigurd who had killed the dragon Fafnir, he tried to escape. However, Sigurd went after him and dealt a blow with his sword Gramr that ripped two teeth off Starkad's mouth. Sigurd then asked Starkad to go home. When Starkad had left the battle, the sons of Gandalf retired as well, and so Sigurd had won the battle against the Swedes.\n\nIt is in \"Gesta Danorum\" that the most comprehensive treatment of Starkad is found. The Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus wrote that Starkad was the son of Stórvirkr (Storwerk/Storuerkus) and saved himself from a shipwreck. He entered the service of the Danish king Frotho and was given a ship so that he could patrol the shores. \n\nNo man was Starkad's equal as he was endowed with a superhuman size and a noble disposition. Saxo Grammaticus gives two accounts of Starkad's origin. According to one, he was born in the land of Estonians east of the Baltic sea. According to the second, which the chronicler considers fantastic and unlikely, Starkad was born of jotuns, and he had formerly many arms until Thor cut off all arms but two. Odin had bestowed on Starkad the curse and the blessing that he would live the lives of three men, and commit three evil deeds.\n\nHis first evil deed was the murder of the Norwegian petty king Vikar (Wicarus). Starkad had joined a Viking expedition with Vikar, but they found themselves stopped by a strong wind. They then had the idea that they could appease the gods by performing a blót with human blood, and decided to cast lots as to whom was to be sacrificed. Starkad made a noose of willow and put it around the king's neck in the pretense that it was only for show and not for killing. However, the knot was so strong that the king was dying, and Starkad gave him the coup de grace with his sword. Others say that the noose of willow suddenly became so strong that the king was strangled.\n\nStarkad joined the Danish Viking Bemon (Bemonus) and they had a tough discipline on their crew, forbidding them alcoholic beverages. During an attack in Russia, they discovered that the Russians had riddled the terrain with caltrops to stop the Vikings. However, Starkad and his men donned clogs and so won the battle. When Bemon was dead, Starkad entered the service of the Bjarmians and did many heroic deeds among them. \n\nLater, Starkad stayed for seven years in Sweden at Uppsala, with the sons of Frey. However the effeminate jingle of bells, the dancing and the mimes at the sacrifices (see the Temple at Uppsala) nauseated Starkad.\n\nHe then enlisted with the Danish king Haki (Haco), and fought for him during the attack on king Hugleik (Hugletus) of Ireland. Hugleik wasted his riches on actors and jugglers, but was defended by Svipdag (Suibdagus) and Geigad (Gegathus), who gave Starkad the most vicious wound he had ever received. After winning the battle, Starkad had all the mimes and jugglers flogged, and all the riches looted.\n\nStarkad was then sent with the Slavic prince Win (Winus) to quell a rebellion in the East. He fought against Curonians, Sambians, Semigallians, until all the Easterlings had been defeated. By covering his sword with a hide, he also defeated a warlord named Wisin (Wisinnus), who lived at Anafial in Russia, and who could make a weapon blunt only by looking at it. He continued his victories by killing the jotun Tanna in Byzantium and the Polish champion Wasce/Wilzce. \n\nWhen the Saxons rebelled against Frotho, and challenged him to a duel against Hama, Starkad unexpectedly returned and took Frotho's place in the duel. Hama contemptuously brought Starkad to his knees with a blow by his fist, but Starkad rose up and cut Hama to death.\n\nAfter a while Frotho was killed through treachery by a Saxon named Swerting (Swertingus). Frotho's son Ingild (Ingellus) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting's daughters. This angered Starkad so much that he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan's (Haldanus) court instead. However, when he learnt that Helga, Ingild's sister, was about to marry a lowly goldsmith, Starkad appeared in disguise and castrated the goldsmith. He gave Helga a slap on her face and lambasted her. Then he returned to Sweden and king Halfdan.\n\nIngild gave Helga to a Norwegian named Helgi (Helgo), on the condition that he fight nine brothers from Zealand who courted her, and among whom the eldest was named Angantyr (Angaterus). Helgi went to Sweden's most famous city Uppsala and asked Starkad to help him in the fight. Starkad agreed, but left Helgi with his bride in order to fight with the nine brothers himself at the moor of Roliung. \n\nStarkad killed the nine brothers but had received seventeen wounds himself, and was so seriously wounded that his guts hung out. He refused the care of three lowly passers-by, but accepted the treatment of a peasant's son, and could return to Sweden.\n\nAs Ingild continued his sinful life and did not do his duty to avenge his father, Starkad appeared during a banquet that Ingild had with the sons of Swerting, his father's slayer. Starkad strongly admonished Ingild and humiliated his queen who tried to calm Starkad with kindness and her costly ribbon. Starkad succeeded in exciting Ingild to kill Swerting's sons and to divorce his Saxon bride. \n\nDuring the Battle of the Brávellir between the Swedish king Sigurd Hring and Harald Wartooth (Haraldus Hyldetan), Starkad fought on the Swedish side. He received such a severe wound that his lung hung out, his skull was cleft and a finger was cut off. He had to leave the battle to tend to his wounds.\n\nStarkad was accepted with honour in the warband of the Norwegian hero Olo. However, when Olo had succeeded in conquering Zealand, Starkad was convinced to join Lennius/Lenus/Lennus scheme to attack and kill Olo. However, Olo was hard to kill as his gaze scared everyone. It was not until Starkad managed to cover Olo's face that he could kill him. Starkad was rewarded with 120 pounds in gold, but regretted his crime, and avenged Olo's death by killing Lennius.\n\nWhen Starkad was so old that he wished to die and his eyesight was bad, he hung his gold around his neck and went out to wander. He killed a man who wanted one of his swords and some riders who were contracted to kill Starkad by Hather (Hatherus), Lennius' son.\n\nIn front of Hather, Starkad sung about his accomplishments, and as Hather's response showed Starkad that Hather was of noble birth, Starkad asked him to be his slayer. Starkad promised Hather all his gold and imperviousness, should Hather cut off his head and run between the head and the body as he fell. Hather cut off Starkad's head but avoided running, as he feared being crushed by Starkad's huge body. When the head had hit the ground, it bit a tussock of grass which showed how ferocious Starkad was.\n\nHather did not want the old warrior to lie unburied, but showed him respect by making a barrow for him on the heath of Roljung, at the same spot where Starkad's heavy body long ago had made an imprint on a stone.\n\nOlaus Magnus' cites the story of Starkad from Gesta Danorum. He disputes Saxo about origin of the hero and informs that Starkad was from the nation of Tavastians, 'Starchaterum Thauestum'.\n\nLater medieval traditions locate Starkad's death and the heath of Roljung to Skåne. According to the \"Annales Ryenses\" (late 13th century), it was still possible to see Starkad's sword in the water beneath the bridge of \"Boilyngh\" when the water was low. It is likely that \"Boilyngh\" is a misspelling of \"Roljung\". Later this spot was located to Rönne river, and in the 16th century, people talked of the \"Stones of Starkkarl\" at Vegeholm. The Danish folklorist Axel Olrik and Arthur Stille recorded many recent traditions about Starkad in north-western Skåne.\n\nThe plot of the Science Fiction novel \"Ensign Flandry\" by the Danish American writer Poul Anderson takes place on a planet named \"Starkad\".\n\nThe modern Danish name, \"Stærkodder\" has been used for a war ship in the Royal Danish Navy.\n\nStarkad (or \"Starkadder\") is the central figure in a trilogy of fantasy novels by the author Bernard King, which draw heavily from traditional Starkad stories and from other aspects of Norse myth and legend. The trilogy comprises the novels \"Starkadder\" (1985), \"Vargr-Moon\" (1986), and \"Death-Blinder\" (1988).\n\nStarkad, as Starkaðr the Mighty, is mentioned in the 2018 videogame \"God of War\", as a late Jotunn enshrined by the Jotnar people, killed by Thor.\n"}
{"id": "792934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=792934", "title": "Textiles in mythology and folklore", "text": "Textiles in mythology and folklore\n\nThe theme of textiles in mythology and folklore is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art. In traditional societies today, westward of Central Asia and the Iranian plateau, weaving is a mystery within woman's sphere. Where men have become the primary weavers in this part of the world, it is possible that they have usurped the archaic role: among the gods, only goddesses are weavers. Herodotus noted, however, the cultural difference between gender identities and weaving among Hellenes and Egyptians: among Egyptians it was the men who wove.\n\nWeaving begins with spinning. Until the spinning wheel was invented in the 14th century, all spinning was done with distaff and spindle. In English the \"distaff side\" indicates relatives through one's mother, and thereby denotes a woman's role in the household economy. In Scandinavia, the stars of Orion's belt are known as \"Friggjar rockr\", \"Frigg’s distaff\".\n\nTextiles have also been associated in several cultures with spiders in mythology.\n\nThe spindle, essential to the weaving art, is recognizable as an emblem of security and settled times in a ruler's eighth-century BCE inscription at Karatepe:\n\"In those places which were formerly feared, where a man fears... to go on the road, in my days even women walked with spindles\"\n\nIn the adjacent region of North Syria, historian Robin Lane Fox remarks funerary stelae showing men holding cups as if feasting and women seated facing them and holding spindles.\n\nIn pre-Dynastic Egypt, \"nt\" (Neith) was already the goddess of weaving (and a mighty aid in war as well). She protected the Red Crown of Lower Egypt before the two kingdoms were merged, and in Dynastic times she was known as the most ancient one, to whom the other gods went for wisdom. Nit is identifiable by her emblems: most often it is the loom's shuttle, with its two recognizable hooks at each end, upon her head. According to E. A. Wallis Budge (\"The Gods of the Egyptians\") the root of the word for \"weaving\" and also for \"being\" are the same: \"nnt\".\n\nIn Greece the Moirai (the \"Fates\") are the three crones who control destiny, and the matter of it is the art of spinning the thread of life on the distaff. Ariadne, the wife of the god Dionysus in Minoan Crete, possessed the spun thread that led Theseus to the center of the labyrinth and safely out again.\n\nAmong the Olympians, the weaver goddess is Athena, who, despite her role, was bested by her acolyte Arachne, who was turned later into a weaving spider. The daughters of Minyas, Alcithoe, Leuconoe and their sister, defied Dionysus and honored Athena in their weaving instead of joining his festival. A woven peplum, laid upon the knees of the goddess's iconic image, was central to festivals honoring both Athena at Athens, and Hera.\n\nIn Homer's legend of the Odyssey, Penelope the faithful wife of Odysseus was a weaver, weaving her design for a shroud by day, but unravelling it again at night, to keep her suitors from claiming her during the long years while Odysseus was away; Penelope's weaving is sometimes compared to that of the two weaving enchantresses in the \"Odyssey\", Circe and Calypso. Helen is at her loom in the \"Iliad\" to illustrate her discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail.\n\nHomer dwells upon the supernatural quality of the weaving in the robes of goddesses.\n\nIn Roman literature, Ovid in his \"Metamorphoses\" (VI, 575–587) recounts the terrible tale of Philomela, who was raped and her tongue cut out so that she could not tell about her violation, her loom becomes her voice, and the story is told in the design, so that her sister Procne may understand and the women may take their revenge. The understanding in the Philomela myth that pattern and design convey myth and ritual has been of great use to modern mythographers: Jane Ellen Harrison led the way, interpreting the more permanent patterns of vase-painting, since the patterned textiles had not survived.\n\nFor the Norse peoples, Frigg is a goddess associated with weaving. The Scandinavian \"Song of the Spear\", quoted in \"Njals Saga\", gives a detailed description of Valkyries as women weaving on a loom, with severed heads for weights, arrows for shuttles, and human gut for the warp, singing an exultant song of carnage. Ritually deposited spindles and loom parts were deposited with the Pre-Roman Iron Age ritual wagon at Dejbjerg, Jutland, and are to be associated with the wagon-goddess.\n\nIn Germanic mythology, Holda (Frau Holle) and Perchta (Frau Perchta, Berchta, Bertha) were both known as goddesses who oversaw spinning and weaving. They had many names.\n\nHolda, whose patronage extends outward to control of the weather, and source of women's fertility, and the protector of unborn children, is the patron of spinners, rewarding the industrious and punishing the idle. Holda taught the secret of making linen from flax. An account of Holda was collected by the Brothers Grimm, as the fairy tale \"Frau Holda\". Another of the Grimm tales, \"Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle\", which embeds social conditioning in fairy tale with mythic resonances, rewards the industrious spinner with the fulfillment of her mantra:\n\nThis tale recounts how the magic spindle, flying out of the girl's hand, flew away, unravelling behind it a thread, which the prince followed, as Theseus followed the thread of Ariadne, to find what he was seeking: a bride \"who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest\". He arrives to find her simple village cottage magnificently caparisoned by the magically-aided products of spindle, shuttle and needle.\n\nJacob Grimm reported the superstition \"if, while riding a horse overland, a man should come upon a woman spinning, then that is a very bad sign; he should turn around and take another way.\" (\"Deutsche Mythologie\" 1835, v3.135)\n\nAlso the Norns, female giantesses, weavers of fate, belong in this folklore of weaving.\n\nThe goddess Brigantia, due to her identification with the Roman Minerva, may have also been considered, along with her other traits, to be a weaving deity.\n\nWeavers had a repertory of tales: in the 15th century Jean d'Arras, a Northern French storyteller (\"trouvere\"), assembled a collection of stories entitled \"Les Évangiles des Quenouilles\" (\"Spinners' Tales\"). Its frame story is that these are narrated among a group of ladies at their spinning.\n\nIn Baltic myth, Saule is the life-affirming sun goddess, whose numinous presence is signed by a wheel or a rosette. She spins the sunbeams. The Baltic connection between the sun and spinning is as old as spindles of the sun-stone, amber, that have been uncovered in burial mounds. Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that are not easy to disentangle.\n\nThe Finnish epic, the \"Kalevala\", has many references to spinning and weaving goddesses.\n\n\"When Adam delved and Eve span...\" runs the rhyme; though the tradition that Eve span is unattested in Genesis, it was deeply engrained in the medieval Christian vision of Eve. In an illumination from the 13th-century Hunterian Psalter (\"illustration. left\") Eve is shown with distaff and spindle.\n\nIn later European folklore, weaving retained its connection with magic. Mother Goose, traditional teller of fairy tales, is often associated with spinning. She was known as \"Goose-Footed Bertha\" or \"Reine Pédauque\" (\"Goose-footed Queen\") in French legends as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children.\n\nThe daughter who, her father claimed, could spin straw into gold and was forced to demonstrate her talent, aided by the dangerous earth-daemon Rumpelstiltskin was an old tale when the Brothers Grimm collected it. Similarly, the unwilling spinner of the tale \"The Three Spinners\" is aided by three mysterious old women. In \"The Six Swans\", the heroine spins and weaves starwort in order to free her brothers from a shapeshifting curse. \"Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle\" are enchanted and bring the prince to marry the poor heroine. Sleeping Beauty, in all her forms, pricks her finger on a spindle, and the curse falls on her.\n\nIn Alfred Tennyson's poem \"The Lady of Shalott\", her woven representations of the world have protected and entrapped Elaine of Astolat, whose first encounter with reality outside proves mortal. William Holman Hunt's painting from the poem (\"illustration, right\") contrasts the completely pattern-woven interior with the sunlit world reflected in the roundel mirror. On the wall, woven representations of Myth (\"Hesperides\") and Religion (\"Prayer\") echo the mirror's open roundel; the tense and conflicted Lady of Shalott stands imprisoned within the brass roundel of her loom, while outside the passing knight sings \"'Tirra lirra' by the river\" as in Tennyson's poem.\n\nA high-born woman sent as a hostage-wife to a foreign king was repeatedly given the epithet \"weaver of peace\", linking the woman's art and the familiar role of a woman as a dynastic pawn. A familiar occurrence of the phrase is in the early English poem \"Widsith\", who \"had in the first instance gone with Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Anglen to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker...\"\n\nIn Inca mythology, Mama Ocllo first taught women the art of spinning thread.\n\n\nMultiple saints are designated as patron saints of various aspects of textile work. The mythology and folklore surrounding their patronage can be found in their respective hagiographies.\nAnthony Mary Claret is a Roman Catholic patron saint of textile merchants. Saint Homobonus is a Roman Catholic patron saint of tailors and clothworkers. Saint Maurice is considered a patron saint of weavers, dyers, and clothmaking in general in Coptic Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Parascheva of the Balkans is a patron of embroiderers, needle workers, spinners, and weavers among the Eastern Orthodox.\nSt. Blaise is the patron saint of drapers.\n\nLydia of Thyatira, a New Testament figure, is a patron saint of dyers in the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. Saint Maurice (see section on patron saints of textiles in general) is also associated with dyers.\nAnastasius the Fuller is the patron saint of fulling in the Roman Catholic Church.\nMary Magdalene is a patron saint of glove-making in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church. Gummarus is a patron saint of glove-making in the Roman Catholic church. \nSaints Crispin and Crispinian are Eastern Orthodox patron saints of glove-making. Although their feast day was removed from the Roman Catholic Church's universal liturgical calendar following the Second Vatican Council, the two saints are still commemorated on that day in the most recent edition of the Roman Catholic Church martyrology. \nSaint Fiacre is the patron saint of hosiers. \nSaints Crispin and Crispinian (see above) are considered the patron saints of lacework.\nClare of Assisi and Saint Veronica are the patron saints of laundry and laundry workers.\nSeverus of Avranches is the Roman Catholic patron saint of millinery. \nIn the Roman Catholic Church, Clare of Assisi is the patron saint of needlework, and Rose of Lima is the patron saint of embroidery, a specific type of needlework. Parascheva of the Balkans is the patron saint of needlework and other aspects of textiles (see section on patron saints of textiles in general) among the Eastern Orthodox.\nSaint Brioc is the patron saint of pursemakers. \nSaint Anne is regarded as the patron saint of seamstresses in both Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions.\nSeverus of Avranches is the Roman Catholic patron saint of silk workers.\nSaint Catherine is the patron saint of spinners.\n\nFrancis of Assisi is the patron saint of tapestry workers. \nOnuphrius is considered a patron saint of weaving in Coptic Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church.

{"id": "303261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303261", "title": "Top 40", "text": "Top 40\n\nIn the music industry, the top 40 is the current, 40 most-popular songs in a particular genre. It is the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. Record charts have traditionally consisted of a total of 40 songs. \"Top 40\" or \"contemporary hit radio\" is also a radio format. Frequent variants of the Top 40 are the Top 10, Top 20, Top 30, Top 50, Top 75, Top 100 and Top 200.\n\nAccording to producer Richard Fatherley, Todd Storz was the inventor of the format, at his radio station KOWH in Omaha, Nebraska. Storz invented the format in the early 1950s. Storz used what he saw from the repetition of plays on the jukebox to develop his platform. The format was commercially successful, and Storz and his father Robert, under the name of the Storz Broadcasting Company, subsequently acquired other stations to use the new Top 40 format. In 1989 Todd Storz was inducted into the Nebraska Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame.\n\nThe term \"Top 40\" for a radio format appeared in 1960. The Top 40, whether surveyed by a radio station or a publication, was a list of songs that shared only the common characteristic of being newly released. Its introduction coincided with a transition from the old ten-inch 78 rpm record format for single \"pop\" recordings to the seven-inch vinyl 45 rpm format, introduced in 1949, which was outselling it by 1954 and soon replaced it completely in 1958. The Top 40 thereafter became a survey of the popularity of 45 rpm singles and their airplay on the radio. Some nationally syndicated radio shows, such as \"American Top 40\", featured a countdown of the 40 highest ranked songs on a particular music or entertainment publication. Although such publications often listed more than 40 charted hits, such as the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, time constraints allowed for the airing of only 40 songs; hence, the term \"top 40\" gradually became part of the vernacular associated with popular music.\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, different recording formats have competed with the 45 rpm vinyl record such as cassette singles, CD singles, digital downloads and streaming. Many music charts changed their eligibility rules to incorporate some or all of these.\n\nSome disc jockeys of Top 40 and similar format programs have been implicated in various payola scandals.\n\nMusic charts and various radio programs adopt different chart formats including Top 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 200 although radio formats usually restrict to the Top 40 wherever the chart contains more than 40 songs.\n\nTop 40 is also adopted to a radio format called Top 40 format, spinning mainly hits appearing in the official Top 40 charts of the country in addition to some upcoming hits that are greatly expected to get into the Top 40 very imminently. The format is variously known also as CHR (contemporary hit radio), contemporary hits, hit list, current hits, hit music, top 40, or pop radio.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "849533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=849533", "title": "Yellowfin tuna", "text": "Yellowfin tuna\n\nThe yellowfin tuna (\"Thunnus albacares\") is a species of tuna found in pelagic waters of tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide.\n\nYellowfin is often marketed as ahi, from the Hawaiian \"ahi\", a name also used there for the closely related bigeye tuna. The species name, \"albacares\" (\"white meat\") can also lead to confusion: in English, the albacore tuna (\"Thunnus alalunga\") is a different species, while yellowfin is officially designated \"albacore\" in French and referred to as \"albacora\" by Portuguese fishermen.\n\nThe yellowfin tuna is among the larger tuna species, reaching weights over , but is significantly smaller than the Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas, which can reach over , and slightly smaller than the bigeye tuna and the southern bluefin tuna.\n\nThe second dorsal fin and the anal fin, as well as the finlets between those fins and the tail, are bright yellow, giving this fish its common name. The second dorsal and anal fins can be very long in mature specimens, reaching almost as far back as the tail and giving the appearance of sickles or scimitars. The pectoral fins are also longer than the related bluefin tuna, but not as long as those of the albacore. The main body is a very dark metallic blue, changing to silver on the belly, which has about 20 vertical lines.\n\nReported sizes in the literature have ranged as high as in length and in weight. The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) record for this species stands at for a fish caught in 1977 near San Benedicto Island in the Pacific waters of Mexico. In 2010, a 184-kg yellowfin was caught off the tip of Mexico's Baja Peninsula, long with a girth of . The catch is still pending verification by the IGFA. In 2012, a fisherman in Baja California caught a 193-kg yellowfin. If the catch is confirmed by the IGFA, the fisherman will receive a prize of $1 million.\n\nYellowfin tuna are epipelagic fish that inhabit the mixed surface layer of the ocean above the thermocline. Sonic tracking has found that although yellowfin tuna, unlike the related bigeye tuna, mostly range in the top of the water column and penetrate the thermocline relatively infrequently, they are capable of diving to considerable depths. An individual tagged in the Indian Ocean with an archival tag spent 85% of its time in depths shallower than , but was recorded as having made three dives to 578, 982, and .\nAlthough mainly found in deep offshore waters, yellowfin tuna may approach shore when suitable conditions exist. Mid-ocean islands such as the Hawaiian archipelago, other island groups in the Western Pacific, Caribbean, and Maldives islands Indian Ocean, as well as the volcanic islands of the Atlantic such as Ascension Island and Saint Helena, often harbor yellowfin feeding on the baitfish these spots concentrate close to the shoreline. Yellowfin may venture well inshore of the continental shelf when water temperature and clarity are suitable and food is abundant.\n\nYellowfin tuna often travel in schools with similarly sized companions. They sometimes school with other tuna species and mixed schools of small yellowfin, and skipjack tuna, in particular, are commonplace. They are often associated with various species of dolphins or porpoises, as well as with larger marine creatures such as whales and whale sharks. They also associate with drifting flotsam such as logs and pallets, and sonic tagging indicates some follow moving vessels. Hawaiian yellowfins associate with anchored fish aggregation devices and with certain sections of the 50-fathom curve.\n\nYellowfin tuna prey include other fish, pelagic crustaceans, and squid. Like all tunas, their body shape is particularly adapted for speed, enabling them to pursue and capture fast-moving baitfish such as flying fish, sauries, and mackerel. Schooling species such as myctophids or lanternfish and similar pelagic driftfish, anchovies, and sardines are frequently taken. Large yellowfins prey on smaller members of the tuna family such as frigate mackerel and skipjack tuna.\n\nIn turn, yellowfin are preyed upon when young by other pelagic hunters, including larger tuna, seabirds, and predatory fishes such as wahoo, shark, and billfish. Adults are threatened only by the largest and fastest hunters, such as toothed whales, particularly the false killer whale, pelagic sharks such as the mako and great white, large Atlantic blue marlin and Pacific blue marlin, and black marlin. The main source of mortality, however, is industrial tuna fisheries.\n\nYellowfins are able to escape most predators, because unlike most fish, tuna are warm-blooded, and their warm muscles make them extremely strong swimmers, with yellowfin tuna reaching \"speeds of up to 50 miles per hour\". (They can navigate enormous distances, sometimes crossing entire oceans.)\n\nModern commercial fisheries catch yellowfin tuna with encircling nets (purse seines), and by industrial longlines. In 2010, 558,761 metric tons of yellowfin tuna were caught in the western and central Pacific Ocean.\n\nFormerly, much of the commercial catch was made by pole-and-line fishing, using live bait such as anchovy to attract schools of tuna close to the fishing vessel that were then taken with baited jigs on sturdy bamboo or fiberglass poles or on handlines. This fishery, which targeted skipjack and occasionally albacore, as well as yellowfin, for canning, reached its heyday between World War I and the 1950s before declining. The most well-known fleet of pole-and-line boats sailed from San Diego in California and exploited abundant stocks in Mexican waters, as well as further south to Panama, Costa Rica, and the Galapagos Islands.\n\nPole-and-line fishing is still carried out today in the Maldives, Ghana, the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores. Few pole-and-line boats now specifically target yellowfin, an incidental take compared to the total commercial catch. In the Maldives, the catch is a mix of skipjack tuna and small yellowfins that often associate with them.\n\nPurse seining largely took over commercial tuna fisheries in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, purse seines account for more of the commercial catch than any other method. The purse-seine fishery primarily operates in the Pacific Ocean, in the historic tuna grounds of the San Diego tuna fleet in the eastern Pacific, and in the islands of the western Pacific, where many U.S. tuna canneries relocated in the 1980s, but significant purse-seine catches are also made in the Indian Ocean and in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, especially in the Gulf of Guinea by French and Spanish vessels.\n\nPurse-seine vessels locate tuna using onboard lookouts, as was done in the pole-and-line fishery, but they also employ sophisticated onboard electronics, sea-surface temperature and other satellite data, and helicopters overhead. Once a school is located, the net is set around it. A single set may yield . Modern tuna seiners have a capacity up to , reach speeds of over , and carry multiple spotting helicopters.\n\nPurse seining for yellowfin tuna became highly controversial in the late 1970s when it became apparent that the eastern Pacific fishery was killing many spinner dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, and other cetaceans (often called \"porpoises\" by the tuna fleet) that accompany the fish. This association has been long-recognized by commercial tuna fishermen.\n\nSince the introduction of \"dolphin-friendly\" labeling, an increasing number of purse seine sets are now made on \"free schools\" unassociated with dolphins, as well as schools that associate with floating objects—another long-understood association that has grown in importance in tuna fisheries. The latter practice in particular has a major ecological impact because of the high proportion of bycatch, including manta rays, sea turtles, pelagic sharks, billfish, and other threatened marine species taken by setting nets around logs and other floating objects. Such tuna are often significantly smaller than the larger adult tuna associated with dolphins. The removal of huge numbers of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna that have yet to reach breeding age has major potential consequences for tuna stocks worldwide.\n\nMost of the commercial catch is canned, but the \"sashimi\" marketplace adds significant demand for high-quality fish. This market is primarily supplied by industrial tuna longline vessels.\n\nIndustrial longlining was primarily perfected by Japanese fishermen who expanded into new grounds in the Western Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Longlining has since been adopted by other fishermen, most notably South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States.\n\nTuna longlining targets larger \"sashimi\"-grade fish around and up that swim deeper in the water column. In tropical and warm temperate areas, the more valuable bigeyes are often the main target, but significant effort is also directed towards larger yellowfins. Longlining seeks areas of higher ocean productivity indicated by temperature and chlorophyll fronts formed by upwellings, ocean current eddies, and major bathymetric features. Satellite imaging technology is the primary tool for locating these dynamic and constantly changing ocean areas.\n\nBycatch is a major environmental issue in the longline fishery, especially impacting billfish, sea turtles, pelagic sharks, and seabirds.\n\nBesides the large-scale industrial purse seine and longline fisheries, yellowfin tuna also support smaller-scale artisanal fisheries that have often supplied local domestic markets for generations. Artisanal fisheries now also often fish for the lucrative \"sashimi\" market in many locations where international air shipment is possible.\n\nArtisanal fishermen tend to employ assorted hook-and-line gear such as trolling lines, surface and deep handlines, and longlines.\n\nBy far, the largest fishery using artisanal methods exists in Philippine and Indonesian waters where thousands of fishermen target yellowfin tuna around fish aggregation devices or \"payaos\", although this fishery far exceeds the artisanal scale in terms of tonnage caught and the numbers of participants involved, and should more properly be considered a commercial handline fishery. General Santos City is the most important Philippine port for the landing and transhipment of catches. Catches that qualify as \"sashimi\"-grade are mostly shipped to the Japanese market; those that do not meet the grade are sold locally or canned. Elsewhere in the Pacific, small-boat fishers in Hawaii, Tahiti, and other Pacific islands supply local and in some cases foreign markets with fresh yellowfins.\n\nHandline-caught yellowfin tuna is one of the few exports of the economy of St. Helena.\n\nYellowfin tuna probably first came to the attention of sports fishermen when they appeared on the tuna grounds of Catalina Island, California, only a few years after pioneering fishermen invented the sport, targeting the Pacific bluefin tuna. These tuna were of the same species caught by commercial fishermen in Japan and the western Pacific, but the reason for their appearance was not known at the time. Later, warmer water species such as yellowfin tuna, dorado and striped marlin were found to enter southern California waters in seasons having favorable ocean conditions, particularly during the El Niño phenomenon, which brings warmer water up North America's western coast.\n\nYellowfin tuna were subsequently discovered by sport fishermen in Bermuda, the Bahamas, Hawaii, and many other parts of their range. Larger adult fish which had developed distinctively long sickle fins were initially thought to be a different species and were known as Allison tuna (a name first given by the then curator of the Bermuda Aquarium, Louis Mowbray, in 1920). Such destinations as Hawaii and Bermuda became famed for their catches of these beautiful fish. In Hawaii, various styles of feather lures served as bait, but in Bermuda, chumming techniques from boats anchored on productive banks were evolved to target not only Allison tuna, but also wahoo and the smaller blackfin tuna. Bermudian experts developed techniques to take all these fish on light tackle, and for many years the International Game Fish Association records for yellowfin tuna were dominated by entries from Bermuda in the lighter line classes, with fish in the and larger class from Hawaii taking most of the heavier line-class records.\n\nToday, yellowfin tuna are a major sport fish pursued by sport fishermen in many parts of the world. Thousands of anglers fish for yellowfin tuna along the eastern seaboard of the United States, particularly in North Carolina and New England. Yellowfin are also a popular gamefish among anglers fishing from US Gulf Coast ports, San Diego, and other ports of southern California. Larger \"long-range\" boats in the San Diego fleet also fish in Mexican waters, searching for yellowfin tuna in many of the grounds that the San Diego pole-and-line tuna clippers used to fish. The yellowfin tuna is also a highly prized catch in the offshore sport fisheries of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Sport fishing for yellowfin tuna exists on a smaller scale in many other parts of the world.\n\nAccording to the Hawaii Seafood Buyers Guide, yellowfin tuna is widely used in raw fish dishes, especially \"sashimi\". This fish is also excellent for grilling. Yellowfin is often served seared rare.\n\nYellowfin buyers recognize two grades, \"\"sashimi\" grade\" and \"other\", although variation in the quality of \"other\" grades occurs.\n\nDifferent seafood sustainability guides come to different conclusions about whether yellowfin fishing is sustainable. The Audubon's \"Seafood Guide\" (a guide for what types of marine food products are not ecofriendly) lists troll-caught tuna as \"OK\", but labels long-line caught as \"Be Careful\".\n\nYellowfin is becoming a popular replacement for the severely depleted supplies of southern bluefin tuna.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list. The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a \"list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries\".\n\n"}
