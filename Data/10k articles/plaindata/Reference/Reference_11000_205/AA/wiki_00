The Badalisc is represented today as a creature with a big head covered with a goat skin, two small horns, a huge mouth and glowing eyes.\n\nAccording to legend the Badalisc lives in the woods around the village of Andrista (commune of Cevo) and is supposed to annoy the community: each year it is captured during the period of Epiphany (5 & 6 January) and led on a rope into the village by musicians and masked characters, including \"il giovane\" (the young man), \"il vecchio\" (the old man), \"la vecchia\" (the old woman) and the young \"signorina\", who is \"bait\" for the animal's lust. There are also some old witches, who beat drums, and bearded shepherds, and a hunchback (\"un torvo gobetto\") who has a \"rustic duel\" with the animal. Traditionally only men take part, although some are dressed as women. In ancient times women were prohibited from participating in the exhibition, or even to see or hear the Badalisc's Speech; if they did so they would be denied Holy Communion the following day.\n\nIn the village square (formerly in a stable) the \"Badalisc's speech\" (\"la 'ntifunada\") is read, in which the mythological animal gossips about the community. The Badalisc itself is a dumb creature, so the speech, nowadays written in rhyme, is read by an \"interpreter\". Once improvised, now written in advance, the speech reveals all the supposed sins and scheming of the community. During the speech the hunchback bangs his stick rhythmically at intervals.\n\nThe speech is followed by singing, dancing and feasting. In the evening the community eats the \"Badalisc polenta\" (a commercial version of this traditional food was launched in 2010). Until recently, village children would beg from house to house during the Badalisc celebrations for cornmeal to make the polenta; a Badalisc salami was also specially made for them. The badalisc has a place of honour at the feasts.\n\nOn the second day, at the end of the exhibition, the Badalisc is set free and allowed to return to the woods.\n\nThe ritual has strong similarities with the \"Bosinada\", \"Bosinade\" or \"Businade\", satirical performances of prose, poetry or song, in which a storyteller (the \"Bosin\") denounced the misdeeds of the community. Known from the 16th century, these were once widespread throughout northern Italy and derived from the purification rituals of New Year's Eve.\n\nAny link between the Badalisk of Andrista and the mythical Basilisk (half lizard, half serpent, with a head like a cat, but squarer, like a toad) that incinerates everything on which it rests its gaze (well known in Cevo and elsewhere in northern Italy) is unclear.\n\n\n"}

Today the company is represented in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Uppsala, Borlänge, Malmö and Umeå.\n\nWikiLeaks used to be hosted in a Bahnhof data center inside the ultra-secure bunker Pionen, which is buried inside the White Mountains in Stockholm.\n\nBahnhof was founded in 1994 by Oscar Swartz. It was one of Sweden's first ISPs. The company is publicly traded since December 2007 under the name BAHN-B (Aktietorget). On 11 September 2008, Bahnhof opened a new computer center inside the former civil defence center Pionen in the White Mountains in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nOn 10 March 2005, the Swedish police confiscated four servers placed in the Bahnhof premises, hoping to find copyrighted material. Although these servers were located near Bahnhof's server park (in a network lab area) the company claimed they were not their property since they had been privately purchased by staff. They further presented evidence showing the material on these servers had been planted there by someone hired by Svenska Antipiratbyrån, a Swedish organisation fighting against copyright infringement.\n\nIn 2009, Bahnhof generated controversy by failing to store the IP addresses of customers, in order to defeat the Swedish government's new laws on illegal file-sharing, transposing the EU IPRED regulations, which enabled ISPs to retain data longer than the data protection regulations would allow, in order for them to be available on police request.\n\nAfter the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks was kicked off of Amazon Web Services in December 2010, it bought server space from Bahnhof, as its chairman Jon Karlung revealed in press interviews after in the light of the new controversy created by the leaks about the War in Afghanistan (2001–14), even showing journalists the two servers on which the data was held. The chairman said that WikiLeaks is treated like any other of Bahnhof's clients.\n\nIn April 2014, however, the CJEU struck down the Data Retention Directive. PTS, Sweden's telecommunications regulator, told Swedish ISPs and telcos that they would no longer have to retain call records and internet metadata. But after two government investigations found that Sweden's data retention law did not break its obligations to the European Convention on Human Rights, the PTS reversed course. Most of Sweden's major telecommunications companies complied immediately, though Tele2 lodged an unsuccessful appeal. Bahnhof was the one holdout and it was given an order to comply by November 24 deadline or face a five million kronor ($680,000) fine. In response Bahnhof offered all their customers a free VPN-service.\n\n"}

{"id": "21514416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21514416", "title": "COLA (software architecture)", "text": "COLA (software architecture)\n\nCOLA stands for Combined Object Lambda Architecture, and is a system for experimenting with software design currently being investigated by the Viewpoints Research Institute. A COLA is a self-describing language in two parts, an object system which is implemented in terms of objects, and a functional language to describe the computation to perform.\n\nSince a COLA is written in itself, the whole environment (when bootstrapped) can be rewritten and extended by programming with the COLA; in other words, it does not require more knowledge to rewrite a COLA than it does to write a program to run in it (as opposed to running Python code in CPython for example, which requires knowledge of C in order to reprogram the language).\n\nThis flexibility has led to the work-in-progress COLA called 'idst' becoming the implementation vehicle of choice for the Viewpoints Research Institute's research into 'reinventing programming', since it allows rapid creation and modification of new programming languages for study.\n\nA COLA is designed to be the simplest possible language which can be described in itself, so that the implementation exactly describes itself. In order to do this the structure of the environment is separated from the semantics of the computation performed.\n\nThe object system describes the structure of a prototype-based Object Oriented environment. This is implemented in terms of objects and message passing, which is in fact the same system it is describing. This allows modification of the system by using the same object oriented knowledge used to write any other application.\n\nThis object system is turned into a useful programming language by complementing it with a functional language describing what each object's methods do. The methods called from the object language are closures running a functional programming language.\n\nCombined together, these two parts form a complete prototype-based Object Oriented programming language which is entirely self-hosting.\n\nIn order to illustrate the concept, we can consider an analogy in natural language, say English. To define the whole of English for someone who speaks a foreign language would be a monumental task, especially since it would have to be done over and over again for each foreign language we're coming from. However, we could instead define a simpler subset of English as a base which is just expressive enough to understand definitions given in English. For example, such a subset would not need a word for \"giraffe\", since it could be added later with a statement like \"A giraffe is a herbivore with a long neck.\" Similarly the definitions of herbivore, neck and long can be added later with other statements, and so on. This way we can remove every part of English which we do not need in our subset.\n\nThe bits we keep are those which are needed to understand definitions and statements (so that we can expand the language later), along with everything needed to define those, and so on. What we end up with is a self-contained language, written in itself (a subset of English) and capable of being expanded with statements like the giraffe one above.\n\nAny English speaker is thus capable of changing the language itself as easily as they speak (since it is defined in English) by rewriting, overriding or bypassing the statements given in the base, turning the language into anything (including existing ones).\n\nAlso, anyone can become an English speaker simply by having this base translated into their native tongue (a more tractable problem than translating the whole of English). Once they know this subset then they know enough English to understand other statements like the giraffe one, and thus grow their knowledge to the whole language through English sentences (which can be reused by everyone, regardless of their first language). This is analogous to the bootstrapping and compatibility of a COLA.\n\nThe way a COLA such as idst implements this can be thought of as defining words using other words (the object system) separately to defining the grammar (the functional language).\n\nA COLA can be used in two ways:\n\nDue to their flexible and extensibility it is possible to make COLAs compatible with many ABIs, which allows integration into existing libraries (for example, those written in C) whilst maintaining the ability to mutate the COLA into another (perhaps custom) language.\n\nA completely COLA-based computer system, whilst capable of implementing the operating system, libraries, applications and other levels of a traditional computer system, allows these distinctions to blur or disappear if the end-user wishes. Every aspect of the computer system, since it is written in a COLA (including the COLA itself), can be overridden, mutated, bypassed, etc. just as the local datastructures and functions in a traditional program can. There is also flexibility in how code is run, since there is a choice of interpreting, static compilation, dynamic compilation, in fact if the COLA is given a suitable backend object then it can even reprogram FPGA's to run arbitrary sections of the system.\n\nIan Piumarta's 'idst' system (the name is currently in flux) is a work-in-progress implementation of a COLA. It consists of several components, such as the Id object model, the Jolt function language and the Pepsi object oriented language. Pepsi was bootstrapped by writing two Pepsi compilers, one in C++ and one in Pepsi, then compiling the latter with the former, then in with itself. This made Pepsi self-hosting, and the C++ version was discarded.\n\nThe idst COLA has already been used in the following projects:\n\nOMeta - An object oriented pattern matching language based on Parsing Expression Grammars\n\nJOHN - A goal-oriented programming language\n\nJITBLT - An image compositing engine\n"}

Although demand letters are not legally required they are frequently used, especially in contract law, tort law, and commercial law cases. For example, if one anticipates a breach, it is advantageous to send a demand letter asserting that the other side appears to be in breach and requesting assurances of performances. Demand letters that are not responded to may constitute admissions by silence. Also, a demand letter will often generate a denial letter stating the basis for rejecting your side's claim (such as when the incorrect entity is sued), and is sometimes a good indication of what defenses will be raised if suit is brought later.\n\nDemand letters are sometimes used as a form of harassment and/or intimidation.\n\nIn personal injury claims, the settlement negotiation process begins by the victim submitting a demand letter to the insurance companies. The purpose of the demand letter is to present facts about the accident in order to persuade the insurance companies to provide adequate compensation. A typical demand letter is structured in the following manner:\n\n\nThe personal injury demand letter is then sent to the insurance companies with supplemental documents that are referenced in the letter.

The documents can then be used to \"prove\" that the fictional events happened. A common propaganda tool, false documentation is often used by management groups and totalitarian governments for four basic reasons:\n\nPerhaps the best illustration of false documentation is Nazi Germany, where the authorities falsified documents for all four reasons.\n\nThere are three basic methods for falsifying documentation. One way, of course, is to create an entirely fictional event and write it down. The other is to misrepresent an actual incident by embellishment or exaggeration so that the blame for the incident is misplaced. The third is to refuse to document an actual event, thereby exonerating the instigators for lack of proof.\n\nThe practice of false documentation rests on the fallacy, promoted by management organizations and governments, that whatever has been written down is unquestionably true. In business, it rests on a further bias: the tendency of management to believe managers rather than to collect and objectively judge evidence. As folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand points out, when a story or a claim appears in print, it gains an air of authority. Many people are skeptical of spoken rumors, but few doubt the veracity of stories appearing in the news media.\n\nA related fallacy is, of course, that whatever has \"not\" been documented must not have happened. Although absence of evidence is evidence of absence, whether any given event happened is entirely independent of whether it was documented.\n\nIn George Orwell's novel \"1984\", the Ministry of Truth has an entire department devoted to altering past editions of newspapers in the belief that changing documentation will change the public's perception of history. One of the novel's greatest ironies is that the Ministry of Truth deals exclusively in lies.\n\n"}

Rural Telephone Service Co.\n\nFeist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States establishing that information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright. In the case appealed, Feist had copied information from Rural's telephone listings to include in its own, after Rural had refused to license the information. Rural sued for copyright infringement. The Court ruled that information contained in Rural's phone directory was not copyrightable and that therefore no infringement existed.\n\nRural Telephone Service Company, Inc. is a telephone cooperative providing services for areas in northwest Kansas, with headquarters in the small town of Lenora, in Norton County. The company was under a statutory obligation to compile a phone directory of all their customers free of charge as a condition of their monopoly franchise.\n\nFeist Publications, Inc. specialized in compiling telephone directories from larger geographic areas than Rural from other areas of Kansas. They had licensed the directory of 11 other local directories, with Rural being the only hold-out in the region. Despite Rural's denial of a license to Feist, Feist copied some 4000 entries from Rural's directory. Because Rural had placed a small number of phony entries to detect copying, Feist was caught.\n\nPrior to this case, the substance of copyright in United States law followed the sweat of the brow doctrine, which gave copyright to anyone who invested significant amount of time and energy into their work. At trial and appeal level the courts followed this doctrine, siding with Rural.\n\nThe ruling of the court was written by Justice O'Connor. It examined the purpose of copyright and explained the standard of copyrightability as based on originality.\n\nThe case centered on two well-established principles in United States copyright law: That facts are not copyrightable, but that compilations of facts can be.\n\n\"There is an undeniable tension between these two propositions,\" Justice O'Connor wrote in her decision. \"Many compilations consist of nothing but raw data -- i.e. wholly factual information not accompanied by any original expression. On what basis may one claim a copyright upon such work? Common sense tells us that 100 uncopyrightable facts do not magically change their status when gathered together in one place. … The key to resolving the tension lies in understanding why facts are not copyrightable: The \"sine qua non\" of copyright is originality.\"\n\nRural claimed a collection copyright in its directory. The court clarified that the intent of copyright law was not, as claimed by Rural and some lower courts, to reward the efforts of persons collecting information — the so-called \"sweat of the brow\" or \"industrious collection\" doctrine — but rather \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts\" (U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 8). That is, to encourage creative expression.\n\nThe standard for creativity is extremely low. It need not be novel, rather it only needs to possess a \"spark\" or \"minimal degree\" of creativity to be protected by copyright.\n\nIn regard to collections of facts, Justice O'Connor stated that copyright can only apply to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not on the information itself. If Feist were to take the directory and rearrange it, it would destroy the copyright owned in the data. \"Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another's publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement,\" Justice O'Connor wrote.\n\nThe court ruled that Rural's directory was nothing more than an alphabetic list of all subscribers to its service, which it was required to compile under law, and that no creative expression was involved. The fact that Rural spent considerable time and money collecting the data was irrelevant to copyright law, and Rural's copyright claim was dismissed.\n\nWhile the other justices joined Justice O'Connor's majority opinion, Justice Blackmun only concurred in judgement, but never filed a concurring opinion to explain his reasons.\n\nThe ruling has major implications for any project that serves as a collection of knowledge. Information (that is, facts, discoveries, etc.), from any source, is fair game, but cannot contain any of the \"expressive\" content added by the source author. That includes not only the author's own comments, but also his choice of which facts to cover, his choice of which links to make among the bits of information, his order of presentation (unless it is something obvious like an alphabetical list), any evaluations he may have made about the quality of various pieces of information, or anything else that might be considered \"original creative work\" of the author rather than mere facts.\n\nFor example, a recipe is a process, and not copyrightable, but the words used to describe it are; see idea-expression divide and \"Publications International v Meredith Corp.\" (1996). Therefore, you can rewrite a recipe in your own words and publish it without infringing copyrights. But, if you rewrote every recipe from a particular cookbook, you might still be found to have infringed the author's copyright in the choice of recipes and their \"coordination\" and \"presentation\", even if you used different words; however, the West decisions below suggest that this is unlikely unless there is some significant creativity carried over from the original presentation. It should be noted that a sufficiently novel, useful, and unique (i.e. non-obvious) recipe can be granted protection under patent law.\n\n\"Feist\" proved most important in the area of copyright of legal case law publications. Although one might assume that the text of U.S. case law is in public domain, Thomson West had claimed a copyright as to the first page citations and internal pin-point page citations of its versions of court opinions (case law) found in its printed versions of the case law (\"West's citation claims.\") West also had claimed a copyright in the text of its versions of the case law, which included parallel citations and typographical corrections (\"West's text claims.\") The text claim would have barred anyone from copying the text of a case from a West case law reporter, since the copied text would include West enhancements to which West claimed copyright.\n\nIn a pre-\"Feist\" case, West's citation copyright claim had been affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in a preliminary injunction case in 1986 brought by West against Mead Data, owner of Lexis. \"West v. Mead\" (1986); however, in a case commenced in 1994 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found \"Feist\" to have undermined the reasoning in \"West v. Mead\". West's citation claims were challenged in 1994 by legal publisher, Matthew Bender & Company and by a small CD-Rom publisher HyperLaw, Inc. HyperLaw intervened, joining Matthew Bender in the citation challenge and separately challenging West's text copyright claims. West was found by the Second Circuit in 1998 not to have a protectable copyright interest in its citations; neither to the first page citations nor to its internal pagination citations. See \"Matthew Bender v. West\", Citation Appeal. The Second Circuit thereby rejected the 1996 determination of a Minnesota district court in \"Oasis Publishing Co. v. West Publishing Co.\", 924 F.Supp. 918 (D. Minn. 1996), that the outcome of \"West\" is not changed by \"Feist\".\n\nIn the same case, but in separate decisions in which Matthew Bender was not involved, HyperLaw successfully challenged West's text claims. Judge John S. Martin ruled in favor of HyperLaw against West in a U.S. District Court decision in May, 1996.\n\"Matthew Bender v. West\", No. 94 Civ. 0589, 1997 WL 266972 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 1997), \"aff'd\", 158 F. 3d 674 (2nd Cir. 1998), \"cert. denied sub. nom.\" \"West v. Hyperlaw\", 526 U.S. 1154 (1999). West lost to HyperLaw in its appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and certiorari was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAfter the 1986 \"West v. Mead\" decision, Mead Data and Lexis were acquired by Reed Elsevier, a large English-Dutch based publisher. During the \"Matthew Bender v. West\" case, Reed Elsevier and Matthew Bender entered into a strategic relationship, culminating in Reed Elsevier's acquisition of Matthew Bender in 1998, just after the Second Circuit appeals were argued. Reed Elsevier now was on the side of West and filed an amicus brief opposing HyperLaw and supporting West. Thus, although the name of the case might suggest that Matthew Bender challenged West on the text claim, by the middle of the case Matthew Bender was on the side of West on the text issue. Reed Elsevier's support of West's claims to a copyright in text was consistent with the initiatives, discussed below, to sidestep \"Feist\" by implementing database protection, through legislation and treaties discussed below. Similarly, during the case, West was acquired by the Canadian-based international publisher, the Thomson Corporation.\n\nAnother case covering this area is \"Assessment Technologies v. Wiredata\" (2003), in which the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a copyright holder in a compilation of public domain data cannot use that copyright to prevent others from using the underlying public domain data, but may only restrict the specific format of the compilation, if that format is itself sufficiently creative. \"Assessment Technologies\" also held that it is a fair use of a copyrighted work to reverse engineer that work in order to gain access to uncopyrightable facts. \"Assessment Technologies\" also created new law, stating that it is a copyright misuse and an abuse of process if one attempts to use a contract or license agreement based on one's copyright to protect uncopyrightable facts.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Congress attempted to pass laws which would protect collections of data, but these measures failed. By contrast, the European Union has a \"sui generis\" (specific to that type of work) intellectual property protection for collections of data.\n\nThe applicability of copyright to phone directories has come up in several other countries.\n\nIn Canada, the appeal-level case of \"Tele-Direct (Publications) Inc. v. American Business Information Inc.\" (1997) 76 C.P.R. (3d) 296 (F.C.A.) reached a similar result to that of \"Feist\". However, the Supreme Court partially backed away from the originality doctrine in \"CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada\". Under the CCH ruling, someone may assert protection in a database where the facts are themselves not copied from another source. For example, a person may assert protection in a collection of her own recipes, but she may not assert protection in a database of facts about persons and their ancestry compiled from census records.\n\nIn Australia, the Federal Court decision of \"Desktop Marketing Systems v Telstra \", followed the UK approach in \"Walter v Lane\" and ruled that copyright law did, in fact, follow the \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine. However, \"Desktop v Telstra\" held, as did \"CCH Canadian\", that collections of facts must not be copied from other sources to be eligible for protection. In 2010, the Telstra decision was overturned in a ruling by Justice Gordon in \"Telstra v Phone Directories\", following the decision of the High Court in IceTV v Nine Network.\n\nCongress has been considering whether to implement a treaty negotiated at the World Trade Organization.

He is a literary critic and philosopher, best known as an expert on deconstruction and the works of Jacques Derrida and Jean-François Lyotard. Bennington has translated many of Derrida's works into English.\n\nBennington received his B.A., M.A., and D.Phil. from Oxford University.\n\nHe took up a teaching appointment at the University of Sussex at Brighton, where he created an M.A. program in Modern French Thought and twice served as chair of the French department. Since arriving at Emory in 2001, he has chaired both the French and the Comparative Literature Departments.\n\nHe co-wrote the book \"Jacques Derrida\" with Derrida. Bennington's contribution, \"Derridabase\", is an attempt to provide a comprehensive explication of Derrida's work. \"Derridabase\" appears on the upper two-thirds of the book's pages, while Derrida's contribution, \"Circumfession\", is written on the lower third of each page. Derrida's \"Circumfession\" is, among other things, intended to show how Derrida's work exceeds Bennington's explication: by introducing details about his own circumcision and its possible meanings Derrida shows the impossibility of such a regulated database of his writings. Many of Bennington's essays on Derrida collected in \"Legislations, Interrupting Derrida\", and \"Not Half No End\", have criticized explanations of Derrida's work attempted by other scholars. Bennington has also written two monographs on Lyotard, \"Writing the Event\" and \"Late Lyotard\", and has also written extensively on Rousseau and Kant, developing original accounts of the \"paradox of the legislator\" in the former and \"interrupted teleology\" in the latter. He is currently writing a deconstructive account of political philosophy.\n\nHe has translated a number of works by Derrida and others, and is General Editor (with Peggy Kamuf) of the English translations of Derrida's posthumously published seminars.\n\nHe has at times tried to engage members of the British press hostile to Derrida's work and has also attempted to explicate the relationship between deconstruction and analytic philosophy, which has generally had difficulties receiving work by Derrida and others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Abdel-Samad came to Germany in 1995 at the age of 23. He soon married an 18 years older, \"rebellious, left-wing teacher with a penchant for mysticism.\" Abdel-Samad studied Japanese, English and French in Cairo as well as political science in Augsburg. He worked as a scholar in Erfurt and Braunschweig. In Japan, where he was involved with eastern spirituality, he met his second wife. He taught and conducted research until the end of 2009 at the Institute for Jewish History and Culture at the University of Munich; his dissertation topic was: \"Bild der Juden in ägyptischen Schulbüchern\" (\"Image of the Jews in Egyptian textbooks”). Subsequently he decided to become a full-time professional writer.\n\nA member of the Muslim Brotherhood in his university days, a stay in a summer camp run by them triggered doubts, causing him to become skeptical, and finally become an atheist.\nOn Sunday 24 November 2013, Egyptian news websites (citing his brother Mahmoud) reported that Hamed Abdel-Samad had been kidnapped. It was then reported that he resurfaced on Wednesday 27 November 2013. His mother denied that he had been kidnapped.\n\nAbdel-Samad became known to the German public through his book \"Mein Abschied vom Himmel\" (\"My Farewell from Heaven\") (2009). Abdel-Samad said that the book was neither an attack on his culture, nor a call to abandon the Muslim faith. Rather, he just wanted to understand the contradictions of his own life. Following the book’s publication in Egypt, a group issued a fatwa threatening Abdel-Samad and he was put under police protection.\n\nAbdel-Samad calls for an \"Islam light\" in Europe without shari'a, jihad, gender apartheid, proselytism and “entitlement mentality”. He criticized the German political establishment for appeasing Islam, while ignoring fears about Islam. According to Abdel-Samad, this behavior created resentment in the German population.\n\nAbdel-Samad participated in the 2nd German Islam Conference 2010-2013 held at the invitation of the German Federal Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière.\n\nIn autumn 2010, Abdel-Samad took the journalist Henryk M. Broder on a 30,000 km-long road trip through Germany for a five-part TV series.\n\nIn an interview aired on the Salafi Islamist Egyptian channel Al-Hafez on June 7, 2013 (as translated by MEMRI), hardline Egyptian cleric and Al-Azhar professor Mahmoud Shaaban accused Abdel-Samad of committing \"heresy\" and stated that \"he must be killed for being a heretic... if he refuses to recant.\" Shaaban also stated that \"after he has been confronted with the evidence, his killing is permitted if the [Egyptian] government does not do it.\"\n\nIn mid-2015, he launched the show \"Ṣundūq al-Islām\" (\"Box of Islam\") on his official YouTube channel, Hamed.TV, which as of 20 October 2018 had more than 100,000 subscribers and more than 21 million video views. The channel is almost entirely in Arabic, containing but one German-language video.\n\nIn 2016, he was questioned by the Berlin police for alleged sedition.

Though it was originally established in 1879, the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania opened its current location in the historic Strip District along the Allegheny River in 1996. It is named for H. John Heinz III, the late US Senator from Pennsylvania who died in a 1991 plane crash.\n\nThe century-old Chautauqua Lake Ice Company building was renovated and adapted by the Pittsburgh office of the architecture firm of Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, who did the design and oversaw construction. The interior was designed to show off the building's features, as well as create spaces for exhibits and support space. The museum building is an exhibit in its own right. The History Center also features the following permanent exhibitions:\n\n\nThe museum's history began in 1879, with the formation of a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. In 1884 it changed its name to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania (HSWP) and has been operating continuously since then. It is the Pittsburgh region's oldest cultural organization.\n\nHSWP began the tradition of interpreting public history in 1911, organizing the centennial of steamboat navigation in Pittsburgh. In 1955 it led the organization of the city's bicentennial celebration. In the early years, HSWP held meetings in homes and churches, but in 1893, it was granted a space for its archives at the new Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood. By 1914, it had its own building nearby. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh's Strip District. The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by an Inaugural Gala there on April 26, 1996 for 900 guests.\n\nLocated in the Smithsonian wing of the Senator John Heinz History Center, the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum spans of exhibit space over two floors. The \"museum within a museum\" captures the Pittsburgh region's evolution and influence as a sports leader over more than a century, from amateur to pro and across the spectrum of sports. The Sports Museum captures tales of Pittsburgh sports through hundreds of artifacts, more than 70 hands-on interactive exhibits, and 20 audio-visual programs.\n\nSelect artifacts include Franco Harris' \"Immaculate Reception\" shoes; Mario Lemieux's hockey skates; Satchel Paige's baseball glove; the pitching rubber from the 1960 World Series; Billy Conn's gloves and light heavyweight champion belt; Arnold Palmer's sweater and golf bag; Chip Ganassi's 2000 Indy 500-winning race car; the \"Ultimate Steelers Fan's Car;\" the Homestead women swimmers Olympic medals from the 1920s and 1930s; and hundreds of Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cards.\n\nThe History Center's Detre Library & Archives is an extensive scholarly resource documenting 250 years of life in Western Pennsylvania. The collection includes books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, atlases, newspapers, films, recordings and other memorabilia.\n\nThe History Center also operates Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a world-renowned archaeological site south of Pittsburgh near Washington County's Avella community.\n\nThe Rockshelter is the oldest site of human habitation in North America, with evidence of man living there for nearly 16,000 years.

{"id": "7129127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7129127", "title": "Letter of recommendation", "text": "Letter of recommendation\n\nA letter of recommendation or recommendation letter, also known as a letter of reference, reference letter or simply reference, is a document in which the writer assesses the qualities, characteristics, and capabilities of the person being recommended in terms of that individual's ability to perform a particular task or function. Letters of recommendation are typically related to employment (such a letter may also be called an employment reference or job reference), admission to institutions of higher education, or scholarship eligibility. Recommendation letters are usually specifically requested to be written about someone, and are therefore addressed to a particular requester (such as a new employer, university admissions officer, etc.), although they may also be issued to the person being recommended without specifying an addressee.\n\nReferences may also be required of companies seeking to win contracts, particularly in the fields of engineering, consultancy, industry and construction, and with regard to public procurement and tenders. Reference letters for organizations are used to assess its ability to deliver the required level of service.\n\nSome applications, such as professional schools give applicants the choice to waive their right to view their letters or not. Usually, applicants are encouraged to waive their rights because if they do not, it is a sign they are not confident in their recommenders.\n\nThe person providing a reference is called a referee. An employment reference letter is usually written by a former employer or manager, but references can also be requested from co-workers, customers and vendors. Teachers and professors often supply references for students who have taken their classes. Reference letters for organizations are usually supplied by parties to which the company has provided similar services in the past. \n\nThe employment reference letter can cover topics such as:\n\nIn some countries, elements of performance are evaluated using established forms of expression, sometimes euphemistic. For example, in the German-language \"Arbeitszeugnis\", the following terms are frequently used:\n\nThis language established itself as an unwritten code in the employment world. Its purpose was to give even weakly performing employees a letter of recommendation that does not sound negative. However, the euphemistically glazed-over descriptions are now codified and generally known, so that the original cryptic intent is no longer served. Nonetheless, it is still standard to use this codified language.\n\nMost potential employers will contact referees to obtain references before offering a job to a new employee. A survey by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) found that eight out of ten resource professionals said they regularly conduct reference checks for professional (89%), executive (85%), administrative (84%) and technical (81%) positions. Candidates are advised to ensure that they provide a suitable list of referees to their new prospective employer or institution, and to contact those referees to ensure that they are able and willing to provide a suitable reference. In some cases employers will contact a candidate's former company for a reference even if no contact is supplied by the candidate.\n\nSome employers may not be willing to provide reference letters because they may be worried about potential lawsuits. In this case, the employer may only provide the job title, dates of employment and salary history for the employee. Finland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Bulgaria are the only countries in Europe where employees can legally claim an employment reference, including the right to a correct, unambiguous and benevolent appraisal.\n\nWhile there is no common law duty to provide a reference, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that a refusal to do so may constitute \"conduct that is unfair or is in bad faith\" with respect to a wrongful dismissal, and thus \"indicative of the type of conduct that ought to merit compensation by way of an addition to the notice period.\" There is a duty of care to ensure that, where one is provided, it is accurate and fair and not give a misleading impression, as held by the House of Lords in \"Spring v Guardian Assurance plc\". If an employer goes beyond what a reference should contain, or if it gives inaccurate or misleading information, liability may arise in the areas of breach of statutory duty, negligent misstatement, deceit, defamation or malicious falsehood. It does not matter what form the reference might take.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, references received by an employer from another person or organization can be disclosed to the person about whom they are written under the subject access provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998, but certain confidentiality considerations apply as to the identity of the person giving the reference. As a result, together with the duty of care under \"Spring\", many organizations have issued guidance as to best practice to be undertaken by reference providers.\n\nThe duty of care has also been held to apply in non-reference situations, as noted in 2011 in \" McKie v Swindon College\". In another case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales has held that \"a reference must not give an unfair or misleading impression overall, even if its discrete components are factually correct.\" However, while a reference must be accurate and fair, it is not necessary to report all material facts concerning an individual, but it can be argued that, if an agreed reference arising from a settlement agreement is misleadingly incomplete, the employer can be sued by a subsequent employer for breaching its duty of care. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, in an unfair dismissal case, ruled that, in preparing a reference, it was not reasonable to provide details of complaints against an employee of which the employee was not aware.\n\nThe Court of Appeal has further held that, if an employee leaves when an investigation is ongoing but has not been concluded, or where issues arise after an employee leaves that have not been investigated, employers can disclose this information but should do so in a measured and fair way, which will be particularly important if to omit this information would mean providing a misleading reference.\n\nIn 2016, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority are issuing rules that will require the furnishing of references, before any approval or certification may be given by them, as well as specifying the information that they must contain.\n\n\n\n"}

Her heyday lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, when she held the NWA World Women's Championship for almost twenty years. Burke started out in 1935, wrestling men at carnivals. She was managed by her second husband, promoter Billy Wolfe.\n\nMildred Burke, aged 15, began to work as a waitress on the Zuni Indian Reservation in Gallup, New Mexico. She lived there for three years, before leaving for Kansas City after agreeing to marry her boyfriend. He took her to a professional wrestling event, which sparked her interest in the sport. Burke, who was pregnant at the time, later persevered.\n\nPrior to wrestling, she was an office stenographer by day, had outstanding muscle development, and was hoping to become a professional wrestler. Locally, Billy Wolfe was training aspiring women professional wrestlers. At first, Wolfe did not want to train Burke and instructed a male wrestler to body slam her, so she would stop asking Wolfe to train her. Burke, however, performed a body slam on the man instead, which resulted in Wolfe agreeing to train her. Wolfe tutored her and realized that she was the prospect for which he was waiting. The close proximity of their training resulted in a relationship and ultimately marriage. Changing her name to Mildred Burke, she defeated Clara Mortenson for the Women's World Championship in January 1937.\n\nIn the 1930s, Burke wrestled over 200 men, but only lost to one of them.\n\nDespite the riches that her husband earned as a promoter of women grapplers, there was a dark side to their marriage. On the road, Wolfe stood as a father figure to the women he trained and managed, but he also earned reputation as a womanizer. Their marriage was not monogamous, as Wolfe enjoyed the companionship of women with whom he traveled.\n\nTensions emanated from the extramarital activity and in 1952, Wolfe and Burke went their own ways. Burke found herself frozen out of professional wrestling among all National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) channels. Desperate, Burke decided to consult Jack Pfefer for help. The NWA attempted to reconcile the couple, but the only agreed upon solution was that one would sell out to the other. Burke volunteered to sell to Wolfe for Burke's Attractions, Inc. went into bankruptcy and into the hands of receiver James Hoff of Columbus. Eight months later, Hoff named Wolfe as administrator and was approved by Franklin County Judge William Bryant. A memorandum dated August 20, 1953, was circulated by Wolfe, in which he boldly announced that he was the booker for Burke and her stable of 27 wrestlers. The claim was disputed by Burke on August 26, 1953, by stating that the issue would be settled in the courts. It was emphasized that her contract prohibited Wolfe from competing in wrestling and was in breach of the binding agreement. She consulted with Leroy McGuirk and hoped that she would be vindicated by the NWA at their September 1953 meeting in Chicago.\n\nBurke faced many obstacles, as women were banned from yearly NWA conferences, and this diminished the importance of women in professional wrestling. An example of the discrimination was evident during the dispute with Wolfe. Burke sat in the lobby of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago as male dignitaries argued behind closed doors about her future. Wolfe's voice was the only one heard by the membership. In the end, the NWA declined to recognize women's wrestling after the meeting, Wolfe regained his stake, but many women were loyal to Burke and refused to wrestle for Wolfe.\n\nIn a letter to NWA members on November 4, 1953, Burke refuted Wolfe's claim that she would wrestle only one woman grappler. She claimed that there were twelve grapplers with whom she would work. Wolfe, however, used his influence to get her frozen from NWA members and her promising run in the Southeast with Cowboy Luttrall and Paul Jones in 1954 fizzled.\n\nEmotionally exhausted, Burke wrestled Wolfe's daughter-in-law June Byers and there was genuine heat between the two. The match took place on August 20, 1954 in Atlanta. It was a grudge match that quickly became a shoot fight, due to genuine enmity between the two women. Wolfe had the local commission in his corner and slid a friendly referee into the match. Burke later admitted that she had given up the legitimate first fall with the intention of competing stronger in the second. The second fall never had a finish. Officials called the match, and Burke left the ring believing that her title was safe because she had not lost two falls. The result was that many in the press stated that Byers had defeated her and the importance of Burke's championship began to diminish.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Burke started the World Women's Wrestling Association in Los Angeles, California. She returned to her promotion after her match with Byers, still recognizing herself as the World Women's Champion even after the NWA had recognized rival June Byers as champion since then, and continued to defend it. She vacated the title in 1956, when she retired from professional wrestling. In 1970, the title was revived by All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) as their top prize.\n\nAfter the tensions with Wolfe and the NWA, Burke traveled with an escort for the rest of her career as a protective measure. She started International Women's Wrestlers Inc. with Bill Newman and the promotion had offices in New York City, San Francisco and Sydney, Australia. These offices served in the dual capacity of booking offices and training centers.\n\nHer efforts to spread women's wrestling internationally reached Japan and brought about the World Wide Women's Wrestling Association (WWWA).\n\nIn her later years, Burke ran a women's wrestling school in Encino, California. Among her students was Canadian Rhonda Sing, who went on to fame as WWWA World Champion, Monster Ripper, and WWF Women's Champion Bertha Faye.\n\nBurke died from a stroke on February 18, 1989 in Northridge, California, and was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2002, she was posthumously inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Burke was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a \"Legacy\" member.\n\n\n"}

It holds the largest archive collection related to the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 2003, Indonesia introduced a joint submission to the UNESCO Memory of the World Register with the Netherlands, South Africa, and Sri Lanka for their archival collections related to the VOC. The National Archives collection traces its origins to the work of Jacob Anne van der Chijs, who was appointed the first archivist of the Dutch East Indies in 1892 by the colonial government.\n\nThe task of archive management in the early period of Dutch presence in Indonesia fell upon the General Secretariat of the colonial government. Archive material received little attention during this period and was often unmaintained, resulting in accumulation of material and insect damage. During the interregnum period (1811–1816) arising from Napoleonic Wars, the British took over administration of the Dutch East Indies. Archive maintenance fell upon the hands of the librarian of the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences. On 19 February 1819, the archive was returned to the management of the General Secretariat and remained within its jurisdiction until 1892.\n\nIn 1860, Jacob Anne van der Chijs and Henry David Levyssohn Norman were commissioned to investigate the existing archives. Over the next several years, 15 chests of archive material were transported to the Nationaal Archief in the Netherlands. Plans to send all material overseas were blocked by the Batavian Society, and a commission was charged in 1872 to determine which materials important enough to be kept would be transferred to the Society. Van der Chijs was recommissioned in 1880 to create the archive's first collection catalog, which was eventually published in two years later. The collection contained 18,387 items, and work began to order and number them definitively.\n\nVan der Chijs was appointed the first archivist of the Indies on 28 January 1892 through a government decree. Although van der Chijs regarded his work as provisional, his successors did not continue the work to document the VOC archives. In 1925, the collection was moved to the former country estate of Governor-General Reynier de Klerck, where it remained undamaged during the period of Japanese occupation. When the Dutch transferred sovereignty of the Indies to Indonesia in 1949, the collections were handed to the current National Archives. They were finally moved to the new location of the National Archives in 1975.\n\nIndonesia holds the largest archive collection related to the Dutch East India Company in the world, with documents dating between 1612 and 1811.

{"id": "380702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380702", "title": "Nocnitsa", "text": "Nocnitsa\n\nThe Notsnitsa in Slavic mythology, is a nightmare spirit that also goes by the name kriksy, plaksy, plachky, plaksivicy, kriksy-varaksy, kriksy-plaksy, night hag, night maiden. She is referred to as Načnica in Belarusian , Nocnica or Płaczka in Polish, горска майка (gorska majka), ношно (nošno) in Bulgarian, Шумска маjка (Šumska majka), бабице (babice), ноћнице (noćnice) in Serbian, mrake, vidine in Croatian, nočnine, mračnine in Slovene.\n\nThe Notsnitsa is also present in Russian and Slovak folklore. She is known to torment children at night, and a stone with a hole in the center is said to be a protection from the Nocnitsa. Mothers in some regions will place a knife in their children’s cradles or draw a circle around the cradles with a knife for protection. This is possibly based on the belief that supernatural beings cannot touch iron.\nIn the Roman tradition,an incubus is a demon in male form who, according to mythological and legendary traditions, lies upon sleeping women, in order to engage in sexual activity with them. Its female counterpart is a succubus. Salacious tales of incubi and succubi have been told for many centuries in traditional societies. Some traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health, mental state, or even death.\nThe Nocnitsa is known to sit on one’s chest, drawing \"life energy\". Because of this, many refer to Nocnitsa as a type of vampire. The Nocnitsa will often continue visiting. According to some folklore, night hags visit when one sleeps on one’s back, with the hands on the chest (a position allegedly called \"sleeping with the dead\"). According to some folklore, night hags are made of shadow. She might also have a horrible screeching voice. She might allegedly also smell of the moss and dirt from her forest of origin.\n\nThe Nocnitsa is almost certainly linked to the common apparition seen during the hypnagogic state of sleep.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7705854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705854", "title": "Passing (racial identity)", "text": "Passing (racial identity)\n\nRacial passing occurs when a person classified as a member of one racial group is also accepted as a member of a different racial group. The term was used especially in the United States to describe a person of color or multiracial ancestry assimilating into the white majority during times when legal and social conventions of hypodescent classified the person as a minority, subject to racial segregation and discrimination.\n\nIn 1857, fifteen-year-old runaway slave Jane Morrison, blonde and blue-eyed, went to court in Louisiana to win her freedom in the case \"Morrison v. White\". Instances such as late 19th-century Jim Crow state laws establishing segregation in public facilities, and early 20th-century state laws establishing the \"one-drop rule\" for racial classification (as in Virginia in 1924), were examples of European Americans attempting to impose regulations of hypodescent. Then, someone who identified by appearance and majority ancestry might be described as \"passing\" for Caucasian. In Louisiana, people of color who passed as white were referred to as \"passe blanc\".\n\nThe US civil rights leader Walter Francis White (who was blond-haired, blue-eyed, and very fair) was of mixed-race background, mostly European ancestry, as 27 of his 32 great-great-great-grandparents were white; the other five were classified as black and had been slaves. He grew up with his parents and family in Atlanta in the black community and identified with it. He served as the chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1929 until his death in 1955. In the earlier stages of his career, he conducted investigations in the South, during which he sometimes passed as white to gather information more freely on lynchings and hate crimes, and to protect himself in socially hostile environments.\n\nIn the 20th century, \"Krazy Kat\" comics creator George Herriman was a Louisiana Creole cartoonist born to mulatto parents, who claimed Greek heritage throughout his adult life. The 20th-century writer and critic Anatole Broyard was a Louisiana Creole who chose to pass for white in his adult life in New York City and Connecticut. He wanted to create an independent writing life and not be classified as a black writer. In addition, he did not identify with northern urban black people, whose experiences had been much different from his as a child in New Orleans' Creole community. He married an American woman of European descent. His wife and many of his friends knew he was partly black in ancestry. His daughter Bliss Broyard did not find out until after her father's death. In 2007, she published a memoir that traced her exploration of her father's life and family mysteries entitled \"One Drop: My Father's Hidden Life: A Story of Race and Family Secrets\".\n\nIn 21st-century intersectional discourse, the term \"white-passing\" refers to someone who identifies as a person of color but benefits from white privilege due to their appearance.\n\nIn a limited reversal of the usual pattern, some people of European ancestry have chosen to pass as members of other races. \n\nIn the New Age and Hippie movements, non-Native people sometimes have attempted to pass as Native American or other Indigenous medicine people. The pejorative term for such people is \"plastic shaman\".\n\nThe United States actor Iron Eyes Cody, who was of Sicilian descent, developed a niche in Hollywood by playing roles of Native Americans. He had claimed American Indian heritage in order to get work. \n\nEuropean-American authors and artists who have notably attempted to pass as being indigenous include Asa Earl Carter. \n\nIn the United States, Jimmie Durham was exposed as a fraud who was posing as a Cherokee artist. \n\nJay Marks, a man of Eastern European Jewish ancestry, adopted the pen name of Jamake Highwater about 1969, claiming to be Cherokee-Blackfeet, and published numerous books under that name. He won awards and NEA grants. Artist Yeffe Kimball claimed to be Osage.\n\nProfessor and activist Ward Churchill, who advocated for American Indian rights, claimed to be Cherokee-Muscogee Creek. His claims were rejected by both tribes. He was fired in 2007 from the University of Colorado.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" reported on October 5, 2015 that Dartmouth College fired the Director of its Native American Program, Susan Taffe Reed, \"after tribal officials and alumni accused her of misrepresenting herself as an American Indian\". She previously taught at Dartmouth, Bowdoin College, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nTo try to protect Native American artists from the claims of non-Native impersonators, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 was passed in the United States. It requires artists to be enrolled members of a state or federally recognized tribe in order to claim to be a Native American artist.\n\nThe Native American and Indigenous Studies Association's Statement on Indigenous Identity Fraud says:\nIf we believe in Indigenous self-determination as a value and goal, then questions of identity and integrity in its expression cannot be treated as merely a distraction from supposedly more important issues. Falsifying one’s identity or relationship to particular Indigenous peoples is an act of appropriation continuous with other forms of colonial violence.\n\nCivil rights activist Rachel Dolezal, then president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, claimed in a February 2015 profile to have been born in a \"Montana tepee\" and have hunted for food with her family as a child \"with bows and arrows\". She primarily identified as African American and had established herself as an activist in Spokane. In 2015 Dolezal's mother disputed her daughter's accounts, saying that the family's ancestry was Czech, Swedish, and German, with \"faint traces\" of Native American heritage. She also denied various claims made by her daughter about her life, including having lived in Africa when young. Dolezal ultimately resigned from her position at the Spokane NAACP chapter.\n\nIn 2015, Vijay Chokalingam, the brother of Indian-American entertainer Mindy Kaling, told CNN that he had pretended to be black years before in order to take advantage of affirmative action to be admitted into medical school. The medical school issued a statement that Chokalingam's grades and scores met the criteria for acceptance at the time, and race had played no factor in his admission.\n\nJohn Roland Redd was an African-American musician who was born and raised in Missouri. In the 1950s he assumed a new identity, claiming to be an Indian named Korla Pandit and fabricating a history of birth in New Delhi, India to a Brahmin priest and a French opera singer. He established a career in this exotic persona, described as an \"Indian Liberace\". Two years after his death in 1999, his true ethnic identity was revealed in an article by \"Los Angeles\" magazine editor R. J. Smith.\n\nNew Zealand actors of Māori descent working in the American film industry—such as Cliff Curtis and Temuera Morrison—are frequently called on to play Hispanic roles. Curtis has appeared as a Mexican or Latino characters in at least half a dozen feature films, among them \"Fracture\", \"Colombiana\", \"Last Knights\", \"Runaway Jury\", \"Blow\", and \"Live Free or Die Hard\".\n\nA mixed-race Creole class developed in Louisiana before the United States purchased the territory. In the early years of the French and Spanish colony, men took enslaved African or Native American women as wives or mistresses. In the Latin culture, the wealthy men often had their mixed-race sons educated in Europe or trained in skilled trades. Gradually a third caste developed, made up of free people of color, or mixed-race Creoles. Creoles were often educated, and many became wealthy property owners. They also formed a community of artisans in New Orleans. Beautiful young Creole women often became the official mistresses of white French colonists, who provided financial settlements for them and their children in a system known as \"plaçage\". This enabled them to have their children educated.\n\nThere were many generations of mixed-race people in the American South. In the later 18th and 19th centuries, they were often the children of white planter fathers and enslaved women. Among the most famous were the multiracial slave children born to Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings from their long relationship after he became a widower. Hemings was three-quarters white, as her mother was half-black and half-white. Betty Hemings was the daughter of a slave woman and an English sea captain; she became the longtime mistress of Jefferson's father-in-law John Wayles after he became a widower for the third time, and had several children with him. Sally was the half-sister of Jefferson's late wife Martha Wayles Jefferson.\n\nIn 1998, DNA studies showed that the descendants of Eston Hemings, Sally's youngest son, were related to the Jefferson male line. Most historians, the National Genealogical Society, and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation of Monticello believe that the weight of historical evidence suggests Jefferson was the father of Eston and all of Hemings' children (who were thus seven-eighths European by ancestry and legally white under Virginia law at the time). The historian Annette Gordon-Reed was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2010 for her work on the history of the Jeffersons and the Hemings families (which won a Pulitzer Prize and 15 other major awards), and for \"changing the course of Jeffersonian scholarship\" by showing how earlier historians had disregarded or discounted important evidence from slave testimonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Nazi Germany and in areas controlled by Germany before and during World War II, some Jewish people who looked \"Aryan\" (in terms of their facial features and physical appearance in general) passed as \"Aryan\" and tried to be \"more German than the Germans\" in order to avoid deportation to ghettos or death camps. Edith Hahn Beer was Jewish and passed as \"Aryan\"; she survived the Holocaust by living with and marrying a Nazi officer. Hahn-Beer wrote a memoir called: \"The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust\". Another such example is Stella Kübler, a Jewish collaborator who initially attempted to hide her Jewish background.\n\nExamples of racial passing have been used by people to assimilate into groups other than European. Marie Lee Bandura, who grew up as part of the Qayqayt First Nation in New Westminster, British Columbia, was orphaned and believed she was the last of her people. She moved to Vancouver's Chinatown, married a Chinese man, and raised her four children as Chinese. One day she told her daughter Rhonda Larrabee about her heritage: \"I will tell you once, but you must never ask me again.\"\n\nThe environmentalist Grey Owl was a white British man named Archibald Belaney, rather than First Nations as he claimed to be. When asked to explain his European appearance, he lied and claimed he was half Scottish and half Apache. Belaney learned some of the Ojibwe language and wilderness skills, and attempted to live by his anachronistic idea of what makes someone Native American.\n\nIn Latin America, generational acculturation and assimilation took place via intermarriage. Medium-brown offspring of even dark parents were no longer \"black\", but were labeled with any of a half-dozen terms denoting class as much as skin tone. Descendants who were European-looking were accepted as white.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tickets were $1,000 each and included numerous celebrities, including, the orchestrator of the event, Elton John. Chefs from the city provided food and entertainment was provided by local groups. The concert itself was held outside the museum, using the stage from the Live 8 concert only a few days before. VIP tickets costing $500 allowed people to sit in 25 rows set up in front of the stage; otherwise, it was a standing only event. Over a million people attended.\n\nThe concert was hosted by Wayne Brady and Bruce Vilanch and included other guests, such as Billie Jean King. Performing were Bryan Adams, Patti LaBelle, Rufus Wainwright, Peter Nero and the Philly Pops, culminating with a performance by Elton John (who was introduced by long-time friend and AIDS activist Billie Jean King).

{"id": "27074851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27074851", "title": "Political class", "text": "Political class\n\nPolitical class, or political elite is a concept in comparative political science originally developed by Italian political theorist theory of Gaetano Mosca (1858–1941). It refers to the relatively small group of activists that is highly aware and active in politics, and from whom the national leadership is largely drawn. As Max Weber noted, they not only live \"for politics\"—like the old notables used to—but make their careers \"off politics\" as policy specialists and experts on specific fields of public administration. Mosca approached the study of the political class by examining the mechanisms of reproduction and renewal of the ruling class; the characteristics of politicians; and the different forms of organization developed in their wielding of power. \n\nElected legislatures may become dominated by subject-matter specialists, aided by permanent staffs, who become a political class. \n\nThe presence or absence of a political class in a country depends on its history. For example Germany (since 1945) has a very weak political class, with a \"striking taboo\" against the sort of elitism that dominated Germany before 1945, including Imperial Germany, Weimar and the Nazi regime. In sharp contrast France has a very prestigious political class trained in special elite schools.\n\nUntil the 1970s Britain featured a tight-knit political class that emerged from upper-class families whose sons came to know each other at elite \"public schools\" (like Eton College and Harrow School) and the \"old boy\" network, based on Oxford and Cambridge, which dominates public life. After 1970, however, the political class became much more open in terms of the social origins of British politicians and top civil servants. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) have increasingly been educated at nonelite schools and have been of more modest social backgrounds. Labour MPs, in turn, are increasingly middle class, white-collar and university educated.\n\nA political class emerged in Spain during the reign (1833–68) of Queen Isabella II. A modern political class emerged in Spain, adapted to the needs of a representative state that was under construction. To bring that about, the circles of power were open to intense renewal, coopting families of provincial gentry networks. The result was a political class composed mostly of jurists and attached to the values and interests of landed property. It was a new ruling class. Although originally inspired by revolutionary principles, it soon limited the circle of power, becoming aristocratic and largely closed to new membership.\n\nLucas (1998) examines despotic versus infrastructural power in terms of relations between the military leaders and the civilian political class in Nigeria from 1985 to 1993. He concludes that weak states experience a conflict between these two types of power. Despotic power, in sociologist Michael Mann's definition, refers to the state's repressive capacities, while infrastructural power refers to its ability to penetrate society and implement its decisions. Whereas leaders cultivate alliances with powerful social groups to realize their infrastructural power, the exercise of despotic power can undermine such patterns of collaboration. \n\nMilitary leaders relied on a number of despotic strategies to extend their control over the political class as part of a promised transition to democracy: many politicians were banned, two government-created political parties were imposed, and elections that yielded outcomes threatening to military interests were annulled. While the military leadership was successful in repressing the politicians, it was unable to restructure the civilian leadership in ways that would further the institutional power of the state. The military's persistent reliance on despotic strategies led to a long-term decline in the integrity and infrastructural capacity of the state.\n\nIn China, the country was prevalently agricultural, dominated by an imperial bureaucracy that was crowned by the Mandarins. This was made up of judges, governors, administrators, all highly qualified in the art of governing. The literary official became the pillar of the political system.\n\nPopulist political movements portray themselves as the enemies of the established political class and outsiders from the main political class that no longer represents the people and are morally corrupt. Such movements have included France's National Front, Austria's Freedom Party and Belgium's Vlaams Belang.\n\nThe term \"political class\" has recently been used as an epithet by conservatives, such as the editors of \"National Review\". The theme is that the political elite is undemocratic and has an agenda of its own—especially the aggrandizement of its own power—that is hostile to the larger national interest, and which ought to be opposed by grassroots of populist movements. \n\nThere was a large movement for term limits in the United States in the 1990s to weaken the political class by limiting the number of terms an elected legislator could serve. Even though it succeeded in many states and cities it was rejected as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court when it tried to limit the number of terms that a federal officeholder could serve.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "332287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332287", "title": "Ric Flair", "text": "Ric Flair\n\nRichard Morgan Fliehr (born February 25, 1949), better known as Ric Flair, is an American professional wrestling manager and retired professional wrestler signed to WWE under its Legends program.\n\nWidely regarded as the greatest professional wrestler of all time and the best American performer of the 1980s, Flair had a career that spanned 40 years. He is noted for his tenures with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Since the mid-1970s, he has used the moniker \"The Nature Boy\".\n\nA major pay-per-view attraction throughout his career, Flair headlined at the premier annual NWA/WCW event, Starrcade, on ten occasions, while also co-headlining its WWF counterpart, WrestleMania, in 1992, after winning that year's Royal Rumble. \"PWI\" awarded him their Wrestler of the Year award a record six times, while \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" named him the Wrestler of the Year (an award named after him and Lou Thesz) a record eight times. The only two-time WWE Hall of Fame inductee, first inducted with the class of 2008 for his individual career and again with the class of 2012 as a member of The Four Horsemen, he is also a member of the NWA Hall of Fame, Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, and Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.\n\nFlair is officially recognized by WWE as a 16-time world champion (eight-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and two-time WWF Champion), although the number of his world championship reigns varies by source, ranging from 16 to 25. He has claimed to be a 21-time champion. He was the first holder of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship (which he also held last). As the inaugural WCW World Heavyweight Champion, he became the first person to complete WCW's Triple Crown, having already held the United States Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships. He then completed WWE's version of the Triple Crown when he won the Intercontinental Championship, after already holding the WWF Championship and the World Tag Team Championship.\n\nFliehr was born on February 25, 1949, in Memphis, Tennessee. His birth name is widely believed to be Fred Phillips, although on different documents he is also credited as Fred Demaree or Stewart, while his biological parents were Luther and Olive Phillips (the latter of whom was also credited under the Demaree and Stewart surnames). He was adopted; at the time of his adoption (arranged by the Tennessee Children's Home Society), his adoptive father, Dr. Richard Reid Fliehr (1918–2000), was completing a residency in obstetrics and gynecology in Detroit, Michigan. His adoptive mother, Kathleen Kinsmiller Fliehr (1918–2003), worked for the \"Star Tribune\". Shortly afterward, the family settled in Edina, Minnesota, where the young Fliehr lived throughout his childhood. After ninth grade, he attended Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin for four years, during which time he participated in interscholastic wrestling, football, and track.\n\nFlair trained as a professional wrestler with Verne Gagne. He attended Gagne's first wrestling camp with Greg Gagne, Jim Brunzell, The Iron Sheik and Ken Patera at Gagne's barn outside Minneapolis in the winter of 1971. On December 10, 1972, he made his debut in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, battling George \"Scrap Iron\" Gadaski to a 10-minute draw while adopting the ring name Ric Flair. During his time in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Flair had matches with Dusty Rhodes, Chris Taylor, André the Giant, Larry Hennig and Wahoo McDaniel.\n\nFlair first competed in Japan in 1973 for International Wrestling Enterprise (IWE), due to a working agreement between AWA promoter Verne Gagne and the IWE. After Flair left the AWA for Jim Crockett Jr.'s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW) in 1974, he began working tours for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). On April 27, 1978, Flair challenged for the NWA United National Championship in a losing effort. Throughout the 1980s, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in All Japan against the likes of Genichiro Tenryu, Riki Choshu, Jumbo Tsuruta, Harley Race, and Kerry Von Erich. On October 21, 1985, Flair wrestled Rick Martel in a double title match where he defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, but the match ended in a double countout. As All Japan withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in the late 1980s, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began a working agreement with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). In 1989, the working agreement led to a feud between Flair and Keiji Mutoh, who was wrestling under The Great Muta gimmick, in the United States for WCW. On March 21, 1991, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged Tatsumi Fujinami for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a double title match on the WCW/New Japan Supershow at the Tokyo Dome. Fujinami beat Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but later lost the title at WCW's SuperBrawl I on May 19, 1991 in the United States.\n\nWhen Flair left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1991, he continued to tour Japan in the Super World of Sports (SWS) promotion, due to an agreement between WWF and SWS. He defended and retained the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Genichiro Tenryu on September 15, 1992 in a match that resulted in a draw. In August 1995, under a WCW contract, Flair participated in the G1 Climax tournament in New Japan, where he beat Shiro Koshinaka, drew Masahiro Chono, and lost to Keiji Mutoh. On July 17, 1996, Flair challenged Shinya Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort in NJPW.\n\nOnce again under the WWE banner, Flair continued to tour Japan periodically between 2002 and 2008. He successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship with Batista against The Dudley Boyz twice in February 2004. On the February 7, 2005 episode of \"Raw\", broadcast from the Saitama Super Arena in Japan, Flair lost to Shawn Michaels in a singles match. In February 2008, Flair wrestled Mr. Kennedy in the Ariake Coliseum and William Regal in the Budokan Hall, both under the stipulation that he would retire if he lost.\n\nOn January 2, 2013, All Japan announced that Flair would make his return to AJPW for the first time in five years on January 26, 2013, teaming with Keiji Mutoh to take on Tatsumi Fujinami and Seiya Sanada. This would have been his first professional wrestling match since his September 2011 loss to Sting on \"Impact Wrestling\" and his first for All Japan since March 1987. However, on January 26, just moments before the start of the All Japan event, the promotion announced that Flair was forced to pull out of his match because of a \"sudden illness\", later reported as a badly swollen left leg. Flair was replaced in the match by his son Reid, but also ended up getting involved in the match himself, delivering chops to Seiya Sanada.\n\nIn 1974, Flair left the AWA for Jim Crockett's Mid-Atlantic region in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and he soon captured his first singles title, when on February 9, 1975 he beat Paul Jones for the Mid-Atlantic TV Championship. On October 4, 1975, however, Flair's career nearly ended when he was in a serious plane crash in Wilmington, North Carolina that took the life of the pilot and paralyzed Johnny Valentine (also on board were Mr. Wrestling, Bob Bruggers, and promoter David Crockett). Flair broke his back in three places and, at age 26, was told by doctors that he would never wrestle again. Flair conducted a rigorous physical therapy schedule, however, and he returned to the ring just eight months later, where he resumed his feud with Wahoo McDaniel in February 1976. The crash did force Flair to change his wrestling technique away from the power brawling style he had used early on, which led him to adopt the \"Nature Boy\" style he would use throughout his career. Flair won the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship when he defeated Bobo Brazil on July 29, 1977. During the next three years, he held five reigns as NWA United States Heavyweight Champion while feuding with Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Mr. Wrestling, Jimmy Snuka and Greg Valentine (with whom he also formed a championship tag team). However, Flair reached elite status when he began referring to himself as \"The Nature Boy\" in order to incite a 1978 feud with the original \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, who put Flair over in one encounter.\n\nOn September 17, 1981, Flair beat Dusty Rhodes for his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In the following years, Flair established himself as the promotion's main franchise in the midst of emerging competition from Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF). An unsanctioned title loss took place on January 6, 1983 to Carlos Colón Sr. in Puerto Rico. Flair recovered the championship belt in a phantom change seventeen days later not officially recognized by the NWA. Harley Race won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Flair in 1983, but Flair regained the title at Starrcade in a steel cage match. Officially, Flair won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship eight more times. Flair lost the title to Race and won it back in the span of three days in New Zealand and Singapore in March 1984. At the first David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions at Texas Stadium, Flair was pinned by Kerry Von Erich, but he regained the title eighteen days later in Japan and reigned for two years, two months and two days, losing the title to Dusty Rhodes on July 26, 1986 at The Great American Bash. However, Flair regained the title two weeks later.\n\nIn late 1985, the tag team of Arn Anderson and Ole Anderson began aiding Flair (whom they claimed as a \"cousin\") in attacks against Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. and Sam Houston. A few weeks later, the Andersons interrupted Houston's match against Tully Blanchard and the three villains combined to rough up the youngster. Shortly thereafter, Flair, Blanchard and the Andersons formalized their alliance, calling themselves The Four Horsemen, with Blanchard's manager J.J. Dillon also coming on board. Upon the group's inception, it was clear that The Four Horsemen were unlike any villainous alliance that had ever existed, as the four rule breakers immediately used their strength in numbers to decimate the NWA's top fan favorites while controlling the majority of the championship titles.\n\nBy 1986, wrestling promoter Jim Crockett had consolidated the various NWA member promotions he owned into a single entity, running under the banner of the National Wrestling Alliance. Controlling much of the traditional NWA territories in the southeast and Midwestern United States, Crockett looked to expand nationally and built his promotion around Flair as champion. During this time, Flair's bookings as champion were tightly controlled by Crockett, and a custom championship belt was created for Flair. Flair lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Detroit to Ron Garvin on September 25, 1987. Garvin held the title for two months before losing to Flair on November 26, 1987 at WCW's first pay-per-view event, Starrcade, in Chicago.\n\nIn early 1988, Sting and Flair fought to a 45-minute time-limit draw at the first ever \"Clash of the Champions\". On February 20, 1989, at Chi-Town Rumble in Chicago, Ricky Steamboat pinned Flair to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This prompted a series of rematches, where Steamboat was presented as a \"family man\" (often accompanied by his wife and young son), while Flair opposed him as an immoral, fast-living \"ladies man\". Following a best-of-three falls match with Steamboat that lasted just short of the 60-minute time limit (and ended with a disputed finish where Steamboat retained the title) at \"Clash of the Champions VI: Ragin' Cajun\" on April 2, Flair regained the title from Steamboat on May 7, 1989 at WrestleWar in a match that was voted 1989's \"Match of the Year\" by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\". On July 23, 1989, Flair defeated Terry Funk at The Great American Bash, but the two continued to feud through the summer and eventually Flair reformed The Four Horsemen, with the surprise addition of longtime rival Sting, to combat Funk's J-Tex Corporation. This led to an \"I Quit\" match at \"\" which Flair won. Flair then kicked Sting out of The Four Horsemen upon his challenge for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, resulting in a revived feud between the two. On July 7, 1990, Flair dropped the title to Sting at The Great American Bash. After being unmasked as The Black Scorpion at Starrcade in 1990, Flair regained the title from Sting on January 11, 1991.\n\nSubsequent to this title win, Flair was recognized by WCW as the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion, though he was still also recognized as NWA World Heavyweight Champion. On March 21, 1991, Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Flair in a match in Tokyo at the WCW/New Japan Supershow. While the NWA recognized Fujinami as their new champion, WCW did not because Fujinami had backdropped Flair over the top rope in a violation of WCW rules. On May 19, 1991, Flair defeated Fujinami at SuperBrawl I in St. Petersburg, Florida to reclaim the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. In the spring of 1991, Flair had a contract dispute with WCW president Jim Herd, who wanted him to take a substantial pay cut. Flair had resigned as head booker in February 1990 and Herd wanted to reduce Flair's role in the promotion even further, despite the fact that Flair was still a top draw. According to Flair, Herd also proposed changes in his appearance and ring name (i.e. by shaving his hair, wearing a diamond earring and going by the name Spartacus) in order to \"change with the times\". Flair disagreed with the proposals and two weeks before The Great American Bash, Herd fired him and vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. While Flair had left for the WWF, he was still recognized as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion until September 8, when the title was officially vacated.\n\nFlair signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in September 1991 and began appearing on television with the Big Gold Belt, calling himself \"The Real World Champion\". Led by his \"financial adviser\" Bobby Heenan and his \"executive consultant\" Mr. Perfect, Flair repeatedly issued challenges to WWF wrestlers like \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan, wrestling a team led by Piper at Survivor Series in November 1991 and helping The Undertaker defeat Hogan for the WWF Championship that same night. WCW sued Flair in an attempt to reclaim the championship belt, but Flair claimed that he owned the title belt in lieu of the US$25,000 deposit paid by NWA champions upon winning the title, which had not been returned to him when he was fired from WCW.\n\nAt the 1992 Royal Rumble, Flair won the Rumble match to claim the vacant WWF Championship. Flair entered as number three in the Rumble match and lasted 60 minutes, last eliminating Sid Justice with help from Hulk Hogan, who had been eliminated by Justice seconds earlier. Randy Savage then challenged Flair for the WWF Championship as part of the double main event at WrestleMania VIII. In the storyline, Flair taunted Savage by claiming that he had a prior relationship with Savage's wife, Miss Elizabeth. Savage defeated Flair for the title at WrestleMania. In July 1992, as Savage prepared to defend the title against The Ultimate Warrior at SummerSlam, Flair and Mr. Perfect sowed distrust between the two by suggesting that they would back one or the other during their match. They actually attacked both Savage and Warrior and injured Savage's knee, an injury that Flair exploited to regain the title in a match with Savage on September 1. His second reign was short-lived, however, as he lost the title to Bret Hart on October 12, 1992.\n\nFlair teamed with Razor Ramon to take on Savage and Perfect at the Survivor Series in November 1992. Flair appeared in the Royal Rumble in January 1993, then lost a Loser Leaves the WWF match to Mr. Perfect on the next night's (January 25) \"Monday Night Raw\" in a match taped six days earlier. Flair then fulfilled his remaining house show commitments, making his last appearance on February 10, 1993, before returning to WCW.\n\nFlair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993, as a result of a \"no-compete\" clause he was unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short-lived talk show in WCW called \"A Flair for the Gold\". Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show's set, and Flair's maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts. Once he returned to action, Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993. At Fall Brawl, Flair lost the title, now rebranded the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, to \"Ravishing Rick\" Rude. At Starrcade in 1993, Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time. In the spring of 1994, Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin, causing the title to be held up. Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held-up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night. The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win. Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree, which turned out to be Barry Windham, whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager. He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five-match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28, in which Flair won the series, with 2 wins, 1 loss, and 2 draws.\n\nIn June 1994 at \"Clash of the Champions XXVII\", Flair defeated Sting in a unification match, merging the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, and solidifying his heel turn. After becoming the unified and undisputed WCW champion, Flair feuded with Hulk Hogan upon Hogan's arrival in WCW in June 1994, losing the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to him in July at Bash at the Beach. Flair continued to feud with Hogan and finally lost to Hogan in a steel cage retirement match at Halloween Havoc. Flair took a few months off afterwards before returning as a wrestler and part-time manager for Vader in 1995 (explained on-air by having Flair nag Hogan for months until Hogan and Savage both petitioned WCW management to let Flair come back).\n\nOn April 29, 1995, Flair wrestled Antonio Inoki in front of 190,000 spectators in Pyongyang, North Korea at the May Day Stadium in a losing effort under a joint show between New Japan Pro Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling. The event was broadcast on August 4, 1995 on pay-per-view under the title of Collision in Korea. In the fall of 1995, Flair began a short feud with Arn Anderson, which culminated in a tag match that saw Flair turning on Sting to reform the new Four Horsemen with Flair as the leader, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Chris Benoit as the members. With the new Four Horsemen, Flair won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship two more times before the nWo invasion storyline began in WCW, with the first one being in December 1995 at Starcade, where Flair defeated Lex Luger and Sting by countout and then defeated Savage after all three Four Horsemen members ran to the ring and Arn Anderson knocked out Savage with brass knuckles, thus allowing Flair to pin Savage to win the match and the title. Afterwards Savage won the title back on \"Nitro\" after Starcade, but Flair won the next match at SuperBrawl VI to regain the championship. During the feud, Savage's manager Miss Elizabeth turned against him and became Flair's valet. Together with Woman and Debra McMichael they would escort Flair to his matches until Miss Elizabeth was taken by the nWo in the fall and eventually returned as Savage's valet when he joined the nWo in 1997. Flair lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship eventually three months later to The Giant. The feud with Savage continued with The New Four Horseman joining the Dungeon of Doom to create an Alliance to end Hulkamania. Together the factions wrestled Hogan and Savage in a triple steel cage, End of Hulkamania match; losing to the reunited Mega Powers. Afterwards, Flair went on to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and there were also changes in the Four Horseman in 1996, as Brian Pillman left WCW and Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael became the fourth member.\n\nOnce again as a top fan favorite, Flair played a major role in the New World Order (nWo) invasion storyline in late 1996 and throughout 1997. He and the other Horsemen often took the lead in the war against Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Hollywood Hulk Hogan, whom Flair immediately challenged for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at the \"Clash of the Champions XXXIII\", but won only by disqualification. In September 1996, Flair and Anderson teamed with their bitter rivals, Sting and Lex Luger, to lose to the nWo (Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and an impostor Sting) in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl when Luger submitted to the impostor Sting's Scorpion Deathlock.\n\nIn October 1996, two developments occurred that affected the Four Horsemen when Jeff Jarrett came over to WCW from the WWF, and expressed his desire to join the Horsemen as he immediately gained a fan in Ric Flair, much to the chagrin of the other Horsemen. Flair finally let Jarrett join the group in February 1997, but the others did not want him, and in July 1997 was ultimately kicked out of the group by Flair himself, who had enough of the instability Jarrett's presence caused the Horsemen. Flair also feuded with Roddy Piper, Syxx, and his old nemesis Curt Hennig in 1997, after Hennig was offered a spot in The Four Horsemen only to turn on Flair and The Four Horsemen at Fall Brawl in September 1997, in which Hennig punctuated the act by slamming the cage door onto Flair's head.\nIn April 1998, Flair disappeared from WCW television, due to a lawsuit filed by Eric Bischoff for no-showing a live episode of \"Thunder\" on April 16, 1998 in Tallahassee, Florida. After the case was settled, Flair made a surprise return on September 14, 1998 to ceremoniously reform the Four Horsemen (along with Steve McMichael, Dean Malenko, and Chris Benoit). Flair feuded with Bischoff for several months afterward. Flair repeatedly raked Eric Bischoff's eyes during this feud. This culminated in a match at Starrcade between Bischoff and Flair in December 1998, which Bischoff won after interference from Curt Hennig, a former member of the Four Horsemen. The following night in Baltimore on \"Nitro\", Flair returned and threatened to leave WCW, demanding a match against Bischoff for the presidency of the company. The match was made, and despite the nWo interfering on Bischoff's behalf Flair won and was granted the position of president of WCW. This resulted in a match at Superbrawl between Flair and Hollywood Hogan for the WCW Championship, which Flair lost after being betrayed by his own son David Flair.\n\nIn spite of his son's betrayal, Flair signed a rematch at Uncensored which was billed as a First Blood barbed wire steel cage Match against Hogan where Flair's presidency and Hogan's WCW World Heavyweight Championship were on the line. Despite being the first to bleed, Flair won the match by pinfall thanks to the bias of the referee Charles Robinson, who counted Hogan out.\n\nAs on-air WCW President, Flair began abusing his power much like Bischoff had, favoring villains over fan favorites and even awarding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship (which was vacated by Scott Steiner due to injury) to his son David and resorting to whatever means necessary to keep him as United States Heavyweight Champion. Flair eventually formed a stable of followers which included Roddy Piper, Arn Anderson and the Jersey Triad to keep things in order. Flair's reign as president came to an end on the July 19 episode of \"Nitro\", when he faced and lost to Sting for the position. During the course of the match, Sting had Flair in his Scorpion Death Lock, but with the referee knocked unconscious, no decision could be reached. A returning Eric Bischoff came to the ring and began ordering the timekeeper to ring the bell, which he eventually did, awarding the match and the presidency to Sting (who promptly gave it up upon receiving it).\n\nFlair won his last world titles in his career by winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship twice during 2000, the company's last full year of operation. When WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, Flair was the leader of the villainous group called the Magnificent Seven. Flair lost the final match of \"Nitro\" to Sting, recreating the second match of \"Nitro\" in 1995. Nevertheless, Flair has repeatedly stated in various interviews how happy he was when WCW finally closed down, although at the same time the fact that many people would lose their jobs saddened him.\n\nAfter an eight-month hiatus from wrestling, Flair made a return to the WWF in November 2001. Flair reappeared on \"Raw\" following the end of the \"WCW/ECW Invasion\" that culminated in a \"Winner Take All\" match at Survivor Series won by the WWF. Flair's new on-screen role was that of the co-owner of the WWF, with the explanation that Shane and Stephanie McMahon had sold their stock in the company to a consortium (namely Flair) prior to purchasing World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling. Flair's feud with Vince McMahon led them to a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2002 in a Street Fight, where Flair defeated McMahon. Flair also wrestled The Undertaker at WrestleMania X8 in March 2002 where Flair lost. The \"co-owner\" angle culminated in early 2002, when Flair controlled \"Raw\" and McMahon controlled \"SmackDown!\" \n\nOn the May 13 episode of \"Raw\", Flair challenged Hulk Hogan to a no disqualifications match for the WWE Undisputed Championship. Flair would later lose the contest before moving onto a rivalry with Stone Cold Steve Austin. At Judgment Day, Flair teamed with The Big Show in losing fashion as they faced Steve Austin in a two-on-one handicap tag team match. On the June 3 episode of \"Raw\", the feud between Flair and Austin would escalate after Austin defeated Flair in a singles contest. After Steve Austin abruptly left the renamed WWE in June while in a program with Flair, a match was hotshotted between Flair and McMahon for sole ownership of WWE, which Flair lost after interference from Brock Lesnar on the June 10 edition of \"Raw\".\n\nFlair's rivalry with Lesnar would continue into the month of June with Lesnar picking up wins over Flair in a singles match on the July 1 episode of \"Raw\" and in a tag team contest on the July 15 episode of \"Raw\". At King of the Ring, Flair defeated Eddie Guerrero in a singles match after Guerrero and Chris Benoit would interrupt Flair's speech regarding losing his position as WWF co-owner; afterwards, Guerrero would lock Flair in his own signature figure four leg lock with help from Benoit. Flair then became involved in a short lived rivalry with Chris Jericho, leading to Flair defeating Jericho at SummerSlam, resulting in Flair being granted a World Championship match against Triple H on the September 2 episode of \"Raw\", which he lost. Later on that same night, Flair would team with Rob Van Dam as the duo were successful in defeating the team of Triple H and Chris Jericho. At Unforgiven, Flair was unsuccessful in capturing the Intercontinental Championship in a singles contest against Jericho.\n\nIn September 2002 at Unforgiven, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Rob Van Dam. During the match, Flair came down to the ring and grabbed the sledgehammer from Triple H and teased hitting him before hitting Van Dam, allowing Triple H to get the win, turning him heel in the process and accompanied Triple H to the ring as his manager. Shortly after, Batista moved from \"SmackDown!\" to \"Raw\" and Flair also began accompanying him to the ring while continuing to second Triple H. In June 2003 at Bad Blood, Flair was able to defeat Shawn Michaels after Orton struck Michaels with a chair.\n\nAt the height of Evolution's power, the group controlled all of the male-based championships of \"Raw\" after Armageddon. Batista teamed with Flair to win the World Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a tag team turmoil match and Triple H regained the World Heavyweight Championship from Goldberg (in a triple threat match that also involved Kane), with the help of the other members. In January 2004 at the Royal Rumble, Flair and Batista successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz in a tables match, and World Heavyweight Champion Triple H fought Shawn Michaels to no contest in a Last Man Standing match, thus retaining the championship. Flair and Batista lost the World Tag Team Championship on February 16 edition of Raw to Booker T and Rob Van Dam. At WrestleMania XX, Evolution defeated the Rock 'n' Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley) in a 3-on-2 handicap match. The following week on \"Raw\" during the 2004 WWE draft lottery, Flair and Batista defeated Booker T and Rob Van Dam to win their second and final World Tag Team Championship. While still world champion, Benoit teamed with Edge to take the World Tag Team Championship from Flair and Batista on April 19 \"Raw\".\n\nAt SummerSlam, Orton pinned Benoit to become the new World Heavyweight Champion and the youngest World Champion in WWE history to date. Batista hoisted Orton on to his shoulders in what appeared to be a celebration, but following the thumbs down from Triple H, the group proceeded to attack Orton. At Unforgiven, Triple H beat Orton to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, with help from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman. Orton's feud with Evolution continued until Survivor Series where Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky, and Edge were defeated by Orton, Maven, Chris Jericho, and Chris Benoit in a Survivor Series match for control of \"Raw\" over the following month.\n\nIn the Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution, Batista, Orton and Triple H were the last three remaining in the match. Orton eliminated Batista with a RKO and Triple H pinned Orton with Batista's help to win the title. Triple H suggested that Batista not enter the Royal Rumble match, wanting the group to focus on Triple H retaining the title. Batista declined, entered the Rumble at number 28 and won. Triple H tried to persuade Batista to challenge the WWE Champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield of SmackDown! rather than for his World Heavyweight Championship. This involved Triple H plotting a feud between JBL and Batista, showing JBL badmouthing Batista in an interview and staging an attack on Batista with a limousine designed to look like Layfield's. The scheme was unsuccessful and at the brand contract signing ceremony, Batista chose to remain on Raw, infuriating Triple H and thus quitting the faction. Batista defeated Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 21.\n\nAfter Vengeance, Triple H took time off, Flair turned face for the first time since 2002 before going on to win the Intercontinental Championship, and the group was dissolved. Triple H returned at the \"Homecoming\" episode of \"Raw\" on October 3 where he was to team with Flair in a tag team match against Carlito and Chris Masters. After winning that match, Triple H betrayed Flair and attacked him with a sledgehammer. Flair retained the Intercontinental Championship against Triple H at Taboo Tuesday in a steel cage match, which was voted as such by the fans. Flair later lost to Triple H in a Last Man Standing non-title match at Survivor Series which ended their feud.\n\nAt the end of 2005, Flair had a feud with Edge that culminated in a WWE Championship Tables, Ladder and Chairs match on \"Raw\" in early 2006, which Flair lost. On the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", he lost the Intercontinental Championship to Shelton Benjamin, thus ending his reign at 155 days. Flair took some time off in mid-2006 to rest and marry for the third time and he returned in June to work a program with his real-life rival Mick Foley that played off their legitimate past animosity. Flair defeated Foley at Vengeance in a two out of three falls match, then at SummerSlam in an \"I Quit\" match.\nSubsequently, he was involved in a rivalry with the Spirit Squad on \"Raw\". On November 5, 2006 at Cyber Sunday, he captured the World Tag Team Championship from the Squad with Roddy Piper. On the November 13 episode of \"Raw\", Flair and Piper lost the Tag Titles to Rated-RKO, due to a disc problem with Piper and had to be flown immediately back to the USA as soon as \"Raw\" was off the air. On November 26, 2006 at Survivor Series, Flair was the sole survivor of a match that featured himself, Ron Simmons (replacing an injured Piper), Dusty Rhodes and Sgt. Slaughter versus the Spirit Squad. Flair then left television due to his divorce hearings.\n\nFlair then began teaming with Carlito after Flair said that Carlito had no heart. Flair defeated Carlito in a match after which Carlito realized that Flair was right. Flair and Carlito faced off against Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a number one contender's match for the World Tag Team Championship but were defeated. The two teamed up on the WrestleMania 23 pre-show, and defeated the team of Chavo Guerrero and Gregory Helms. After weeks of conflict between Flair and Carlito, the team split up when Carlito attacked Flair during a match. At Judgment Day, Flair defeated Carlito with the figure four leglock.\n\nOn the June 11 episode of \"Raw\", Flair was drafted from Raw to SmackDown! as part of the 2007 WWE draft. He briefly feuded against Montel Vontavious Porter and rejoined forces with Batista to feud with The Great Khali; the alliance was short-lived, however, as Flair was \"injured\" during a match with Khali.\n\nAfter a three-month hiatus, Flair returned to WWE programming on the November 26 episode of \"Raw\" to announce \"I will never retire\". Vince McMahon retaliated by announcing that the next match Flair lost would result in a forced retirement. Later in the night, Flair defeated Orton after a distraction by Chris Jericho. It was revealed on the 15th anniversary of \"Raw\" that the win or retire ultimatum only applied in singles matches. Flair won several \"career threatening\" matches against the opponents such as Triple H, Umaga, William Regal, Mr. Kennedy, and Vince McMahon himself among others. On March 29, 2008, Flair was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the class of 2008 by Triple H. The day after, Flair wrestled at WrestleMania XXIV in Orlando, Florida, losing to Shawn Michaels. The match was lauded by fans and critics and was voted the 2008 \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" (PWI) Match of the Year. Flair's fight to keep his career going garnered him the 2008 \"PWI\" \"Most Inspirational Wrestler of the Year\" award.\n\nOn the March 31, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Flair delivered his farewell address. Afterward, Triple H brought out many current and retired superstars to thank Flair for all he has done, including Shawn Michaels, some of the Four Horsemen, Harley Race, and Chris Jericho, followed by The Undertaker and then Vince McMahon. Along with the wrestlers, the fans gave Flair a standing ovation. This event represented a rare moment in WWE as both the heels and the faces broke character and came out to the ring together. Flair made his first post retirement appearance on the June 16, 2008 episode of \"Raw\" to confront Chris Jericho about his actions during a rivalry with Shawn Michaels. He challenged Jericho to a fight in the parking lot, rather than an official match, but Jericho was stopped by Triple H.\n\nThe following year on February 9, Flair once again confronted Jericho on \"Raw\". Jericho was attacking Hall of Fame members and Flair demanded he respect them, before punching Jericho. Flair appeared a month later to distract him during a Money in the Bank Qualifying Match. Jericho then challenged Flair to come out of retirement for WrestleMania XXV; instead Flair managed Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka and Ricky Steamboat in a three-on-one handicap match at WrestleMania in a losing effort. On May 17, Flair returned during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, coming to the aid of Batista, who was being attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase). On the June 1 episode of \"Raw\", Flair challenged Orton in a parking lot brawl match, after an interference from the rest of The Legacy, the fight ended with Flair was trapped inside a steel cage and was punted by Orton. After \"Raw\", Flair left WWE when his contract expired on June 2, 2009.\n\nFlair signed with Ring of Honor (ROH) and appeared at the \"Stylin' And Profilin\"' event in March 2009, clearing the ring after an ROH World Championship match ended with a run-in. He soon served as the company's ambassador, in an on-screen authority role, and appeared on the television show \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" in May to cement his role. After a number one contender's match ended in a time-limit draw, and the following week a double count out, Flair announced \"Ring of Honor Wrestling's\" first ROH World Title match as a four-way contest.\n\nOn November 21, 2009, Flair returned to the ring as a villain on the \"\" tour of Australia, losing to Hulk Hogan in the main event of the first show by brass knuckles. Hogan defeated Flair again on November 24 in Perth, Australia after both men bled heavily. Flair also lost to Hogan on the two remaining matches on the tour.\n\nOn the January 4, 2010 episode Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's (TNA) \"Impact!\", Flair made his debut appearance for the company arriving via limo and later observing the main event between A.J. Styles and longtime rival Kurt Angle. It was later reported that Flair had signed a one-year deal with the company. In the past, Flair has openly stated that he was loyal to the McMahons and wanted to end his career in WWE, however he had not had contact from WWE since June 2009 and decided to sign with TNA Wrestling after waiting for the call from WWE for six months. On January 17 at Genesis, Flair helped Styles cheat to pin Angle and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn addition to Styles, Flair began informally managing Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and Desmond Wolfe as a loose alliance. On the March 8 episode of \"Impact!\", Hulk Hogan and Abyss defeated Flair and Styles when Abyss pinned Styles. Afterwards, the returning Jeff Hardy saved Abyss and Hogan from a beatdown at the hands of Flair, Styles and Beer Money, Inc. At Lockdown, Team Flair (Ric Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) was defeated by Team Hogan (Hulk Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) in a Lethal Lockdown match. On the April 26 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair was defeated by Abyss in a match where Flair's and Hogan's WWE Hall of Fame rings were at stake, and as a result Flair lost possession of his ring to Hogan. The following week, Hogan gave the ring to Jay Lethal, who returned it to Flair out of respect. This, however, was not enough for Flair, who attacked Lethal along with the members of Team Flair. After Styles dropped the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Rob Van Dam, then failed to regain it in a rematch and later was pinned by Jay Lethal, Flair adopted Kazarian as his newest protégé, seemingly replacing Styles as his number one wrestler.\n\nOn the June 17 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , a group consisting of A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, and Desmond Wolfe. Flair made a return to the ring on July 11 at Victory Road, losing to Jay Lethal. On the August 5 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair faced Lethal in a rematch, this time contested under Street Fight rules, with the members of banned from ringside; Flair managed to win the match after an interference from Douglas Williams. The following week, Williams and Matt Morgan were added to . In the weeks leading to Bound for Glory, Flair's stable's name was tweaked to Fortune to represent the expansion in the number of members in the group. On the October 7 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair was defeated by Mick Foley in a Last Man Standing match.\nOn the following episode of \"Impact!\", Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan's and Eric Bischoff's new stable, Immortal. On the November 18 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair returned to the ring, competing in a match where he faced Matt Morgan, who had been kicked out of Fortune the previous month; Morgan won the match after Douglas Williams turned on the rest of Fortune, when they interfered in the match. On January 25, 2011, it was reported that Flair had pulled out of TNA's \"Maximum Wooo!\" tour of Europe mid–tour after monetary disputes. After missing a show in Berlin, Germany, Flair returned to the tour on January 27 in Glasgow, Scotland, reportedly apologizing to the locker room prior to the show. On January 29, Flair wrestled his only match of the tour, defeating Douglas Williams in London, tearing his rotator cuff in the process. During Flair's time away from TNA, Fortune turned on Immortal. Flair returned at the February 14 tapings of the February 17 episode of \"Impact!\", turning on Fortune during a match between A.J. Styles and Matt Hardy and jumping to Immortal. On the March 10 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair defeated Styles and Hardy in a three–way street fight, contested as more of a two–on–one handicap match. On April 17 at Lockdown, Immortal, represented by Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy, was defeated by Fortune members James Storm, Kazarian and Robert Roode and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J. Styles, in a Lethal Lockdown match, when Flair tapped out to Roode. The match was used to write Flair off television, as the following week he was scheduled to undergo surgery for his torn rotator cuff; however, Flair ultimately chose not to have the surgery as it would have required six months of rehab.\n\nFlair returned to television in a non–wrestling role on the May 12, 2011 episode of \"Impact!\" Flair did not appear again for three months, until making his return on August 9 at the tapings of the August 18 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", confronting old rival Sting and challenging him to one more match. In exchange for Sting agreeing to put his career on the line, Flair promised to deliver him his match with Hogan if he was victorious. The match, which Flair lost, took place on the September 15 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\". During the match, Flair tore his left triceps on a superplex spot, sidelining him indefinitely from in-ring action. at Bound for Glory (2011), Flair appeared in Hogan's corner in his match against Sting. Flair continued to make appearances for TNA until April 2012. In April 2012, Flair tried to have his TNA contract terminated, which led to TNA filing a lawsuit against WWE for contract tampering and eventually firing Flair on May 11. Having been inactive since his September 2011 injury, Flair announced in a December 3, 2012 interview that he would never wrestle again, owing chiefly to an on-air heart attack suffered by age peer Jerry Lawler following a \"Raw\" match three months earlier.\n\nOn March 31, 2012, while still contracted to TNA, Flair became the first person to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame twice, the second time as part of the class of 2012 with The Four Horsemen. On December 17, 2012, Flair returned to WWE as a non-wrestling personality on the annual Slammy Awards show to present the Superstar of the Year award to John Cena, who in turn gave the award to Flair. Flair's return was interrupted by CM Punk and Paul Heyman, escalating into a confrontation that ended with him locking Heyman in the figure-four leglock. After clearing the ring, Flair was assaulted by The Shield, until Ryback and Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) helped Flair fend off the group.\n\nFlair appeared on the main roster sporadically throughout 2013, as The Miz's mentor. He also occasionally appeared on \"NXT\" in 2013 and 2014, accompanying his daughter Charlotte to the ring.\nFlair appeared on the April 28, 2014, episode of \"Raw\", alongside the reunited Evolution (minus Flair) and The Shield; Flair showed his endorsement for The Shield, Evolution's opponents at Extreme Rules, effectively turning his back on his old teammates. On July 14, John Cena symbolically handed over his World Heavyweight Championship belt to Flair, telling him to \"take it\" while promoting his match at Battleground. On the post-SummerSlam \"Raw\" in August 2015, Flair interrupted Jon Stewart, who had saved Flair's 16 world title record by preventing Cena's victory the previous night, telling him that the record would be broken eventually and he would rather it would be by someone who he respects.\n\nFlair began making more frequent appearances with Charlotte after she won the Divas Championship. In January 2016, Flair and Charlotte began displaying villainous traits, with Flair often getting involved in Charlotte's Divas Championship and later WWE Women's Championship defenses. This lasted until the May 23, 2016 episode of \"Raw\", when Charlotte turned on him. On the November 28, 2016 episode of \"Raw\", Flair returned to congratulate the new Raw Women's Champion Sasha Banks, who had defeated Charlotte to win the title. On the November 14, 2017 edition of \"SmackDown\", Flair returned to congratulate his daughter, after she won the SmackDown Women's title from Natalya, incidentally in Charlotte's hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, this being his first appearance for WWE since nearly dying earlier in the year.\n\nFlair was often popular with the crowd due to his in-ring antics, including rulebreaking (earning him the distinction of being \"the dirtiest player in the game\"), strutting and his shouting of \"Wooooooo!\" (Flair got the inspiration from Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Great Balls of Fire\"). The \"Wooo!\" yell has since become a tribute to Flair, and is often shouted by the crowd whenever a wrestler performs a knife-edge chop, one of Flair's signature moves. It is also often shouted by the crowd whenever a wrestler utilizes Flair's figure-four leglock finisher. From the late 1970s, Flair wore ornate fur-lined robes of many colors with sequins during in-ring appearances, and since the early 1980s, his approach to the ring was usually heralded by the playing of the \"Dawn\" section of Richard Strauss' \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" (famous for being used in the 1968 motion picture \"\" and for the introduction to Elvis Presley's concerts of the 1970s). Flair also described himself as a \"limousine-ridin', jet-flyin', kiss stealin', wheelin' dealin', son-of-a-gun (who kissed all the girls worldwide and made em cry)\".\n\nOn October 19, 1998, it was declared \"Ric Flair Day\" in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Mayor Sharon Belton and on November 15, 2008, it was declared \"Ric Flair Day\" in Norfolk, Virginia. On March 24, 2008, Mayor Bob Coble, of Columbia, South Carolina, declared March 24 to be Ric Flair Day in Columbia. Flair also received the key to the city. He received the key to the city of Greensboro, North Carolina on December 5, 2008, to commemorate Flair's victory in a steel cage match against Harley Race at the inaugural Starrcade event. April 18, 2009 was declared \"Ric Flair Day\" in Charleston, West Virginia and he was presented with the key to the city by the mayor. Also, on June 12, 2009, Flair was presented with the key to the city of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and, in September, he received the key to the city in Marion County, South Carolina. On July 17, 2010, Flair made a special appearance at Scotland Motors in Laurinburg, North Carolina and received the key to that city, as well.\nOn the February 18, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Shawn Michaels announced Flair as the first inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2008. The induction ceremony took place on March 29, 2008, with Triple H inducting him. This made him the first person to be inducted while still an active competitor. Flair was later inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame in Atlanta, Georgia, but he did not participate in the event. On January 9, 2012 it was announced that the Four Horsemen would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, thus making Flair the first person to have been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice.\n\nOn April 15, 2008, Flair was honored in Congress by a representative from North Carolina, Republican Sue Myrick, who praised his career and what he means to the state. On September 29, 2008, it was announced that Flair's signature sequin covered robe that he wore at WrestleMania XXIV, in what was to be his last WWE match, would be placed in the pop culture section of the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1999, a large group of professional wrestling experts, analysts and historians named Flair the greatest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time. In 2002, Flair was named the greatest professional wrestler of all time in the book \"The Top 100 Wrestlers of All Time\" by John Molinaro, edited by Dave Meltzer and Jeff Marek. in July 2016, Luke Winkie of \"Sports Illustrated\" also named Flair the greatest professional wrestler of all time.\n\nFlair's \"Wooo\" chant has been used throughout pop culture, in hip-hop music in particular. Rapper Pusha T has paid homage to Flair in numerous songs. For example, on the track \"Sweet Serenade\", he says, \"Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Wooo!), They love me on my Ric Flair shit (Wooo!), In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Wooo!), Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)\". Rapper Killer Mike also has a track named \"Ric Flair\". Rapper Offset paid tribute to Flair in his hit song \"Ric Flair Drip\".\n\nSome have looked unfavorably upon Flair's career from the 1990s onward. In 1998, wrestler and former WCW colleague Stone Cold Steve Austin said that Flair had reached the \"time to hang it up\", having not been great for a \"long time\". John Molinaro of Slam! Sports penned a 1999 article titled, \"Ric Flair is tarnishing his legacy\"; Molinaro saw Flair as a wrestler whose prestige was \"in jeopardy\". In 2006, \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" writer Frank Ingiosi said that Flair had a \"personal vendetta against his legend\". He nevertheless continued to wrestle until retiring in 2008, at age 59. Following an elaborate farewell ceremony staged for Flair by WWE, wrestling personality Paul Heyman lamented his cutting promos at \"low rent wrestling shows\", calling it \"painful to watch\".\n\nFlair would ultimately return to the ring in 2009 and signed to wrestle for TNA the following year, breaking a vow to never again lace up his boots. Wrestler Axl Rotten, NFL writer Adam Rank, and many fans felt that he sullied his legend by continuing to wrestle in TNA. Asked in 2011 if Flair was tainting his prestige, former opponent Shane Douglas was harsher, stating that he had \"been tarnishing his legacy since 1990\". Also that year, Kevin Eck of \"The Baltimore Sun\" criticized the aging Flair for being unable to separate himself from his ostentatious gimmick when not wrestling, and said: \"I don't know what's sadder, Ric Flair tarnishing his legacy in the ring or embarrassing himself away from the ring\". Asked about Flair in 2015, wrestler The Honky Tonk Man felt that viewers would \"remember only the last years of his career\", which consist of \"bad memories\".\n\nConversely, professional wrestling announcer Jim Ross in 2012 felt that Flair had not tarnished his legacy, observing only \"passion and need to earn a living\". In 2016, Flair said continuing to wrestle in TNA was the \"number one\" regret of his career.\n\nFlair has made numerous appearances in television shows. In 1996, Flair, along with other WCW wrestlers, appeared in an episode of \"Baywatch\" as themselves. In 2013, Flair made an appearance in, \"Stuff You Should Know\", in the episode, \"Bacteriopolis\", as Dr. Roland Grayson. In 2014, Flair voiced himself in the animated series, \"Uncle Grandpa\", in the episode, \"History of Wrestling\".\n\nFlair released his autobiography, \"To Be the Man\", on July 6, 2004. The title is taken from one of his catchphrases, \"To be the man, you gotta beat the man!\".\n\nIn 2009, Flair voiced Commander Douglas Hill in the video game \"\".\n\nIt was announced on July 8, 2012, that Flair was to appear at Insane Clown Posse's 13th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos weekend as a main stage host who was in charge of announcing the performers. However, his appearance at the event was cut short after he was struck with a water bottle thrown from the crowd before announcing Tech N9ne to enter the main stage, at which point he left and did not announce Tech N9ne or go back out on the main stage to announce the remaining performers.\n\nIn 2015, Flair made his feature film debut, appearing in \"Magic Mike XXL\". From May 2015-April 2016, Flair was host of a podcast titled \"WOOOOO! Nation\". The podcast was placed on hiatus after episode 46 which was uploaded on April 1, 2016. Flair returned to podcasting on MLW Radio with a new show called \"The Ric Flair Show\" in July 2016. The final episode of \"The Ric Flair Show\" was uploaded on December 16, 2016.\n\nESPN aired \"Nature Boy\", a \"30 for 30\" documentary directed by Rory Karpf.\n\nOn October 31, 2017, hip-hop artist Offset released a single titled \"Ric Flair Drip\", which Flair made an appearance in the music video for.\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Latin trap artist Bad Bunny released a new music video entitled \"Chambea,\" on which Flair made an appearance.\n\nOn August 2, 2018, online Ticket exchange TickPick released a new commercial video entitled \"No Extra Flair,\" on which Flair stars in.\n\nFlair married his first wife, Leslie Goodman, on August 28, 1971. They had two children, daughter Megan and son David, before divorcing in 1983 after twelve years of marriage. On August 27, 1983, he married his second wife, Elizabeth Harrell. Promoter Jim Crockett Jr. served as the best man for the wedding. They had two children, daughter Ashley and son Reid. Beth also made periodic appearances in WCW between 1998 and 2000. Flair and Beth divorced in 2006 after nearly 23 years of marriage. On May 27, 2006, Flair married his third wife Tiffany VanDemark, a fitness competitor. In 2008, Tiffany filed for divorce from Flair, which was finalized in 2009. On November 11, 2009, Flair married his fourth wife, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Beems, in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2012, Flair filed for divorce from Beems, which was finalized in 2014. Flair married his fifth wife, Wendy Barlow (known as \"Fifi the Maid\" in WCW), on September 12, 2018, at a resort in Florida.\n\nFlair's son David is a semi-retired professional wrestler. Flair's younger son Reid, who signed a developmental contract with WWE near the end of 2007, was an accomplished high school wrestler and made several appearances on WCW television along with his sister Ashley and half-sister Megan. In 2004, Flair became a grandfather at the age of 55, when his older daughter, Megan Fliehr Ketzner, gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Morgan Lee Ketzner on May 9. On May 17, 2012, it was reported that Flair's daughter Ashley had signed with WWE adopting the ring name, Charlotte (which was later changed to include the Flair surname). On March 29, 2013, Reid died from an accidental overdose of heroin, Xanax and a muscle relaxer.\n\nIn December 2005, a judge issued arrest warrants for Flair after a road rage incident that took place in Charlotte, North Carolina in which Flair allegedly got out of his car, grabbed a motorist by the neck, and kicked the door off the motorist's sport utility vehicle. Flair was charged with two misdemeanors, injury to personal property and simple assault and battery. This incident was ridiculed on WWE programming, most notably by the wrestler Edge.\n\nIn September 2007, Flair opened a financial business called Ric Flair Finance. In July 2008, Flair Finance filed for bankruptcy. Following Flair's debut in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling his former employer, Ring of Honor, filed a lawsuit in 2010, alleging that Flair owed them over $40,000 and that he had not appeared at several events that he was contractually obligated to appear at. The lawsuit was never resolved.\n\nHighspots Inc. claimed that Flair had given them the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt as collateral for the loan. A warrant for Flair's arrest was issued in May 2011 for being held in contempt of court for violating the terms of his settlement with Highspots. If Flair had failed to comply he could have potentially faced 90 days in jail. On June 25, Highspots released a statement over their official Facebook page stating that someone had paid Flair's debts.\n\nAccording to Teddy Long, during his tenure in NWA, Flair had approached him backstage and asked, “Nigger, do you like working here?” Long stated that wrestlers Kevin Sullivan and Eddie Gilbert mentioned how Flair disliked the idea of him becoming manager. Retired professional wrestling executive, Jim Herd, had also spoke to Long about Flair’s dislike for him. Long would say in a separate interview how he never understood why Flair had hated him, saying he was “only doing his job.”\n\nFlair has long supported Republican political candidates in North Carolina politics. In 2000, Flair explored the possibility of running for governor of North Carolina, but he never filed the papers.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Flair declared his support for the Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. He said of Huckabee, \"[Huckabee] is a quality person, self-made, a great family man and he has a great vision for our country. And I'm here to excite the crowd\".\n\nFlair endorsed Ted Cruz during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFlair has a heart condition called alcoholic cardiomyopathy.\n\nOn August 14, 2017, Flair had surgery in Georgia to remove an obstructive piece of his bowel, which led to various complications, most seriously kidney failure, necessitating dialysis treatment and ongoing hospitalization. He was discharged from rehabilitation and allowed to return home on September 21.\n\nFlair engaged in an off-screen rivalry with Bret Hart. In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview in which he said Flair \"sucks\" and described his workplace, WCW, as \"minor league\". In Flair's autobiography, he accused Hart of over-exploiting the death of his brother Owen and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart's popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as \"plain ridiculous\" in a column written for the \"Calgary Sun\". Hart cited his headlining performances on consistently sold out tours throughout his WWF career, while alleging that Flair wrestled to near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage, both personal friends of Hart. Hart went on to criticize Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle blading. However, they have reconciled and are now friends.\n\nFlair also had a long running feud with Shane Douglas, who would refer to him as \"Dick Flair\" and accuse him of sabotaging his push in the NWA/WCW after getting a solid push and a rub from his tag team partner Ricky Steamboat. In turn, Flair responded that Douglas was always the guy that would blame his shortcomings on others. He called Douglas out as well as accused him of steroid abuse during a broadcast of the Internet radio show \"WCW Live!\" in which he said that he would meet him anytime and anywhere if he would \"take the needle out of his ass\".\n\nFlair has also had problems with Mick Foley. In his 1999 autobiography \"\", Foley said that \"Flair was every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it\". This was in reference to how poorly Foley thought he was booked during his WCW career when Flair was on the booking committee. Flair responded in his autobiography by writing: \"I do not care how many thumbtacks Mick Foley has fallen on, how many ladders he's fallen off, how many continents he's supposedly bled on, he will always be known as a glorified stuntman\". However, they have reconciled and are now friends.\n\nIn his book, Flair also touched on some real-life tension between himself and Hulk Hogan which largely stemmed from an incident that followed the conclusion of a tag team match between Flair and his son David and the team of Curt Hennig and Barry Windham at WCW's Souled Out pay-per-view on January 17, 1999, in Charleston, West Virginia. However, Flair has stated that he and Hogan remained friends despite their differences.\n\nFlair and wrestler Bruno Sammartino had a real-life disagreement over what reports call \"the infamous backstage snub\" where Flair claims that Sammartino refused to shake his hand at a live event. While Flair claims Sammartino ignored him due to comments made in his book, stating Sammartino was \"a Northeast star who couldn’t draw fans outside New York\", Sammartino referred to Flair as a \"liar\" and stating: \"No, I don't respect Ric Flair. I don't respect him at all\". They reconciled and were friends until Sammartino's passing in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of Richard Prosser, the Birmingham, England, engineer and inventor. R. B. Prosser was educated at University College School, London where he was a fellow pupil of Joseph Chamberlain.\n\nRichard Prosser was heavily involved with the introduction of the Patent Law Amendment Act 1852, and his 700-volume library, combined with that of Bennet Woodcroft,(1803-1879) formed the basis of the Patent Office Library, which opened on 5 March 1854.\n\nRichard Prosser died in 1854; in 1856 R. B. Prosser joined the Office of the Commissioners of Patents, London, where he later rose to become Chief Examiner. He was forced to retire early, in 1888, because of partial blindness, but continued to take an active part in local government and church life in St Pancras, London, where he lived. He was much involved in national Church of England organisations. He married Anne Ostell, daughter of William Ostell of Bloomsbury, London; she died in 1911. They had a daughter and three sons.\n\nR. B. Prosser was greatly interested in technical history, and in particular the biographies of inventors. This was due to his work on patents, where he needed to be able to assess the priority of them - a knowledge of patents history was vital for this. He wrote 58 lives for the Dictionary of National Biography, and supplied much material for the New English Dictionary. Prosser also wrote \"Birmingham Inventors and Inventions\", 1881, in a limited edition of 50 copies. This was a cumulation of notes he had published earlier in the \"Birmingham Gazette\". A similar work on Manchester inventors was never finished. His 315 contributions to 'St Pancras Notes and Queries' in the \"St. Pancras Guardian\" between 3 February 1897 and 2 January 1903 were later published in a book of 150 copies. He was a frequent contributor to Notes and Queries, as well as to technical periodicals. Prosser had in mind to write a history of invention, written around the abstracts of British Patent Specifications, but the project never got further than the planning stage.\n\nProsser died, aged 79. His library was dispersed by auction, and his files of biographical notes were sold for about £50. They surfaced again in the 1970s, to be bought by the British Library, Dept of Manuscripts, Add Ms 54,496 - 54,507. They comprise 24 volumes and cover over 1600 names. More of Prosser's papers are in Birmingham and Manchester reference libraries, having been presented either by himself in his lifetime or by his family after his death. The on-line catalogue of the National Archives lists small collections of Prosser's papers for patentees in the South West of England, Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. These might be part of his history of inventions project, noted above.\n\nProsser was a pioneer of the study of technical history, and his published biographies and manuscript records are an incomparable source for present-day researchers.\n\n"}

Han defectors played a very important role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were often given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General Li Yongfang 李永芳 after he surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchu in 1618. The offspring of Li received the \"Third Class Viscount\" () title. In retaliation, a year later, a Ming punitive force of about 100,000 men, which included Korean and Yehe troops, approached Nurhaci's Manchus along four different routes. The Manchus scored successive victories, the most famous of which was near the town of Sarhu. The Ming dynasty was wearied by a combination of internal strife and constant harassment by the Manchu.\n\nOn May 26, 1644, Beijing fell to a peasant rebel army led by Li Zicheng. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City.

{"id": "59021219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59021219", "title": "Shrouds of the Somme", "text": "Shrouds of the Somme\n\nShrouds of the Somme is an artwork by British artist Rob Heard which commemorates the 72,396 servicemen from the British Commonwealth with no known grave, whose names are recorded at Thiepval Memorial as missing presumed dead at the Battle of the Somme. It is estimated that more than three million men fought in the battle, and more than one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the bloodiest battles in human history. \n\nThe work comprises 72,396 small human figurines, each separately wrapped in a calico shroud which was cut and sewn by hand. The full installation was laid out at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park from 8 to 18 November 2018, over the centenary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the First World War.\n\nHeard started the work after suffering injuries to his hands in a car accident in 2013 which prevented him continuing with his earlier artworks. He was inspired by injured British servicemen returning from Afghanistan, and the difficulty to envision the 19,240 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, on 1 July 1916. The shrouded figures draw in part from the films of Ridley Scott, and presents a tangible three dimensional representation of each dead soldier and of the scale of the casualties. \n\nDetermined to make each figure an individual, each shroud covers a plastic figurine approximately long (approximately 1:6 scale); the figurines are jointed so each can take its own slightly different position. The calico shrouds are cut by hand, wrapped around the figure, and then sewn up and tied on. As he worked, Heard crossed off a name from the official list of the missing for each shrouded figure he completed, creating a relationship between that figure and a specific person. Heard built a shed in his garden in Somerset to assemble and store the shrouded figures. He received early financial support from songwriter Steve Knightley, Exeter City Council, and the Exeter Chiefs Foundation.\n\nAfter completing and exhibiting 19,240 shrouded figures, Heard resolved to expand the work by adding another 60,000 figures to represent all 72,396 Commonwealth soldiers missing during the 5 months of the Battle of the Somme, from 1 July and 18 November 1916. He aimed to complete the work for the centenary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the First World War. Heard's work was supported by a team including Shrouds of the Somme committee chairman Commodore Jake Moores, project director Mel Bradley, and (from June 2017) project patron Jim Carter. Completing the work took approximately 13,000 hours, working almost continuously on this project over the five years from 2013 to the centenary of the end of the First World War in 2018, finishing only days before the completed work went on display in London. Support was received from a number of organisations, including VolkerFitzpatrick, DHL, West Ham United F.C., Westfield Group, Network Rail, Transport for London and Waitrose.\n\nAn assemblage of 19,240 shrouded figures was laid out by soldiers from the 6th battalion of The Rifles and exhibited in Exeter for the centenary of the Battle of the Somme in July 2016, attracting over 60,000 visitors. The assemblage was then exhibited in Bristol for Remembrance Sunday, in November 2016. \n\nThe extended work was laid out as \"The Trench\" in Exeter in June 2018, with approaching 72,000 models stacked in high wooden frames to create a replica trench about long that the public could walk through. The names of the missing were listed on the outside of the frames.\n\nAfter displays in Salisbury, Exeter, Belfast, Bristol in the UK, and at Thiepval in France, the full installation was laid out at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, in Stratford, East London, in November 2018, with all 72,396 models placed on a lawn in strictly regimented rows by volunteers from the 1st battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment. The shrouds took three days to put in place, covering an area of on the South Park Lawn near the ArcelorMittal Orbit. It was described by the historian Dan Snow as \"the most remarkable First World War commemoration you will ever see\".\n\nDisplayed alongside the main installation was \"Lost Lives\", a separate display of 1,561 shrouds, one for each day of the First World War, with each shrouded figure accompanied by a cross listing the number of Commonwealth war casualties on that day. Posters with copies of the official list of the missing were displayed nearby. During the exhibition, volunteers recited names from the list.\n\nThe installation went on public display from Thursday 8 to Sunday 18 November, with free entry. A memorial service was held on Sunday 11 November 2018, led by Reverend Canon Flora Winfield. The exhibition was visited by Anne, Princess Royal on Thursday 15 November. \n\nDonations were collected for SSAFA - the Armed Forces charity, and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The models will be sold for £35 each, with proceeds also donated to those two charities.\n"}
{"id": "655575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=655575", "title": "Sting (wrestler)", "text": "Sting (wrestler)\n\nSteve Borden (born March 20, 1959), better known by the ring name Sting, is an American retired professional wrestler, actor, author and former bodybuilder. He is currently signed with WWE under a Legends contract.\n\nSting is known for his time spent as the public face of two major professional wrestling promotions: the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which displaced the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as the leading professional wrestling organization in the United States from 1995 to 1998, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Borden is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, having cultivated a legacy over a career spanning more than three decades in which he held 15 world championships.\n\nSting's 14-year tenure with WCW and its predecessor, Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), began in 1987. Dubbed \"The Franchise of WCW\", he held a total of 15 championships in the promotion – including the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on six occasions, the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one occasion – and made more pay-per-view (PPV) appearances for the company than any other wrestler. Sting has been described as the WCW counterpart to the WWF's Hulk Hogan. Against Hogan, Sting headlined the highest-grossing PPV event in WCW history at Starrcade in December 1997. Upon the acquisition of WCW by the WWF in March 2001, Sting and his long-term rival Ric Flair were chosen to perform in the main event of the final episode of \"Nitro\".\n\nFollowing the expiration of his contract with WCW's parent company, AOL Time Warner, in March 2002, Borden held talks with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion and instead toured internationally with World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) – winning the WWA World Heavyweight Championship – before joining the then-upstart TNA in 2003. Over the following 11 years, he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one further occasion and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship four times, as well as being the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2012. He is the only man to hold the NWA, WCW (WWA and WCW International, additionally) and TNA world championships in a career. Previously described by WWE as the greatest wrestler never to have performed for that promotion, Sting finally joined the company in 2014, making his first appearance at Survivor Series and having his debut match at WrestleMania 31 the following year. His last ever bout at Night of Champions in September 2015, marked his sole WWE pay-per-view main event and WWE World Heavyweight Championship contest for the organization. Sting headlined the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2016 on April 2, where he announced his retirement. His induction renders him the first performer to be inducted into both the WWE and TNA Hall of Fame, as well as the second man to be inducted while an active WWE wrestler, after Ric Flair.\n\nSting held 25 total championships throughout his career, including 21 between WCW and TNA. Readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" named him \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" on four occasions, a record he shares with John Cena. In 2016, Sting was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. Slam! Sports wrote that he holds \"a lofty level of prestige that few will ever touch\".\n\nBorden was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Southern California. He played competitive football and basketball in high school and later embarked on a career in bodybuilding, once co-owning a Gold's Gym health club. Borden had no interest in professional wrestling and no television access to it within his home community, but decided to pursue a career in the industry after being taken to an \"incredible\" World Wrestling Federation (WWF) event in Los Angeles where he saw Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik, The British Bulldogs, André the Giant and others perform.\n\nBorden, originally wrestling under the ring name Flash, teamed with Jim \"Justice\" Hellwig as two members of Power Team USA in independent All-California Championship Wrestling. Power Team USA was a four-man unit also featuring Garland \"Glory\" Donahoe and Mark \"Commando\" Miller, plus manager Rick Bassman. Hellwig and Borden later moved to the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), a wrestling company based in Memphis, Tennessee and became known as the Freedom Fighters. Fans were slow to respond to the lumbering hulks, so the team turned heel. The Freedom Fighters left the CWA after an uneventful run, the highlight of which was an angle in which they broke the leg of veteran wrestler Phil Hickerson.\n\nThe duo surfaced in the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), an organization run by Bill Watts and based in Shreveport, Louisiana where they were known as the Blade Runners. Borden changed his ring name from Flash to Sting, while Hellwig became known as Rock. They soon joined Hotstuff & Hyatt International, a heel stable headed by \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert and Missy Hyatt. Together with \"Russian\" wrestler Kortsia Korchenko, the Blade Runners became henchmen in Gilbert's on-screen feud with Watts. Hellwig, who would later become The Ultimate Warrior in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), left the promotion in mid-1986, leaving Sting without a partner. Sting won the UWF World Tag Team Championship twice with Gilbert in 1986 and a third time with Rick Steiner in 1987.\n\nFollowing a match against Terry Taylor in mid-1987, Gilbert interfered on Taylor's behalf, costing Sting the match. Taylor and Gilbert ganged up on Sting until Gentleman Chris Adams came to Sting's aid. Adams cleared the ring and then asked Sting if he was with him or against him in his feud with Taylor and Gilbert. Sting turned face by declaring his allegiance to Adams.\n\nBehind the scenes, Gilbert endorsed Borden by telling a dirt sheet that Sting would be a megastar in the future. Later that year, Sting was tabbed to win the UWF Television Championship, then held by Gilbert, until Jim Crockett of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) bought the company from Watts. Crockett's booker, Dusty Rhodes, decided to put the Television title on Taylor to set up a feud between Taylor and NWA Television Champion Nikita Koloff to unify the two titles. Rhodes used then-unknown Shane Douglas as the transitional champion from Gilbert to Taylor because Rhodes did not want to diminish Sting's growing stardom with a brief title run.\n\nSometime after Sting's arrival to the NWA in July 1987, Dusty Rhodes used the opening bout of Crockett's first foray into pay-per-view, Starrcade '87, to showcase the young superstar. Sting partnered with Michael P.S. Hayes and Jimmy Garvin in a six-man tag team match against Gilbert, Steiner, and Larry Zbyszko that ended in a 15-minute time-limit draw.\n\nHaving established himself as a rising star, Sting was one of the few UWF alumni to be pushed in the NWA. At the inaugural Clash of the Champions in March 1988, Sting challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The match ended in a draw after the 45-minute time limit expired and the ringside judges could not declare a winner. Sting lost to Flair in several non-televised rematches following the Clash and, later that year, battled other members of Flair's stable, the Four Horsemen. Sting teamed with Koloff at The Great American Bash in July 1988 to challenge Horsemen Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship; Blanchard and Anderson retained the titles when the match ended in a 20-minute time-limit draw.\n\nRhodes continued to book Sting in title matches throughout the year against both NWA United States Champion Barry Windham and NWA Television Champion Mike Rotunda. In the fall of 1988, Sting was attacked by Hawk and Animal of The Road Warriors after a televised match. Rhodes, as booker, identified Sting as the face who was most over with the fans, despite knowing that turning the Road Warriors heel would be no easy task. Rhodes himself teamed with Sting to challenge the Road Warriors for the tag team championship at Starrcade '88 that December. Rhodes and Sting got the win by disqualification, allowing the Road Warriors to retain the titles.\n\nSting returned to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's Omni on New Year's Day. He would also have his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), with his most notable match in AJPW against Dan Spivey on January 25. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March. Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as The Iron Sheik. In mid-1989, The Great Muta challenged Sting at The Great American Bash. The match was booked with a classic, controversial Dusty finish even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the three-count and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder was up at the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant. Sting and Muta battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, but they always ended in disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, Muta won a No Disqualification match against Sting at a live event in September by using a blackjack to get the win and the title.\n\nIn the main event of that year's Great American Bash, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Terry Funk, who was a member of Gary Hart's J-Tex Corporation. After Flair got the victory, he was attacked by Funk's stablemate, Muta. Sting came to the aid of his old rival Flair, and the two feuded with Muta and Funk for the rest of the summer and fall, culminating in a Thunderdome Cage match between the two teams, which Flair and Sting won, at Halloween Havoc '89. The alliance with Flair resulted in Sting joining the newly reformed and now-face Four Horsemen along with the Andersons, Arn and Ole (kayfabe cousins). Sting finished out the year by winning a four-man round-robin Iron Man tournament at Starrcade '89. In the final match of the night, Sting defeated Flair to accumulate the necessary points to win the tournament. The victory made Sting the number one contender for Flair's NWA World title, leading to tension within the Four Horsemen.\n\nSting was summarily dismissed from The Four Horsemen on February 6, 1990, at after refusing to relinquish his title shot against Flair, thus restarting their rivalry. Later that evening, Borden suffered a legitimate knee injury while interfering in a steel cage match featuring the Horsemen. Borden's injury forced the bookers of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the dominant promotion in the NWA, to find a new opponent for Flair for the forthcoming WrestleWar pay-per-view event.\n\nLex Luger was chosen to challenge Flair at WrestleWar. During the match between Flair and Luger, Sting came down to motivate Luger to come back and beat Flair. Before this Sting and Luger had been at odds. When Luger was close to winning Sting was attacked by Ole Anderson. Luger opted to save the already injured Sting and ended up losing the match by countout while assisting his friend. Behind the scenes, WCW officials had wanted Flair to drop the title to Luger at WrestleWar, but Flair refused, saying he had promised Borden he would hold the title until Borden could return to the ring. Despite the injury, Sting was still utilized on television and pay per views when necessary.\n\nAt the Capital Combat event in May, Sting was accosted by the Four Horsemen and thrown into a metal cage at ringside. In a promotional crossover, Sting was rescued by his buddy RoboCop. After Borden's recovery, Sting finally defeated Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on July 7, 1990, at The Great American Bash. Sting went on to feud with title contenders Flair and Sid Vicious. Vicious appeared to defeat Sting in a title match at the 1990 Halloween Havoc, but the \"Sting\" that Vicious pinned was revealed to be an impostor played by Horseman Barry Windham. The real Sting appeared soon after and pinned Vicious to retain his title after the match was restarted.\n\nDuring Sting's title run, a masked man known as The Black Scorpion would taunt and attack Sting on many occasions. This feud culminated in a final showdown between Sting and The Black Scorpion at Starrcade: Collision Course in December. The cage match ended with Sting pinning and unmasking the Scorpion, who turned out to be Flair in disguise.\n\nSting's first world championship reign ended January 11, 1991, when Flair defeated him in a rematch from Starrcade. In the same month, WCW seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance, in the process recognizing a WCW World Heavyweight Championship and a WCW World Tag Team Championship. Sting then took part in what many consider to be the best match of 1991, teaming with Luger to face The Steiner Brothers at the SuperBrawl I pay-per-view for the world tag-team titles. The Steiners won by pinfall after Koloff, who had been feuding with Luger, interfered in the match by swinging a chain at Luger but hitting Sting instead. Consequently, Sting feuded with Koloff throughout the summer of 1991. In August 1991, Sting defeated Steve Austin to win a tournament for the vacated WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Sting held the title for 86 days before losing it to Rick Rude at Clash of the Champions XVII.\n\nAt Starrcade '91, Sting won the first-ever Battlebowl battle royal, for which he received a Battlebowl championship ring. Sting then became embroiled in a feud with the Dangerous Alliance, headed by manager Paul E. Dangerously. The stable targeted Sting because he was the so-called \"franchise\" of WCW, and the Alliance vowed to destroy both Sting and the promotion he was the face of. At the same time, Sting was being targeted by Luger, who had once again turned heel and, as WCW Champion, viewed Sting as a threat. Sting engaged in many matches with Dangerous Alliance members, especially Rude, who was the group's biggest star. It was during this feud that Sting won the first of his six WCW World Heavyweight Championships, defeating Luger on February 29, 1992, at SuperBrawl II. The feud ended when Sting formed Sting's Squadron, consisting of allies Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes, Windham, and Koloff, and defeated the Alliance (Rude, Austin, Arn Anderson, Zbyszko, and Bobby Eaton) in a WarGames match at WrestleWar in May 1992. Dave Meltzer awarded the match his highest rating of five stars.\n\nNear the end of Sting's battles with the Dangerous Alliance, the seeds were sown for what became arguably one of the most famous feuds of Sting's career. Sting defended his WCW World title on April 12, 1992, at The Omni in Atlanta against the 450-pound Big Van Vader. During the match, Vader splashed Sting, cracking three of Sting's ribs and rupturing his spleen. Sting recovered and defended his title on July 12 against Vader at The Great American Bash, dropping the belt to Big Van Vader after missing a Stinger Splash, hitting his head on the ringpost, and receiving a powerbomb. After beating Cactus Jack in a Falls Count Anywhere Match at Beach Blast and WCW newcomer Jake Roberts in a Coal Miner's Glove match at Halloween Havoc, Sting defeated Vader, who had lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in August, in the \"King of Cable\" tournament final at Starrcade.\n\nThe Sting-Vader feud continued into 1993, with Vader, who was again WCW World Heavyweight Champion, defeating Sting in a bloody Strap match at SuperBrawl III. Sting exacted revenge by beating Vader for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on March 11 in London, England, but lost it back to Vader six days later in Dublin, Ireland. Sting then teamed with WCW newcomer Davey Boy Smith to beat the team of Vader and Vicious at Beach Blast in a match that was set up by a mini-movie in which an evil midget blew up Sting's boat. At the end of 1993, Sting was one of the first people to congratulate Flair, who had just returned from the World Wrestling Federation, after his WCW World Heavyweight Title victory over Vader at Starrcade.\n\nSting feuded with Vader and Rude through the first half of 1994. Sting won the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship from Rude in April. Rude recaptured the title on May 1 at Wrestling Dontaku 1994 in Japan, but the decision was reversed because Rude had allegedly hit Sting with the title belt during the match; this was to cover for a real-life back injury Rude sustained in the match that forced Rude into retirement. Sting refused to have the title handed to him and instead defeated Vader for the vacant WCW International World Heavyweight Championship at Slamboree. Soon afterward, Flair defeated Sting in a title unification match at \"Clash of the Champions XXVII\", turning heel in the final moments of the match when Sensuous Sherri turned on Sting and took Flair's side. Sting spent the second half of 1994 and most of 1995 teaming with new arrival Hulk Hogan in his battles against Kevin Sullivan's Three Faces of Fear and its successor stable, The Dungeon of Doom.\n\nAt The Great American Bash 1995, Sting defeated Meng to win another tournament for the WCW United States Championship. Sting defeated Meng in a rematch for the title at Bash at the Beach 1995. Sting was on the first ever \"Monday Nitro\" in a match where Flair defeated Sting by disqualification as a result of a run-in by Arn Anderson to attack Flair. At Fall Brawl, Sting teamed with Hogan, Luger, and Randy Savage to defeat the Dungeon of Doom, consisting of Kamala, Zodiac, Shark and Meng, in the event's WarGames match. In October 1995, Flair convinced Sting to team with him in a match against Anderson and Brian Pillman at Halloween Havoc. Anderson and Pillman had attacked Flair earlier in the night, rendering Flair unable to come out for the first part of the match. Sting fended off his opponents until Flair emerged. Later in the match, Flair turned on Sting and reformed the Four Horsemen with Anderson and Pillman, later adding Chris Benoit to fill out the group.\n\nSting defeated Flair on a subsequent \"Nitro\" with the Scorpion Deathlock, refusing to let go until Luger persuaded him to do so. Sting defeated Flair again at the World War 3 pay-per-view. Later in the night, Sting competed in the World War 3 battle royal for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Savage. Sting's alliances with Hogan and Savage led the Horsemen to attack them as well. Sting's second U.S. title reign lasted until November 13, when he was defeated by Kensuke Sasaki in Japan. At Starrcade, Sting defeated Sasaki, representing New Japan Pro Wrestling, in a non-title match to win the World Cup of Wrestling for WCW. In the next match that night, Sting lost a Triangle match involving Flair and Luger; Flair won by countout to become number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Flair won from Savage in the next match.\n\nEarly in 1996, Sting's appearance started to change: he grew longer, darker hair, replacing his blond flattop haircut, and he often wore black tights with a multi-colored scorpion, although he occasionally wore his colorful ones and maintained his colorful face paint. Sting teamed with his old friend Luger, who had returned to WCW from WWF in September 1995, despite Luger's standing as a heel. The duo beat Harlem Heat for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the January 22 edition of \"Nitro\". The team often retained the championship as a result of Luger's cheating tactics, to which Sting remained oblivious. When Luger was temporarily unavailable for WCW Uncensored in March, Harlem Heat member Booker T teamed up with Sting to successfully prevent the title from changing hands. Sting and Booker T developed a mutual respect that showed itself when Sting and Luger granted Harlem Heat a rematch. During the Tag title run, Sting received a World title shot against The Giant at Slamboree in May, but lost after accidental interference from Luger. Harlem Heat eventually won the titles back on the June 24 edition of \"Nitro\".\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Sting was the first to stand up to The Outsiders: Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, who had recently competed in the WWF and whose alliances and agenda were unclear, had been infiltrating and causing chaos at WCW events. Sting teamed with Luger and Savage to defend WCW against Hall, Nash, and a mysterious third Outsider to be revealed at the Bash at the Beach. Hall and Nash started the bout without their third partner, but the WCW's temporary three-on-two advantage was short-lived: Luger left the match after he was accidentally injured by a mistimed Stinger Splash. The two-on-two match continued while Hogan, who had been a fan favorite for nearly fifteen years, emerged at ringside. Hogan appeared ready to back up the WCW wrestlers until he attacked Savage with his leg drop finisher in one of wrestling's most famous swerves. The match was ruled a no-contest, and Hall, Nash, and Hogan declared a new world order in professional wrestling. The name stuck and Sting became one of WCW's stalwarts against the New World Order, or nWo for short.\n\nAs part of this, Sting and Luger went up to rivals and Four Horsemen members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson some time after Bash at the Beach and asked them to team with him, saying that they needed to put aside their differences for the good of WCW. Flair and Anderson agreed and the four wrestlers composed Team WCW for the annual WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September 1996. They would be facing the nWo's team of Hall, Nash, Hogan, and a fourth member yet to be determined. On the \"Nitro\" prior to the event, however, the nWo played a trick on WCW claiming that Sting was joining their side. A vignette was shown where the nWo had a recording of Sting's voice playing in its limousine as Luger was being lured into the parking lot. Once he was there a man dressed as Sting, played by Jeff Farmer, attacked him and the crowd at home was led to believe that Sting had joined up with the nWo and would be their fourth man against what was now a three-man WCW team. Sting, however, was not at that edition of \"Nitro\" and showed up at Fall Brawl just as his teammates declared that they would face the nWo by themselves. Sting told Luger that he did not attack him, but Luger refused to believe him. Later, during the match, Sting entered as the fourth and final man for Team WCW, after the impostor Sting had entered for the nWo. Once in the ring, Sting immediately took out all four members of the nWo. He then stopped, turned to Luger, and angrily said to him, \"Is that good enough for you right there? Is that proof enough?\" Sting then gave Luger an obscene gesture and walked out of the match, leaving Team WCW at a four-on-three disadvantage which they did not overcome. The next night on \"Nitro\", Sting came out unannounced during the middle of the show with no music or entrance pyrotechnics. He entered the ring and, with his back turned to the camera side of the audience, launched into an angry tirade about what had transpired over the last week: \n\nDeclaring he would be \"popping in from time to time\" afterwards, Sting threw the microphone down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, to take part in the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated Masahiro Chono in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by Shiro Koshinaka. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of \"Nitro\", Sting returned for the first time since the night after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling Mr. JL, Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks around his eyes. He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the Scorpion Death Drop inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, Ted DiBiase and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a \"cheap imitation,\" before telling the nWo, \"the \"real\" Sting may or may not be in your price range,\" and then concluded by saying \"the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure\". With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on mic) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a baseball bat as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white corpse paint. Sting's new gimmick was inspired by the 1994 film \"The Crow\". In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on QVC Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from \"The Crow\". Sting maintains aspects of his \"Crow\" persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint.\n\nIn a series of unusual loyalty tests over the next months, Sting would confront a WCW wrestler in the ring and shove the wrestler several times with his bat until the wrestler was provoked enough to advance on him. Then Sting would draw the weapon back as if he were going to assault him, causing the wrestler to stop. Sting would hand the bat to the offended wrestler and turn his back, offering the wrestler a chance at retaliation. When the wrestler hesitated or declined, Sting would nod, retrieve the bat and leave the ring. In January 1997, a \"blackballed\" Randy Savage returned to WCW for the first time since Halloween Havoc and aligned himself with Sting as a \"free agent\" as he refused to join the nWo although WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, also one of the leaders of the nWo, declared he would not be allowed back in WCW if he didn't. For the next few weeks the two were seen in the rafters together and coming to the ring together. This story, however, petered out at SuperBrawl VII in February; Sting and Savage had come to the ring together to watch Roddy Piper face Hogan in a match for the WCW world title. As Sting left, Savage went to the ring and helped Hogan win the match, thus going back on his word and joining the nWo. Over the next couple weeks, Sting would accompany the nWo, indicating that he too joined the group. However, at WCW Uncensored in March 1997, as the nWo celebrated a victory in the main event battle royal which guaranteed them title shots whenever they desired with their newest recruit, Chicago Bulls NBA star Dennis Rodman, Sting rappelled from the roof of the arena on a vertical zip-line. When Hall and Nash went to approach him, Sting attacked them and Randy Savage when he tried to intervene, revealing his allegiance to WCW.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, Sting frequently rappelled from the rafters or came up through the ring to attack unsuspecting nWo members, came to the aid of wrestlers once subjected to his loyalty test as they battled the nWo, and employed decoy \"Stings\" to play mind games with the nWo during the closing segments of \"Nitro\". Sting's appearances to fight the nWo at the end of almost every \"Nitro\" helped WCW keep and widen its television ratings advantage over the WWF's Monday Night Raw throughout the summer. On-screen WCW commissioner James J. Dillon tried many times to get Sting to return to wrestling by making contracts to fight various nWo members. Sting, however, did not accept any of the contracts, often tearing them up in Dillon's face. A confused Dillon then asked Sting who he wanted on one edition of \"Nitro\", and Sting went out to ringside, picked up a fan's sign, and pointed out one name on it: Hogan. Eventually Sting got his wish and he and Hogan finally met in December at Starrcade for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The finish of the match was supposed to echo the Montreal Screwjob finish that the WWF had used to double cross Bret Hart just one month earlier at their annual Survivor Series event. Nick Patrick, the referee for the contest, was supposed to execute a fast count on Sting while Hart, whose signing with WCW was the linchpin for the Montreal Screwjob, would come out to protest the decision and, since he had already served as the guest referee for the match between Larry Zbyszko and Eric Bischoff earlier that evening, order the match to be restarted and Sting would emerge victorious by forcing Hogan to submit to the Scorpion Death Lock. However, Patrick did not do his part properly and instead counted the pin at normal speed, which added an unintentional level of controversy to the finish.\n\nThe next night on \"Nitro\", Hogan protested the decision claiming that Patrick's decision should have been considered final and a rematch was granted. The match ran over \"Nitro's\" allotted time slot and the finish was aired later in the week on the inaugural episode of \"Thunder\". Similar to the Starrcade result, two different referees declared the two different men as the winner. Later that night, Dillon vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, forcing Sting to surrender the belt. Sting responded with his first words (on mic) since October 1996 when he told Dillon, \"You've got no guts!\" Sting turned to Hogan and said, \"And you... You're a dead man!\".\n\nAs 1998 began, the nWo began to splinter. Sting recaptured the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship in February at SuperBrawl VIII with the help of Savage, who was beginning to split from the nWo. Sting went on to successfully defend the title against the likes of Hall, Nash, and Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). Like Savage, Nash began to pull away from the Hogan-dominated nWo, and Nash helped Savage beat Sting for the championship at Spring Stampede in April. Nash and Savage officially split from the original nWo on May 4, forming the face group nWo Wolfpac, while Hogan's heel faction became identified as nWo Hollywood. The two nWo factions vied for Sting's allegiance, with Sting's friends The Giant joining nWo Hollywood and Luger joining nWo Wolfpac. Sting seemed to have joined nWo Hollywood when he appeared wearing a black and white nWo shirt, but he soon tore off the shirt to reveal the red and black of the nWo Wolfpac. Sting began wearing red and black face paint and tights as a member of nWo Wolfpac.\n\nSting and The Giant won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree in May when Hall turned on his teammate Nash. Sting and The Giant also split, and the team was forced to vacate the title 18 days later. Sting then defeated The Giant at The Great American Bash in June to take control of the Tag Team titles and chose Nash as his partner. Throughout the summer, Sting and fellow nWo Wolfpac members Nash, Luger, and Konnan feuded with Hogan and nWo Hollywood. Sting also got involved in a feud with Bret Hart over their similar finishing holds, the Sharpshooter and the Scorpion Deathlock. Hart cost Sting and Nash the Tag titles by interfering in their match with Hall and The Giant on the July 20 \"Nitro\". Sting and Hart squared off at Halloween Havoc, where Hart, the United States Champion, attacked Sting with a baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for several months.\n\nSting returned to \"Nitro\" in March 1999, sporting the black and white \"Crow\"-inspired attire he debuted in 1996 and began to participate in more mic work. By this time, the nWo storyline had faded, and Sting was not aligned with any of its factions. Sting competed in the main event of April's Spring Stampede, a Four Corners match for the World Championship, against Hogan, DDP, and champion Flair. Savage served as special guest referee and delivered a diving elbow drop to help DDP win the match and the title.\n\nSting defeated Page on the April 26 edition of \"Nitro\" to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship for the fifth time. Later that night, Sting defended the title in a four-way match featuring DDP, Goldberg, and a returning Nash. DDP pinned Nash, allowing DDP to win the title without directly beating Sting. Sting's 90-minute reign was only the second shortest WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign in WCW history. Sting lost to Rick Steiner in a Falls Count Anywhere match at The Great American Bash after he was attacked by Steiner's three pet dogs backstage and Steiner forced the referee to prematurely declare himself the victor, claiming his dogs had pinned Sting for him.\n\nOver the next several months, Sting feuded with Goldberg, Rick Steiner, Vicious, and Savage. Sting teamed with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Nash at the Bash at the Beach in July to take on Vicious and Savage of Team Madness. Savage pinned Nash and won the World title as a result. Hogan returned from injury on July 12 as a face to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Flair on the July 19 edition of \"Nitro\" to become the on-screen president of WCW. Later that night, Nash turned heel by attacking Hogan during a title defense against Vicious. Sting remained president for just one week and used his power to book a main event pitting Hogan and himself against Nash and Vicious. Sting vacated the presidency the following week because he only wanted Flair out of the position rather than wanting the power for himself. Along with Goldberg, Sting and Hogan feuded with Nash, Vicious and Rick Steiner for the next month.\n\nSting began to question Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in the weeks leading up to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.\n\nSting entered the 32-man tournament that was set up to award the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Brian Knobs, Meng, and Luger to reach the semi-finals to be held at WCW Mayhem. At the November event, Sting lost to Hart, the eventual winner of the tournament. After the match, Sting shook hands with Hart in a sign of respect, turning face again. Sting sought revenge against Luger the next month at Starrcade. Sting won by disqualification when Luger and Elizabeth assaulted Sting with a steel chair and baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for some time. Sting ended his feud with Luger by defeating him in a Lumberjacks with Casts match at Uncensored 2000 the following March.\n\nWCW officials Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff, in an attempt to save the fading company, rebooted the storylines on April 10, 2000, and declared all titles vacant. At Spring Stampede 2000 the following week, Sting advanced to the finals of the United States Championship tournament by defeating Booker T and Vampiro in the first two rounds. Vampiro cost Sting the championship in the finals against Scott Steiner, leading to an intense feud between Sting and Vampiro. Sting pinned Vampiro at Slamboree 2000 in May, and Vampiro beat Sting in a Human Torch match at The Great American Bash the next month; for the climax of the match, Borden switched with a stuntman, who was set on fire and thrown off the top of the frame of the stage's entrance video screen. At Bash at the Beach 2000, he returned wearing another Sting mask as men wearing cloaks and Sting masks carried him in a casket, and then he attacked Vampiro.\n\nSting went on to feud with Jeff Jarrett and then Scott Steiner. Steiner attacked and injured Sting in November 2000. Sting stayed off WCW programming until the final episode of \"Nitro\" on March 26, 2001. WCW had been purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and the final match in WCW history pitted Sting against his longtime rival Flair; the two had also competed on the very first edition of \"Nitro\" on September 4, 1995. Sting defeated Flair and the two embraced at the end of the contest.\n\nAfter the WWF did not buy out Sting's contract with AOL Time Warner, he rejected a buyout offer of 50 cents on the dollar from AOL Time Warner, instead waiting until his contract expired in March 2002 (he announced a short-lived retirement in February of that year). Borden then entered into contract negotiations with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion.\n\nIn 2002, after over a year and a half of hiatus, Borden toured Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion throughout November and December. His first match in the WWA took place on November 28, 2002, in Dublin, Ireland, where he reunited with Lex Luger to defeat Buff Bagwell and Malice. At The Retribution on December 6, 2002 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, Sting lost to Luger in a bout for the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Luger to claim the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in Zurich, Switzerland, on December 13.\n\nSting embarked on a second tour with WWA in May 2003, successfully defending his championship against Rick Steiner, Shane Douglas, and Disco Inferno. The WWA held its final show, The Reckoning, on May 25 in Auckland, New Zealand, where NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship, unifying the two championships.\n\nIn 2003, Sting signed a contract committing him to four appearances with the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. He debuted in TNA on the June 18 one year anniversary show, teaming with Jeff Jarrett to defeat A.J. Styles and Syxx Pac. Following this, Borden engaged in a comprehensive series of sitdown interviews with Mike Tenay, discussing his career and his faith. Sting returned to TNA on November 5, 2003, defeating Jarrett by disqualification in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On November 12, Sting teamed with A.J. Styles to defeat Jarrett and Lex Luger. He made his final TNA appearance of 2003 on December 17, defeating Jarrett in a non-title match. On March 24, 2004, Borden was interviewed once again by Mike Tenay as part of the promotion for his direct-to-video biographical film, \"Sting: Moment of Truth\", and on March 31, he returned to the company for one night only as the special guest enforcer for the main-event, a four-way match between Abyss, A.J. Styles, Raven, and Ron Killings, which Raven won.\n\nOn December 11, 2005, at Turning Point, as Jeff Jarrett stood in the ring celebrating his victory, the lights in the arena went out as images of a scorpion—Sting's symbol— appeared on the arena screens, along with the date \"January 15, 2006\". Spotlights then illuminated the ring, revealing a chair bearing Sting's signature trench coat, boots, and a black baseball bat in the center of the ring. His return to TNA was officially announced one minute after midnight on the January 1, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\". On January 15 at Final Resolution, Sting and Christian Cage defeated NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown in a tag team match after Sting pinned Jarrett following the Scorpion Death Drop. His heavily promoted return was greeted with chants of \"welcome back\" and \"you've still got it\" by the Orlando, Florida audience. TNA later revealed that Final Resolution was \"by far the most-purchased TNA pay-per-view event in company history, breaking all previous numbers\". On the January 28, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\", Sting made his Spike TV debut and first appearance on national television in almost five years, coming to the ring at the end of the show to make a \"major announcement\". Sting noted that he had never had a chance to properly say goodbye to his fans. He then announced that Final Resolution had been \"his goodbye\", before thanking the TNA management and the fans. Sting then dropped his bat, with a spotlight appearing over it, and left the ring, shaking hands with various TNA wrestlers on his way up the ramp.\n\nWith Sting gone, the storyline continued with Jeff Jarrett and Eric Young worrying that Sting had not actually retired and sending Alex Shelley to California to videotape Sting at home. Sting discovered Shelley filming, then walked up to Shelley's car and told him that he was going to show up at Destination X and confront Jeff Jarrett as Steve Borden. Clad in \"street clothes\" and without face paint Borden returned on March 12 at Destination X, saving Christian Cage and Rhino as they were attacked by Jarrett's Army. He placed Jarrett in the Scorpion Deathlock, but was attacked by the debuting Scott Steiner shortly thereafter. In his first cable television match in five years, Sting defeated Eric Young on the April 13, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\". After being attacked by Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), Sting was saved by A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino, who he announced as his teammates in his Lethal Lockdown match against Jarrett's Army. On April 23 at Lockdown, \"Sting's Warriors\" (Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino) defeated Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted after Sting made Chris Harris tap out to the \"Scorpion Death Lock\". Following Lockdown, Sting proceeded to seek out partners to help him defeat Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner for good. After bringing out Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, and Rick Steiner as options, he settled on Samoa Joe. On May 14 at Sacrifice, Sting and Joe defeated Jarrett and Steiner after Joe pinned Jarrett with a Muscle Buster. Still having proven unsuccessful at putting Jarrett away, Sting defeated Scott Steiner by disqualification to earn a spot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 18. Due to a confrontation with Christian Cage during the match, Sting was distracted, which allowed crooked referee Earl Hebner to knock over the ladder both were on, sending both men to the floor and allow Jarrett to pick up the victory.\n\nOn July 16 at Victory Road, a four-way number one contenders match was held for a shot at Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Jeff Jarrett, disguised as a cameraman, came into the ring with a bottle of gasoline and squirted it into Sting's eyes. Sting was taken by security into the back and as a result, taken out of the running for the number one contender match. As the match continued as a three-way, Sting returned to the ring with his head wrapped in bandages, performed the \"Scorpion Death Drop\" on Scott Steiner, and Sting pinned him to become number one contender. After the match, Sting had a confrontation with Christian Cage in the ring that ended with them shaking hands, and Cage showing respect for Sting. Sting received his title shot on August 13 at Hard Justice, but failed to capture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Jeff Jarrett after Christian Cage turned heel and hit Sting with Jarrett's guitar. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", Sting stated that he wanted a rematch with Jarrett at Bound for Glory, TNA's biggest pay-per view of the year. Jarrett accepted the match, with the implication that Sting put his career on the line, a stipulation Sting accepted. Sting then retreated to train for what could have been his final match. Meanwhile, \"Impact!\" began showing videos of Sting going through a so-called transformation with many biblical references. On October 22, 2006, in the Title vs. Career match at the Bound for Glory PPV, Sting returned debuting his new look, a hybrid of his \"surfer,\" \"Crow,\" and \"nWo Wolfpac\" styles, looking much leaner physically. He went on to claim his second NWA World Heavyweight title when he made Jarrett submit to the \"Scorpion Deathlock\" marking the first major championship title Sting had won since 1999. With that victory, Sting became the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of the TNA era, as well as the only person to ever win the title both before and after the inception of TNA. This would also go on to make Sting the longest superstar to recapture his second NWA title from 1990 to 2006 (16 years).\n\nSting lost the title to \"The Monster\" Abyss on November 19 at Genesis by disqualification after pushing aside the referee and pushing Abyss into a stack of tables covered in barbed wire. In the weeks following Genesis, Sting's feud with Abyss continued as he tried to get in Abyss' head by telling him he was being used by his satanic manager James Mitchell. Abyss was visibly affected by this, but remained by Mitchell's side. Sting's former friend Christian Cage and his bodyguard Tomko were also thrown in the mix, with Cage claiming he knew a dark secret in Abyss' past. The three finally met in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 10 at Turning Point, where Abyss retained the title. After Turning Point, Sting continued to try to convince Abyss he was nothing but a machine for Mitchell, and he got so far into Abyss that Abyss grabbed Mitchell by the throat, almost chokeslamming him on an edition of \"Impact!\", but ultimately convinced himself not to.\n\nAs 2007 came along, Sting continued his feud with Abyss while trying to recapture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On January 14 at Final Resolution, Sting faced Abyss and Christian Cage in three-way elimination match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but failed regain the championship after he was eliminated last by Cage. On the January 24, 2007 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting revealed after going through public records that Abyss shot his own father three times in the back, sending him into a coma. During the ensuing brawl throughout the \"Impact!\" Zone between Sting and Abyss, James Mitchell burned Sting's face with a fireball, sending Sting to the hospital. Sting returned to defeat Abyss in a \"Prison Yard\" match on February 11 at Against All Odds and again in a \"Last Rites\" match on March 11 at Destination X. On the March 22 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting teamed with his enemy Abyss to face Christian Cage and A.J. Styles. During the match, Mitchell returned with a woman who Abyss recognized and Abyss left the match with Mitchell and the woman, leaving Sting alone to fight Cage and Styles. The following week on \"Impact!\", during a meeting between Sting and James Mitchell, it was revealed that the woman was Abyss' mother, and that she was the one who had actually shot Abyss' father, but Abyss took the blame to protect his mother. Later in the night, it was announced Abyss was added to the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown as part of Team Cage while Sting ended up joining Team Angle. At Lockdown, Sting, with the help of Jeff Jarrett, pinned Abyss to win the match for his team and end their bitter rivalry.\n\nDue to his win, he was supposed to be facing Christian Cage for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Sacrifice, but the next week on \"Impact!\", Kurt Angle challenged Sting for his number one contendership. After Team Cage interfered in the match, it was revealed that at Sacrifice there would be a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between Sting, Kurt Angle, and Christian Cage. The day of the PPV, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships, stripped Cage of the title and Team 3D of the tag team title. NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich stated the reason was that Cage refused to defend the NWA Title at NWA live events. At the event, Cage, still holding the physical NWA Championship belt, defended what was billed as the \"World Heavyweight Championship\" against Sting and Angle. Angle was the victor of said contest by making Sting submit, who had technically just pinned Cage, and was announced as the new \"TNA World Heavyweight Champion\". The \"Impact!\" following the event, the title was labelled as the \"TNA World Heavyweight Championship\" and was vacated due to the controversial finish of the match. A tournament was then held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. Sting lost his qualifying match with Samoa Joe after Christopher Daniels interfered. Sting instead faced Daniels on June 17 at Slammiversary, which he ultimately won.\n\nAfter his feud with Daniels, Sting began teaming up with his former enemy, Abyss who had recently turned face. Together, the two went on to defeat A.J. Styles and Tomko on July 15 at Victory Road. While trying to help Abyss to win a match against A.J. Styles, Sting and Abyss were attacked by Christian's Coalition. Abyss was pulled under the ring and Sting was slammed into broken glass by Tomko, before Abyss emerged bleeding badly and was slammed into the broken glass and thumbtacks. The following week, Sting and Abyss got revenge by defeating Christian Cage and A.J. Styles in a ladder match, in the process earning a contract that allowed them to pick the type of match between Abyss and Christian at Hard Justice. It was announced via TNA mobile that Abyss had selected \"Doomsday Chamber of Blood\" match. Sting's team won, with Abyss pinning A.J. Styles to become the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn the August 30 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting defeated A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Samoa Joe in a four-way match to become the co-holder of the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Kurt Angle. Yet after only thirteen days, Sting and Angle lost the titles to Adam \"Pacman\" Jones and Ron \"The Truth\" Killings at No Surrender. During the match, Karen Angle claimed that Sting had slapped her, which led to a falling out between Sting and Kurt Angle and on the first two-hour edition of \"Impact!\", Kurt Angle was shown via satellite (kayfabe) stalking and assaulting Sting's son Garrett. It was announced that Sting would face Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. The match was billed as return to his roots for Sting, who enjoyed enormous popularity and success in the Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling earlier in his career. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Sting overcame interference by both Karen Angle and Kevin Nash to defeat Angle and win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On October 16, at the tapings of the October 25 episode of \"Impact!\", Sting lost the championship back to Angle after Kevin Nash interfered on Angle's behalf. Sting then challenged Angle to a tag team rematch at Genesis. Angle was forced to Kevin Nash as his partner, while Sting's partner was a mystery until during the event where his partner was revealed to be Booker T. In the match, whoever scored the pinfall would win the TNA World Championship, which Angle won after pinning Sting to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This would be the final TNA appearance of Sting in 2007 as he would take some time off to be with his family.\n\nOn the March 20 edition of \"Impact!\", after a brawl between members of both Team Cage and Team Tomko, a promo aired at the end of the show indicating that Sting would return the next week on the first-ever live \"Impact!\" episode. Sting then made his official return on March 27, announcing that he would be a part of Team Cage for the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown. Later on the show, he teamed with members of Team Cage (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and Matt Morgan) and defeated Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D) in a 5-man tag team match. Morgan was added when James Storm attacked Sting with a glass bottle after the match. Sting, however, later gained revenge by defeating Storm when Morgan threw him his baseball bat. Morgan then ripped off his referee shirt and revealed a Team Cage shirt, thus becoming the fifth member. At Lockdown, Team Cage defeated Team Tomko when Rhino gored Storm to get the pinfall. After the tag titles were vacated, Jim Cornette held a Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament to determine new champs. Four teams were already in the Sacrifice finals, while Cornette named eight wrestlers as the \"Egotistical 8\". Sting's partner was James Storm and on May 11 at Sacrifice, they came up short due their inability get along, and towards the end, Sting attacked Storm and walked out. Sting was not seen after that except in an interview which talked about his career and his eventual retirement.\nOn July 13 at Victory Road, Booker T faced Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Sting tried to talk sense into Joe, as he was brutally beating Booker T, and was potentially heading towards a disqualification. Joe rebuked him, and Sting struck him with his trademark black baseball bat. Over the coming weeks, the feud between Joe and Booker intensified, with episodes ending with Booker T or Sharmell striking Samoa Joe with Sting's trademark bat as \"Impact!\" went off the air, leading to a question of whether Sting had turned on Samoa Joe and became a heel. Although still receiving a face reaction from the fans, Sting sided with Booker T. On August 10 at Hard Justice, Sting attacked A.J. Styles after he and Kurt Angle wrestled a Last Man Standing match. Sting later announced why he attacked Joe and Styles by saying that the younger generation needed to learn about respecting veterans like Angle, Booker, and himself. He declared that he wouldn't retire until he had accomplished this mission. This led to mixed fan reactions, and sparked a feud between him and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe, as well as Jeff Jarrett who arrived to aid Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles by giving them his guitar as Sting had done with his bat.\n\nOn October 12 at Bound for Glory IV, Sting challenged Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and was successful in claiming the title, after Kevin Nash returned and hit Joe with Sting's baseball bat. On October 23, Sting joined The Main Event Mafia (Kurt Angle, Booker T, Sharmell, Kevin Nash, Scott Steiner, and himself) and by doing so, he fully turned heel for the first time in years, although Sting did not participate in sneak attacks and was cheered by the crowd, making him more a tweener (neutral character). Sting went on to successfully defend the title against AJ Styles on November 9 at Turning Point, The TNA Front Line in an eight-man tag team match with the Main Event Mafia on December 7 at Final Resolution, Rhino on January 11 Genesis, Kurt Angle and both members of Team 3D in a four-way match on February 8 at Against All Odds, and against Angle on March 15 at Destination X. At Lockdown 2009, Sting lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Mick Foley inside the Six Sides of Steel, ending his reign at 189 days (his longest world title reign for any organization). On May 24 at Sacrifice, Sting defeated Kurt Angle to become the new Godfather of the Main Event Mafia. On June 21 at Slammiversary, Sting defeated Matt Morgan in a singles match, thus preventing Morgan from joining the Main Event Mafia. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", Sting's fellow Main Event Mafia members attacked him, removed him from the group, and Kurt Angle reclaimed his role as Godfather. The following week, Sting took his revenge upon the Mafia, when he attacked every member of the group and stole Angle's world heavyweight championship belt, becoming a fully fledged face as a result. On July 19 at Victory Road, Sting was defeated by new Main Event Mafia member Samoa Joe in a singles match after the debuting Taz interfered on Joe's behalf. On August 16 at Hard Justice, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match, which also included Matt Morgan. On September 20 at No Surrender, Sting lost a five-way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship that also included A.J. Styles, Hernandez, Kurt Angle, and Matt Morgan. Instead of pinning Angle, he opted to attack Morgan, to allow Styles to pin Angle and become the new World Heavyweight Champion. As a token of gratitude, Styles offered to give him a title shot at the following month's PPV Bound for Glory in a match billed as possibly being Sting's retirement match. At the PPV, Styles defeated Sting to retain his title, ending Sting's undefeated streak at Bound for Glory. After the match he announced that he didn't know whether he would continue his career or not, Saying that \"the way you fans are reacting right now, makes me wanna stay forever!\" At the end of the year the match was voted the match of the year by the fans of TNA.\n\nOn the January 4, 2010, live-three-hour, Monday night edition of \"Impact!\" Sting returned to the Impact! Zone appearing in the rafters of the arena. Sting reappeared two months later on March 8, appearing as he was going to help a bloodied Hulk Hogan and Abyss during a match at the beginning of the show against A.J. Styles and Ric Flair. Instead he swung his baseball bat on Hogan and Abyss, turning heel as a result. He was later defeated by the debuting Rob Van Dam. Sting would continuously attack Van Dam with his bat after the match, completing his heel turn by attacking security guards and Hulk Hogan. On the March 22 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting was announced as the captain of Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Hogan, captained by Abyss. At Lockdown Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). On May 3, Sting explained his actions to Hogan and was later attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett. At Sacrifice Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he managed to score a pinfall in seconds over his bloodied opponent, leaving him injured. On the following edition of \"Impact!\" the TNA Championship Committee ranked Sting number one in the rankings and as a result he was granted a shot at Rob Van Dam's World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary VIII. Sting then attacked Eric Bischoff with his baseball bat, biting the hand that fed him. Sting later promised that he would reveal the motives behind his actions after winning the World Heavyweight Championship. At Slammiversary VIII Jeff Jarrett made his return and cost Sting his title match against Rob Van Dam.\n\nAfter assaulting Jarrett from behind on the June 24 edition of \"Impact!\", TNA president Dixie Carter suspended Sting for 30 days without pay the following week. Sting returned from his suspension on the August 5 edition of \"Impact!\", wearing his nWo Wolfpac red face paint, and helping Kevin Nash, who had backed him up during his suspension, beat down Jarrett, Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan. On the September 2 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Nash. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Sting and Nash away. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with his own baseball bat. On the September 16 edition of \"Reaction\", Sting and Nash were joined by D'Angelo Dinero, who claimed to have gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Sting and Nash were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something. At Bound for Glory Sting, Nash and Dinero faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was slated to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe, and Sting, Nash, and Dinero tried to tell Joe this was what they were saying all along. Joe fought them anyway and ended up pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Sting had been right about Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they turned heel with Jarrett and Jeff Hardy as Abyss's \"they\", and in the process turned Sting, Nash and Dinero back to being faces. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", Sting and Nash refused to join Hogan, Bischoff and their new group, Immortal, and walked out on TNA and Dixie Carter, noting that they had tried to warn her that Hogan and Bischoff would try to take over the company for their own gain, but she hadn't listened, meaning Sting was never a true villain his entire heel run. After Impact!, Sting took hiatus from TNA television, as Borden's TNA contract had expired at the end of 2010.\nAfter a four-month hiatus, Sting returned to TNA on February 24, 2011 at the tapings of the March 3 edition of \"Impact!\", where he appeared as a surprise challenger and defeated Jeff Hardy to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the third time. On March 13 at Victory Road, Sting successfully defended the title against Hardy in a No Disqualification rematch that lasted ninety seconds. According to word from backstage, the match was planned to last longer, but Sting, believing that Jeff was in no shape to perform from looking at him, deliberately ended the match early, and was later heard agreeing with a fan's claim that the match was \"bullshit\". The following month at Lockdown, Sting successfully defended the title against Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam in a three-way steel cage match. In May, Sting was allowed to pick his number one contender and chose Van Dam, whom he went on to defeat at Sacrifice. The following month at Slammiversary IX, Sting lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Mr. Anderson, following outside interference from Eric Bischoff.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Sting displayed a more maniacal character similar in look and style to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker from the 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\". On the July 14 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting, now dubbed as the \"Insane Icon\", regained the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Mr. Anderson, after Fortune and Kurt Angle, disguised as his clown minions, attacked each member of Immortal, preventing them from interfering in the match. He would go on to lose the title to Kurt Angle on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, after Angle hit him with a chair brought to the ring by Hulk Hogan. Sting continued tormenting head members of Immortal with his strange new personality, and on the August 18 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", his longtime rival Ric Flair made his return to TNA and challenged him to a match. Sting agreed to put his career on the line in the match in exchange for Flair promising to deliver him his long-awaited match with Hogan, should he be able to defeat him. On the September 1 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting received a rematch against Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated following interference from special enforcer Hulk Hogan and the rest of Immortal. On September 11 at No Surrender, Hogan once again cost Sting the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a three-way match, which also included Mr. Anderson. On the September 15 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting defeated longtime rival Ric Flair to earn the right to face Hogan at Bound for Glory. On the October 6 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", after being exposed for his false claim of retiring and his secret ridicule of the fans, a furious Hogan impulsively agreed to hand TNA back to Dixie Carter, should Sting manage to defeat him at the pay-per-view. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Sting defeated Hogan to bring Dixie Carter back to power. After the match, Hogan turned on Immortal and helped Sting overcome the odds in his battle with the stable. On the following edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Carter placed Sting in charge of the program. Sting returned to the ring on the December 22 and February 9, 2012, editions of \"Impact Wrestling\", where he teamed up with Jeff Hardy to defeat TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode and Bully Ray both times.\n\nOn March 18 at Victory Road, Sting was defeated by Roode in a non-title No Holds Barred match. On the following edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting announced his resignation from the general manager position, and handed the position over to Hulk Hogan. He later stated that he believe that Hogan could properly run TNA without the influence of Bischoff. On March 29, Dixie Carter announced that Borden had signed another contract extension with TNA. Sting returned to TNA on the May 24 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", attacking Bobby Roode. The following week, Sting defeated Roode in a non-title lumberjack match to earn a shot at his TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On June 10 at Slammiversary, Sting was announced as the first person inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame the following October. Later, in the main event of the evening, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Roode for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, after being hit with a beer bottle. Afterwards, Sting attacked Roode and dropped him on the entrance ramp with a Scorpion Death Drop.\nOn the June 14 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting's speech about the events of Slammiversary was interrupted, when he was attacked by three masked assailants. Sting returned four weeks later, but this time both he and Hulk Hogan were attacked by the same group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the \"Aces & Eights\". While Hogan was recovering from his storyline injuries suffered in the attack, and a legitimate back surgery, Sting reclaimed the role of interim general manager. On October 13, Sting was officially inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. The following day at Bound for Glory, Sting teamed with Bully Ray in a tag team match, where they were defeated by the Aces & Eights, following interference from a man who was afterwards unmasked as Ray's longtime partner, the returning Devon. As a result of their win, the Aces & Eights earned full access to TNA. On the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting defeated Devon via disqualification, following interference from the Aces & Eights. On the November 8 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting was sidelined with a storyline injury, after being put through a table and beaten with a ball-peen hammer by DOC, a member of Aces & Eights.\n\nSting returned on the January 3, 2013, episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", saving Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe from Aces & Eights before beating the group down with a baseball bat. Sting wrestled his return match the following week, defeating Aces & Eights member Mike Knox after he injured Kurt Angle.

On March 10 at Lockdown, Team TNA, consisting of Sting, Eric Young, James Storm, Magnus, and Samoa Joe defeated Aces & Eights, consisting of Devon, DOC, Garett Bischoff, Mike Knox, and Mr. Anderson in a Lethal Lockdown match. After Bully Ray won the World Heavyweight Championship and revealed himself as the leader of Aces & Eights later that night, Hulk Hogan blamed Sting as he had encouraged Hogan to give Ray the title shot while also encouraging Hogan to support Ray's marriage with his daughter Brooke. Sting proceeded to walk out on Hogan. Sting returned on the April 25 \"Impact Wrestling\", saving Hogan from an attack by the Aces & Eights. The following week, Sting reconciled with Hogan and became the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship later that night after defeating Matt Morgan. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Bully Ray for the World Heavyweight Championship in a No Holds Barred Match after an interference by Aces & Eights. Per stipulation, Sting would never get another World title opportunity again.\n\nOn the June 13 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting noted that nobody in the back helped him during his title match, but he would form a New Main Event Mafia to battle the Aces & Eights. In the following weeks, Sting would recruit Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Magnus, and Rampage Jackson as members of the New Main Event Mafia. Before Bound for Glory, MEM member Magnus complained to Sting because his losses. Magnus told to Sting he had Flair to put him in the map, but he had nobody, so Sting challenged him to a match at Bound for Glory. At Bound for Glory, Sting was defeated by Magnus. On the October 31 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Dixie Carter offered to lift the lifetime ban so Sting can get another World title opportunity again by entering him first in a Battle Royal Gauntlet match, which was won by Magnus as Sting attempted to eliminate Kazarian, and Magnus eliminated the both of them. Sting disbanded The Main Event Mafia after Aces & Eights disbanded, and while other members began to chase their World Heavyweight Title dreams, Sting started a feud against Ethan Carter III and Dixie Carter after they began humiliating TNA Legends, like Curry Man and Earl Hebner by Carter. On the December 12 episode of Impact, Carter was confronted by Sting, and was issued an option, either face Sting immediately, or enter the Feast or Fired match. Carter entered the Feast or Fired match, and grabbed one of the briefcases. On the December 19 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", the Feast or Fired briefcase revealed to contain a future World Tag Team Championship match, and also led to the firing of Chavo Guerrero. On the January 16, 2014 edition of Impact Wrestling: Genesis, Sting lost a match to Ethan Carter III due an interference from the World Champion Magnus and subsequently challenged Magnus to a Title vs. Career match for the January 23, 2014 episode of Impact Wrestling-Genesis. Sting lost, and his TNA contract was terminated as a result.\n\nVeteran professional wrestling journalist Bill Apter chronicled Sting's career in a piece for WWE.com on February 19, 2014, wherein he stated that Sting's \"best days may still be yet to come\". Amid speculation about a contract offer from the company, Sting appeared in a WWE Network production on April 15, 2014, sharing a story of his former tag team partner The Ultimate Warrior, who had recently died. This marked Sting's first non-archive appearance on a WWE-branded show. Sting was a prominent contributor to the documentary film \"Warrior: The Ultimate Legend\", which aired on the WWE Network on April 17.

That same day, WWE began selling official Sting merchandise. On July 24, Borden made his first public appearance for WWE, in full Sting garb, as a surprise guest at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International.

On January 19, 2015, Sting made his live \"Raw\" debut by appearing backstage during the main event, then walking to the stage, causing a distraction and costing Authority members Big Show, Kane and Seth Rollins their handicap match against John Cena; this win gave the recently fired Dolph Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan their jobs back. Triple H challenged Sting to a face-to-face confrontation on the January 26 episode of \"Raw\". Sting accepted this challenge on the February 16 episode of \"Raw\" by sending a Sting doppelganger into the ring to scare Triple H, after airing a vignette on the big screen accepting Triple H's challenge. Sting and Triple H had a confrontation at Fastlane on February 22. Following physicality between the two, Sting pointed to the WrestleMania 31 sign with his baseball bat, issuing a challenge for the event that was accepted by Triple H. On the March 16 episode of \"Raw\", Sting made a surprise appearance and helped Randy Orton fight off the Authority. Immediately following on the WWE Network, Sting spoke for the first time in-ring.

Triple H then announced on the WWE Network that Sting would face Rollins for the title at Night of Champions. Sting appeared on the tron throughout the September 7 \"Raw\", defacing and ultimately destroying Rollins's statue by pushing it into a garbage truck. The following week, Sting defeated Big Show by disqualification in his debut \"Raw\" match, as a consequence of Rollins attacking Sting. John Cena then came to Sting's aid, which prompted Triple H to book a tag team contest involving the four wrestlers: Sting and Cena won after Sting made Rollins tap out to the Scorpion Deathlock. Sting suffered a legit neck injury during his championship match against Rollins at Night of Champions, but was able to complete the bout in a losing effort.\n\nSting said on the December 9 edition of Ric Flair's \"WOOOOO! Nation\" podcast that he required surgery to correct cervical spinal stenosis, and is \"lucky that a catastrophe didn't happen\" in his match with Rollins at Night of Champions.\n\nIt was announced on the January 11, 2016 episode of \"Raw\" that Sting would be the first member of the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2016. He was the second active WWE wrestler to be inducted – the first being his inductor, Ric Flair.

On April 2, during his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech, Sting announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He appeared at WrestleMania 32, alongside his fellow 2016 inductees, the following night.\n\nIn August 2016, Sting appeared on the WWE Network show \"Legends with JBL\" and talked about his career. He also stated that he has not undergone surgery, which would definitively end his career, and he still holds hope for a match with The Undertaker, claiming that such a match is his \"unfinished business\" in wrestling.\n\nSting is widely regarded as the greatest performer in WCW history. Former rival Hulk Hogan asserted that Sting should be mentioned in any conversation regarding the top 10 greatest pro wrestlers of all time; numerous outlets have placed him in such listings. Sting also garnered one of the largest and most loyal fanbases in the industry; he was voted by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers as \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" four times (a record shared with John Cena), for the years 1991, 1992, 1994 and 1997. Digital Spy writer Mayer Nissim commended Sting's ability to constantly evolve his gimmick while fellow franchise players Hulk Hogan and John Cena largely failed to do so, in order to maintain spectator interest. Borden is known for his charity work, once regarding his involvement with the Make-A-Wish and Starlight Children's Foundations as his \"most fulfilling activity\". His young supporters are known as the \"Little Stingers\".\n\nPrior to his signing with WWE, Sting's legacy was perpetuated by the organization. It hailed him as \"one of sports-entertainment's elite\", and ranked him at number one in listings of the greatest wrestlers to never perform in WWE, and the greatest stars in WCW history. In 2013, the company named Sting's WCW World Heavyweight Championship contest against Diamond Dallas Page, on April 26, 1999, as the greatest match ever aired on WCW's flagship \"Monday Nitro\" program. At Night of Champions 2013, WWE organized a viewer poll to determine the greatest United States Champion of all time: Sting, a two-time champion, beat out the other four contenders – all WWE Hall of Famers – in a landslide victory with 53% of the overall vote. In regard to Sting's creative handling after he signed with WWE, \"PWInsider\" editor Dave Scherer wrote that \"he really represented WCW so he was never going to get that [legend] treatment\".\n\nSting was the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame. TNA president Dixie Carter credits Sting with being the major wrestling superstar that TNA needed to establish itself. The company describes him as having had an \"unparalleled career\" and as being a legend who surpasses time.\n\nSting was regarded by colleagues in WCW as a professional and well-respected locker room leader. Prominent adversary Big Van Vader felt that Sting had unsurpassed athletic prowess within the business, and \"ranks right up at the top\" as an in-ring performer. Ric Flair called Sting his greatest opponent. Former rival Diamond Dallas Page, commenting on Sting's entry into WWE in 2014, said: \"Everyone there grew up watching him... No one did it better than Sting, nobody\". John Cena mimicked Sting's hairstyle in his youth and recalled, \"he was my guy\"; Cody Rhodes and Shelton Benjamin have also named him as their favorite childhood wrestler. Tyson Kidd professed to being a \"huge Sting fan\" as a child, and Seth Rollins would dress up as Sting in his youth. He was also a prominent influence on industry veterans Kurt Angle, Bill Goldberg, Jeff Hardy, Kane, A.J. Styles and Goldust. Bray Wyatt has stressed that he \"\"really\" would like to take on\" Sting, adding: \"I have to have [that] before I die; I don't care if it happens outside a Waffle House, somewhere.\"\n\nSting was the only WCW World Heavyweight Champion to wear face paint.\n\nSting's drawing ability has been disputed. Journalist Dave Scherer of \"PWInsider\" wrote: \"Sting is an all timer for sure, but the fact is that when he was the man in WCW, even before the NWO came in, he didn't draw huge\". Pro wrestling historian Dave Meltzer also reported that Sting was not a formidable draw. Fin Martin of \"Power Slam\" felt that while Sting did not make \"essential improvements\" nor \"grow into the champion's role\" during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1990 to 1991, he suffered from a weak line-up of potential opponents and poor creative handling. Martin said that Sting never truly established himself as 'The Man'.\n\nOn the other hand, Steve Austin has taken exception to the notion that Sting was not a profitable wrestler. Reflecting on Sting in the early 1990s, veteran wrestler Kevin Nash said: \"There weren't many draws in WCW at that point, but he was one of them\". Former WCW booker Mike Graham asserted that Sting was a television ratings success during the Monday Night Wars, while fellow booker Kevin Sullivan said of Sting's rivalry with Ric Flair: \"If I needed to draw a rating, Sting and Flair always drew. It was like [Muhammad] Ali and [Joe] Frazier\". The inaugural Clash of the Champions event in 1988, which aired opposite the WWF's WrestleMania IV and was headlined by Sting vs. Flair, generated a record-setting 5.6 rating on TBS. The pair also main-evented The Great American Bash 1990, which was the NWA's biggest pay-per-view success up to that point.\n\nSting was a major attraction in 1997, being WCW's top merchandise seller (second only to the WWF's Steve Austin overall) and, versus Hollywood Hogan, headlining the biggest-grossing pay-per-view event in the company's history at Starrcade 1997. Sting went on to join the nWo Wolfpac stable, which dominated WCW's merchandise sales at events in mid 1998. Discussing Sting in WWE, Kevin Nash said that he is \"so valuable to the company as a trademark\".\n\nPrior to his signing with WWE, Sting was widely considered the greatest wrestler never to perform for the company. He had \"really good conversations\" with the promotion during his career, but did not appear there until 2014, at the age of 55. His loyalty to WCW, even in its dying days, has been noted. That organization was purchased by the WWF (now WWE) in 2001, and Sting's contract with its parent company AOL Time Warner expired in 2002, but he still refused to make the jump, alternately attributing this to the WWF's creative usage of former WCW talents and negative dealings with attorneys. The company's onerous live schedule and the content of its programming were also factors. Sting has, however, downplayed rumors of a difficult relationship with WWE.\n\nRather than sign with the WWF in 2002, Sting performed for smaller promotions, becoming the centerpiece of TNA by the mid 2000s. His pre-WWE career included \"dream\" matches against former WWF stars Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart in WCW, as well as bouts opposite names such as Ric Flair, Randy Savage, Kurt Angle and Mick Foley. Sting often wrestled Steve Austin in WCW; he had positive negotiations with WWE in 2003, with his proposed debut angle being a confrontation with Austin at the conclusion of WrestleMania XIX. He was also \"very, very close\" to making a deal with the company in 2011, which would potentially have involved a match against The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVII. Although Sting twice wrestled Mark Calaway in his pre-Undertaker character, Mark Callous, at WCW live events in 1990, WWE viewers clamored for a televised Sting versus Undertaker match.\n\nBorden appeared in the music video for the song \"Fire in the Hole\" by Lȧȧz Rockit in 1989.\n\nBorden appeared in the syndicated TV show Super Force as Hallor / ... (3 episodes, 1991-1992)\n\nHe starred in a pay-per-view only film titled \"The Real Reason (Men Commit Crimes)\" (1998).\n\nBorden was featured in a Sprite commercial in 1999. He also appeared in three episodes of the action-adventure series with Hulk Hogan in \"Thunder in Paradise\" as the character Adam \"Hammerhead\" McCall. Borden made a guest appearance on \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" as biker and drug dealer Grangus in the episode \"Unsafe Speed\". He also appeared in \"Ready to Rumble\" (2000) as Sting.\n\nHis book, Moment Of Truth, was released on December 1, 2004.\n\nHe also appeared in the Christian film, \"The Encounter\" (2010) and was featured as the lead actor in the TV movie \"Shutterspeed\" (2000). He makes a cameo appearance as Sting on an episode of \"Upright Citizens Brigade\". Borden played an outlaw biker in the film \"Revelation Road\" (2013).\n\nIn October 2015, WWE released a second Sting DVD titled \"Sting: Into the Light\". The three-disc set features a behind-the-scenes documentary with Sting himself as he prepares to step into a WWE ring for the first time ever at WrestleMania 31.\n\nBorden was an admitted anabolic steroid user in the 1980s. He became a born-again Christian in August 1998, after confessing his adultery, and substance and alcohol abuse to his then-wife. Borden has two sons, Garrett Lee and Steve, Jr. and a daughter named Gracie, who was born in 2000. His elder son Garrett attends Azusa Pacific University, where he plays college football as a running back. Steven attended Kilgore College, where he played tight end; on December 19, 2012, he committed to attend the University of Kentucky. After the 2015 NFL Draft, Steven was invited by the Kansas City Chiefs to try out for the team at their rookie mini-camp. Borden married his second wife Sabine in 2015, shortly after WrestleMania 31.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22464685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22464685", "title": "The Georgian Chronicles", "text": "The Georgian Chronicles\n\nThe Georgian Chronicles is a conventional English name for the principal compendium of medieval Georgian historical texts, natively known as Kartlis Tskhovreba (), literally \"Life of Kartli\", Kartli being a core region of ancient and medieval Georgia, known to the Classical and Byzantine authors as Iberia.\n\nThe chronicles are also known as The Georgian Royal Annals, for they were essentially the official corpus of history of the Kingdom of Georgia.\n\nThe Chronicles consist of a series of distinct texts dating from the 9th to the 14th century. The dating of these works as well as the identification of their authors (e.g., Leonti Mroveli and Juansheriani) have been a subject of scholarly debates. Although many scholars in Georgia still propose an 11th-century dating for the first redaction of the corpus, the increasing number of modern experts has accepted Professor Cyril Toumanoff's hypothesis that the earliest texts of \"Kartlis Tskhovreba\" were composed c. 800. The latest texts were added in the 14th century. A \"canonized\" version was edited by a special commission appointed and chaired by King Vakhtang VI of Kartli early in the 18th century.\n\nDuring the 11th century, the first three works – the \"History of the Kings and Patriarchs of the Georgians\", the \"History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali\", and the \"Martyrdom of Saint Archil\" – already made up a first corpus which covered the Georgian history from the earliest times through the reign of Vakhtang I Gorgasali (r. 452–502/22) down to the death of Vakhtang's descendant Archil (786). In the middle of the 12th century, two texts were added: the \"Chronicle of Kartli\" – which records the Georgian history from the late 8th century through the reign of the first all-Georgian king Bagrat III (r. 1008-1014) to the early regnal years of George II (r. 1072-1089) – and the \"History of the King of Kings David\" – which continues the story and focuses on the reign of David IV (r. 1089-1125).\n\nThe extant Georgian manuscripts of \"Kartlis Tskhovreba\" are relatively late, with the earliest, the so-called \"Anaseuli\" or \"Queen Anna\" codex, dating from the period of 1479-1495. Another major variant, \"Mariamiseuli\" or \"Queen Mariam\" codex, was copied in the years 1633-1645/1646. However, the surviving Georgian manuscripts are predated by the Chronicles' abridged Armenian adaptation known as \"The History of Georgians\" (\"Patmut'iwn Vrats\"'), most probably made in the 12th century, with its earliest extant manuscript being copied in the period of 1279-1311.\n\nA number of translations are available in French, Russian, English and German, but each one covers only a selected number of these texts.\n\nSome modern scholars, such as Ivane Javakhishvili, have questioned the authenticity of the early components of \"The Georgian Chronicles\" and have called for extreme caution when working with them. Indeed, strict historical facts are frequently intermingled with mythical ones, making it sometimes difficult to discern true historiography and mythology. However, critical analyses against other sources, including the Classical authors, and a series of recent archaeological studies have proved the trustworthiness of many of the Chronicles' accounts. These texts relate evidence not only for the history of Georgia, but also Armenia and the Caucasus in general, Iran, Syria, Anatolia, the Roman Empire, the Khazars, and the Turks.\n\n"}

It is also available for download for use off-line. It provides a two- to three-page summary of the demographics, geography, communications, government, economy, and military of each of 267 international entities including U.S.-recognized countries, dependencies, and other areas in the world.\n\n\"The World Factbook\" is prepared by the CIA for the use of U.S. government officials, and its style, format, coverage, and content are primarily designed to meet their requirements. However, it is frequently used as a resource for academic research papers and news articles. As a work of the U.S. government, it is in the public domain in the United States.\n\nIn researching the \"Factbook\", the CIA uses the sources listed below.

However, the CIA requests that it be cited when the \"Factbook\" is used. Copying the official seal of the CIA without permission is prohibited by U.S. federal law—specifically, the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 ().\n\nBefore November 2001 \"The World Factbook\" website was updated yearly; from 2004 to 2010 it was updated every two weeks; since 2010 it has been updated weekly. Generally, information currently available as of January 1 of the current year is used in preparing the \"Factbook\".\n\nThe first, classified, edition of \"Factbook\" was published in August 1962, and the first unclassified version in June 1971. \"The World Factbook\" was first available to the public in print in 1975. In 2008 the CIA discontinued printing the \"Factbook\" themselves, instead turning printing responsibilities over to the Government Printing Office. This happened due to a CIA decision to \"focus Factbook resources\" on the online edition. The \"Factbook\" has been on the World Wide Web since October 1994. The web version receives an average of 6 million visits per month; it can also be downloaded. The official printed version is sold by the Government Printing Office and National Technical Information Service. In past years, the \"Factbook\" was available on CD-ROM, microfiche, magnetic tape, and floppy disk.\n\nMany Internet sites use information and images from the CIA \"World Factbook\". Several publishers, including Grand River Books, Potomac Books (formerly known as Brassey's Inc.), and Skyhorse Publishing have re-published the \"Factbook\" in recent years.\n\nAs of July 2011, \"The World Factbook\" consists of 267 entities. These entities can be divided into categories. They are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Factbook is full of usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and out-of-date information, which are often repeated elsewhere due to the \"Factbook\"s widespread use as a reference. For example, Albania was until recently, described in the \"Factbook\" as 70% Muslim, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholic, which was based on a survey conducted in 1939, before World War II; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures. Another example is Singapore, which the \"Factbook\" states has a total fertility rate of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78. This low and inaccurate value then gets cited in news articles which state that Singapore has the world's lowest fertility, or at least use the figure for its shock value. Another serious problem is that the Factbook never cites its sources, making verification of the information it presents difficult if not impossible.\n\nIn June 2009, National Public Radio (NPR), relying on information obtained from the \"CIA World Factbook\", put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on State Department and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digital, said, \"I'm surprised and displeased, and it makes me wonder what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA \"World Factbook\".\"\n\nScholars have acknowledged that some entries in the \"Factbook\" are out of date.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27922365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27922365", "title": "Turingery", "text": "Turingery\n\nTuringery or Turing's Method (playfully dubbed Turingismus by Peter Ericsson, Peter Hilton and Donald Michie) was a hand codebreaking method devised in July 1942 by the mathematician and cryptanalyst Alan Turing at the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park during World War II. It was for use in cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher produced by the SZ40 and SZ42 teleprinter rotor stream cipher machines, one of the Germans' \"Geheimschreiber\" (secret writer) machines. The British codenamed non-Morse traffic \"Fish\", and that from this machine \"Tunny\".\n\nReading a Tunny message required firstly that the logical structure of the system was known, secondly that the periodically changed pattern of active cams on the wheels was derived, and thirdly that the starting positions of the scrambler wheels for this message—the message key—was established. The logical structure of Tunny had been worked out by William Tutte and colleagues over several months ending in January 1942. Deriving the message key was called \"setting\" at Bletchley Park, but it was the derivation of the cam patterns—which was known as \"wheel breaking\"—that was the target of Turingery. \n\nGerman operator errors in transmitting more than one message with the same key, producing a \"depth\", allowed the derivation of that key. Turingery was applied to such a key stream to derive the cam settings.\n\nThe logical functioning of the Tunny system was worked out well before the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts saw one of the machines—which only happened in 1945, shortly before the allied victory in Europe.\n\nThe SZ machines were 12-wheel rotor cipher machines which implemented a Vernam stream cipher. They were attached in-line to standard Lorenz teleprinters. The message characters were encoded in the 5-bit International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). The output ciphertext characters were generated by combining a pseudorandom character-by-character key stream with the input characters using the \"exclusive or (XOR)\" function (symbolised by ⊕ ).\n\nSimilarly, for deciphering, the ciphertext was combined with the same key to give the plaintext.\n\nThis produces the essential reciprocity to allow the same machine with the same settings to be used for both enciphering and deciphering.\n\nEach of the five bits of the key for each character was generated by the relevant wheels in two parts of the machine. These were termed the \"chi\" (formula_1) wheels, and the \"psi\" (formula_2) wheels. The \"chi\" wheels all moved on one position for each character. The \"psi\" wheels also all moved together, but not after each character. Their movement was controlled by the two \"mu\" (formula_3) or \"motor\" wheels. \n\nThe key stream generated by the SZ machines thus had a \"chi\" component and a \"psi\" component that were combined together with the XOR function. So, the key that was combined with the plaintext for enciphering—or with the ciphertext for deciphering—can be represented as follows.\n\nSymbolically: \n\nThe twelve wheels each had a series of cams (or \"pins\") around them. These cams could be set in a raised or lowered position. In the raised position they generated a \"mark\" ' x ' (1 in binary), in the lowered position they generated a \"space\" ' • ' (0 in binary). The number of cams on each wheel equalled the number of impulses needed to cause them to complete a full rotation. It should be noted that these numbers are all co-prime with each other, giving the longest possible time before the pattern repeated. With a total of 501 cams this equals 2 which is approximately 10, an astronomically large number. However, if the five impulses are considered independently, the numbers are much more manageable. The product of the rotation period of any pair of \"chi\" wheels gives numbers between 41×31=1271 and 26×23=598.\n\nCryptanalysis often involves finding patterns of some sort that provide a way into eliminating a range of key possibilities. At Bletchley Park the XOR combination of the values of two adjacent letters in the key or the ciphertext was called the difference (symbolised by the Greek letter \"delta\" 'Δ') because XOR is the same as modulo 2 subtraction (without \"borrow\")—and, incidentally, modulo 2 addition (without \"carry\"). So, for the characters in the key(K), the difference ΔK was obtained as follows, where underline indicates the succeeding character:\n\nThe relationship amongst them applies when they are differenced. For example, as well as: \n\nIt is the case that:\n\nIf the plaintext is represented by P and the cipertext by Z, the following also hold true:\n\nAnd:\n\nThe reason that differencing provided a way into Tunny was that, although the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext could not be distinguished from a random stream, the same was not true for a version of the ciphertext from which the \"chi\" element of the key had been removed. This is because, where the plaintext contained a repeated character and the \"psi\" wheels did not move on, the differenced \"psi\" character (Δformula_2) would be the null character (••••• or 00000), or, in Bletchley Park terminology, '/ '. When XOR-ed with any character, this null character has no effect, so in these circumstances, Δformula_1 = ΔK. Repeated characters in the plaintext were more frequent, both because of the characteristics of German (EE, TT, LL and SS are relatively common), and because telegraphists frequently repeated the figures-shift and letters-shift characters as their loss in an ordinary telegraph message could lead to gibberish.\n\nTo quote the General Report on Tunny:Turingery introduced the principle that the key differenced at one, now called ΔΚ, could yield information unobtainable from ordinary key. This Δ principle was to be the fundamental basis of nearly all statistical methods of wheel-breaking and setting.\n\nAs well as applying differencing to the full 5-bit characters of the ITA2 code, it was also applied to the individual impulses (bits). So, for the first impulse, that was enciphered by wheels formula_1 and formula_2, differenced at one: \nAnd for the second impulse:\nAnd so on. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the periodicity of the \"chi\" and \"psi\" wheels for each impulse (41 and 43 respectively for the first one) is reflected in its pattern of ΔK. However, given that the \"psi\" wheels did not advance for every input character, as did the \"chi\" wheels, it was not simply a repetition of the pattern every 41 × 43 = 1763 characters for ΔK, but a more complex sequence.\n\nIn July 1942 Turing spent a few weeks in the Research Section. He had become interested in the problem of breaking Tunny from the keys that had been obtained from depths. In July, he developed the method of deriving the cam settings from a length of key. It involved an iterative, almost trial-and-error, process. It relied on the fact that when the differenced \"psi\" character is the null character (••••• or 00000), /, then XOR-ing this with any other character does not change it. Thus the delta key character gives the character of the five \"chi\" wheels (i.e. Δformula_1 = ΔK).\n\nGiven that the delta \"psi\" character was the null character half of the time on average, an assumption that ΔK = Δformula_1 had a 50% chance of being correct. The process started by treating a particular ΔK character as being the Δformula_1 for that position. The resulting putative bit pattern of x and • for each \"chi\" wheel, was recorded on a sheet of paper that contained as many columns as there were characters in the key, and five rows representing the five impulses of the Δformula_1. Given the knowledge from Tutte's work, of the periodicity of each of the wheels, this allowed the propagation of these values at the appropriate positions in the rest of the key. \n\nA set of five sheets, one for each of the \"chi\" wheels, was also prepared. These contained a set of columns corresponding in number to the cams for the appropriate \"chi\" wheel, and were referred to as a 'cage'. So the formula_1 cage had 29 such columns. Successive 'guesses' of Δformula_1 values then produced further putative cam state values. These might either agree or disagree with previous assumptions, and a count of agreements and disagreements was made on these sheets. Where disagreements substantially outweighed agreements, the assumption was made that the Δformula_2 character was not the null character /, so the relevant assumption was discounted. Progressively, all the cam settings of the \"chi\" wheels were deduced, and from them the \"psi\" and motor wheel cam settings.\n\nAs experience of the method developed, improvements were made that allowed it to be used with much shorter lengths of key than the original 500 or so characters.\n\n\n"}

It is a strong community of forum users who frequent the site. The website is regulated by an administrator and moderators which are privileged members who can edit and delete other users comments. Moderators are users that are rewarded for being particularly helpful and knowledgeable in a specific subject and are responsible for moderating forums that focus on the subject they specialize in. Inappropriate words used to be censored by a computer that searched for and replaced undesired words posted within the community, until September 1, 2015, when censorship of curse and swear words was lifted on the website. Community members may also create guitar lessons, and have their approved works published on the website and read by its users.

UG Profiles can be used for networking, advertising gear, and bands in a similar way to other sites such as MySpace; unlike other networking sites, UG Profiles are focused on those who share the interest of guitar, or to a lesser extent, bass. Users are able to add profiles for each of their bands, upload pictures of themselves, as well as gear, display their \"guitar skills\", join groups of interest, and add other users to their friends list. At one time the site featured MP3 functionality, allowing users to upload their own recordings to their profiles, however that feature was disabled as of September 1, 2014 due to lack of use and legal liability in the case of copyright violations.\n\nIn late 2004–05, after taborama and mxtabs.net began closing due to legal threats from the Music Publishers Association of America, UG saw a surge of new users flock to the community. UG was not affected by the MPA legal actions, since UG has license agreements with thousands of publishers, including Sony, EMI, Peermusic, Alfred, Hal Leonard, Faber and Music Sales, through which the songwriters receive compensation for the display of the tabs.\n\nOn April 10, 2010, Ultimate Guitar entered a licensing agreement with Harry Fox Agency.

{"id": "1366582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1366582", "title": "Vienna Dioscurides", "text": "Vienna Dioscurides\n\nThe Vienna Dioscurides or Vienna Dioscorides is an early 6th-century Byzantine Greek illuminated manuscript of \"De Materia Medica\" (Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς in the original Greek) by Dioscorides in uncial script. It is an important and rare example of a late antique scientific text. The 491 vellum folios measure 37 by 30 cm and contain more than 400 pictures of animals and plants, most done in a naturalistic style. In addition to the text by Dioscorides, the manuscript has appended to it the \"Carmen de herbis\" attributed to Rufus, a paraphrase of an ornithological treatise by a certain Dionysius, usually identified with Dionysius of Philadelphia, and a paraphrase of Nicander's treatise on the treatment of snake bites.\n\nThe manuscript was created in about 515 AD in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire's capital, Constantinople, for a resident byzantine imperial princess, Anicia Juliana, the daughter of Anicius Olybrius, who had been one of the last of the Western Roman Emperors. The manuscript is accordingly now called the Juliana Anicia Codex by scholars. Although it was created as a luxury copy, in later centuries it was used daily as a textbook in the imperial hospital of Constantinople, and a medieval note records that a Greek nurse there, named Nathanael, had it rebound in 1406. After residing in Constantinople for just over a thousand years, the text passed to the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna in the 1500s, a century after the city fell to the Ottomans.\n\nThroughout the Byzantine period the manuscript was used as the original for copies of the work that were given to foreign leaders, including the Arabic edition of Abd al-Rahman III of Spain for the creation of which the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII sent a Greek copy and a translator. A note recording the name of one Michael of the Varangian Guard is also found in the text.\n\nThe manuscript was restored and a table of contents and extensive scholia added in Byzantine Greek minuscule, by the patriarchal notary John Chortasmenos in 1406. In the mid 1400s it was used to create the Pope Alexander VII Dioscorides, now in the Vatican Library, by the monks of St. John the Baptist Greek orthodox monastery in Constantinople. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 a subsequent owner handwrote each plant's name in Arabic and Hebrew. The manuscript, still in Istanbul a century after the fall of the city, was purchased from Moses Hamon, the Arabic-speaking, Jewish physician to sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, by the Flemish diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who was in the employ of Emperor Ferdinand I of the Austrian Habsburgs. The manuscript is now held in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna, where it is identified as the \"Codex Vindobonensis med. gr. 1.\"\" The manuscript was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 1997 in recognition of its historical significance.\n\nThe manuscript has 383 extant full-page illustrations of plants out of the original 435 illustrations. The illustrations fall into two groups. There are those that faithfully follow earlier classical models and present a quite naturalistic illustration of each plant. There are also other illustrations that are more abstract. The majority of the illustrations were painted in a naturalistic style so as to aid a pharmacologist in the recognition of each plant. However, it is believed that these illustrations were made as copies of an earlier herbal and were not drawn from nature.\n\nIn addition to the illustrations of the text, the manuscript contains several frontispieces in the form of a series of full-page miniatures. Of special note is the dedication miniature portrait of Anicia Juliana on folio 6 verso. (See .) The manuscript was presented to Anicia out of gratitude for her funding the construction of a church in the suburbs of Constantinople. This portrait is the oldest extant dedication portrait. The portrait has Anicia seated in a ceremonial pose distributing alms. She is flanked by personifications of Magnanimity and Prudence. At her feet, another personification, labeled \"Gratitude of the Arts\", kneels. A putto holds a dedication copy up to Anicia. Anicia and her attendants are enclosed within an eight-point star within a circle all formed of intertwined rope. Within the outer spandrels of the star are putti, done in grisaille, working as masons and carpenters. This miniature is an altogether original creation and, with the inclusion of the personifications and the putti, shows the endurance of the classical tradition in Constantinople, despite the fact that Anicia herself was a pious Christian.\n\nThe series of frontispieces in the manuscript begins with two full-page miniatures, each having a group of seven noted pharmacologists. In the second picture (folio 3 verso, see ), the most prominent and only one sitting on a chair is Galen. He is flanked by three pairs of other physicians, seated on stones or the ground. Closest to Galen are Crateuas and Dioscurides. The second pair are Apollonius Mys and Nicander. Farthest from Galen are Andreas and Rufus. Each of the figures is a self-contained portrait and was probably modeled on authors' portraits from the various authors' treatises. The seven figures are contained within an elaborate decorated frame. The background is solid gold, which places the figures in an abstract space. This is the earliest known manuscript to use a solid gold background.\n\nFollowing the two miniatures of seven pharmacologists, there are two author portraits. In the second portrait (see ), Dioscurides sits writing in a codex on his lap. He is shown in profile, which corresponds to the portrait in the previous miniature. It is possible that there was a tradition based on Dioscurides' life portrait that the images are based on. In front of Dioscurides is an artist, seated at a lower level, painting an illustration of the mandrake root. He is painting from nature. The mandrake root he is looking at is held by the personification of Epinoia (the power of thought). There is architectural background consisting of a colonnade with a central niche.\n\nThe paraphrase of the treatise on birds by Dionysius is in three books. The first two books have illustrations of the birds inserted into the text columns without frame or background (for example, see ). The third book has 24 birds arranged in a grid on a full-page miniature (see illustration above). The birds portrayed throughout the treatise are of high artistic merit and are faithful to nature in form and color. Most of the birds are easily identifiable. Some of the birds contained in the full-page miniature in the third book are not described in the text of the paraphrase. It is probable that these illustrations are based on the illustrations from an older, different treatise, possibly that of Alexander of Myndus. This manuscript, however, is the oldest surviving illustrated treatise on birds.\n\n\n"}

It compares both required time and compression ratio of measured applications, with those of a \"de facto\" standard according to the data type. It was developed by Tsachy Weissman, a professor at Stanford University, and Vinith Misra, a graduate student, at the request of producers for HBO's television series \"Silicon Valley\", about a fictional tech start-up.\n\nThe formula is the following; where \"r\" is the compression ratio, \"T\" is the time required to compress, the overlined ones are the same metrics for a standard compressor, and alpha is a scaling constant.\nformula_1\n\nWeissman score was used in Dropbox Tech Blog to explain real-world work on lossless compression.\n\nThis example shows the score for the data of Hutter Prize, using the paq8f as a standard and 1 as the scaling constant.\nAlthough the value is relative to the standards against which it is compared, the unit used to measure the times changes the score (see examples 1 and 2), and the multiplier also can't have a numeric value of 1 or less, because the logarithm of 1 is 0 (examples 3 and 4), and the logarithm of any value less than 1 is negative (examples 5 and 6); that would result in scores of value 0 (even with changes), undefined, or negative (even if better than positive).\n\n"}

() is a Mexican 1997 documentary film written and directed by Carlos Marcovich. The film is about Yuliet Ortega, a teenage prostitute who lives in Havana, Cuba and Fabiola Quiroz, a Mexican model. Marcovich intentionally misspelled the title character, \"Yuliet Ortega\", as \"Juliette Ortega\" in the credits.\n\nMarcovich met Fabiola Quiroz during the shooting of a music video. He met Yuliet Ortega in Cuba and decided that she would be the younger sister of Quiroz in the music video. Marcovich features the similarities of the two women: green eyes and persistent thoughts about their missing fathers. After shooting the music video, he filmed the two women over a period of three years and created the film, \"Who the Hell is Juliette?\"\n\nThe film was filmed in Cuba, Mexico, and the United States.\n\n\"Who the Hell is Juliette?\" begins with Yuliet Ortega saying that her name on the title card, Juliette Ortega, is misspelled and demanding that it is corrected. The director immediately complies and the card is corrected to Yuliet Ortega. Ortega is a 16-year-old girl who is being taken care of by her grandmother. Her mother committed suicide, while her father left his family and went to the United States. Ortega became a jinetera to support herself.\n\nDuring the shooting of a music video, Ortega meets 23-year-old Fabiola Quiroz who is a Mexican model. Both Quiroz and Ortega have been abandoned by their fathers and are deeply scarred by what has happened.\n\nDirector Carlos Marcovich organizes a reunion for Ortega and her father, who lives in New Jersey.\n\nFinally, to save Ortega from street prostitution, Fabiola Quiroz helps her arrange a modeling interview.\n\nSalma Hayek and Francesco Clemente make guest appearances in the documentary.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" called the film the \"artiest home movie ever made\" and was critical about how the subtitles appeared and disappeared too quickly to be easily read. On the other hand, the \"New York Daily News\" called the film \"a great example of what happens when a film maker follows a subject that intrigues him rather than a pre-set program\".\n\nThe documentary received two Ariel Awards. At the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, it received the Latin American Cinema Award.\n\n"}
