The 20th and most recent edition, published in 1991, was over 1200 pages long.\n\nThe reference work was compiled by William Raimond Baird (1848-1917), an 1878 graduate of the Stevens Institute of Technology. He exhaustively researched other fraternal organizations when he was seeking a suitable partner to merge with his own Alpha Sigma Chi. He eventually selected Beta Theta Pi, which absorbed ΑΣΧ in 1879. As no authoritative resource on the subject existed, Baird published his research for the benefit of the public as \"American College Fraternities\".\n\nBaird and Beta Theta Pi held the rights for some time before selling them to George Banta, publisher of \"Banta's Greek Exchange\". The Banta Publishing Company of Menasha, Wisconsin released several editions before spinning the publication off to the Baird's Manual Foundation, which published editions in 1977 and 1991.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It strives to provide a comprehensive curated resource for all major model organism species while attempting to remove redundancy to create a single mapping of data. Users of The BioGRID can search for their protein or publication of interest and retrieve annotation, as well as curated data as reported, by the primary literature and compiled by in house large-scale curation efforts. The BioGRID is hosted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Dallas, Texas, United States and is partnered with the Saccharomyces Genome Database. The BioGRID is funded by the BBSRC, NIH, and CIHR. BioGRID is a member of the International Molecular Exchange Consortium (IMEx).\n\nThe BioGRID was originally published and released as simply the General Repository for Interaction Datasets but was later renamed to the BioGRID in order to more concisely describe the project, and help distinguish it from several GRID Computing projects with a similar name. Originally separated into organism specific databases, the newest version now provides a unified front end allowing for searches across several organisms simultaneously. The BioGRID was developed initially as a project at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital but has since expanded to include teams at the Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et en Cancérologie at the Université de Montréal, the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, and the Wellcome Trust Center for Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh. The BioGRID's original focus was on curation of binary protein-protein and genetic interactions, but has expanded over several updates to incorporate curated post-translational modification data, chemical interaction data, and complex multi-gene/protein interactions. Moreover, on a monthly basis, the BioGRID continues to expand curated data and also develop and release new tools, data from comprehensive targeted curation projects, and perform targeted scientific analysis.\n\nThe Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) is an open access database that houses genetic and protein interactions curated from the primary biomedical literature for all major model organism species and humans. , the BioGRID contains 749,912 interactions as drawn from 43,149 publications that represent 30 model organisms. BioGRID data are freely distributed through partner model organism databases and meta-databases and are directly downloadable in a variety of formats. In addition to general curation of the published literature for the major model species, BioGRID undertakes themed curation projects in areas of particular relevance for biomedical sciences, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system and various human disease-associated interaction networks. BioGRID curation is coordinated through an Interaction Management System (IMS) that facilitates the compilation interaction records through structured evidence codes, phenotype ontologies, and gene annotation. The BioGRID architecture has been improved in order to support a broader range of interaction and post-translational modification types, to allow the representation of more complex multi-gene/protein interactions, to account for cellular phenotypes through structured ontologies, to expedite curation through semi-automated text-mining approaches, and to enhance curation quality control. Through comprehensive curation efforts, BioGRID now includes a virtually complete set of interactions reported to date in the primary literature for budding yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"), thale cress (\"Arabidopsis thaliana\"), and fission yeast (\"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\").\n\nThe following organisms are currently supported within the BioGRID, and each has curated interaction data available according to the latest statistics.\n\nBioGRID is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.\n\n"}

It has a reputation for tackling destinations overlooked by other guide book publishers. Bradt guides have been cited by The Independent as covering \"parts of the world other travel publishers don't reach\", and nearly two-thirds of the guides on the publisher's list have no direct competition in English from other travel publishers. \n\nThese include guides to parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa, in particular, which traditionally have not been widely covered by guidebook publishers, or do not have a long history of tourism. Bradt also has an extensive list of regional European guides to destinations such as the Peloponnese, the Vendee and the Basque Country.\n\nThe guides give a brief summary of the history of the destination. Each guide then covers the basics such as geography and climate, wildlife, languages and culture, healthcare and media. Subsequent chapters are usually arranged on a geographical basis, addressing the main cities or regions of the destination in systematic order. According to Michael Palin: \"Bradt Guides are expertly written and longer on local detail than any others\".\n\nBradt guides are often written by writers who live in the country or region they are writing about or have travelled there extensively over many years, rather than professional travel writers. As such, they may be written somewhat unconventionally compared with normal tourist guides. Bradt guides often relay information about the nature of the local people, based on the experiences of the author. The health chapters are written in collaboration with a well-travelled doctor: Jane Wilson-Howarth or Felicity Nicholson.\n\nIn 2010 Bradt launched the Slow Travel series of UK regional guides, now 16 titles strong.

In recent editions it has been in two volumes, volume 1 being individual compounds and hazardous reactions, volume 2 being groups and other information relevant to reactive chemical hazards, arranged by topic.\n\nIn 1964, research chemist Leslie Bretherick read of a violent explosion in a laboratory, and knew that the same journal had reported a similar incident with the same chemicals 16 years earlier. Realising that there was no central source of literature on dangerous chemical reactions, he set out to create one, combing through the literature in his spare time. In 1971 his employers (BP) allowed him to do this in half his work time and a book was published in 1975 entitled \"Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards\". The work involved creating what was effectively a database on paper of substances and literature references, arranged by empirical formula, and converting this into a book.\nThis was well received as “an invaluable reference work” One reviewer wrote ““Bretherick” (the name under which this book must surely become known)”. A revised second edition followed in 1979, with a reviewer stating “that “Bretherick” is an essential first reference” As well as corrections and additional reactions, this contained a new section dealing with groups of compounds and some other matters.\nA third edition followed in 1985, Bretherick having retired in 1982 in order to work full-time on the project.\nIn the preface to the 4th edition (1989) he announced that his eyesight was failing. As a result, he did not contribute new material to further editions, which was done by others. The 5th edition (1995) was edited by Peter G. Urben and as the book was larger, was split into two volumes. \nLeslie Bretherick died in April 2003\nThe 6th edition (1999), the 7th edition (2007) and the 8th edition (2017) were also edited by Urben.\n\nA version of the 4th edition was also made available on floppy disks in the form of a database, allowing searches for hazard by class or topic and also partial name. Subsequent editions were supported by an equivalent on CD-ROM. The difficulties of converting the book into a database have been described.\n"}

{"id": "57588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57588", "title": "Cigarette card", "text": "Cigarette card\n\nCigarette cards are trade cards issued by tobacco manufacturers to stiffen cigarette packaging and advertise cigarette brands.\n\nBeginning in 1875, cards depicting actresses, baseball players, Indian chiefs, and boxers were issued by the U.S.-based Allen and Ginter tobacco company. These are considered to be some of the first cigarette cards. Other tobacco companies such as Goodwin & Co. soon followed suit. They first emerged in the U.S., then the UK, then, eventually, in many other countries.\n\nIn the UK, W.D. & H.O. Wills in 1887 were one of the first companies to include advertising cards with their cigarettes, but it was John Player & Sons in 1893 that produced one of the first general interest sets 'Castles and Abbeys'. Thomas Ogden soon followed in 1894 and in 1895, Wills produced their first set 'Ships and Sailors', followed by 'Cricketers' in 1896. In 1906, Ogden's produced a set of football cards depicting footballers in their club colours, in one of the first full-colour sets.\n\nEach set of cards typically consisted of 25 or 50 related subjects, but series of over 100 cards per issue are known. Popular themes were 'beauties' (famous actresses, film stars and models), sporters (in the U.S. mainly baseball, in the rest of the world mainly football and cricket), nature, military heroes and uniforms, heraldry and city views.\n\nToday, for example, sports and military historians study these cards for details on uniform design.\n\nSome very early cigarette cards were printed on silk which was then attached to a paper backing. They were discontinued in order to save paper during World War II, and never fully reintroduced thereafter.\n\nEarly in 2007, a world record price was paid in America for a single card – $2,350,000. This card was resold later in the year for another world record price, $2,800,000. The card in question featured Honus Wagner, one of the great names in U.S. baseball at the turn of the 20th century. Wagner was a dedicated non-smoker and objected when America's biggest tobacco corporation planned to picture him on a cigarette card without his permission. Threats of legal action prevented its release, but a few slipped out, and it was one of these that stunned the collecting world when it was auctioned.\n\nAnother notable and sought-after set of cards is the untitled series issued by Taddy and known by collectors as \"Clowns and Circus Artistes\". While not the rarest cards in existence (there are a number of series in which only one known example remains), they are still very rare and command high prices whenever they come up for auction.\n\nThe Mecca cigarette trading card for George Sutton is also notable for it depicts him with hands. Sutton was known as \"the handless billiard player\" for mastering the game with such a handicap.\n\nThe system devised to codify 19th Century American tobacco issues has its origin in the 'American Card Catalog' (ACC), written by Jefferson Burdick. Burdick listed the American Tobacco Cards in one section, broken down by companies that issued the card series and by the types of cards. The 19th Century issues were prefixed with 'N' (N1-N694) and the 20th with 'T'. (T1-T235).\n\nThe World Tobacco Index (WTI), published by the Cartophilic Society of Great Britain (CSGB), lists all known tobacco issues from around the world and is still being updated today on reports of new finds. Using a similar alphanumeric system, it assigns a code based on the name of manufacturer, rather than the century in which the cards were issued. For example, Burdick's N2 'Celebrated American Indian Chiefs' by Allen & Ginter is listed as A400-030 (a), with the larger N42 series listed as A400-030 (b). More info : CSGB\n\nThe catalogue contains details of cigarette cards and silks issued at home and abroad from the 19th century to the present day, quoting up-to-date values for cards in top condition. The original price guide now in its 84th year of publication. The catalogue has reference numbers to cross reference with the British Tobacco Issues Handbook, Ogdens, G Phillips and Wills reference books giving information for British Tobacco series which will be a great help to collectors to identify cards especially unnumbered or untitled series. More info : Cigarette Card Catalogue\n\nThe catalogue gives an up-to-date price guide for odd cards, sets and special albums. First published in 1974, this catalogue is devoted entirely to non-tobacco cards plus a section, which details over 350 reprinted series. The catalogue covers a magnificent selection of well over 6,000 series by non-tobacco firms, such as Brooke Bond Tea, Bassett, A & BC Gum, Topps, as well as the newer companies like Rittenhouse, Inkworks, Golden Era, Rockwell, Hunter etc. Cards from the early 1900s by Fry and Cadbury right up to the latest series of Harry Potter, Star Wars TV & Films, Cricket, Footballers, Military, Motoring etc. More info : Trade Card Catalogue\n\nAs well as the series title and manufacturer, cards may also exhibit different back varieties to advertise the different brands of cigarette produced by a firm. For example, the English manufacturer Edwards, Ringer and Bigg's 1917 'War Map of the Western Front' was issued with both 'Exmoor Hunt' and 'New York Mixture' tobacco advertised on the backs. Whilst this was commonplace, the number of varieties varies greatly between manufacturers; F. & J. Smith's 1913 series entitled 'Battlefields of Great Britain' for example has 15 different backs.\n\nDoral, an R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company brand, started printing cigarette cards in the year 2000. These were the first cigarette cards from a major manufacturer since the 1940s., although the small company Carreras in the UK issued cigarette cards with Turf brand cigarettes for a short period in the 1950s and 1960s, Black Cat brand in 1976. Furthermore, card-like coupons with special offers have often been included in cigarette packets over the years.\n\nThe first set of \"Doral Celebrate America\" cards featured the 50 states in two releases, 2000 and 2001. Later themes include American festivals, cars, national parks, and 20th century events.\n\nNatural American Spirit, another R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company brand, also includes cigarette cards on their packs, with information on such things as windpower, diversity, and their farmers.\n\nPhilip Morris USA started including \"Information For Smokers\" cigarette cards in certain packs. One provides information on quitting smoking and the other states that \"Light, \"Ultra Light\", \"Mild\", \"Medium\", and \"Low Tar\" cigarettes are just as harmful as \"Full Flavor\" ones.\n\nThe largest cigarette card collection on record is that of Edward Wharton-Tigar. His collection, bequeathed to the British Museum following his death in 1995, is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the largest collection of its kind. His autobiography, \"Burning Bright\", details both his obsession with collecting cigarette cards, as well as his business life, which included becoming President of Selection Trust – at the time, one of the largest mining companies in the world – as well as his lifelong passion for cricket, which culminated in his presidency of Kent Cricket Club. When asked what others thought of his collecting he said the following:\n\n'If to collect cigarette cards is a sign of eccentricity, how then will posterity judge one who amassed the biggest collection in the world? Frankly, I care not'.\n\nHe was the president of the Cartophilic Society of Great Britain until his death in 1995.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "380406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=380406", "title": "Comparative psychology", "text": "Comparative psychology\n\nComparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species from insects to primates.\n\nComparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single organism to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both proximate and ultimate causation. \n\nUsing a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen. First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.\n\nThird, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see Tinbergen's four questions.\n\nThe 9th century scholar al-Jahiz wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants. The 11th century Arabic writer Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote the \"Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals\", an early treatise dealing with the effects of music on an imals. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of music, and shows other examples of how music can affect animal behavior, experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the Western world continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.\n\nCharles Darwin was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of \"pre-\" and \"post-Darwin\" because his contributions were so influential. theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the \"anecdotal movement\" led by George Romanes who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a \"rudimentary human mind\". Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched anthropomorphism.\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. Douglas Alexander Spalding was called the \"first experimental biologist\", and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. Jacques Loeb emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, Sir John Lubbock is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and Conwy Lloyd Morgan is thought to be \"the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word\".\n\nThroughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term \"comparative psychology\" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.\n\nA persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare. However, the definition of \"intelligence\" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism, and focuses on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation are plagued with practical and theoretical problems. In the literature, \"intelligence\" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. echolocation). Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).\n\nA wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. Ivan Pavlov's early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. Thorndike began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical rat, which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.\n\nSkinner introduced the use of pigeons, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of primate; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by Harry F. Harlow's studies of maternal deprivation in rhesus monkeys. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named Gua was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended 9 months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.\n\nNonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee Washoe 350 words in American Sign Language. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, Loulis. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated. All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.\n\nInterest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be intelligent have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of corvid, parrots — especially the grey parrot — and dolphins. Alex (Avian Learning EXperiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg, who found that the African gray parrot Alex did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid found that a Border Collie named Chaser was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.\n\nResearchers who study animal cognition are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans. For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and animal cognition are heavily overlapping research categories.\n\nVeterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.\n\nCommon causes of disordered behavior in captive or pet animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, rats who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human psychosis, like biting their owners.\n\nThe way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the breed as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, huskies have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity. Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.\n\nThe systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on ethological studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.\n\nThe relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. Domestication has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.\nIngold remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as \"not people,\" and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: \"Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals.\" With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who isn't, that is, the outsider.\n\n\"The New York Times\" ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals, more specifically of children with their pets. It's been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, \"It made the children more cooperative and sharing.\" It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.\n\nFurthermore, in an edition of \"Social Science and Medicine\" it was stated, \"A random survey of 339 residents from Perth, Western Australia were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales.\" Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.\n\nNoted comparative psychologists, in this broad sense, include:\n\nMany of these were active in fields other than animal psychology; this is characteristic of comparative psychologists.\n\nFields of psychology and other disciplines that draw upon, or overlap with, comparative psychology include:\n\n\n"}

Their main difference is that while Esperanto is a schematic language, with an invarying grammar, Novial is a naturalistic language, whose grammar and vocabulary varies to try to retain a \"natural\" sound. Demographically, Esperanto has thousands of times more speakers than Novial.\n\nBoth Esperanto and Novial are written using versions of the Latin alphabet. The Esperanto alphabet has 28 letters: 22 without diacritics and 6 with diacritics unique to Esperanto: \"ĉ\", \"ĝ\", \"ĥ\", \"ĵ\", \"ŝ\" and \"ŭ\". Novial uses the standard 26 letters of the Latin alphabet with no diacritics. \n\nIn Esperanto one letter corresponds to one phoneme and one phoneme to one letter: there are no digraphs. Novial has 3 digraphs: \"ch\", \"sh\" and \"qu\"; \"c\" and \"q\" are unique to these digraphs (except in foreign proper nouns) and permit no ambiguity; when \"s\" and \"h\" are separate phonemes this is indicated by separating with a hyphen: \"s-h\". Novial permits some 2-vowel combinations to be pronounced either as 2 separate vowels or as diphthongs; for example, \"au\", \"eu\" and \"oi\" may be pronounced as \"a + w\", \"e + w\" and \"o + y\", respectively, and \"ie\", \"io\" and \"ia\" as \"y + e\", \"y + o\" and \"y + a\", respectively.\n\nIn handwriting neither Esperanto nor Novial presents any problem. However, the diacritics of Esperanto require special methods for typing and printing. The original method was a set of digraphs now known as the \"h-system\", but with the rise of computer word processing a so-called \"x-system\" has become equally popular. These systems are described in the article Esperanto orthography. However, with the advent of Unicode, the need for such work-arounds has lessened.\n\nThe personal pronouns of Esperanto all end in \"i\" and some may be difficult to distinguish in a noisy environment (especially \"mi\" and \"ni\"). The personal pronouns of Novial use various vowels making them more distinct, although some differ only in the initial consonant (e.g. \"nus\", \"vus\" and \"lus\"). A later form of \"nus\" – \"nos\", more distinct from \"vus\" – has sometimes been used. Novial does not distinguish familiar and polite forms of “you” (e.g. French \"tu\" and \"vous\"). Novial’s inventor argued that such a distinction has no place in a language intended solely for international use. The distinction is available in Esperanto but is little used in practice. \n\nThe Novial system displays a systematic correspondence between singular and corresponding plural forms (i.e. \"vu\", \"vus\"; \"lo\", \"los\"; \"la\", \"las\"; \"lu\", \"lus\"; \"le\", \"les\"). Strictly speaking \"we\" is not the plural of \"I\", because \"many I’s\" is nonsensical. Jespersen suggested that \"nu\", the singular of \"nus\", could be used as a \"royal we\". The optional marking of sex in Novial, especially in the third person plural, permits greater flexibility than in Esperanto, at least in this case. Exactly the same system is applied to other pronouns and to nouns with natural sex differences.\n\nThe system of sex marking for Esperanto nouns is frequently criticised for being asymmetric and male biased. In contrast Novial has one symmetric, unbiased system for both nouns and pronouns which marks either male, female, epicene or inanimate.\n\nThe grammars of Novial and Esperanto differ greatly in the way that the various tenses, moods and voices of verbs are expressed. Both use a combination of auxiliary verbs and verb endings. However, Novial uses many more auxiliary verbs and few endings, while Esperanto uses only one auxiliary verb and a greater number of verb endings.\n\nIn Novial all verb forms are independent of person (1st, 2nd or 3rd persons) and number (singular or plural). In Esperanto verb forms are independent of the person but compound tenses, with participles, require the participle (which is an adjective) to agree with the subject of the verb in number (singular or plural). \n\nThe continuous tenses are less common in both Esperanto and Novial than in English.\n\nIn the following table endings are separated from stems by hyphens. Alternative forms with the same meaning are in brackets. In the Esperanto forms (j) indicates agreement when the subject of the verb is plural.\n\nThe difference between the passive of becoming and the passive of being is not always immediately obvious to English speakers because their forms can often be the same. However, in English the passive of becoming is often expressed with the verb \"get\" in the sense of \"become\" as well as with the verb \"be\". \n\nEsperanto uses an appropriate form of the auxiliary verb \"esti\" (\"to be\") followed by a passive participle (present, past or future according to sense). With many verbs Esperanto may, instead of the passive voice, use the suffix \"-iĝ-\" to form an intransitive verb of becoming, which is conjugated in the active voice (see table below).\n\nNovial uses the auxiliary verb \"bli\" (\"to get, become, be\" from the equivalent auxiliary verb \"bli\" in Scandinavian languages) followed by the root form of the verb. The various tenses and moods are expressed regularly using the other auxiliary verbs \"ha\", \"had\", \"sal\", \"saled\" and \"vud\", the word order corresponding to the English.\n\nThe passive voice of being is generally expressed in English with an appropriate form of the verb \"to be\" followed by the past participle. It is formed in the same way in Esperanto and Novial. Note that in contrast to the passive of becoming, in the Novial passive of being the auxiliary verb is followed by the past participle, which ends in \"-t\".\n\nIn Esperanto, most words are created from a set number of roots, endings, and affixes. This allows for a comparatively low number of words to be extended to a described vocabulary, resulting in easy learning. However, some argue that results in heavy reliance on common affixes. For example, Esperanto notoriously relies heavily on the prefix \"mal-\" to form the opposite of an adjective or verb. The equivalent prefix in Novial, \"des-\", is used to a much lesser degree.\n\nHere is the Lord's Prayer in both languages:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27125801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27125801", "title": "Comparison of train and tram tracks", "text": "Comparison of train and tram tracks\n\nA railway or railroad is a track where the vehicle travels over two parallel steel bars, called rails. The rails support and guide the wheels of the vehicles, which are traditionally either trains or trams. Modern light rail is a relatively new innovation which combines aspects of those two modes of transport. However fundamental differences in the track and wheel design are important, especially where trams or light railways and trains have to share a section of track, as sometimes happens in congested areas.\n\nBoth trams and trains have flanged iron wheels with a horizontal section transferring the vehicle weight to the rail and a vertical flange \"inboard\" to guide the vehicle along the rail using its inside edge.\n\nRail vehicle wheels are usually mounted on a solid axle, so they turn at the same speed. When a vehicle turns the outer wheel has to travel further than the inner wheel. On a road vehicle, this is usually achieved by allowing the wheels to move independently, and fixing the front wheels in an arrangement known as Ackermann steering geometry.\n\nTrains and trams can turn corners without wheel-slip because the outer horizontal part of the wheels has a slightly tapered rim. The guide flange (ridge) is on the inside to prevent the vehicle from slipping sideways off the rails. The horizontal (cone-shaped) rim makes contact with the slightly convex top of a steel rail in different (horizontal) places so that the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel.\n\nWith both tram and train wheels, this happens naturally because the tires are cone shaped sloping surfaces: the inside diameter is a few millimeters larger than the outside. As the track starts to curve, the train tries to run straight. The wheel flange presses against the side of the curved rail so the \"contact point\" between rail and wheel moves a few millimeters outwards, making the effective diameter of the outer wheel temporarily larger, and equally opposite: the effective diameter of the inner wheel effectively becomes temporarily smaller. This technique works well on large-radius curves which are canted, but not as well on tight curves and railway switches (also known as \"points\"). This is because the geometry or cant of the track is more difficult to optimize for every possible combination of vehicle and direction of travel.\n\nCity trams often use tight curves - sometimes with a radius of much less than about , and canting may be impossible because the surface is shared with road vehicles or pedestrian zones or sidewalks, so the track often has to be flush with the road surface or pavement. In sharp curves, the rail grooves are sometimes made very shallow, which causes the outer wheel to temporarily ride up onto the edge of its flange. This increases the wheel diameter and the curve can be taken more easily. In extreme cases, the rail has a groove so that the rim of the flange can take most of the weight, the \"out-board\" tire (on the outer radius of the outer rail) acting as no more than a vertical plate. \n\nIn contrast, a train wheel is almost never designed to transfer weight through the flange rim, and some train wheels may be damaged if this should happen even once. \n\nThe point where two straight but intersecting railroads cross is called a frog. A groove through each rail allows the wheel flanges to pass through the intersecting rails. Without countermeasures each wheel would dip into the groove and strike the frog point gap causing unacceptable wear. The point where two tracks join and the vehicle can take one of two directions is called a railway switch. This works on the same principle, except that the inner rail is almost continuous and the outer rail has a gap for the flange to pass through.\n\nWith a train this problem is solved by using a wide tire. Train rails usually cross at a shallow angle. In the middle of the interchange there is a supporting frog. The tire is guided on each side by guide rails and some portion of the tire always maintains rail contact. This method is not feasible with trams and light railways.\n\nTram tires are generally narrower than train tires. Trams use bigger crossing angles and tighter curve radii are more likely than for train tracks. To cope with this difficulty the wheels of trams temporarily transfer the weight of the tram onto the flange to reduce wear on both the frog point and the horizontal surface of the tram wheels. Train wheels are not designed to bear such weight on their flanges.\n\nA tram wheel which runs on the flange rather than on the horizontal tyre has a larger effective diameter, so the distance travelled per revolution is greater. On the outside track of the curve this is an advantage. It may be necessary to compensate the inner wheel or allow for some slippage. Modern trams and trams tend to have thicker and wider tires which allow for a greater (horizontal) conical section and so greater effective diameter variation and turning ability.\n\nAt the junctions of train tracks, the gap in the frog or switch rail is wide. So trams can be accommodated.\n\nThe main problem with a train on tram rails is the relatively narrow width of frog and switch gaps and channels of the groove rails designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels . The wider flanges of train wheels increase the risk of derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of The Hague), wider grooves are required as a compromise that is practical as wide grooved girder rail is available. A larger structure gauge would also be required This was also done in Los Angeles and in Vancouver as well as elsewhere in North America. The usually or normally limited structure gauge, and tight curves, on tram tracks will also prevent trains from using tram tracks.\n\nIn North America the groove would have to be a minimum of wide and by extension, the maximum distance between the inside faces of the guard flanges of the grooved rails can be no more than , see below. \n\nQuote: \n1. Lateral tolerance between wheels and rails \nTwo types of flanges are permitted on railroad wheels - narrow and wide. The maximum\nlateral movement T1 possible for a new wheel set centered on in-gage track is a function of\nthe flange type and is determined by the following formula: \nCAUTION: Use only English Units in Formulas in this Recommended Practice \n\nWhere: gt = standard track gage at a point “5/8” () below top of rail = 56.5\" ()\ngw = minimum gage of wheel set between backs of flanges = 53” ()\nfn = minimum thickness of new wheel flange = 1.15625” () for narrow flange or = 1.375\" () for wide flange\nQuoted from \n\nRural and suburban lines can be made compatible for use by several types of vehicles. For example, the narrow gauge railway used by Charleroi Metro in Belgium is ridden by trams, but the tracks are built to train track standards. Trams nonetheless run smoothly on the old NMVB tram net in Anderlues, where shallow groove rails are used. Between The Hague and Rotterdam, an old railway line was converted for RandstadRail into a route able to carry both the Rotterdam Metro, which uses vehicles built to train standards as well as The Hague trams which uses vehicles built to tram standards. The Electroliners which ran out of Chicago on the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, and afterwards on the Norristown High Speed Line, were another example.\n\n"}

It is the only surviving section of a much larger encyclopedia; only small parts still survive from sections on agriculture, military science, oratory, jurisprudence and philosophy. \"De Medicina\" draws upon knowledge from ancient Greek works, and is considered the best surviving treatise on Alexandrian medicine. Its \"encyclopedic arrangement follows the tripartite division of medicine at the time as established by Hippocrates and Asclepiades — diet, pharmacology, and surgery.\" This work also covers the topics of disease and therapy. Sections detail the removal of missile weapons, stopping bleeding, preventing inflammation, diagnosis of internal maladies, removal of kidney stones, the amputation of limbs and so forth.\n\nThe original work was published some time before 47 CE. It consisted of eight books in highly regarded Latin text. The subject matter is divided as follows:\nHe classified mental disorders into: Phrenitis, delirium with fever; Melancholia, depression; one due to false images and disordered judgment, presumably schizophrenia; Delirium due to fear; Lethargus, coma; and Morbus comitialis, epilepsy.

{"id": "8498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8498", "title": "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "text": "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the , produced by the WHO.\n\nThe DSM is now in its fifth edition, the DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the other common manual for mental disorders. It is distinguished from the DSM in it covers health as a whole. While the DSM is the most popular diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US, the ICD is used more in Europe and other parts of the world, giving it a far larger reach than the DSM. The DSM-IV-TR (4th. ed.) contains specific codes allowing comparisons between the DSM and the ICD manuals, which may not systematically match because revisions are not simultaneously coordinated. Though recent editions of the DSM and ICD have become similar due to collaborative agreements, each one contains information absent from the other.\n\nWhile the DSM received praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria, it also generated controversy and criticism. Critics, including the National Institute of Mental Health, argue the DSM represents an unscientific and subjective system. There are ongoing issues concerning the validity and reliability of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial symptoms; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from \"normality\"; possible cultural bias; and medicalization of human distress. The publication of the DSM, with tightly guarded copyrights, now makes APA over $5 million a year, historically totaling over $100 million.\n\nMany mental health professionals use the manual to determine and help communicate a patient's diagnosis after an evaluation; hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies in the US also often require a DSM diagnosis for all patients treated. The DSM can be used clinically in this way, and to categorize patients using diagnostic criteria for research purposes. Studies done on specific disorders often recruit patients whose symptoms match the criteria listed in the DSM for that disorder. An international survey of psychiatrists in sixty-six countries compared the use of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV; it found the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was more valued for research.\n\nDSM-5, and the abbreviations for all previous editions, are registered trademarks owned by the APA.\n\nThe initial impetus for developing a classification of mental disorders in the United States was the need to collect statistical information. The first official attempt was the 1840 census, which used a single category: \"idiocy/insanity\". Three years later, the American Statistical Association made an official protest to the U.S. House of Representatives, stating that \"the most glaring and remarkable errors are found in the statements respecting nosology, prevalence of insanity, blindness, deafness, and dumbness, among the people of this nation\", pointing out that in many towns African-Americans were all marked as insane, and calling the statistics essentially useless.\n\nThe Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane was formed in 1844, changing its name in 1892 to the American Medico-Psychological Association, and in 1921 to the present American Psychiatric Association (APA).\n\nEdward Jarvis and later Francis Amasa Walker helped expand the census, from two volumes in 1870 to twenty-five volumes in 1880. Frederick H. Wines was appointed to write a 582-page volume called \"Report on the Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent Classes of the Population of the United States, As Returned at the Tenth Census (June 1, 1880)\" (published 1888). Wines used seven categories of mental illness: dementia, dipsomania (uncontrollable craving for alcohol), epilepsy, mania, melancholia, monomania and paresis. These categories were also adopted by the Association.\n\nIn 1917, together with the National Commission on Mental Hygiene (now Mental Health America), the APA developed a new guide for mental hospitals called the \"Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane\". This included twenty-two diagnoses and would be revised several times by the APA over the years. Along with the New York Academy of Medicine, the APA also provided the psychiatric nomenclature subsection of the US general medical guide, the \"Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease\", referred to as the \"Standard\".\n\nWorld War II saw the large-scale involvement of US psychiatrists in the selection, processing, assessment, and treatment of soldiers. This moved the focus away from mental institutions and traditional clinical perspectives. A committee headed by psychiatrist Brigadier General William C. Menninger developed a new classification scheme called Medical 203, that was issued in 1943 as a War Department Technical Bulletin under the auspices of the Office of the Surgeon General. The foreword to the DSM-I states the US Navy had itself made some minor revisions but \"the Army established a much more sweeping revision, abandoning the basic outline of the Standard and attempting to express present day concepts of mental disturbance. This nomenclature eventually was adopted by all Armed Forces\", and \"assorted modifications of the Armed Forces nomenclature [were] introduced into many clinics and hospitals by psychiatrists returning from military duty.\" The Veterans Administration also adopted a slightly modified version of Medical 203.\n\nIn 1949, the World Health Organization published the sixth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD), which included a section on mental disorders for the first time. The foreword to DSM-1 states this \"categorized mental disorders in rubrics similar to those of the Armed Forces nomenclature.\" An APA Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics was empowered to develop a version specifically for use in the United States, to standardize the diverse and confused usage of different documents. In 1950, the APA committee undertook a review and consultation. It circulated an adaptation of Medical 203, the VA system, and the Standard's Nomenclature to approximately 10% of APA members. 46% replied, of which 93% approved, and after some further revisions (resulting in its being called DSM-I), the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was approved in 1951 and published in 1952. The structure and conceptual framework were the same as in Medical 203, and many passages of text were identical. The manual was 130 pages long and listed 106 mental disorders. These included several categories of \"personality disturbance\", generally distinguished from \"neurosis\" (nervousness, egodystonic).\n\nIn 1952, the APA listed homosexuality in the DSM as a sociopathic personality disturbance. \"\", a large-scale 1962 study of homosexuality by Irving Bieber and other authors, was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was very influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study comparing the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a heroine to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until May 1974.\n\nIn the 1960s, there were many challenges to the concept of mental illness itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz, who argued mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as Erving Goffman, who said mental illness was another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from behavioural psychologists who challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder. A study published in \"Science\" by Rosenhan received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nAlthough the APA was closely involved in the next significant revision of the mental disorder section of the ICD (version 8 in 1968), it decided to go ahead with a revision of the DSM. It was published in 1968, listed 182 disorders, and was 134 pages long. It was quite similar to the DSM-I. The term \"reaction\" was dropped, but the term \"neurosis\" was retained. Both the DSM-I and the DSM-II reflected the predominant psychodynamic psychiatry, although they also included biological perspectives and concepts from Kraepelin's system of classification. Symptoms were not specified in detail for specific disorders. Many were seen as reflections of broad underlying conflicts or maladaptive reactions to life problems, rooted in a distinction between neurosis and psychosis (roughly, anxiety/depression broadly in touch with reality, or hallucinations/delusions appearing disconnected from reality). Sociological and biological knowledge was incorporated, in a model that did not emphasize a clear boundary between normality and abnormality. The idea that personality disorders did not involve emotional distress was discarded.\n\nAn influential 1974 paper by Robert Spitzer and Joseph L. Fleiss demonstrated the second edition of the DSM (DSM-II) was an unreliable diagnostic tool. They found different practitioners using the DSM-II rarely agreed when diagnosing patients with similar problems. In reviewing previous studies of eighteen major diagnostic categories, Fleiss and Spitzer concluded \"there are no diagnostic categories for which reliability is uniformly high. Reliability appears to be only satisfactory for three categories: mental deficiency, organic brain syndrome (but not its subtypes), and alcoholism. The level of reliability is no better than fair for psychosis and schizophrenia and is poor for the remaining categories\".\n\nAs described by Ronald Bayer, a psychiatrist and gay rights activist, specific protests by gay rights activists against the APA began in 1970, when the organization held its convention in San Francisco. The activists disrupted the conference by interrupting speakers and shouting down and ridiculing psychiatrists who viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1971, gay rights activist Frank Kameny worked with the Gay Liberation Front collective to demonstrate against the APA's convention. At the 1971 conference, Kameny grabbed the microphone and yelled: \"Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.\"\n\nThis activism occurred in the context of a broader anti-psychiatry movement that had come to the fore in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-psychiatry activists protested at the same APA conventions, with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations.\n\nPresented with data from researchers such as Alfred Kinsey and Evelyn Hooker, the sixth printing of the DSM-II, in 1974, no longer listed homosexuality as a category of disorder. After a vote by the APA trustees in 1973, and confirmed by the wider APA membership in 1974, the diagnosis was replaced with the category of \"sexual orientation disturbance\".\n\nIn 1974, the decision to create a new revision of the DSM was made, and Robert Spitzer was selected as chairman of the task force. The initial impetus was to make the DSM nomenclature consistent with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), published by the World Health Organization. The revision took on a far wider mandate under the influence and control of Spitzer and his chosen committee members. One goal was to improve the uniformity and validity of psychiatric diagnosis in the wake of a number of critiques, including the famous Rosenhan experiment. There was also a need to standardize diagnostic practices within the US and with other countries after research showed psychiatric diagnoses differed between Europe and the US. The establishment of these criteria was an attempt to facilitate the pharmaceutical regulatory process.\n\nThe criteria adopted for many of the mental disorders were taken from the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and Feighner Criteria, which had just been developed by a group of research-orientated psychiatrists based primarily at Washington University in St. Louis and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Other criteria, and potential new categories of disorder, were established by consensus during meetings of the committee, as chaired by Spitzer. A key aim was to base categorization on colloquial English descriptive language (which would be easier to use by federal administrative offices), rather than assumptions of cause, although its categorical approach assumed each particular pattern of symptoms in a category reflected a particular underlying pathology (an approach described as \"neo-Kraepelinian\"). The psychodynamic or physiologic view was abandoned, in favor of a regulatory or legislative model. A new \"multiaxial\" system attempted to yield a picture more amenable to a statistical population census, rather than a simple diagnosis. Spitzer argued \"mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders\" but the task force decided on the DSM statement: \"Each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome.\" The personality disorders were placed on axis II along with mental retardation.\n\nThe first draft of the DSM-III was prepared within a year. It introduced many new categories of disorder, while deleting or changing others. A number of the unpublished documents discussing and justifying the changes have recently come to light. Field trials sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) were conducted between 1977 and 1979 to test the reliability of the new diagnoses. A controversy emerged regarding deletion of the concept of neurosis, a mainstream of psychoanalytic theory and therapy but seen as vague and unscientific by the DSM task force. Faced with enormous political opposition, the DSM-III was in serious danger of not being approved by the APA Board of Trustees unless \"neurosis\" was included in some capacity; a political compromise reinserted the term in parentheses after the word \"disorder\" in some cases. Additionally, the diagnosis of ego-dystonic homosexuality replaced the DSM-II category of \"sexual orientation disturbance\".\n\nFinally published in 1980, the DSM-III was 494 pages and listed 265 diagnostic categories. It rapidly came into widespread international use and has been termed a revolution or transformation in psychiatry.\n\nWhen DSM-III was published, the developers made extensive claims about the reliability of the radically new diagnostic system they had devised, which relied on data from special field trials. However, according to a 1994 article by Stuart A. Kirk:\n\nTwenty years after the reliability problem became the central focus of DSM-III, there is still not a single multi-site study showing that DSM (any version) is routinely used with high reliably by regular mental health clinicians. Nor is there any credible evidence that any version of the manual has greatly increased its reliability beyond the previous version. There are important methodological problems that limit the generalisability of most reliability studies. Each reliability study is constrained by the training and supervision of the interviewers, their motivation and commitment to diagnostic accuracy, their prior skill, the homogeneity of the clinical setting in regard to patient mix and base rates, and the methodological rigor achieved by the investigator ...\n\nIn 1987, the DSM-III-R was published as a revision of the DSM-III, under the direction of Spitzer. Categories were renamed and reorganized, and significant changes in criteria were made. Six categories were deleted while others were added. Controversial diagnoses, such as pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder and masochistic personality disorder, were considered and discarded. \"Ego-dystonic homosexuality\" was also removed and was largely subsumed under \"sexual disorder not otherwise specified\", which can include \"persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation.\" Altogether, the DSM-III-R contained 292 diagnoses and was 567 pages long. Further efforts were made for the diagnoses to be purely descriptive, although the introductory text stated for at least some disorders, \"particularly the Personality Disorders, the criteria require much more inference on the part of the observer\" (p. xxiii).\n\nIn 1994, DSM-IV was published, listing 410 disorders in 886 pages. The task force was chaired by Allen Frances. A steering committee of twenty-seven people was introduced, including four psychologists. The steering committee created thirteen work groups of five to sixteen members. Each work group had about twenty advisers. The work groups conducted a three-step process: first, each group conducted an extensive literature review of their diagnoses; then, they requested data from researchers, conducting analyses to determine which criteria required change, with instructions to be conservative; finally, they conducted multicenter field trials relating diagnoses to clinical practice. A major change from previous versions was the inclusion of a clinical significance criterion to almost half of all the categories, which required symptoms cause \"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\". Some personality disorder diagnoses were deleted or moved to the appendix.\n\nA \"text revision\" of the DSM-IV, known as the DSM-IV-TR, was published in 2000. The diagnostic categories and the vast majority of the specific criteria for diagnosis were unchanged. The text sections giving extra information on each diagnosis were updated, as were some of the diagnostic codes to maintain consistency with the ICD. The DSM-IV-TR was organized into a five-part axial system. The first axis incorporated clinical disorders. The second axis covered personality disorders and intellectual disabilities. The remaining axes covered medical, psychosocial, environmental, and childhood factors functionally necessary to provide diagnostic criteria for health care assessments.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR characterizes a mental disorder as \"a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual [which] is associated with present distress ... or disability ... or with a significant increased risk of suffering.\" It also notes \"no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of 'mental disorder' ... different situations call for different definitions\". It states \"there is no assumption that each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries dividing it from other mental disorders or from no mental disorder\" (APA, 1994 and 2000).\n\nThe DSM-IV is a categorical classification system. The categories are prototypes, and a patient with a close approximation to the prototype is said to have that disorder. DSM-IV states, \"there is no assumption each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries\" but isolated, low-grade and non-criterion (unlisted for a given disorder) symptoms are not given importance. Qualifiers are sometimes used, for example mild, moderate or severe forms of a disorder. For nearly half the disorders, symptoms must be sufficient to cause \"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\", although DSM-IV-TR removed the distress criterion from tic disorders and several of the paraphilias due to their egosyntonic nature. Each category of disorder has a numeric code taken from the ICD coding system, used for health service (including insurance) administrative purposes.\n\nWith the advent of the DSM-5 in 2013, the APA eliminated the longstanding multiaxial system for mental disorders.\n\nPreviously, the DSM-IV organized each psychiatric diagnosis into five dimensions (axes) relating to different aspects of disorder or disability:\nMental/Psychiatric/Behavioral/Learning conditions include, but are not limited to: depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and schizophrenia.\n\nPersonality Disorders include, but are not limited to: paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder; and organic intellectual disabilities.\n\nCommon medical/physical conditions or diseases that may result in and/or exacerbate some of the aforementioned mental/psychiatric conditions OR that may be aggravated by the aforementioned mental/psychiatric conditions include, but are not limited to: brain injuries, terminal diseases, pregnancy, cancer, epilepsy, idiopathic physiological conditions and virtually any other conditions, ailments and/or injuries which may affect the patient's mental health.. Many Biopsychosocial Assessments incorporate multiple factors that adversely affect the patient's, client's and/or subject's overall well-being and homeostasis.\n\nTypical psychosocial influences that are usually listed as having negative impact on life, mentality and health include, but are not limited to: Environmental factors of dysfunction such as those experienced within home, school and work; Social factors such as issues with drug use (not diagnosed), enabling friends and conflicts with coworkers; Family complications such as divorce, social service involvement and court ordered placements; Various stressors such as recent accident, natural disaster and other traumatic occurrences (i.e. assault, death, abuse); Financial problems such as bankruptcy, job loss and debts; and service needs such as lack of medical insurance, inability to find adequate treatment and inaccessibility to necessary state and federal programs.\n\nThe DSM-IV does not specifically cite its sources, but there are four volumes of \"sourcebooks\" intended to be APA's documentation of the guideline development process and supporting evidence, including literature reviews, data analyses and field trials. The Sourcebooks have been said to provide important insights into the character and quality of the decisions that led to the production of DSM-IV, and hence the scientific credibility of contemporary psychiatric classification.\n\nThe fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the DSM-5, was approved by the Board of Trustees of the APA on December 1, 2012. Published on May 18, 2013, the DSM-5 contains extensively revised diagnoses and, in some cases, broadens diagnostic definitions while narrowing definitions in other cases. The DSM-5 is the first major edition of the manual in twenty years.\n\nA significant change in the fifth edition is the deletion of the subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated and residual).\n\nThe deletion of the subsets of autistic spectrum disorder (namely, Asperger's syndrome, classic autism, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) was also implemented, with specifiers with regard to intensity (mild, moderate and severe). Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, with three levels: 1 (requiring support), 2 (requiring substantial support) and 3 (requiring very substantial support).\n\nDuring the revision process, the APA website periodically listed several sections of the DSM-5 for review and discussion.\n\nBeginning with the fifth edition, it is intended diagnostic guidelines revisions will be added more often to keep up with research in the field. It is notable the DSM-5 is identified with Arabic rather than Roman numerals. Beginning with DSM-5, the American Psychiatric Association will use decimals to identify incremental updates (e.g., DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2) and whole numbers for new editions (e.g., DSM-5, DSM-6), similar to the scheme used for software versioning.\n\nThe revisions of the DSM from the 3rd Edition forward have been mainly concerned with diagnostic reliability—the degree to which different diagnosticians agree on a diagnosis. It was argued {Henrik Walter} that a science of psychiatry can only advance if diagnosis is reliable. If clinicians and researchers frequently disagree about the diagnosis of a patient, then research into the causes and effective treatments of those disorders cannot advance. Hence, diagnostic reliability was a major concern of DSM-III. When the diagnostic reliability problem was thought to be solved, subsequent editions of the DSM were concerned mainly with \"tweaking\" the diagnostic criteria. Unfortunately, neither the issue of reliability or validity was settled. However, most psychiatric education post DSM-III focused on issues of treatment—especially drug treatment—and less on diagnostic concerns. In fact, Thomas R. Insel, director of the NIMH, stated in 2013 that the agency would no longer fund research projects that rely exclusively on DSM criteria due to its lack of validity. Field trials of DSM-5 brought the debate of reliability back into the limelight as some disorders showed poor reliability. For example, major depressive disorder, a common mental illness, had a poor reliability kappa statistic of 0.28, indicating that clinicians frequently disagreed on this diagnosis in the same patients. The most reliable diagnosis was major neurocognitive disorder with a kappa of 0.78.\n\nBy design, the DSM is primarily concerned with the signs and symptoms of mental disorders, rather than the underlying causes. It claims to collect them together based on statistical or clinical patterns. As such, it has been compared to a naturalist's field guide to birds, with similar advantages and disadvantages. The lack of a causative or explanatory basis, however, is not specific to the DSM, but rather reflects a general lack of pathophysiological understanding of psychiatric disorders. As DSM-III chief architect Robert Spitzer and DSM-IV editor Michael First outlined in 2005, \"little progress has been made toward understanding the pathophysiological processes and cause of mental disorders. If anything, the research has shown the situation is even more complex than initially imagined, and we believe not enough is known to structure the classification of psychiatric disorders according to etiology.\"\n\nThe DSM's focus on superficial symptoms is claimed to be largely a result of necessity (assuming such a manual is nevertheless produced), since there is no agreement on a more explanatory classification system. Reviewers note, however, that this approach is undermining research, including in genetics, because it results in the grouping of individuals who have very little in common except superficial criteria as per DSM or ICD diagnosis.\n\nDespite the lack of consensus on underlying causation, advocates for specific psychopathological paradigms have nonetheless faulted the current diagnostic scheme for not incorporating evidence-based models or findings from other areas of science. A recent example is evolutionary psychologists' criticism that the DSM does not differentiate between genuine cognitive malfunctions and those induced by psychological adaptations, a key distinction within evolutionary psychology but one that is widely challenged within general psychology. Another example is the strong operationalist viewpoint, which contends that reliance on operational definitions, as purported by the DSM, necessitates that intuitive concepts like depression be replaced by specific measurable concepts before they are scientifically meaningful. One critic states of psychologists that \"Instead of replacing 'metaphysical' terms such as 'desire' and 'purpose', they used it to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions ... the initial, quite radical operationalist ideas eventually came to serve as little more than a 'reassurance fetish' (Koch 1992) for mainstream methodological practice.\"\n\nA 2013 review published in the \"European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience\" states \"that psychiatry targets the phenomena of consciousness, which, unlike somatic symptoms and signs, cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like objects.\" As an example of the problem of the superficial characterization of psychiatric signs and symptoms, the authors gave the example of a patient saying they \"feel depressed, sad, or down\", showing that such a statement could indicate various underlying experiences: \"not only depressed mood but also, for instance, irritation, anger, loss of meaning, varieties of fatigue, ambivalence, ruminations of different kinds, hyper-reflectivity, thought pressure, psychological anxiety, varieties of depersonalization, and even voices with negative content, and so forth.\" The structured interview comes with \"danger of over confidence in the face value of the answers, as if a simple 'yes' or 'no' truly confirmed or denied the diagnostic criterion at issue.\" The authors gave an example: A patient who was being administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders denied thought insertion, but during a \"conversational, phenomenological interview\", a semi-structured interview tailored to the patient, the same patient admitted to experiencing thought insertion, along with a delusional elaboration. The authors suggested 2 reasons for this discrepancy: either the patient did not \"recognize his own experience in the rather blunt, implicitly either/or formulation of the structured-interview question\", or the experience did not \"fully articulate itself\" until the patient started talking about his experiences.\n\nDr. Allen Frances being an outspoken critic of the DSM-5 states that \"normality is an endangered species,\" for the reason of \"fad diagnoses\" and an \"epidemic\" of over-diagnosing, and suggests that the \"DSM-5 threatens to provoke several more [epidemics].\" Some researchers state that changes in diagnostic criteria reduce thresholds for a diagnosis, which results in increases in prevalence rates following each published version of the DSM for ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. Bruchmüller suggests that as a factor that may lead to overdiagnosis can be also situations when the diagnostician's clinical judgment regarding a diagnose (ADHD) is affected by heuristics.\n\nDespite caveats in the introduction to the DSM, it has long been argued that its system of classification makes unjustified categorical distinctions between disorders and uses arbitrary cut-offs between normal and abnormal. A 2009 psychiatric review noted that attempts to demonstrate natural boundaries between related DSM syndromes, or between a common DSM syndrome and normality, have failed. Some argue that rather than a categorical approach, a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.\n\nIn addition, it is argued that the current approach based on exceeding a threshold of symptoms does not adequately take into account the context in which a person is living, and to what extent there is internal disorder of an individual versus a psychological response to adverse situations. The DSM does include a step (\"Axis IV\") for outlining \"Psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder\" once someone is diagnosed with that particular disorder.\n\nBecause an individual's degree of impairment is often not correlated with symptom counts and can stem from various individual and social factors, the DSM's standard of distress or disability can often produce false positives. On the other hand, individuals who do not meet symptom counts may nevertheless experience comparable distress or disability in their life.\n\nPsychiatrists have argued that published diagnostic standards relied on an exaggerated interpretation of neurophysiological findings and so understate the scientific importance of social-psychological variables. Advocating a more culturally sensitive approach to psychology, critics such as Carl Bell and Marcello Maviglia contend that researchers and service-providers often discount the cultural and ethnic diversity of individuals. In addition, current diagnostic guidelines have been criticized as having a fundamentally Euro-American outlook. Although these guidelines have been widely implemented, opponents argue that even when a diagnostic criterion-set is accepted across different cultures, it does not necessarily indicate that the underlying constructs have any validity within those cultures; even reliable application can only demonstrate consistency, not legitimacy. Cross-cultural psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman contends that the Western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the DSM-IV: the fact that disorders or concepts from non-Western or non-mainstream cultures are described as \"culture-bound\", whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever, is to Kleinman revelatory of an underlying assumption that Western cultural phenomena are universal. Other cross-cultural critics largely share Kleinman's negative view toward the culture-bound syndrome, common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non-Western mental disorders still left out, and frustration that even those included were often misinterpreted or misrepresented.\n\nMainstream psychiatrists have also been dissatisfied with these new culture-bound diagnoses, although not for the same reasons. Robert Spitzer, a lead architect of the DSM-III, has held the opinion that the addition of cultural formulations was an attempt to placate cultural critics, and that they lack any scientific motivation or support. Spitzer also posits that the new culture-bound diagnoses are rarely used in practice, maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved. In general, the mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid, cross-cultural factors are either irrelevant or are only significant to specific symptom presentations. One of the results was the development of the Azibo Nosology by Daudi Ajani Ya Azibo as an alternative to the DSM to treat African and African American patients.\n\nHistorically, the DSM tended to avoid issues involving religion; the DSM-5 relaxed this attitude somewhat.\n\nIt has also been alleged that the way the categories of the DSM are structured, as well as the substantial expansion of the number of categories, are representative of an increasing medicalization of human nature, which may be attributed to disease mongering by psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies, the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades. Of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half have had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry at one time, raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest. The same article concludes that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong in those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry. In 2005, then APA President Steven Sharfstein released a statement in which he conceded that psychiatrists had \"allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio-bio-bio model\".\n\nHowever, although the number of identified diagnoses has increased by more than 300% (from 106 in DSM-I to 365 in DSM-IV-TR), psychiatrists such as Zimmerman and Spitzer argue it almost entirely represents greater specification of the forms of pathology, thereby allowing better grouping of more similar patients. However, William Glasser refers to the DSM as \"phony diagnostic categories\", arguing that \"it was developed to help psychiatrists – to help them make money\". In addition, the publishing of the DSM, with tightly guarded copyrights, has in itself earned over $100 million for the APA.\n\nA client is a person who accesses psychiatric services and may have been given a diagnosis from the DSM, while a survivor self-identifies as a person who has endured a psychiatric intervention and the mental health system (which may have involved involuntary commitment and involuntary treatment). A term adopted by many users of psychiatric services is \"consumer.\" This term was chosen to eliminate the \"patient\" label and restore the person to an active role as a user or consumer of services. Some individuals are relieved to find that they have a recognized condition that they can apply a name to and this has led to many people self-diagnosing. Others, however, question the accuracy of the diagnosis, or feel they have been given a \"label\" that invites social stigma and discrimination (the terms \"mentalism\" and \"sanism\" have been used to describe such discriminatory treatment).\n\nDiagnoses can become internalized and affect an individual's self-identity, and some psychotherapists have found that the healing process can be inhibited and symptoms can worsen as a result. Some members of the psychiatric survivors movement (more broadly the consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement) actively campaign against their diagnoses, or the assumed implications, and/or against the DSM system in general. Additionally, it has been noted that the DSM often uses definitions and terminology that are inconsistent with a recovery model, and such content can erroneously imply excess psychopathology (e.g. multiple \"comorbid\" diagnoses) or chronicity.\n\nPsychiatrist Allen Frances has been critical of proposed revisions to the DSM-5. In a 2012 \"New York Times\" editorial, Frances warned that if this DSM version is issued unamended by the APA, \"it will medicalize normality and result in a glut of unnecessary and harmful drug prescription.\" In a December 2, 2012 blog post in \"Psychology Today\", Frances provides his \"... list of DSM 5's ten most potentially harmful changes\":\n\nFrances and others have published debates on what they see as the six most essential questions in psychiatric diagnosis:\n\nIn 2011, psychologist Brent Robbins co-authored a national letter for the Society for Humanistic Psychology that has brought thousands into the public debate about the DSM. Over 15,000 individuals and mental health professionals have signed a petition in support of the letter. Thirteen other American Psychological Association divisions have endorsed the petition. Robbins has noted that under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.\n\n\n"}

He thus aroused the jealousy and disapproval of his cousin, \"Abu Tayyib\", who then made Dik al-Jinn believe that Ward and Bakr were dating one another. Being mad and jealous, Dik al-Jinn killed them both. Later on, he learned the truth and cried the rest of his life in funeral elegies that some critics, such as \"Ibn Rashiq\" recognize as models of their kind.\n\nHe is considered one of the masters of the poet Abu Tammam.\n\nDik al-Jinn departs, like his contemporary Abu Nuwas, standards of ancient poetry from Pre-Islamic qasida and its range of Bedouin themes. Leaving aside the long verses generally preferred by poets of the classical style, such as Tawil, Dik al-Jinn composed above all on the basit, kamil, and khafif meters. His diwan consists mainly of fragments and short pieces of amorous poetry (ghazal) and elegies addressed to \"Ward\". Another great part of his poetry is devoted to the love of wine. He also left some long pieces of praise (madîh) and a famous satire (hijâ') addressed to his cousin \"Abu Tayyib\".\n\nHis diwan has been collected by Sheikh Muhammad al-Samâwî, who was the first to gather his works.\n\nThe story of Dik al-Jinn has similar aspects to William Shakespeare's Othello.\n"}

Morse\n\nEdward Sylvester Morse (June 18, 1838 – December 20, 1925) was an American zoologist and orientalist.\n\nMorse was born in Portland, Maine as the son of a Congregationalist deacon who held strict Calvinist beliefs. His mother, who did not share her husband's religious beliefs, encouraged her son's interest in the sciences. An unruly student, Morse was expelled from every school he attended in his youth — the Portland village school, the academy at Conway, New Hampshire, in 1851, and Bridgton Academy in 1854 (for carving on desks). He also attended Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine. At Gould Academy, Morse came under the influence of Dr. Nathaniel True who encouraged Morse to pursue his interest in the study of nature.\n\nHe preferred to explore the Atlantic coast in search of shells and snails, or go to the field to study the fauna and flora. However, despite his lack of formal education, the collections formed during adolescence soon earned him the visit of eminent scientists from Boston, Washington and even the United Kingdom. He was noted for his work with land snails, and before the age of twelve when he had discovered two new species: \"Helix Milium\" and \"H. astericus\".\n\nAs a young man, he worked as a mechanical draftsman at the Portland Locomotive Company and a wood engraver attached to a Boston company. Morse was recommended by Philip Pearsall Carpenter to Louis Agassiz (1807–1873) at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University for his intellectual qualities and talent at drawing, and served as his assistant in charge of conservation, documentation and drawing collections of mollusks and brachiopods until 1861.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Morse attempted to enlist in the 25th Maine Infantry, but was turned down due to a chronic tonsil infection. On June 18, 1863, Morse married Ellen (“Nellie”) Elizabeth Owen in Portland. The couple had two children, Edith Owen Morse and John Gould Morse (named after Morse's lifelong friend Major John Mead Gould).\n\nMorse rapidly became successful in the field of zoology, specializing in malacology or the study of mollusks. In March 1863, along with three other students of Agassiz, Morse co-founded the scientific journal \"The American Naturalist,\" and he became one of its editors. The journal included a large number of his drawings. In 1864, he published his first work devoted to mollusks under the title \"Observations On The Terrestrial Pulmonifera of Maine, Including a Catalogue of All the Species of Terrestrial Mollusca and Fluvial Known to Inhabit the State\". In 1870 he published \"The Brachiopods, a Division of the Annelida\" wherein he reclassified brachiopods as worms rather than mollusks. The work attracted the attention of Charles Darwin. From 1871 to 1874, Morse was appointed to the chair of comparative anatomy and zoology at Bowdoin College. In 1874, he became a lecturer at Harvard University. In 1876, Morse was named a fellow of the National Academy of Science.\n\nIn June 1877 Morse first visited Japan in search of coastal brachiopods. His visit turned into a three-year stay when he was offered a post as the first professor of Zoology at the Tokyo Imperial University. He went on to recommend several fellow Americans as \"o-yatoi gaikokujin\" (foreign advisors) to support the modernization of Japan in the Meiji Era. To collect specimens, he established a marine biological laboratory at Enoshima in Kanagawa Prefecture.\n\nWhile looking out of a window on a train between Yokohama and Tokyo, Morse discovered the Ōmori shell mound, the excavation of which opened the study in archaeology and anthropology in Japan and shed much light on the material culture of prehistoric Japan. He returned to Japan in 1881 to present a report of his findings to Tokyo Imperial University.\n\nWhile in Japan, he authored a book \"Japanese Homes and Their Surroundings\" illustrated with his own line drawings. He also made a collection of over 5,000 pieces of Japanese pottery. He devised the term \"cord-marked\" for the sherds of Stone Age pottery, decorated by impressing cords into the wet clay. The Japanese translation, \"Jōmon,\" now gives its name to the whole Jōmon period as well as Jōmon pottery.\n\nMorse had much interest in Japanese ceramics. He returned on a third visit to Japan in 1882, during which he collected clay samples as well as finished ceramics. He brought back to Boston a collection amassed by government minister and amateur art collector Ōkuma Shigenobu, who donated it to Morse in recognition of his services to Japan. These now form part of the \"Morse Collection\" of Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, whose catalog was written by Ernest Francisco Fenollosa. His collection of daily artifacts of the Japanese people is kept at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. The remainder of the collection was inherited by his granddaughter, Catharine Robb Whyte via her mother Edith Morse Robb and is housed at the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies, Banff, Alberta, Canada.\n\nAfter leaving Japan, Morse traveled to Southeast Asia and Europe. In 1884 (at age 46), he was elected a vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and became president of that association in 1886, 1887, 1888, 1889. During this period, he returned to Europe, and Japan in quest of pottery.\n\nMorse became Keeper of Pottery at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1890. He was also a director of the Peabody Academy of Science (now part of and succeeded by the Peabody Essex Museum) in Salem from 1880 to 1914. In 1898, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (3rd class) by the Japanese government. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1898. He became chairman of the Boston Museum in 1914, and chairman of the Peabody Museum in 1915. He was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasures (2nd class) by the Japanese government in 1922.\n\nMorse was a friend of astronomer Percival Lowell, who inspired interest in the planet Mars. Morse would occasionally journey to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, during optimal viewing times to observe the planet. In 1906, Morse published \"Mars and Its Mystery\" in defense of Lowell’s controversial speculations regarding the possibility of life on Mars.\n\nHe donated over 10,000 books from his personal collection to the Tokyo Imperial University. On learning that the library of the Tokyo Imperial University was reduced to ashes by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, in his will he ordered that his entire remaining collection of books be donated to Tokyo Imperial University.\n\nMorse died at his home in Salem, Massachusetts in 1925 of cerebral hemorrhage and was buried at the Harmony Grove Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Humbaba was the guardian of the Cedar Forest, where the gods lived, by the will of the god Enlil, who \"assigned [Humbaba] as a terror to human beings. Gilgamesh defeated this great enemy.\"\n\nHis face is that of a lion. \"When he looks at someone, it is the look of death.\" \"Humbaba's roar is a flood, his mouth is death and his breath is fire! He can hear a hundred leagues away any [rustling?] in his forest! Who would go down into his forest!\" In various examples, his face is scribed in a single coiling line like that of the coiled entrails of men and beasts, from which omens might be read. \n\nAnother description from Georg Burckhardt translation of Gilgamesh says, \"he had the paws of a lion and a body covered in thorny scales; his feet had the claws of a vulture, and on his head were the horns of a wild bull; his tail and phallus each ended in a snake's head.\"\n\nYet another description in a newly discovered tablet in Sulaymaniyah is somewhat positive about Humbaba:\n\nThe tablet goes on to portray Gilgamesh as an aggressor who destroys a forest unnecessarily, and his death is lamented by Enkidu.\n\nHumbaba is first mentioned in Tablet II of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\": after Gilgamesh and Enkidu become friends following their initial fight, they set out on an adventure to the Cedar Forest beyond the seventh mountain range, to slay Humbaba (Huwawa): \"Enkidu,\" Gilgamesh vows, \"since a man cannot pass beyond the final end of life, I want to set off into the mountains, to establish my renown there.\" Gilgamesh tricks the monster into giving away his seven \"radiances\" by offering his sisters as wife and concubine. When Humbaba's guard is down, Gilgamesh punches him and captures the monster. Defeated, Humbaba appeals to a receptive Gilgamesh for mercy, but Enkidu convinces Gilgamesh to slay Humbaba. In a last effort, Humbaba tries to escape but is decapitated by Enkidu, or in some versions by both heroes together; his head is put in a leather sack, which is brought to Enlil, the god who set Humbaba as the forest's guardian. Enlil becomes enraged upon learning this and redistributes Humbaba's seven splendors (or in some tablets \"auras\"). \"He gave Humbaba's first aura to the fields. He gave his second aura to the rivers. He gave his third aura to the reed-beds. He gave his fourth aura to the lions. He gave his fifth aura to the palace (one text has \"debt slaves\"). He gave his sixth aura to the forests (one text has \"the hills\"). He gave his seventh aura to Nungal.\" No vengeance was laid upon the heroes, though Enlil says, \"He should have eaten the bread that you eat, and should have drunk the water that you drink! He should have been honored.\"\n\nAs each gift was given by Gilgamesh, he received a \"terror\" (= \"radiance\") in exchange, from Humbaba. The seven gifts successively given by Gilgamesh were:\n\nWhile Gilgamesh thus distracts and tricks this spirit of the cedar forest, the fifty unmarried young men he has brought on the adventure are felling cedar timber, stripping it of its branches and laying it \"in many piles on the hillside,\" ready to be taken away. Thus the adventure reveals itself in the context of a timber raid, bringing cedar wood to timberless Mesopotamia.\n\nAs his death approaches, and Gilgamesh is oppressed with his own mortality, the gods remind him of his great feats: \"…having fetched cedar, the unique tree, from its mountains, having killed Humbaba in the forest…\"\n\nThe iconography of the apotropaic severed head of Humbaba, with staring eyes, flowing beard and wild hair, is well documented from the First Babylonian Dynasty, continuing into Neo-Assyrian art and dying away during the Achaemenid rule. The severed head of the monstrous Humbaba found a Greek parallel in the myth of Perseus and the similarly employed head of Medusa, which Perseus placed in his leather sack. Archaic Greek depictions of the gorgoneion render it bearded, an anomaly in the female Gorgon. Judith McKenzie detected Humbaba heads in a Nabatean tomb frieze at Petra.\n\n"}

Such systems are known as DDI, or DNS, DHCP, IPAM systems. IPAM is often confused with DDI (DNS/DHCP/IPAM), of which it's a single component.\n\nSome IPAM applications are provided as part of a DDI system, examples are offerings from Cisco Systems, SolarWinds, Men & Mice and Microsoft. Others integrate with other standalone DNS and DHCP services.\n\nAdditional functionality, such as controlling reservations in DHCP and other data aggregation and reporting capabilities, is also common. Data tracked by an IPAM system may include information such as IP addresses in use, the devices an IP is assigned to at what time, as well as to which user an IP was assigned. This information can also support troubleshooting and abuse investigations. \n\nIPAM tools are increasingly important as new IPv6 networks are deployed with larger address pools, different subnetting techniques and more complex 128-bit hexadecimal numbers, which are not as easily human-readable as IPv4 addresses. IPv6 networking, mobile computing, and multihoming require more dynamic address management.\n"}
{"id": "32683552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32683552", "title": "Joseph Pivato", "text": "Joseph Pivato\n\nJoseph Pivato (born February 1946, in Tezze sul Brenta, Italy) is a Canadian writer and academic who first established the critical recognition of Italian-Canadian literature and changed perceptions of Canadian writing.\n\nHe was born Giuseppe Pivato in Tezze sul Brenta, a town about 40 km north of Venice, Italy. His mother was from Udine in the Friuli region east of Venice. This Italian origin was to have a profound influence on his whole life and career as a writer, researcher and academic. The family emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1952 where the Catholic nuns changed his name to Joseph. He attended St. Michael's College School, an academic high school for boys, where he studied languages and literature. He enrolled at York University where he studied with modernist scholar, D.E.S. Maxwell, feminist and medievalist, Beryl Rowland, feminist scholar, Johanna H. Stuckey, Canadian writer, Irving Layton, met French poet Hedi Bouraoui and poet-critic, Eli Mandel. With D.E.S. Maxwell he enrolled in the first course in African Literature (1969). In the summers he worked with Italian bricklayers to help pay for his university fees. In 1968 he founded and edited the first literary magazine at York, \"Voodoo Poetry\" at Vanier College. In 1970 he earned a B.A. (Combined Honours, English and French) from York and moved to Edmonton to study Comparative Literature at the University of Alberta. His 1971 M.A. thesis was on Dante and Baudelaire. Writer and academic E.D. Blodgett was his advisor for his Ph.D. thesis on hermetic poetry. He also met Canadian writers Henry Kreisel and Sheila Watson and began to work on Canadian authors publishing his first critical essay in \"Canadian Literature\" (1973, editor George Woodcock) while he was still a graduate student. At the end of his doctoral program (1977) he began to work at Athabasca University, a distance education institution modeled after the British Open University. At Athabasca he helped to develop the first courses in English literature, Canadian Literature, Comparative Literature and theory. He was promoted to Full Professor in 1986. He was founding president of the Association of Italian-Canadian Writers(1986) which advances the work of these ethnic minority authors through critical publications, biennial conferences, book launches and literary readings across Canada and in Italy. At Athabasca Pivato was Chair of the Centre for Language and Literature on three separate occasions and developed the first courses in creative writing. In 2010 he was founding professor of the new M.A. in Literary Studies which is part of the MA-IS program. He is married to Alberta psychologist, writer, academic and disabilities advocate Dr. Emma Pivato. Their children include Dr. Marcus J. Pivato, Prof. of Economics, University of Cergy-Pontoise (Paris, France), and Juliana Pivato, Artist and Academic in Toronto. Emma Pivato's novels include \"Blind Sight Solution\" (Chicago: Cozy Cat Press, 2013) \"The Crooked Knife\" (2014) \"Roscoe's Revenge\" (2014) \"Jessie Knows\" (2015) \"Murder on Highway 2\" (2016) and \"Deadly Care\" (2016). Since July, 2015, he has been Professor Emeritus at Athabasca University.\n\nJoseph Pivato promotes Italian-Canadian writing by using the theories of Comparative Literature. As a literature which exists in three languages: English, French and Italian, it lends itself to discussions on translation, influences, ethnic identity, migration and appropriation. His discovery began in 1978 when his poems were included in \"Roman Candles\", the first anthology of Italian-Canadian poets edited by Pier Giorgio DiCicco. This inspired him to present the first paper on Italian-Canadian writers at a national conference at Dalhousie University, Halifax in May, 1981. This paper was rejected by several journals and was eventually published as \"The Arrival of Italian-Canadian Writing,\" in \"Canadian Ethnic Studies\" 14,1 (1982).\n\nIn 1984 Pivato was Research Fellow in the Ethnic and Immigration Studies Program at the University of Toronto. This fellowship was at the invitation of Prof. Robert F. Harney, Academic Director (1976–89) of the Multicultual History Society of Ontario at U.of T. In Toronto he edited his first book, \"Contrasts: Comparative Essays on Italian-Canadian Writing\" (1985) which became a seminal volume for the promotion of ethnic minority literature in Canada. He conceived and co-edited the \"Italian-Canadian Connections\" issue of \"Canadian Literature\" 106 (1985). Pivato spent the year 1987-88 at York University in the Mariano Elia Chair in Italian-Canadian Studies where he developed and taught the first course on Italian-Canadian writers. The Research Institute for Comparative Literature in Edmonton invited him to edit \"Literatures of Lesser Diffusion\" (1990), the first collection of studies of writing by 20 different ethnic groups in Canada. In 1991 he was Canadian Visiting Fellow at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. This sojourn resulted in the publication of \"Echo: Essays on Other Literatures\" (1994), a collection of original critical studies on Comparative Literature and minority writing, translation, oral influences on writing, ethnic women writers, and other topics. The critical foreword is by feminist scholar, Sneja Gunew (Deakin & U.B.C.). He returned to \"Canadian Ethnic Studies\" in 1996 by editing a special issue on \"Literary Theory and Ethnic Minority Writing.\" The major volume Pivato edited was \"The Anthology of Italian-Canadian Writing\" (1998) which included 53 authors working in English, French or Italian and which has been used as a text in many college and university courses. Among the authors included are F.G. Paci, Linda Hutcheon, Nino Ricci, Pasquale Verdicchio, Mary di Michele, Fulvio Caccia and Marco Micone. Pivato's poetry has appeared in \"Poetry Canada Review, \"Seven Persons Repository, \"Manna, \"Canadian Ethnic Studies,\" and his short fiction in \"Threshold\" (1999) and \"Passages\" (2002).\n\nPivato was in the forefront of research and advocacy for a multicultural view of Canadian literature. Writer and academic George Elliott Clarke points to his work as an example that other ethnic minority writers should follow in establishing a distinct identity for their publications. Pivato has been a visiting speaker and researcher at the University of Udine several times and has contributed to conferences and publication at their Centro di Cultura Canadese founded by Prof. Anna Pia De Luca. He focused some of his research on Canadian writers with backgrounds in Friuli. In 2004 he was visiting fellow at the University of Wollongong, Australia, where he collaborated with Prof. Gaetano Rando. Over the years Pivato has been an invited speaker at the University of Calgary, the University of Toronto, The University of Montreal, Laurentian University, the California State University, Long Beach, the University of Warwick, U.K. the University of Venice, the University of Melbourne and other institutions.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2011 he was general editor of the Essential Writers Series with Antonio D’Alfonso at Guernica Editions (Toronto and Montreal). He is now sole editor of this Writers Series. By 2018 the series had reached an impressive 49 volumes, each a monograph on a Canadian author including: Sheila Watson, Sharon Pollock, Caterina Edwards, Aritha Van Herk, Gail Scott, Robert Kroetsch, David Adams Richards, Nicole Brossard, Margaret Atwood, Anne Hébert, Gary Geddes, Joy Kogawa, Mary di Michele, Dany Laferriere, and Jack Hodgins. Each is edited by a prominent academic such as Lianne Moyes, Anne Nothof, Louise H. Forsyth, Monique Tschofen, Christl Verduyn, Nicole Markotic, Jolene Armstrong and Sheena L. Wilson. In 2008 he first identified the Sherbrooke School of Comparative Canadian Literature as instrumental in the development and study of Canadian writing in English, French and translations, and later published this new proposal in 2011. He edited the critical anthology, \"Africadian Atlantic: Essays on George Elliott Clarke\" (2012), the first book devoted to this important African-Canadian author. He edited, \"Sheila Watson: Essays on Her Works\" (2015), the first book to examine all of Watson's work as a writer, editor and mentor. In 2018 Pivato co-edited with Giulia De Gasperi \"Comparative Literature for the New Century\" the first Canadian text in Comparative Literature. It promotes the field from a pluralistic approach with the study of different languages and literatures. Most of the 20 contributors are bilingual Canadian academics.\n\nAt the Athabasca University site for faculty research Pivato has posted 12 of his recently published essays on ethnic minority writing in Canada. Joseph Pivato created and maintains the Canadian Writers site at Athabasca University, the extensive research site on the authors of Canada.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6030771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6030771", "title": "Mesoamerican language area", "text": "Mesoamerican language area\n\nThe Mesoamerican language area is a \"sprachbund\" containing many of the languages natively spoken in the cultural area of Mesoamerica. This sprachbund is defined by an array of syntactic, lexical and phonological traits as well as a number of ethnolinguistic traits found in the languages of Mesoamerica, which belong to a number of language families, such as Uto-Aztecan, Mayan, Totonacan, Oto-Manguean and Mixe–Zoque languages as well as some language isolates and unclassified languages known to the region.\n\nThe similarities noted between many of the languages of Mesoamerica have led linguistic scholars to propose the constitution of a sprachbund, from as early as 1959. The proposal was not consolidated until 1986, however, when Lyle Campbell, Terrence Kaufman and Thomas Smith-Stark employed a rigid linguistic analysis to demonstrate that the similarities between a number of languages were indeed considerable, with the conclusion that their origins were very likely caused by diffusion rather than inheritance, the standard criteria for defining a sprachbund.\n\nIn their 1986 paper \"Meso-America as a Linguistic Area\" the above authors explored several proposed areal features of which they discarded most as being weakly attested, possibly by chance or inheritance or not confined to the Mesoamerican region. However, five traits in particular were shown to be widely-attested among the languages, with boundaries coinciding with that of the Mesoamerican region and having a probable origin through diffusion. They then compared the five traits with the traits defining other language areas considered to be well-established, like the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area and Balkan language area. They concluded that by comparison the proposed Mesoamerican language area could indeed be considered a well-founded area: arguably \"among the very strongest that are known\" (Campbell, Kaufman & Smith-Stark. 1986 p. 556).\n\nThey also argued that some of the discarded traits might also be taken into consideration as strengthening the proposal, but they were not sufficient by themselves to act as foundation and other well-documented traits of a more ethnolinguistic character might not be considerable as traits that are linguistic but cultural.\n\nThe following is a brief description of the linguistic traits considered by Campbell, Kaufman and Smith-Stark as defining the Mesoamerican language area.\n\nMany of the Mesoamerican languages show a particular kind of construction for possession of nominals. The commonly found construction is \"his noun1 noun2\" meaning \"noun2's noun1\" (\"his\" often is a prefix in this construction). For example, in the K'iche' language, a Mayan language, \"u-tzi' le achih\" \"the man's dog\" literally means \"his-dog the man\". The similar construction in Nahuatl would be \"i:-itskʷin in tɬaːkatɬ\".\n\nAnother trait shared by nearly all Mesoamerican languages is relational nouns. Relational nouns are used to express spatial and other relations, much like prepositions in most Indo-European languages but composed of a noun and possessive affixes.\n\nPied-piping with inversion is a special word order found in wh-questions. It appears to be found in all Mesoamerican languages, but is rare outside Mesoamerica.\n\nAll the languages of Mesoamerica have vigesimal, or base twenty numeral systems. This system has also spread to some languages just outside the Mesoamerican cultural area.\n\nNo language with verb-final basic word order is attested in Mesoamerica even though most of the languages bordering on Mesoamerica are verb final (SOV). Also no languages with switch reference are attested in Mesoamerica, but this is supposed by Campbell, Kaufman and Smith-Stark to be a secondary effect of the Mesoamerican languages not being verb final.\n\nA strong evidence of diffusion throughout Mesoamerica is provided by a number of semantic calques widely found throughout the area.\n\nFor example in many Mesoamerican languages the words for specific objects are constructed by compounding two different stems, and in many cases these two stems are semantically identical although linguistically unrelated.\n\nAmong these calques are:\n\nOther traits found in Mesoamerican languages, but not found by Campbell, Kaufman and Smith-Stark to be prominent enough to be conclusive for the proposal of the language area are:\n\n\n"}

The original MS-DOS version showcased the massive storage capacity of CD-ROM technology, and was accessed while the user was using one of 13 different word processor programs that Bookshelf supported. Subsequent versions were produced for Windows and became a commercial success as part of the Microsoft Home brand. It was often bundled with personal computers as a cheaper alternative to the Encarta Suite. The Encarta Deluxe Suite / Reference Library versions also bundled Bookshelf.\n\nMicrosoft Bookshelf was discontinued in 2000. In later editions of the Encarta suite (Encarta 2000 and onwards), Bookshelf was replaced with a dedicated \"Encarta Dictionary\", a superset of the printed edition. There has been some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in Bookshelf which many found to be a useful reference, such as the dictionary of quotations (replaced with a quotations section in \"Encarta\" that links to relevant articles and people) and the Internet Directory, although the directory is now a moot point since many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist.\n\nThe original 1987 edition contained \"The Original Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases\", \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", World Almanac and Book of Facts, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, The Chicago Manual of Style (13th Edition), the U.S. ZIP Code Directory, Houghton Mifflin Usage Alert, Houghton Mifflin Spelling Verifier and Corrector, Business Information Sources, and Forms and Letters. Titles in non-US versions of Bookshelf were different. For example, the 1997 UK edition included the Chambers Dictionary, Bloomsbury Treasury of Quotations, and Hutchinson Concise Encyclopedia.\n\nThe Windows release of Bookshelf added a number of new reference titles, including \"The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia\" and an Internet Directory. Other titles were added and some were dropped in subsequent years. By 1994, the English-language version also contained the \"Columbia Dictionary of Quotations\"; \"The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia\"; the \"Hammond Intermediate World Atlas\"; and \"The People's Chronology\". By 2000, the collection came to include the \"Encarta Desk Encyclopedia\", the \"Encarta Desk Atlas\", the \"Encarta Style Guide\" and a specialized \"Computer and Internet Dictionary\" by Microsoft Press.\n\nBookshelf 1.0 used a proprietary hypertext engine that Microsoft acquired when it bought the company Cytation in 1986. Also used for Microsoft Stat Pack and Microsoft Small Business Consultant, it was a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program that ran alongside a dominant program, unbeknownst to the dominant program. Like Apple's similar Hypercard reader, Bookshelf engine's files used a single compound document, containing large numbers of subdocuments (\"cards\" or \"articles\"). They both differ from current browsers which normally treat each \"page\" or \"article\" as a separate file.\n\nThough similar to Apple's Hypercard reader in many ways, the Bookshelf engine had several key differences. Unlike Hypercard files, Bookshelf files required compilation and complex markup codes. This made the files more difficult to pirate, addressing a key concern of early electronic publishers. Furthermore, Bookshelf's engine was designed to run as fast as possible on slow first-generation CD-ROM drives, some of which required as much as a half-second to move the drive head. Such hardware constraints made Hypercard impractical for high-capacity CD-ROMs. Bookshelf also had full text searching capability, which made it easy to find needed information.\n\nCollaborating with DuPont, the Microsoft CD-ROM division developed a Windows version of its engine for applications as diverse as document management, online help, and a CD-ROM encyclopedia. In a skunkworks project, these developers worked secretly with Multimedia Division developers so that the engine would be usable for more ambitious multimedia applications. Thus they integrated a multimedia markup language, full text search, and extensibility using software objects, all of which are commonplace in modern internet browsing.\n\nIn 1992, Microsoft started selling the Bookshelf engine to third-party developers, marketing the product as Microsoft Multimedia Viewer. The idea was that such a tool would help a burgeoning growth of CD-ROM titles that would spur demand for Windows. Although the engine had multimedia capabilities that would not be matched by Web browsers until the late 1990s, Microsoft Viewer did not enjoy commercial success as a standalone product. However, Microsoft continued to use the engine for its Encarta and WinHelp applications, though the multimedia functions are rarely used in Windows help files.\n\nIn 1993, the developers who were working on the next generation viewer were moved to the Cairo systems group which was charged with delivering Bill Gates' 'vision' of 'Information at your fingertips'. This advanced browser was a fully componentized application using what are now known as Component Object Model objects, designed for hypermedia browsing across large networks and whose main competitor was thought to be Lotus Notes. Long before Netscape appeared, this team, known as the WEB (web enhanced browser) team had already shipped a network capable hypertext browser capable of doing everything that HTML browsers would not be able to do until the turn of the century. Nearly all technologies of Cairo shipped. The WEB browser was not one of them, though it influenced the design of many other common Microsoft technologies.\n\n\"BYTE\" in 1989 listed Microsoft Bookshelf as among the \"Excellence\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it \"is the first substantial application of CD-ROM technology\" and \"a harbinger of personal library systems to come\".\n\n"}

In addition, many of the race and ethnicity concepts that appear on national censuses worldwide have their origins in Europe or in the views of Europeans, rather than in the views of the locals of these countries.\nPeople in Abkhazia (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census.

The 2011 Albanian census also enumerated people by language used and by their religious beliefs.\n\nThe Portuguese asked about race in colonial censuses when they controlled Angola, and they provided three options: White, Mestizo, or African/Black. Africans had to then pick either \"Assimilado\" (assimilated) or \"Indigenato\" (indigenous). Angola has not used any racial categories since its independence in 1975.

The 2012 census included 40 ethnic group options. However, it did not include Mestizo as an option, which critics of current Bolivian President Evo Morales say was because he wants more Bolivians to identify as one of the indigenous groups in order to lend more legitimacy to his indigenous-friendly policies.\n\nThe population of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been enumerated by ethnicity since at least 1885, including the recent censuses in 1991 and 2013.\n\nBotswana enumerated people by race in all censuses between 1904 and 1946, and again in the 1964 census (though not in 1956), but in no censuses after 1964.

A new census which plans to enumerate the people of Burma by ethnicity and race is planned to be held in 2014. The 1931 Burmese census generated a lot of anger from non-Burmese ethnic groups who were marked as Burmese on the census. There is hope that the scheduled 2014 Burma Census will help empower the various ethnic groups in Burma.\n\nCanada counted people by ethnic origin in 1765 and again from at least 1871 to 2006, with the exception of 1891. The options for ethnicity in the 2006 Canadian census were various kinds of European Canadian, Aboriginal Canadian, and various non-white or non-European groups known officially as \"visible minorities\". The 2011 Canadian census did not ask about race and ethnicity, but the new voluntary National Household Survey (NHS) for that year did ask about race and ethnicity (as well as many other questions that were previously asked on the Canadian census). Prior to the 1981 Canadian census, respondents could only mark one ethnicity/ethnic ancestry, but the 1981 census and all future ones allowed multiple ethnicity responses.

There were 192 different ethnicity/nationality options in the 2011 Estonian census.\n\nEthiopia enumerated people by ethnicity in 1994.\n\nThe population of Fiji was enumerated by ethnicity from 1881 all the way up to Fiji's most recent census in 2007.\n\nFinland has enumerated its population by language of most frequent use from at least 1990 to the present day.\n\nFrance has not counted individuals by race or ethnicity since at least 1978, when a law was passed that prevented individuals from being enumerated by these categories without their consent or a state committee waiver. The reasons for this are that many French people consider asking people about race and ethnicity to be a contradiction of their principle of equality and equal treatment for all French people. Also, there is a desire to avoid repeating what Vichy France did in regards to its Jewish population and to prevent the National Front from getting more popularity. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his administration supported and proposed counting French people by race and ethnicity. Due to criticism, however, this proposal was never implemented, and as of 2013 former French President Francois Hollande opposes enumerating people by race and ethnicity.\n\nThe population of Gabon was enumerated by ethnicity in 1960–1961 and 1993.\n\nPeople in Georgia (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census.

The 2011 Irish census enumerated people by ethnicity as well, and offered the options White Irish, White Irish Traveller, Other White, Black or Black Irish (with options for African and Other Black), Asian or Asian Irish (with options for Chinese and Other Asian), Other, and Not Stated.\n\nThe census in Israel directly asked people about their ethnicity only in 1983. However, Israel has used the religion question on its census to determine the ethnic composition of its population from 1948 to the present day. Israel has enumerated its Jewish population by their continent of birth since 1948.\n\nCensuses in Italy do not inquire about race or ethnicity. Only information disposable are those of civil registers, where only the country of birth is noted down.\n\nThe people of Ivory Coast were enumerated by ethnicity in 1948, 1957–1958, and 1988.

The race categories in Mozambique were the same ones as in Angola, due to both being controlled by Portugal before acquiring their independence. People were counted by language between 1940 and 1997, but not after 1997.\n\nPeople in Nagorno Karabakh (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census.

An allochtoon born outside the Netherlands (from at least one parent also born outside the Netherlands) was labelled first generation allochtoon, an allochtoon born in the Netherlands was labelled a second generation allochtoon. This definition implied that from third generation onwards people (grandparents from abroad, but parents born in the Netherlands) were considered autochtoon.\n\nNew Zealand enumerated people by ethnicity from 1858 to the present day.

Sovereign Poland enumerated people by ethnicity/nationality in 1921. It enumerated people by mother tongue in 1931, and used this data to determine ethnicity/nationality. After World War II, the Communist Polish government did not enumerate people by nationality/ethnicity. The post-Communist 2002 Polish census did enumerate people by nationality/ethnicity and language used at home.\n\nPuerto Rico enumerated people by race in its census since at least 1877 with the exception of the period from 1960 to 1990.\n\nRomania enumerated people by ethnicity in 1859–1860, 1887, 1899, and in every census since 1930, with the exception of the 1948 census, which enumerated people only by mother tongue. The World Jewish Congress also carried out a census of Romania's Jewish population in 1947.\n\nThe Russian Empire began counting people by native tongue with its first modern census in 1897. In 1920, the Soviet Union replaced this question with a question about ethnicity. The Soviet government organized lists of ethnicities and wanted to shape these various ethnic groups in the mold of Communism. In the words of Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan, the Soviet Union was \"creating and organising new nations\" The government of the U.S.S.R. was eager to get ethnic data for many ethnic groups in order to create republics and autonomous regions for many of these ethnic groups and nationalities, and later on (under Joseph Stalin) in order to deport some of them. The Bolsheviks also wanted to get more support from ethnic minority groups within the Soviet Union, many of whom were previously oppressed under Tsarist rule. The Soviet Union continued to ask about ethnicity for the rest of its existence, and Russia also asked about ethnicity in its two post-Soviet censuses of 2002 and 2010. Unlike in 1989, the 2002 census did not require respondents to prove their ethnicity/nationality when they responded to this question. The number of ethnicity/nationality options available on Soviet censuses was enormous—the Soviet Union offered 194 different choices for ethnicity/nationality in its 1926 census. There were 97 options in 1939, 126 options in 1959, 122 options in 1970, 123 options in 1979, and 128 options for the Soviet Union in 1989. There were 192 ethnicity/nationality options for Russia in 2002.\n\nRwanda enumerated people by ethnicity from 1933/34 until 1991. Due to the 1994 Rwandan Genocide and the ethnic hatred and tensions that caused it, the Rwandan census of 2002 did not enumerate people by ethnicity.\n\nThe Sao Tome and Principe enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1950 and 1960.\n\nThe people of Senegal were enumerated by ethnicity in 1960–1961 and 1988.\n\nThe Seychelles enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1947, 1987, and 1994.\n\nIn addition to Yugoslavia enumerating people by ethnicity/nationality, Serbia enumerated people by ethnicity/nationality in its 2002 and 2011 censuses.\n\nThe people of Seychelles were enumerated by ethnicity in 1947, 1987, and 1994.\n\nThe people in Singapore were numerated by ethnicity from at least 1947 up to the most recent Singaporean census in 2010.\n\nThe population of Slovakia was enumerated by ethnicity/nationality since 1910 all the way up to the present day.\n\nThe population of Slovenia was enumerated by ethnicity since 1953 all the way up to the present day.\n\nIn the pre-independence period in Somalia, the colonial administrations in British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland officially classified the ethnic Somali majority within the two territories as \"Hamitic\". The Italian Somaliland census of 1935 reported that the remaining 6.2% of the area's population consisted of \"Negroid groups\", including the Bantu ethnic minorities inhabiting the southern riverine region. These census designations were at the time pre-assigned rather than based on self-reporting. Following independence in 1960, no official census was taken until 1975. This first post-independence national census only collected information on district of birth. However, the general government literature maintained that the country's ethnic Somali majority was of Hamitic stock, or alternately of Arab heritage. Similarly, Article 3 of the Provision Constitution adopted in 2012 indicates that Somalia is an Arab nation. In 2014, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation also announced that it would release a new national population census before 2016.\n\nSouth Africa has enumerated people by race in all of its censuses since 1904. Five population group options are provided in response to the question \"How would \"(name)\" describe him/herself in terms of population group?\": \"Black African\", \"Coloured\", \"Indian or Asian\", \"White\" and \"Other\".

In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, the de facto independent country of Transnistria also enumerated people by ethnicity in its only post-Soviet census in 2004. Romania also enumerated people in Transnistria by ethnicity in its 1941 census.\n\nTunisia enumerated people by ethnicity in 1956.\n\nBetween 1881 and 1893 the Ottoman Empire implemented its first census, which enumerated the people in the empire by ethnicity. Some other censuses and studies were conducted in the Ottoman Empire for enumerating the population by ethnicity after the first Ottoman census.\n\nPeople in Turkmenistan (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Turkmenistan also enumerated people by ethnicity in its only post-Soviet census in 1995.\n\nThe people of Uganda were enumerated by ethnicity from 1948 all the way up to Uganda's most recent census in 2012, with the exception of 1980 and possibly 1969.\n\nPeople in Ukraine (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. In addition to the Soviet Union enumerating people by ethnicity for its entire existence, Ukraine also enumerated people by ethnicity in its only post-Soviet census in 2001.\n\nThe United Kingdom began counting people by ethnicity in 1991. There eventually became more of an interest in enumerating ethnic minorities after large-scale racial minority immigration to the United Kingdom began in the post-World War II era. The United Kingdom previously planned to enumerate people by ethnicity in 1981, but changed its mind after the large non-response rate to this question in the 1979 Test Census. In 1979, many ethnic minorities refused to answer this question due to the fear of deportation. In the 2011 census, the ethnic group options for England and Wales were White, Mixed, Asian British, Black British, Chinese or other ethnic group, and Not stated, with ethnic origin sub-group choices for most of these. The census in the United Kingdom also included a question on country of citizenship between 1851 and 1961.\n\nBefore the U.S. acquired independence from Great Britain, many of the Thirteen Colonies conducted censuses of their own where they enumerated their populations by race. The United States as a whole enumerated people by race in every census since its first census in 1790. Part of the reason why the United States began counting people by race much sooner than many other countries was due to the Three Fifths Compromise, which determined the amount of representation that Southern states had based on how many slaves they had (slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for representation purposes, and a new census every ten years was needed to enumerate the current slave population). Initially, the United States Census only counted Americans as either white or black, with blacks classified as either free or slaves until 1860 (slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865). Over time, the United States has also added some other racial categories as well. Asian and Native American categories were added in 1860. However, the first census to enumerate all Native Americans occurred in 1890. Before that point Native Americans living on reservations were not counted, and thus most Native Americans in the U.S. were not counted in census data before 1890. Between 1850 and 1870, and in 1890, 1910, and 1920, the U.S. Census Bureau also enumerated Mulattoes and sometimes other partially black groups (Quadroons and Octoroons) separately.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau counted Mexicans as a separate race in 1930 and tried to retroactively determine the number of Mexicans in the U.S. in 1910 and 1920 as well.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted a \"good neighbor\" policy that sought better relations with Mexico. In 1935, a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law. Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white. This policy encouraged the League of United Latin American Citizens in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting their whiteness.\n\nHispanics were counted as whites in 1940, but for the first time ever, the U.S. made an attempt to measure the size of the Hispanic population that year. The U.S. resumed enumerating its Hispanic/Latino population in 1970, with Hispanics being enumerated in every U.S. census since then. The U.S. Census Bureau also began offering Hispanics several sub-group options from which they could identify themselves, such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, et cetera (these Hispanic sub-group options have changed over time). The Other race category was added in 1950, and the Multiracial (\"two or more races\") category was added in 2000. Due to the adding of the Multiracial category, U.S. Census data since 2000 is not directly comparable with that of previous censuses. While people nowadays are enumerated by race based on self-identification, until 1950 their race on the census was mainly determined by their census enumerator. During this time multiracial people who were White and of another race were usually marked down as belonging to the other race due to the One drop rule.\n\nIt is worth noting that some of the definitions of race in the United States changed over time. For instance, Indian Americans were previously marked as Hindu in 1920–1940, Other race in 1950–1960, and White in 1970 before being marked as Asian (Indian) since 1980. The U.S. census counted certain Asian ethnic groups separately since 1870, initially counting only Chinese and Japanese, but having other categories as well since 1910. It only began counting all people by ethnic ancestry since the 1980 census, though. The United States enumerated most or all foreign-born Americans by mother between 1910 and 1970, with the exception of 1950. It counted the foreign-born aged five or more by the language that they spoke at home since 1980. Before 1970, Alaska and Hawaii had different choices for race on their censuses in contrast to the continental United States.\n\nThe 2020 United States Census might allow Middle Easterners and North Africans to write in their ethnicity/race instead of merely marking them as White. Right now, and in the past, Arabs have been marked in the U.S. Census as White. This began in the early twentieth century when Arabs coming to the United States successfully petitioned to be marked as White in order to avoid entry quotas and have a greater chance of achieving success and avoiding discrimination.\n\nThe United States is one of the countries that uses racial and ethnic census data in order to create minority-majority districts, as is required by the 1965 Voting Rights Act. These districts were created in order to increase minority representation in the United States Congress following the end of legal segregation and racial discrimination in the Southern United States.\n\nSince 1850, the United States enumerated its population by their country of birth of its population. The whole U.S. population was enumerated by country of birth between 1850 and 1930 and again from 1960 to the present day. Meanwhile, only the White population of the United States was enumerated by their country of birth in 1940 and 1950.\n\nPeople in Uzbekistan (when it was still a part of the Russian Empire) were enumerated by native tongue in the 1897 Russian Empire Census. The Soviet Union (to which Uzbekistan also belonged) enumerated people by ethnicity for its entire existence. Uzbekistan has not conducted any censuses at all since 1989.\n\nVatican City enumerated people by ethnicity in 1948.\n\nCommunist North Vietnam enumerated people by ethnicity in 1960, when Vietnam was still divided into two countries. After Vietnamese reunification, Vietnam enumerated its population by ethnicity from 1979 up to the most recent census in 2009.\n\nYemen enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1994. The British Colony of Aden (which is within Yemen's current borders) enumerated its population by ethnicity in 1946 and 1955.\n\nPeople in Zambia were not continuously counted by race before independence, and when they were counted by race it were primarily the non-Africans/non-blacks who were counted. People were counted by language only in 1931, while they were counted for ethnicity at various points since 1969. The 1969 census asked about language but not ethnic group, and the 1974 census asked about ethnic group, but not language. The 1980 census asked about ethnic group, mother tongue, and language of most frequent use, while the 1990 census asked about ethnic group and mother tongue.

Chiromancy is the divination from a subject's palms as practiced by the Romani (at the time recently arrived in Europe), and scapulimancy is the divination from animal bones, in particular shoulder blades, as practiced in peasant superstition. Nigromancy contrasts with this as scholarly \"high magic\" derived from High Medieval grimoires such as the \"Picatrix\" or the \"Liber Rasielis\".\n\nNecromancy or demonic magic is a black art usually performed in the night dealing with dark phenomena such as raising the dead. Using necromancy for divination is through a genocide using blood and corpses. Due to these acts, it is forbidden and goes against the Christian faith. The art and practitioners are not received well in philosophy as it destroy religion and taints a person's morals. Since demons enjoy blood, practitioners would experiment with human blood and flesh to obtain a demon's service. Hydromancy can be used alongside necromancy using the purity of children five to seven years old, repeating after their master's incantation over human blood or bones. The product deceives others through illusions such as transforming a person into animals.\n\nPractitioners in the late Middle Ages usually belonged to the educated elites due to the contents being written in Latin onto books. Demonic magic was usually performed in groups surrounding a spiritual leader in possession of necromantic books. One such case in 1444, Inquisitor Gaspare Sighicelli took action against a group active in Bologna. Marco Mattei of Gesso and friar Jacopo of Viterbo confessed to taking part in magical practices.\n\nThe art of geomancy was one of the more popular forms of magic that people practiced during the renaissance period. Geomancy was a form of divination where a person would cast sand, stone, or dirt on the ground and read the shapes. The Geomantic figures would then tell them \"anything\" based on geomancy charts that were used to read from the shape.\n\nHydromancy, a form of divination using water is typically used with scrying. Water is used as a medium for scrying to allow the practitioner see illusionary pictures within it. Hydromancy originated from Babylonia and was popular during Byzantine times whereas in medieval Europe, it was associated with witchcraft.\n\nAeromancy divination consisted in tossing sand, dirt, or seeds into the air and studying and interpreting the patterns of the dust cloud or the settling of the seeds. This also includes divination coming from thunder, comets, falling stars, and the shape of clouds.\n\nPyromancy is the art of divination which consisted of signs and patterns from flames. There are many variations of pyromancy depending on the material thrown into a fire and it is thought to be used for sacrifices to the gods and that the deity is present within the flames with priests interpreting the omens conveyed.\n\nChiromancy is a form of divination based on reading palms and based on intuitions and symbolism with some symbols tying into astrology. A line from a person's hand that resembles a square is considered a bad omen whereas a triangle would be a good omen. This idea comes from the trine and square aspect in the astrological aspects. \n\nScapulimancy was a form of divination using an animal's scapula. The scapula would be broken and based on how it was broken, it could be used to read the future. It was generally broken by heating it with hot coals until it broke.\n\nBoth bourgeoisie and nobility in the 15th and 16th century showed great fascination with \nthese arts, which exerted an exotic charm by their ascription to Arabic, Jewish, Romani, and Egyptian sources. There was great uncertainty in distinguishing practices of vain superstition, blasphemous occultism, and perfectly sound scholarly knowledge or pious ritual. Intellectual and spiritual tensions erupted in the Early Modern witch craze, further reinforced by the turmoils of the Protestant Reformation, especially in Germany, England, and Scotland. The people during this time found that the existence of magic was something that could answer the questions that they could not explain through science. To them it was suggesting that while science may explain reason, magic could explain \"unreason\".\n\nC. S. Lewis in his 1954 \"English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama\" differentiates what he takes to be the change of character in magic as practiced in the Middle Ages as opposed to the Renaissance:\n\nThe Hermetic/Cabalist magic which was created by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Marsilio Ficino was made popular in northern Europe, most notably England, by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's De \"occulta philosophia libra tres\". Agrippa had revolutionary ideas about magical theory and procedure that were widely circulated in the Renaissance among those who sought out knowledge of occult philosophy.\n\"Agrippa himself was famous as a scholar, physician jurist, and astrologer, but throughout his life he was continually persecuted as a heretic. His problems stemmed not only from his reputation as a conjurer, but also from his vehement criticism of the vices of the ruling classes and of the most respected intellectual and religious authorities.\"\nWhile some scholars and students viewed Agrippa as a source of intellectual inspiration, to many others, his practices were dubious and his beliefs serious. \nThe transitive side of magic is explored in Agrippa's \"De occulta philosophia\", and at times it is vulgarized. Yet in Pico and Ficino we never lose sight of magic's solemn religious purposes: the magician explores the secrets of nature so as to arouse wonder at the works of God and to inspire a more ardent worship and love of the Creator.\n\"Considerable space is devoted to examples of evil sorcery in De occulta philosophia, and one might easily come away from the treatise with the impression that Agrippa found witchcraft as intriguing as benevolent magic\"\n\nThe study of the occult arts remained widespread in the universities across Europe up until the Disenchantment period of the 17th Century. At the peak of the witch trials, there was a certain danger to be associated with witchcraft or sorcery, and most learned authors take pains to clearly renounce the practice of forbidden arts. Thus, Agrippa while admitting that natural magic is the highest form of natural philosophy unambiguously rejects all forms of ceremonial magic (goetia or necromancy). Indeed, the keen interest taken by intellectual circles in occult topics provided one driving force that enabled the witchhunts to endure beyond the Renaissance and into the 18th century. As the intellectual mainstream in the early 18th century ceased to believe in witchcraft, the witch trials soon subsided.\n\nRenaissance authors writing on occult or magical topics include:\n\n\n\n"}

The Hebrew word that is formed from the initials of these names means \"mischief-makers.\" This word appears in Jeremiah 3:22, which begins: \"Return o' mischief makers\" (שׁוּבוּ בָּנִים שׁוֹבָבִים). During a Jewish leap-year this period is extended to an eight-week period called \"Shovavim Tat\", derived by adding the next two portions, \"Terumah\" and \"Tetzaveh\", to the list. The period in which these portions are read typically falls around Tevet-Shevat in the Hebrew Calendar (corresponding to January–February).\n\nShovavim is a season when the Kabbalists teach that it is auspicious to repent for sins (\"mischief\"), especially for sexually-related transgressions. During these weeks, it is customary to be more careful not to violate any of the sexually-related transgressions commanded in the Torah. Some have the customs of studying laws relating to such transgressions, fasting and giving extra \"tzedakah\" during this time, and of reciting Selichos and other \"tikkunim\" (Kabbalistic prayers or meditations) designed to counteract their harmful effects. On the Shabbatot (Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath) when these weekly portions of the Torah are read, some take upon themselves to refrain from speaking, except words of prayer and Torah. This type of fast is called a \"ta'anit dibbur\" (תענית דבור).\n\nThe origin to these customs is based on Jewish Kabbalistic teachings and therefore Sephardic and Hassidic Jews are more likely to follow them than their Ashkenazic counterparts.\n\nDuring the Shovavim period, some Jewish individuals have the custom to fast every Monday and Thursday from dawn until dusk. Some fast on Friday (the eve of Shabbat) until the afternoon.\n\nThere are extra prayers added called \"Tikkun Shovavim\" during these weeks. Some have the custom of praying more prayers and reading extra Psalms during this period.\n\nA special type of fast called a \"ta'anit dibbur\" is observed by some during the Shovavim period. This does not involve refraining from eating and drinking, but from speaking. During the entire day (usually Shabbat, when regular fasting is prohibited), between sunrise and dusk, one refrains from superfluous speech. Speaking words of prayer and Torah is permitted. Some Jewish congregations gather on the Shabbat when these speech fasts are held, to read the entire book of Psalms three times (a total of 450 psalms). At an average pace, this reading can take up to ten hours. This is usually accomplished between the Shabbat morning meal and the afternoon prayer.\n\nIn the Lubavitch hassidic tradition, no mention is made of shovavim. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson wrote, \"there is no mention in the basic books of Chabad hassidism that refer to the fasts of shovavim, the word shovavim does not even appear. Because the main rectification through these fasts was already concluded by the first generations.\"\n\n"}

The website was operated as a hobby by David Rock of Cheltenham, England.\n\nOn October 18, 2007, the website's servers, located in the Netherlands, were raided and shut down by Gloucestershire police in cooperation with the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) in response to complaints received from major US film studios about TV Links. No official clarification has been made to date as to why the website was shut down. Simultaneously, David Rock was arrested, and later released pending further investigation, without being charged with a crime. Although FACT initially stated that the raid was performed because of allegations of copyright infringement, it later stated that Rock was arrested for trademark infringement.\n\nTV Links launched on October 2006, following a surge in services of its kind.

He stated that the arrest and shutdown were initiated because TV Links allowed users \"[to view] any one of a large number of films and television programmes directly via the website. This is illegal under UK copyright law.\"\n\nWhilst arrested under Section 92 of the Trade Marks Act 1994, he has now been released \"pending further investigation\" with no charges filed against him.

In an interview, Rock stated that he would have not started the website if he had found anything in the laws of the country stating that what he was doing was illegal.\n\nVideo content that was used by the website was hosted by third-party video sharing websites. TV Links used hyperlinks, and later a streaming web-based video player, in order to link visitors to videos.\n\nThe website had a forum community with a membership of around 37,000 members at the time of closure. Links to videos were posted daily on the forums by members, and later moved to the website listings by admins.\n\nAfter the video player was introduced, the website's crew enforced a strict policy against saving the provided video content, and viewing it outside the scope of its video player. This policy was further enforced by a technical implementation, the URL that directed the video player to video files contained a randomly generated MD5 encoded string, and was made to expire after several minutes, or after being loaded once.\n\nThe website's servers were purposely located in the Netherlands so that UK copyright law could not apply to them.\n\nAs part of the effort to protect the website against legal action, a link to the following legal disclaimer was displayed at the bottom of most pages.\nEva Wiseman of \"The Guardian\" had described the practices of linking to copyrighted content as \"teetering on the edge of illegality\" in an article on similar video directory services.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been speculated that concerns over the popularity of websites such as TV Links were an influence on the launch of official online video on demand services from Britain's terrestrial television networks, such as the BBC iPlayer and 4od.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13125058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13125058", "title": "The Aesthetics of Resistance", "text": "The Aesthetics of Resistance\n\nThe Aesthetics of Resistance (, 1975-1981) is a three-volume novel by the German-born playwright, novelist, filmmaker, and painter Peter Weiss.\n\nSpanning from the late 1930s into World War II, this historical novel dramatizes anti-fascist resistance and the rise and fall of proletarian political parties in Europe. Living in Berlin in 1937, the unnamed narrator and his peers, sixteen and seventeen-year-old working-class students, seek ways to express their hatred for the Nazi regime. They meet in museums and galleries, and in their discussions they explore the affinity between political resistance and art, the connection at the heart of Weiss's novel.\n\nWeiss suggests that meaning lies in the refusal to renounce resistance, no matter how intense the oppression, and that it is in art that new models of political action and social understanding are to be found. The novel includes extended meditations on paintings, sculpture, and literature. Moving from the Berlin underground to the front lines of the Spanish Civil War and on to other parts of Europe, the story teems with characters, almost all of whom are based on historical figures.\n\nThe three volumes of the novel were originally published in 1975, 1978 and 1981.\n\nWeiss's complex multi-layered 1000 page novel has been called a \"book of the century [Jahrhundertbuch].\" It can no more be usefully summarized than James Joyce's \"Ulysses\". By way of introducing \"The Aesthetics of Resistance\" what follows are the opening paragraphs of an article by Robert Cohen:\n\n\"\"The Aesthetics of Resistance\" begins with an absence. Missing is Heracles, the great hero of Greek mythology. The space he once occupied in the enormous stone frieze depicting the battle of the Giants against the Gods is empty. Some two thousand years ago the frieze covered the outer walls of the temple of Pergamon in Asia Minor. In the last third of the nineteenth century the remnants of the ancient monument were discovered by the German engineer Carl Humann and sent to Germany. The fragments were reassembled in the specially built Pergamon Museum in Berlin, the capital of Wilhelminian Germany, and were to signal from this point forward the late claims to power of German imperialism. The Pergamon frieze can still be seen in Berlin today. In the fall of 1937 – and here we are at the beginning of Peter Weiss's novel – three young men find themselves before the frieze. Two of them, Coppi and the narrator, whose name is never mentioned, are workers. The third, a sixteen-year-old named Heilmann, is a high school student. Coppi is a member of the illegal Communist Party, Heilmann and the narrator are sympathizers. All three are active in the antifascist resistance. In a lengthy discussion the three friends attempt to interpret the stone figures and events depicted in the frieze in a way which would make them relevant for their own present day struggle. They cannot, however, find Heracles. Other than a fragment of his name and the paw of a lion's skin, nothing remains of the leader of the Gods in the battle against the Giants. The \"leader\" of 1937, on the other hand, is an omnipresent force, even in the still halls of the Pergamon Museum, where uniformed SS troopers, their Nazi insignia clearly visible, mingle among the museum's visitors. Under the pressure of the present and with their lives in constant danger, the three young antifascists read the empty space in the frieze as an omen, they feel encouraged to fill it with their own representation of the absent half-god. What they envision is an alternative myth in stark contrast to the traditional image of Heracles. From a friend of the Gods, the mighty and the powerful, Heracles is transformed into a champion of the lowest classes, of the exploited, imprisoned, and tortured – a messianic \"leader\" in the struggle against the terror of the \"Führer\".\n\n\"[\"The Aesthetics of Resistance\"] . . . which [Peter Weiss] began when he was well over fifty, making a pilgrimage over the arid slopes of cultural and contemporary history in the company of \"pavor nocturnus\", the terror of the night, and laden with a monstrous weight of ideological ballast, is a magnum opus which sees itself . . . not only as the expression of an ephemeral wish for redemption, but as an expression of the \"will\" to be on the side of the victims at the end of time.\"\nW. G. Sebald, \"On The Natural History of Destruction\"\n\nVisual artists such as Hubertus Giebe and composers such as Kalevi Aho or Helmut Oehring have taken up motives from \"The Aesthetics of Resistance\" in their paintings and compositions. The novel has been adapted for the stage by Thomas Krupa and Tilman Neuffer at Grillo-Theater Essen in May 2012. The band Rome was inspired by the novels when making their album trilogy Die Æsthetik Der Herrschaftsfreiheit.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "320237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320237", "title": "The Eternaut", "text": "The Eternaut\n\nEl Eternauta is a science fiction comic created by Argentine comic strip writer Héctor Germán Oesterheld with artwork by Francisco Solano López. It was first published in \"Hora Cero Semanal\" from 1957 to 1959.\n\nOesterheld returned to \"El Eternauta\" with a remake and a sequel, published in 1969 and 1975, respectively. Both featured a more political script, as Oesterheld was disturbed by political conditions in the nation after military juntas had overthrown elected governments. By the time he published the sequel, he and his daughters had joined the Montoneros leftist guerrilla group. Oesterheld disappeared in 1977, was seen in prisons, and is believed to have been tortured, killed, and \"disappeared\" in 1979 by the U.S.-backed military dictatorship.\n\nSince the restoration of democracy in 1983, \"El Eternauta\" has been continued in different versions by a variety of writers and artists.\n\nThe \"Eternauta\" was first published in \"Hora Cero Suplemento Semanal\" on September 4, 1957. Quickly becoming a success, the serial publication ran until 1959. It was reissued in 1961 in a dedicated magazine, \"Eternauta\", published by Editorial Emilio Ramírez.\n\nIn 1969, Oesterheld rewrote \"El Eternauta\", with changes to the story, more political references and more violence. It became an open critique of dictatorial regimes and United States' imperialism. This version featured artwork by Alberto Breccia, who drew the story in an experimental and unique style diverging from the original expression. It was first published on May 29, 1969 in the weekly \"Gente\". The following years the series was also published in several European magazines, such as \"Linus\", \"El Globo\", \"Alter Alter\", \"Il Mago\", \"Charlie Mensuel\" and \"Metal Hurlant\".\n\nIn December 1975, Ediciones Record began publishing new episodes of \"Eternauta II\" in \"Skorpio.\" Oesterheld resumed the story, with artwork by Solano López. Disturbed by the Dirty War and political repression of the period, Oesterheld criticized the dictatorship. He placed himself as a narrating character within the story. Having joined the banned leftist organization Montoneros with his daughters, Oesterheld wrote the chapters from hidden locations. He disappeared in 1977, believed abducted by government forces. Oesterheld is believed to have died after 1979, when he was last reported alive. His daughters also disappeared, as were their husbands. Only his widow and two grandsons survived, the youngest boy recovered from government custody after being born while his mother was in prison.\n\nOther authors have continued the saga. A third part, \"El Eternauta, Tercera Parte\" (1983), published after the restoration of democracy, met with moderate success. It was criticized for being just another sci-fi comic instead of a continuation of the series' political content. Later chapters, \"El mundo arrepentido\" and \"El Eternauta, El regreso, \" feature artwork by Solano López.\n\nFantagraphics Books published the first translation into English, under the name \"The Eternaut\". It was translated by Erica Mena. It is the first time that the book was published in the English language.\n\n\n\nThe story begins as a deadly snowfall covers Buenos Aires and the surrounding metropolitan area, wiping out most life in a few hours. Juan Salvo, along with a couple of friends (Favalli, Lucas and Polski who were playing truco at his house), his wife and daughter remain safe from the lethal snowflakes thanks to the protection of Juan Salvo's home and the cleverness of Favalli. They organize to survive the ordeal, making special suits to be able to leave the house to gather supplies. During these trips they find Pablo, a twelve-year-old boy, and realize that crazed or needy survivors may be as much of a threat as the deadly snow.\nA few days into the snowfall, they learn that the phenomenon was caused by an extraterrestrial invasion to Earth. They are recruited into an improvised resistance army to fight the invaders. During this time, Salvo meets and befriends a few of his fellow soldiers, namely Franco, a lathe operator, and Mosca, a journalist. As the insurgents march towards the country's capital city, they fight on different occasions against giant insects (\"cascarudos\", \"beetles\"); a humanoid species with many more fingers than humans, especially on their right hands (\"Manos\", \"Hands\"); giant elephantine beasts capable of knocking buildings down (\"Gurbos\"); and fellow men who were captured and altered (\"hombres-robot\", \"robot-men\"). All of these beings are pawns, remotely controlled through implants or fear devices by the real invaders, \"los Ellos\" (\"Them\"), unseen creatures who remain hidden, controlling everything from the distance.\n\nAfter managing a few victories, the resistance forces are ambushed and reduced to a few men. Juan Salvo decides to return to his wife and daughter to go into hiding with them. A passing ICBM convinces Favalli and Franco that a larger global war is starting, and that they can't return empty-handed. Salvo reluctantly agrees to join them. After the trio attacks the aliens' HQ in Buenos Aires, taking down the \"anti-nukes field\", they flee. Buenos Aires is leveled by a nuclear warhead.\n\nGradually the aliens lure the pockets of survivors throughout the country to \"snow-free zones\" as part of an elaborate ruse. Salvo's group splits, and he tries to escape with his wife and daughter using one of the alien spaceships. He accidentally triggers a time traveling apparatus in the craft. As a result, the three are lost in separate time dimensions known as \"continuums\". Juan Salvo begins to travel through time seeking them, eventually being named \"Eternauta\", a voyager of eternity.\n\n\nNumerous comic book artists and members of the specialized press have remarked on Oesterheld's amplitude of subtle interpretations, veiled references and double readings. Oesterheld indicated that the protagonists were always a group of people - sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller - something he terms a \"group hero\" or \"hero-in-group.\" He believed this was a more valuable concept than the traditional individual hero who appears to triumph without help from others.\n\nCritics have frequently likened the invaders and their methods as veiled references to the various military-led coup d'états which occurred at the time in the country. The three versions written by Oesterheld (the first part, its remake and the second part) were contemporaneous with the \"de facto\" governments of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, Juan Carlos Onganía and the \"Proceso de Reorganización Nacional,\" respectively.\n\nIt has also been noted that, except for the \"Ellos\", none of the invaders is truly evil; they are noble beings forced to carry out the orders of others. Critics believe Oesterheld was conceptually attacking the Dirty War or writing an allegory of class struggle.\n\nDirectors such as Adolfo Aristarain, Fernando Solanas or Gustavo Mosquera expressed interest in a film adaptation, but could not manage reasonable production costs.\n\nIn 2008, under supervision by Elsa Oesterheld, the writer's widow, an Italian production company worked on a film adaptation of the original comic. The story would be set in Buenos Aires and the possibility of co-producing the film with INCAA was discussed. Lucrecia Martel was reported as slated to direct the film and said that production was already past the \"embryonic stages.\" In 2009, however, Martel was dropped due to conceptual differences with the producers.\n\nFootnotes\n"}

In 18th century Europe, the footmen of aristocrats and royalty would deliver these first European visiting cards to the servants of their prospective hosts solemnly introducing the arrival of their owners.\n\nVisiting cards became an indispensable tool of etiquette, with sophisticated rules governing their use. The essential convention was that a first person would not expect to see a second person in the second's own home (unless invited or introduced) without the first having first left his visiting card at the second's home. Upon leaving the card, the first would not expect to be admitted at first, but instead might receive a card at his own home in response from the second. This would serve as a signal that a personal visit and meeting at home would be welcome. On the other hand, if no card was forthcoming, or if a card was sent in an envelope, a personal visit was thereby discouraged.\n\nAs an adoption from France, they were called \"une carte d'adresse\" from 1615 to 1800, and then became \"carte de visite\" or \"visiteur\" with the advent of photography in the mid 19th century. Visiting cards became common among the aristocracy of Europe, and also in the United States. The whole procedure depended upon there being servants to open the door and receive the cards and it was, therefore, confined to the social classes which employed servants.\n\nIf a card was left with a turned corner it indicated that the card had been left in person rather than by a servant.\n\nSome visiting cards included refined engraved ornaments, embossed lettering, and fantastic coats of arms. However, the standard form visiting card in the 19th century in the United Kingdom was a plain card with nothing more than the bearer's name on it. Sometimes the name of a gentlemen's club might be added, but addresses were not otherwise included. Visiting cards were kept in highly decorated card cases.\n\nThe visiting card is no longer the universal feature of upper middle class and upper class life that it once was in Europe and North America. Much more common is the business card, in which contact details, including address and telephone number, are essential. This has led to the inclusion of such details even on modern domestic visiting cards: \"Debrett's New Etiquette\" in 2007 endorsed the inclusion of private and club addresses (at the bottom left and right respectively) but states the inclusion of a telephone or fax number would be \"a solecism\". \n\nAccording to \"Debrett's Handbook\" in 2016, a gentleman's card would traditionally give his title, rank, private or service address (bottom left) and club (bottom right) in addition to his name. Titles of peers are given with no prefix (e.g. simply \"Duke of Wellington\"), courtesy titles are similarly given as \"Lord John Smith\", etc., but \"Hon\" (for \"the Honourable\") are not used (Mr, Ms, etc. being used instead). Those without titles of nobility or courtesy titles may use ecclesiastical titles, military ranks, \"Professor\" or \"Dr\", or Mr, Ms, etc. For archbishops, bishops, deans and archdeacons, the territorial title is used (e.g. \"The Bishop of London\"). Men may use their forenames or initials, while a married or widowed woman may either use her husband's name (the traditional usage) or her own. The only post-nominal letters used are those indicating membership of the armed forces (e.g. \"Captain J. Smith, RN\"). The \"Social Card\", which is a modern version of the visiting card, features a person's name, mobile phone number, and email address, with an optional residential address rarely included; family social cards include the names of parents and children.\n\n\n"}
