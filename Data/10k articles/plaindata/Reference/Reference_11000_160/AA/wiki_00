{"id": "3144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3144", "title": "A Doll's House", "text": "A Doll's House\n\nA Doll's House (; also translated as \"A Doll House\") is a three-act play written by Norway's Henrik Ibsen. It premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month. The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879.\n\nThe play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman, who at the time in Norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. It aroused a great sensation at the time, and caused a “storm of outraged controversy” that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society.\n\nIn 2006, the centennial of Ibsen's death, \"A Doll's House\" held the distinction of being the world's most performed play that year. UNESCO has inscribed Ibsen's autographed manuscripts of \"A Doll's House\" on the Memory of the World Register in 2001, in recognition of their historical value.\n\nThe title of the play is most commonly translated as \"A Doll's House\", though some scholars use \"A Doll House\". John Simon says that \"A Doll’s House\" is \"the British term for what [Americans] call a 'dollhouse'\". Egil Törnqvist says of the alternative title: \"Rather than being superior to the traditional rendering, it simply sounds more idiomatic to Americans.\"\n\n\nThe play opens at Christmas time as Nora Helmer enters her home carrying many packages. Nora's husband Torvald is working in his study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts, calling her his \"little squirrel.\" He teases her about how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because money was scarce. This year Torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. The maid announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's, who has come seeking employment; and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the family, who is let into the study. Kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children. Nora says that things have not been easy for them either: Torvald became sick, and they had to travel to Italy so he could recover. Kristine explains that when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers, but now that they are grown she feels her life is \"unspeakably empty.\" Nora promises to talk to Torvald about finding her a job. Kristine gently tells Nora that she is like a child. Nora is offended, so she teases the idea that she got money from \"some admirer,\" so they could travel to Italy to improve Torvald's health. She told Torvald that her father gave her the money, but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldn't do anything economical like signing checks without their husband. Over the years, she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off.\n\nKrogstad, a lower-level employee at Torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the study. Nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. Dr. Rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched, though like everyone he wants to go on living. In contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the study, Krogstad, is \"morally diseased.\"\n\nAfter the meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes out of the study. Nora asks him if he can give Kristine a position at the bank and Torvald is very positive, saying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become available. Torvald, Kristine, and Dr. Rank leave the house, leaving Nora alone. The nanny returns with the children and Nora plays with them for a while until Krogstad creeps into the living room and surprises her. Krogstad tells Nora that Torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to intercede with Torvald to allow him to keep his job. She refuses, and Krogstad threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to Italy; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature. Krogstad leaves and when Torvald returns, Nora tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad. Torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that Krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime: he forged someone's name. Torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man \"poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation.\"\n\nKristine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume function that she and Torvald plan to attend the next day. Torvald returns from the bank, and Nora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad, claiming she is worried Krogstad will publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald dismisses her fears and explains that, although Krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is not deferential enough to Torvald in front of other bank personnel. Torvald then retires to his study to work.\n\nDr. Rank, the family friend, arrives. Nora asks him for a favor, but Rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of tuberculosis of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. She tries clumsily to tell him that she is not in love with him but that she loves him dearly as a friend.\n\nDesperate after being fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora convinces Dr. Rank to go into Torvald's study so he will not see Krogstad. When Krogstad confronts Nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of Nora's loan, but that he will instead preserve the associated bond to blackmail Torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. Nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature of surety on the bond) and put it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.\n\nNora tells Kristine of her difficult situation. Having had a relationship with Krogstad in the past before her marriage, Kristine says that they are still in love and promises to try to convince him to relent.\n\nTorvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but Nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, feigning anxiety about performing. She dances so badly and acts so childishly that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When the others go to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.\n\nKristine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits. Krogstad changes his mind and offers to take back his letter to Torvald. However, Kristine decides that Torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.\n\nAfter literally dragging Nora home from the party, Torvald goes to check his mail but is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has followed them. Dr. Rank chats for a while, conveying obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his letters. As he reads them, Nora steels herself to take her life. Torvald confronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that he is now completely in Krogstad's power; he must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. He says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.\n\nA maid enters, delivering a letter to Nora. The letter is from Krogstad, yet Torvald demands to read the letter and takes it from Nora. Torvald exults that he is saved, as Krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which Torvald immediately burns along with Krogstad's letters. He takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves himself more than he does Nora.\n\nTorvald explains that when a man has forgiven his wife, it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. He dismisses the fact that Nora had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health, and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation. He preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.\n\nNora tells Torvald that she is leaving him, and in a confrontational scene expresses her sense of betrayal and disillusionment. She says he has never loved her, they have become strangers to each other. She feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving Krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. She has lost her religion. She says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. Concerned for the family reputation, Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but Nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important, and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.\n\nTorvald is unable to comprehend Nora's point of view, since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life. Furthermore, he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical, and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality. Nora leaves her keys and wedding ring, and as Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened, Nora leaves the house, slamming the door behind her. Whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear.\n\nIbsen's German agent felt that the original ending would not play well in German theatres. Therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, Ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the German premiere. In this ending, Nora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she collapses, and the curtain is brought down. Ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a \"barbaric outrage\". Virtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all of the film versions of the play.\n\n\"A Doll's House\" was based on the life of Laura Kieler (maiden name Laura Smith Petersen), a good friend of Ibsen. Much that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband, Victor. Similar to the events in the play, Laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband. She wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's tuberculosis. She wrote to Ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt. At his refusal, she forged a check for the money. At this point she was found out. In real life, when Victor discovered about Laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known Danish author, living to the age of 83.\n\nIbsen wrote \"A Doll's House\" at the point when Laura Kieler had been committed to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. In the play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.\n\nKieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as \"Ibsen's Nora\" years afterwards.\n\nIbsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its protagonist, Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing \"a blue woollen dress\"). He outlined his conception of the play as a \"modern tragedy\" in a note written in Rome on 19 October 1878. \"A woman cannot be herself in modern society,\" he argues, since it is \"an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.\"\n\nIbsen sent a fair copy of the completed play to his publisher on 15 September 1879. It was first published in Copenhagen on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880, and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.\n\n\"A Doll's House\" received its world premiere on 21 December 1879 at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, with Betty Hennings as Nora, Emil Poulsen as Torvald, and Peter Jerndorff as Dr. Rank. Writing for the Norwegian newspaper \"Folkets Avis\", the critic Erik Bøgh admired Ibsen's originality and technical mastery: \"Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear.\" Every performance of its run was sold out. Another production opened at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm, on 8 January 1880, while productions in Christiania (with Johanne Juell as Nora and Arnoldus Reimers as Torvald) and Bergen followed shortly after.\n\nIn Germany, the actress Hedwig Niemann-Raabe refused to perform the play as written, declaring, \"\"I\" would never leave \"my\" children!\" Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright, Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a \"barbaric outrage\" on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not leave. A production of this version opened in Flensburg in February 1880. This version was also played in Hamburg, Dresden, Hanover, and Berlin, although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-Raabe eventually restored the original ending. Another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March 1880 at the Residenz Theatre in Munich.\n\nIn Great Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in London was in an adaptation by Henry Arthur Jones and Henry Herman called \"Breaking a Butterfly\". This adaptation was produced at the Princess Theatre, 3 March 1884. Writing in 1896 in his book \"The Foundations of a National Drama\", Jones says: \"A rough translation from the German version of A Doll's House was put into my hands, and I was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play, a ready opening would be found for it on the London boards. I knew nothing of Ibsen, but I knew a great deal of Robertson and H. J. Byron. From these circumstances came the adaptation called \"Breaking a Butterfly\".\" H. L. Mencken writes that it was \"A Doll’s House\" “denaturized and dephlogisticated. … Toward the middle of the action Ibsen was thrown to the fishes, and Nora was saved from suicide, rebellion, flight and immortality by making a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from Krogstad’s desk. … The curtain fell upon a happy home.“\n\nBefore 1899 there were two private productions of the play in London (in its original form as Ibsen wrote it) — one featured George Bernard Shaw in the role of Krogstad. The first public British production of the play in its regular form opened on 7 June 1889 at the Novelty Theatre, starring Janet Achurch as Nora and Charles Charrington as Torvald. Achurch played Nora again for a 7-day run in 1897. Soon after its London premiere, Achurch brought the play to Australia in 1889.\n\nThe play was first seen in America in 1883 in Louisville, Kentucky; Helena Modjeska acted Nora. The play made its Broadway premiere at the Palmer's Theatre on 21 December 1889, starring Beatrice Cameron as Nora Helmer. It was first performed in France in 1894.\nOther productions in the United States include one in 1902 starring Minnie Maddern Fiske, a 1937 adaptation with acting script by Thornton Wilder and starring Ruth Gordon, and a 1971 production starring Claire Bloom.\n\nA new translation by Zinnie Harris at the Donmar Warehouse, starring Gillian Anderson, Toby Stephens, Anton Lesser, Tara FitzGerald and Christopher Eccleston opened in May 2009. In August 2013, Young Vic, London, Great Britain, produced a new adaptation of \"A Doll's House\" directed by Carrie Cracknell based on the English language version by Simon Stephens.\nIn September 2014, in partnership with Brisbane Festival, La Boite located in Brisbane, Australia, hosted an adaptation of \"A Doll's House\" written by Lally Katz and directed by Stephen Mitchell Wright.\nIn June 2015, Space Arts Centre in London staged an adaptation of \"A Doll's House\" featuring the discarded alternate ending.\n'Manaveli' Toronto is preparing to stage a Tamil version of \"A Doll's House\"(ஒரு பொம்மையின் வீடு)on 30 June 2018, Directed by Mr P Wikneswaran.\n\n\"A Doll's House\" questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage. To many 19th-century Europeans, this was scandalous. The covenant of marriage was considered holy, and to portray it as Ibsen did was controversial. However, the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw found Ibsen's willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating.\n\nThe Swedish playwright August Strindberg criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories \"Getting Married\" (1884). Strindberg questioned Nora’s walking out and leaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him. Strindberg also considers that Nora’s involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved Nora forging a signature, all done behind her husband’s back, and then Nora’s lying to her husband regarding Krogstad’s blackmail, are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play, when Nora is moralistically judging her husband. And Strindberg points out that Nora’s complaint that she and Torvald “have never exchanged one serious word about serious things,” is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two.\n\nThe reasons Nora leaves her husband are complex, and various details are hinted at throughout the play. In the last scene, she tells her husband she has been “greatly wronged” by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her, and his attitude towards her in their marriage — as though she were his “doll wife” — and the children in turn have become her “dolls,” leading her to doubt her own qualifications to raise her children. She is troubled by her husband’s behavior in regard to the scandal of the loaned money. She does not love her husband, she feels they are strangers, she feels completely confused, and suggests that her issues are shared by many women. George Bernard Shaw suggests that she left to begin “a journey in search of self-respect and apprenticeship to life,” and that her revolt is “the end of a chapter of human history.”\n\nIbsen was inspired by the belief that \"a woman cannot be herself in modern society,\" since it is \"an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.\" Its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: Michael Meyer argued that the play's theme is not women's rights, but rather \"the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person.\" In a speech given to the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he \"must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement,\" since he wrote \"without any conscious thought of making propaganda,\" his task having been \"the \"description of humanity\".\"\n\nBecause of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in Nora's leaving home, her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself. In \"Iconoclasts\" (1905), James Huneker noted \"That slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world.\"\n\n\"A Doll's House\" has been adapted for the cinema on many occasions, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the last in his four-piece series, \"The Epic of the Indian\". A statuette of it is in the permanent collection of the White House, and decorated President Bill Clinton's Oval Office.\n\nDallin, a native of Utah, had a large amount of interaction with Native American children while growing up. This provided him with unique insights that he was to call upon while creating this, and other, works. The actual model who posed for the sculpture was Antonio Corsi, an Italian, who modeled for the great painters and sculptors of the era.\n\nIn 1909, the sculpture was cast in Paris, and won a gold medal for its exhibition in the Paris Salon. On January 23, 1912, it was installed outside the main entrance to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. A restoration of the Boston version was reversed at Dallin's request because he preferred the light green tones that had developed on the equestrian sculpture over time rather than the typical \"statuary brown\" patina the conservator applied prior to consulting him.\n\nAn edition of nine 40-inch bronzes of the statue was produced about 1922. One example stands as the centerpiece of the Tower Room of Dartmouth College's Baker Tower, the college's main library and most iconic building. There is a full-scale model in Muncie, Indiana, in the \"Y\" of the intersection of Walnut and Granville streets in the Wysor Heights Historic District , and is considered by many residents to be a symbol of Muncie. A plaster example in this size is at the Cyrus Dallin Museum in Arlington, Massachusetts, and another is in the Rockwell Museum in Corning, New York. Central High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma possesses another plaster example, which was used, in 1985, as the model for a bronze version. The casting was done by American Artbronze Fine Arts Foundry under the direction of Howard R. Kirsch. The heroic sized bronze is now installed in Woodward Park in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the intersection of 21st Street and Peoria.\n\nExamples of the 21-inch bronze statuette are at the White House, the U.S. Department of State, and many American museums.\n\nAn 8-1/2-inch miniature edition was produced by the Gorham Manufacturing Company in 1913; in 2009, No. 263 sold for $9,375.\n\n\n"}

The archive is hosted by National ARAS, with institutional members in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco.\n\nThe ARAS archive contains about 17,000 photographic images collected over more than sixty years, each accompanied by scholarly commentary. The commentary includes a description of the image with a cultural history that places it in context historically and geographically, an important aspect for understanding and working with archetypal images. Where applicable, the commentary brings the image into focus for its modern psychological and symbolic meaning, as well as often including a bibliography for related reading and a glossary of technical terms.\n\nThe archive has physical repositories in the cities of its institutional-member hosts; it is also available online (online access does require a subscription) and images are indexed with keywords, including historical, cultural, geographic and other useful terms. ARAS also publishes a quarterly online journal connecting art, culture and depth psychology from a multi-disciplinary perspective that can be subscribed to free of charge on their website, aras.org.\n\nThe ARAS archive is designed for and used by students and scholars for research, by artists and designers as a sourcebook of motifs and iconographic forms, by individuals interested in commonalities in mythology, dream imagery, and vision which transcend nation and ideology, and by practitioners of depth psychology or other psychological perspectives wanting to enhance their knowledge of archetypal symbolism.\n\nAmong the scholars who have visited or made use of ARAS' resources are Erich Neumann, who in his \"The Great Mother: An Analysis of the Archetype\" (Princeton, 1955) mined ARAS for images of ancient goddesses to explore the archetype of the feminine as it evolved over the centuries from ancient Sumeria and Egypt into the modern era. Two volumes have been published containing a small fraction of the images held by ARAS, entitled \"An Encyclopedia of Archetypal Symbolism\".\n\nARAS was begun—and built to over six thousand images—by spiritualist and scholar Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn, who founded the Eranos conferences in 1933. Each conference had a theme, and Fröbe-Kapteyn collected images to illustrate the topic of each year's meeting. In 1946, Olga Froebe-Kapteyn gave her collection of pictorial artifacts to the Warburg Institute in London, and photographic duplicates were given to the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich and to the Bollingen Foundation in New York. The collection in New York was edited and further developed, including collection, sorting, and classification of the material and the development of detailed study sheets for every image. This New York archive was eventually renamed the Archive for Research in Archetypal Symbolism and was acquired by the C.G. Jung Foundation of New York (mirror collections exist at the C.G. Jung Institutes in San Francisco and Los Angeles). The close association of ARAS with the Jung Institutes is \"not because a symbolic point of view is limited to Jungians, but because Jung was the particular proponent of a broadly archetypal point of view that insists upon transpersonal and symbolic connections transcending cultural and theological boundaries. This perspective lies at the heart of the archive.\"\n\nARAS contains more than 17,000 images from every era of human history, from the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras, from ancient India, Asia Minor, Egypt, and Mycenae, from small tribal societies to great empires. The study sheets that accompany each image provide a detailed description of the image, a cultural history to place it in context, an archetypal commentary which examines the image's modern psychological meaning and offers numerous cross-cultural references to related concepts/images, a bibliography for related reading, and a glossary of technical terms. This detailed documentation renders the library of images accessible to the lay person as well as the specialist scholar, although as the ARAS homepage notes, \"There is...no supposition among those working in this field that they have found the one and only way of interpreting archetypal symbolism. The symbol is forever recreating itself anew in the imaginations of those who experience it.\"\n\nWhile for many years the archive was accessible only by personal visit to one of the three locations, New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, the digitization of the archive has made it accessible to anyone with a computer connected through a web browser to the Internet. ARAS online is built over a powerful search engine accessible through an intuitive user interface, and aided by reference features such as the ARAS cultural timeline. This timeline shows the selected images placed in historical time, and a click on the \"live\" marker for a particular image opens that image and its descriptive content.\n\nARAS online content is available only to members.

{"id": "2405448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2405448", "title": "Bixby letter", "text": "Bixby letter\n\nThe Bixby letter is a brief, consoling message sent by President Abraham Lincoln in November 1864 to Lydia Parker Bixby, a widow living in Boston, Massachusetts, who was thought to have lost five sons in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Along with the Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address, the letter has been praised as one of Lincoln's finest written works and is often reproduced in memorials, media, and print.\n\nControversy surrounds the recipient, the fate of her sons, and the authorship of the letter. Bixby's character has been questioned (including rumored Confederate sympathies), at least two of her sons survived the war, and the letter was possibly written by Lincoln's assistant private secretary, John Hay.\n\nPresident Lincoln's letter of condolence was delivered to Lydia Bixby on November 25, 1864 and was printed in the \"Boston Evening Transcript\" and \"Boston Evening Traveller\" that afternoon. The following is the text of the letter as first published:\n\nLydia Parker married shoemaker Cromwell Bixby on September 26, 1826, in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. The couple had at least six sons and three daughters before Cromwell's death in 1854. Some time before the Civil War, Bixby and her family settled in Boston.\n\nOn September 24, 1864, Massachusetts Adjutant General William Schouler wrote to Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew about a discharge request sent to the governor by Otis Newhall, the father of five Union soldiers. In the letter, Schouler recalled how, two years prior, they had helped a poor widow named Lydia Bixby to visit a son who was a patient at an Army hospital. About ten days earlier, Bixby had come to Schouler's office claiming that five of her sons had died fighting for the Union. Governor Andrew forwarded Newhall's request to the U.S. War Department with a note requesting that the president honor Bixby with a letter.\n\nIn response to a War Department request of October 1, Schouler sent a messenger to Bixby's home six days later, asking for the names and units of her sons. He sent a report to the War Department on October 12, which was delivered to President Lincoln by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton sometime after October 28.\n\nOn November 21, both the \"Boston Evening Traveller\" and the \"Boston Evening Transcript\" published an appeal by Schouler for contributions to assist soldiers' families at Thanksgiving which mentioned a widow who had lost five sons in the war. Schouler had some of the donations given to Bixby and then visited her home on Thanksgiving, November 24. The letter from the President arrived at Schouler's office the next morning.\n\nNevertheless, at least two of Lydia Bixby's sons survived the war:\n\nSchouler's report to the War Department erroneously listed Edward as a member of the 22nd Massachusetts Infantry who had died of his wounds at Folly Island, South Carolina. Bixby may have been trying to conceal—possibly from embarrassment or hope of further financial aid—Edward's 1862 desertion. (She had been receiving a pension following Charles's death in 1863.)\n\nAt the time of her September meeting with Schouler, Bixby's son George had been a prisoner of war for just over a month, and Henry was still hospitalized following his exchange. The War Department failed to use its own records to correct errors in the Schouler report.\n\nLydia Bixby died in Boston on October 27, 1878, while a patient at Massachusetts General Hospital. In his initial letter to Governor Andrew, Schouler called Bixby \"the best specimen of a true-hearted Union woman I have yet seen,\" but in the years following her death both her character and loyalty were questioned.\n\nWriting to her daughter in 1904, Boston socialite Sarah Cabot Wheelwright claimed she had met and had given charitable aid to Lydia Bixby during the war, hoping that one of her sons, in Boston on leave, might help deliver packages to Union prisoners of war; but she later heard gossip that Bixby \"kept a house of ill-fame, was perfectly untrustworthy and as bad as she could be\".\n\nIn the 1920s, Lincoln scholar, William E Barton interviewed the oldest residents of Hopkinton, Massachusetts for their memories of Bixby's family before she moved to Boston. They recalled her sons as being \"tough\" with \"some of them too fond of drink\". One son may have \"served a jail sentence for some misdemeanor\".\n\nOn August 12, 1925, Elizabeth Towers, a daughter of Oliver Bixby, told the \"Boston Herald\" that her grandmother had \"great sympathy for the South\" and that her mother recalled that Bixby had been \"highly indignant\" about the letter with \"little good to say of President Lincoln\". In 1949, Towers' nephew, Arthur March Bixby, claimed that Lydia Bixby had moved to Massachusetts from Richmond, Virginia; though this assertion is contradicted by contemporary records that list her birthplace as Rhode Island.\n\nThe fate of the original letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told \"The New York Times\" in an August 9, 1925 interview that he did not know what happened to the letter after his grandmother received it, though he doubted it still survived. A few days later, William's sister, Elizabeth told the \"Boston Herald\" that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the \"New York Sun\" in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.\n\nIn the early 20th century, it was sometimes claimed that the original letter could be found on display at Brasenose College at the University of Oxford along with other great works in the English language. Lincoln scholar F. Lauriston Bullard investigated this claim in 1925, discovering that it was untrue and the college had never heard of the Bixby letter.\n\nChristie's auction house receives many supposed original Bixby letters every year, including copies of a lithographic facsimile of the letter in widespread circulation. These first appeared in 1891, when New York City print dealer Michael F. Tobin applied for a copyright to sell souvenir copies of the letter with an engraving of Lincoln by John Chester Buttre for $2 each. Soon, Huber's Museum, a dime museum in Manhattan, began displaying a copy, \"stained by coffee and exposure\", of Tobin's facsimile as \"the original Bixby letter\" and selling their own copies for $1 each.\n\nCharles Hamilton, an autograph dealer and handwriting expert, examined the Tobin facsimile; concluding it had been copied from a poorly executed forgery originally written in pencil and retraced in ink to imitate Lincoln's handwriting, calling it \"halting and awkward and makes his forceful hand appear like a child's scrawl\".\n\nTobin's facsimile also errs when compared to the original text of the letter published in Boston newspapers; adding the salutation \"To Mrs Bixby, Boston Mass\", misspelling the word \"assuage\" as \"assauge\", omitting the word \"to\" after the word \"tendering\", changing the plural \"words\" into \"word\", not capitalizing the words \"freedom\" and \"republic\", missing the recipient \"Mrs. Bixby\" on the bottom left, and combining the original three paragraphs into one. Huber's Museum corrected the spelling of \"assuage\" in their version of the facsimile.\nScholars have debated whether the Bixby letter was written by Lincoln himself or by his assistant private secretary, John Hay. November 1864 was a busy month for Lincoln, possibly forcing him to delegate the task to Hay.\n\nSecond- and third-hand recollections of acquaintances suggest Hay may have claimed to others that he wrote it, but his children could not recall him ever mentioning composing the letter. Writing to William E. Chandler in 1904, Hay said \"the letter of Mr. Lincoln to Mrs. Bixby is genuine\", but he may only have been referring to its text. In a 1917 letter to historian Isaac Markens, Robert Todd Lincoln said Hay had told him that he did not have \"any special knowledge of the letter at the time\" it was written.\n\nHistorian Michael Burlingame, who believes Hay is the author, has pointed out that Hay's scrapbooks have two newspaper clippings of the letter while largely containing Hay's own writing. However, they also contain material written by Lincoln including the Gettysburg Address and the Second Inaugural.\n\nScholars favoring Lincoln's authorship, including Edward Steers and Jason Emerson, note that the Gettysburg Address and the Farewell Address are similar examples of Lincoln's highly regarded style. Other scholars, such as Burlingame, have countered that Hay wrote pieces that compare favorably to the Bixby letter and note words and phrases in the letter that appear more frequently in Hay's writings than those of Lincoln. For instance, Burlingame notes the word \"beguile\" appears numerous times in the works of Hay and the phrase \"I cannot refrain from tendering\" is used by Hay in an 1864 letter to Quincy Gillmore, but neither appears once in the other collected works of Lincoln. Although, the phrase \"I cannot refrain from\" is used by Lincoln in an 1859 letter to Salmon P. Chase.\n\nIn 1988, at the request of investigator Joe Nickell, University of Kentucky professor of English Jean G. Pival studied the vocabulary, syntax, and other stylistic characteristics of the letter and concluded that it more closely resembled Lincoln's style of writing than Hay's. \nThe letter's passage \"the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom\" is inscribed on the base of the statue of Lady Columbia at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii.\n\nDiscussions on the topic of siblings dying in war have frequently mentioned the letter; such as the Sullivan brothers, the Niland brothers, the Borgstrom brothers, and the Sole Survivor Policy of the United States military.\n\nIn the 1998 war film \"Saving Private Ryan\", General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle. In a voiceover near the end of the film, Marshall quotes the Bixby letter in a letter to Mrs. Ryan. \n\nOn September 11, 2011, former U.S. President George W. Bush read the Bixby letter during the memorial ceremony at the World Trade Center site on the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks.\n\n\nCitations\nSources\n\n"}

It was postmarked and received on 27 September 1888, by the Central News Agency of London. It was forwarded to Scotland Yard on 29 September.\n\nWritten in red ink, the message, like most alleged Ripper letters that followed, contains spelling and punctuation errors. It reads:\n\nInitially the letter was considered to be just one of many hoaxes, but when the body of Catherine Eddowes was found with one earlobe severed on 30 September, the writer's promise to \"clip the ladys ears off\" attracted attention. The Metropolitan Police published handbills with facsimiles of it and the Saucy Jacky postcard (which had referred to the earlier message and was received before the first became public knowledge) hoping someone would recognise the handwriting, but nothing came of this effort. Many newspapers also reprinted the text in whole or in part. These two messages gained worldwide notoriety after their publication. It was the first time the \"Jack the Ripper\" name had been used to refer to the killer, and the term captured the imagination of the public. Soon hundreds of other letters claiming to be from \"Jack the Ripper\" were received, most copying key phrases from these letters.\n\nAfter the murders, police officials stated that they believed this letter and the postcard were hoaxes by a local journalist. One journalist is reported to have confessed that he had written it and other messages purported to be from the Ripper in order \"to keep the business alive\".\n\nThese suspicions were not well publicised, and the idea that the killer had sent messages taunting the police became one of the enduring legends of the Ripper case. Modern scholars are divided on which, if any, of the letters should be considered genuine, but the \"Dear Boss\" letter is one of three named most frequently as potentially having been written by the killer. A number of authors have tried to advance their theories by comparing handwriting samples of their suspects to the writing found in this letter.\n\nLike many items related to the Ripper case, the \"Dear Boss\" letter disappeared from the police files not long after the investigation ended. It may have been kept as a souvenir by one of the investigating officers. It was returned anonymously to the Metropolitan Police in 1987, whereupon Scotland Yard recalled all the documents from their file from the Public Record Office, now The National Archives, at Kew. The return of the documents was announced in 1988.\n\nIn 1993 the handwriting of the Dear Boss letter was compared to that of the purported diary of James Maybrick. The report noted that the \"characteristics of the Dear Boss letter follow closely upon the Round Hand writing style of the time and exhibit a good writing skill.\"\n\n"}

It declared Finland an independent nation, among nations ending its autonomy within Russia as its Grand Duchy of Finland, with reference to a simultaneously delivered bill to the Diet to make Finland an independent republic instead.\n\nDeclaring the independence was only part of the long process leading to the independence of Finland. The declaration is celebrated as the Independence Day in Finland.\n\nAfter the February Revolution and the abdication of Grand Duke Nicholas II on 2 March (15 March N.S.) 1917, the personal union between Russia and Finland lost its legal base – at least according to the view in Helsinki. There were negotiations between the Russian Provisional Government and Finnish authorities.\n\nThe resulting proposal, approved by the Provisional Government, was heavily rewritten in the Finnish Parliament and transformed into the so-called Power Act (Finnish: \"Valtalaki\", Swedish: \"Maktlagen\"), whereby the Parliament declared itself to now hold all powers of legislation, except with respect to foreign policy and military issues, and also that it could be dissolved only by itself. At the time of the vote it was believed that the Provisional Government would be quickly defeated by the rebellion in Saint Petersburg. The Provisional Government survived, however, disapproved of the Power Act and dissolved the Parliament.\n\nAfter new elections and the ultimate defeat of the Provisional Government in the October Revolution, the Finnish Parliament decided to set a three-man regency council, based on Finland's Constitution, and more precisely on clause §38 of the old Instrument of Government of 1772, which had been enacted by the Estates after Gustav III's bloodless coup. This paragraph provided for the election of a new monarch in case of the extinction of the royal line and was interpreted in Finland as vesting sovereignty in the estates, later the Parliament, in such an interregnum. The regency council was however never elected because of the strong opposition of Finnish socialists and their general strike which demanded for more radical action.\n\nOn 2 November (15 November N.S.) 1917, the Bolsheviks declared a general right of self-determination, including the right of complete secession, \"for the Peoples of Russia\". On the same day the Finnish Parliament issued a declaration by which it assumed, \"pro tempore\", all powers of the Sovereign in Finland.\n\nThe old Instrument of Government was however no longer deemed suitable. Leading circles had long held monarchism and hereditary nobility to be antiquated, and advocated a republican constitution for Finland.\n\nThe Senate of Finland, the government that the Parliament had appointed in November, drafted a Declaration of Independence and a proposal for a new republican Instrument of Government. Chairman of the Senate ( Prime minister) Pehr Evind Svinhufvud read the Declaration to the Parliament on 4 December. The Declaration of Independence was technically given the form of a preamble of the proposition, and was intended to be agreed by the Parliament, which adopted the Declaration on 6 December.\n\nOn 18 December (31 December N. S.) the Soviet Russian government issued a Decree, recognizing Finland's independence, and on 22 December (4 January 1918 N. S.) it was approved by the highest Soviet executive body, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK).\n\nWith reference to the declaration of 15 November, the declaration says:\nThe people of Finland have by this step taken their fate in their own hands; a step both justified and demanded by present conditions. The people of Finland feel deeply that they cannot fulfil their national and international duty without complete sovereignty. The century-old desire for freedom awaits fulfilment now; Finland's people step forward as a free nation among the other nations in the world.\n\n(...) The people of Finland dare to confidently await how other nations in the world recognize that with their full independence and freedom, the people of Finland can do their best in fulfilment of those purposes that will win them a place amongst civilized peoples.\n\nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania declared their independence from Russia during the same period. See Estonian War of Independence, Latvian Independence and Lithuanian Wars of Independence.\n\nThese three countries were occupied by, and annexed into, the Soviet Union (1940-1941, 1944-1991).

The ISDS Recommended Practice (DNV-RP-D201) was launched in 2008 by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), the Norwegian classification society. DNV Offshore Standard OS-D203 launched in April 2010.\n\nSince the ISDS standard was first published by DNV, it has been applied by several oil companies, equipment suppliers, ship and rig owners. The ISDS standard focuses on how to set up and run a project and how to develop system and software quality assurance processes that will last the lifetime of the unit (ship, rig etc.). It provides a framework for working systematically to achieve the required reliability, availability, maintainability and safety for the integrated unit of software dependent systems.\n\nThe process typically starts when owners are specifying their requirements, either for a new project or an enhancement to an existing system. In collaboration with DNV specialists, the owner can assess the integrator and the suppliers to ensure they have the prerequisites for delivering good quality software. One of the innovations of ISDS is that it assigns systems and software responsibilities to one or more of the roles: owner, operator, system integrator, suppliers, and independent verifier.\n\nAnother important feature of ISDS is that it requires the designation of a system integrator. This can be the shipbuilder, the major automation supplier, or a specialized contractor. The ISDS defines the activities to be performed by the system integrator. These activities focus on managing requirements and interfaces among the different systems.\n\nThe ISDS-required practices for suppliers focus on ensuring that software quality is built into vendors’ products through systematic reviews, inspections, and testing. All of these requirements are generally accepted good practices in software engineering. Nothing revolutionary is demanded.\n\nAmong the rig-owners, Songa Offshore, Seadrill and Dolphin Drilling have been early adopters of the ISDS approach. DNV conducted a pilot project of the recommended practice version of ISDS with Seadrill (in Houston) in 2009. Several improvements were made to Seadrill’s new build and operations practices as a result of this initiative, and a story on this has been published in \"Offshore Engineer\".\n\nDNV has been engaged with Dolphin Drilling in an effort that will lead to the issuance of the first ISDS class certificate, see article by Steve Marshall in Upstream Online.\n\nDNV is engaged by the Daewoo Ship and Marine Engineering (DSME), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) and Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) yards in South Korea, for drilling units they are building for Songa Offshore, Fred Olsen Energy (Dolphin Drilling), Statoil and Diamond Drilling. The owners have specified a full scope for DNV follow-up on ISDS, including systems for emergency shut-down, fire and gas, BOP control, drilling control, pipe/riser handling, heave compensation & tensioning, bulk storage, drilling fluid circulation, cementing, dynamic positioning, power management and integrated automation. See article published in Offshore Magazine for the Songa Offshore units.\n\nIn September 2013, DNV announced the contract with Diamond Drilling, the first American rig-owner to apply ISDS for a new-build project.\n\nThe ISDS methodology has been developed starting with best industry practices from aerospace, telecom and automotive industries, and adapting the requirements to fit the offshore and maritime domains. An article published in Oil & Gas Journal gives an industry perspective to ISDS.\n\nIn July 2015, the \"Songa Equinox\", the first of \"Songa Offshore\"’s four new sixth generation Cat-D semisubmersible rigs, met the requirements of integrated software dependent systems (ISDS) standard (DNV-OS-D203) to prevent software glitches. The aim is to enable full tracking of the quality and version control of all integrated software systems, so that the yard and the user knows the status of all systems, the latest updates, if any still require close-out at the yard, at any given time.

The compiler published the first volumes in New York and Warsaw before World War II. Later volumes were published in New York and Mexico City from 1959 to 1969. A seventh volume was prepared for publication, but on Zylbercweig's death it was unable to be completed.\n\nEarly on Zylbercweig received support for his project from the Hebrew Actors' Union, which sponsored a 16-page prospectus for the lexicon in 1928; with the Union's help Zylbercweig mailed out a questionnaire to all of its members, the responses to which served as a basis for entries. The first volume of the lexicon appeared in New York in 1931, and the second in Warsaw, in 1934. Zylbercweig raised money for the publication of these volumes through a number of routes, such as banquets, fundraiser performances, pre-sales, and the sales of his other books.\n\nThe nature of the \"Leksikon\" changed significantly between the second volume and all further volumes. The early volumes were edited so that length of entry reflected the stature of individuals, and attempted to limit information given to the most meaningful details. In the post-War years, however, Zylbercweig understood his mission to be the dissemination of any and all information he could gather, to prevent it being lost to history. Thus, in later volumes the entries are generally longer, and the length of entry does not correspond to the importance of the individual but to the amount of material available about them. Volume 5 is titled \"kadoyshim band\" [martyr's volume] and consists entirely of entries for individuals who perished in the Holocaust. Some entries are very short; most lack dates of death.\n"}

The Secretary, with input from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, has final approval over the design of banknotes.\n\nThe redesign of U.S. banknotes in 1922 prompted the Treasury Department to review the portraits on banknotes and conclude that \"portraits of Presidents of the United States have a more permanent familiarity in the minds of the public than any others.\" Exceptions were made for Alexander Hamilton, Salmon Chase, and Benjamin Franklin. There have been no changes in the people depicted on currency intended for the general public since 1928; when Woodrow Wilson was depicted on the 1934 $100,000 gold certificate, the note was only for internal Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank use.\n\nFive people have been depicted on U.S. currency during their lifetime, with each of those depictions occurring during the American Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was portrayed on the 1861 $10 Demand Note; Salmon Chase, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury, approved his own portrait for the 1862 $1 Legal Tender Note; Winfield Scott was depicted on Interest Bearing Notes during the early 1860s; and Francis Spinner and Spencer Clark both approved the use of their own image on fractional currency. In 1873, driven in large part by the actions of Spinner and Clark, Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond, security, note, or fractional or postal currency.\n\nMany of the 53 individuals were depicted on more than one note of a series or denomination.

{"id": "151826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151826", "title": "Marrano", "text": "Marrano\n\nMarranos were Jews living in the Iberian Peninsula who converted or were forced to convert to Christianity during the Middle Ages, yet continued to practice Judaism in secret. \n\nThe term specifically refers to the charge of Crypto-Judaism, whereas the term converso was used for the wider population of Jewish converts to Catholicism, whether or not they secretly still practised Jewish rites. Converts from either Judaism or Islam were referred to by the broader term of \"New Christians\".\n\nThe term \"marrano\" came into later use in 1492 with the Castilian Alhambra Decree; it prohibited the practice of Judaism in Spain and required all remaining Jews to convert or leave. By then, the large majority of Jews in Spain had converted to Catholicism, and conversos numbered hundreds of thousands. They were closely monitored by the Spanish Inquisition and subject to suspicions by Catholics of the secret practice of Judaism, also known as \"Marranism\". \n\nIn modern use \"marrano\" is sometimes, but not always, considered offensive; and \"crypto-Jew\" is occasionally preferred in scholarly works.\n\nThe origin of the term \"marrano\" as applied to Crypto-Jews is debatable, since there are at least three possible etymologies for the word. \n\nOne source of the term derives from Arabic \"muḥarram\"; meaning \"forbidden, anathematized\". \"Marrano\" in this context means \"swine\" or \"pig\", from the ritual prohibition against eating pork, practiced by both Jews and Muslims. However, as applied to crypto-Jews, the term marrano may also derive from the Spanish verb \"marrar\" (of Germanic rather than Arabic origin) meaning \"to deviate\" or \"to err\", in the sense that they deviated from their newly adopted faith by secretly continuing to practice Judaism. A third origin has been cited from Galician-Portuguese, where \"marrar\" means \"to force\" and \"marrano\" means \"forced one,\" indicating the compulsory nature of the religious conversions.\n\nUnder state pressure in the late 14th and early 15th century, over half of Jews in the Iberian Peninsula converted to Christianity, thus avoiding the Decree of Expulsion which affected Spain's remaining openly Jewish population in 1492. The numbers who converted and the effects of various migrations in and out of the area have been the subject of historical debate. A phylogeographic study in 2008 of 1,150 volunteer Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups appeared to support the idea that the number of forced conversions has been significantly underestimated, as 20% of the tested Iberian population had haplogroups consistent with Sephardi ancestry. This percentage was suggested as representing the proportion of Sephardi in the population at the time of mass conversions in the 14th and 15th centuries. However, the authors concede that other historical population movements from the Near East such as Syrians and Phoenicians may also account for these results.\n\nSome Portuguese \"conversos\" or \"cristãos-novos\" continued to practice as crypto-Jews. In the early 20th century, historian Samuel Schwartz wrote about crypto-Jewish communities discovered in northeastern Portugal (namely, Belmonte, Bragança, Miranda, and Chaves). He claimed that members had managed to survive more than four centuries without being fully assimilated into the Old Christian population. The last remaining crypto-Jewish community in Belmonte officially returned to Judaism in the 1970s and opened a synagogue in 1996. In 2003, the American Sephardi Federation founded the Belmonte Project to raise funds to acquire Judaic educational material and services for the Belmonte community, who then numbered 160–180.\n\nTwo documentary films are known to have been made in north-eastern Portugal where present day descendants of marranos were interviewed about their lives. In 1974 for \"The Marranos of Portugal\", the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) sent reporter Ron Ben-Yishai to carry out interviews with families about their religious practice. After being asked to prove he knew Hebrew before they would talk, he found people still reluctant to talk openly but did eventually gain a remarkable insight into their version of Jewish customs, prayers and songs. The film was commended at the 1976 Jerusalem Jewish Film and TV Festival. Another documentary, \"The Last Marranos\", was made by the New York Jewish Media Fund in 1997.\n\nAfter the expulsion of Jews and Muslims from Spain (1492) and Portugal (1497), \"conversos\" continued to be suspect in times of social strain. In Lisbon in 1506, a months-long plague caused people to look for scapegoats. Some became suspicious that \"conversos\" might be practicing Judaism and therefore be at fault. On April 17, 1506, several \"conversos\" were discovered who had in their possession \"some lambs and poultry prepared according to Jewish custom; also unleavened bread and bitter herbs according to the regulations for the Passover, which festival they celebrated far into the night\". Officials seized several, but released them after a few days.\n\nOn the same day on which the \"conversos\" were freed, the Dominicans displayed a crucifix and a reliquary in glass from which a peculiar light issued in a side-chapel of their church, where several New Christians were present. A New Christian who tried to explain the miracle as due to natural causes was dragged from the church and killed by an infuriated woman. A Dominican roused the populace still more. Friar João Mocho and the Aragonese friar Bernardo, crucifix in hand, were said to have gone through the streets of the city, crying \"Heresy!\" and calling upon the people to destroy the conversos. Attracted by the outcry, sailors from Holland, Zeeland and others from ships in the port of Lisbon, joined the Dominicans and formed a mob with local men to pursue the \"conversos\".\n\nThe mob dragged \"converso\" victims from their houses and killed some. Old Christians who were in any way associated with New Christians were also attacked. The mob attacked the tax-farmer João Rodrigo Mascarenhas, a New Christian; although a wealthy and distinguished man, his work also made him resented by many. They demolished his house. Within 48 hours, many \"conversos\" were killed; by the third day all who could have escaped, often with the help of other Portuguese. The killing spree lasted from 19 to 21 April, in what came to be known as the Lisbon massacre.\n\nKing Manuel severely punished those who took part in the killings. The ringleaders and the Dominicans who encouraged the riot were also executed. Local people convicted of murder or pillage suffered corporal punishment and their property was confiscated. The king granted religious freedom for 20 years to all \"conversos\" in an attempt at compensation. Lisbon lost \"Foral\" privileges. The foreigners who had taken part generally escaped punishment, leaving with their ships.\n\nNew Christians were attacked in Gouvea, Alentejo, Olivença, Santarém, and other places. In the Azores and the island of Madeira, mobs massacred former Jews. Because of these excesses, the king began to believe that a Portuguese Inquisition might help control such outbreaks.\n\nThe Portuguese \"conversos\" worked to forestall such actions, and spent immense sums to win over the \"Curia\" and most influential cardinals. Spanish and Portuguese conversos made financial sacrifices. Alfonso Gutierrez, Garcia Alvarez \"el Rico\" (the rich), and the Zapatas, conversos from Toledo, offered 80,000 gold crowns to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, if he would mitigate the harshness of the Inquisition (\"Revue des Etudes Juives\", xxxvii, p. 270 et seq.).\n\nThe Mendes of Lisbon and Flanders also tried to help. None were successful in preventing Portugal from introducing the Inquisition in 1478. The \"conversos\" suffered immensely both from mob violence and interrogation and testing by the Inquisition. Attacks and murders were recorded at Trancoso, Lamego, Miranda, Viseu, Guarda, and Braga.\n\nAt Covilhã, there were rumors that the people planned to massacre all the New Christians on one day. In 1562, prelates petitioned the \"Cortes\" to require \"conversos\" to wear special badges, and to order Jewish descendants to live in ghettos (\"judiarias\") in cities and villages as their ancestors had before the conversions.\n\nAccording to historian Cecil Roth, Spanish political intrigues had earlier promoted the anti-Jewish policies which culminated in 1391, when Regent Queen Leonora of Castile gave the Archdeacon of Écija, Ferrand Martinez, considerable power in her realm. Martinez gave speeches that led to violence against the Jews, and this influence culminated in the sack of the Jewish quarter of Seville on June 4, 1391. Throughout Spain during this year, the cities of Ecija, Carmona, Córdoba, Toledo, Barcelona and many others saw their Jewish quarters destroyed and inhabitants massacred.\n\nIt is estimated that 200,000 Jews saved their lives by converting to Christianity in the wake of these persecutions. Other Jews left the country altogether and around 100,000 openly practicing Jews remained.\n\nIn 1449, feelings rose against \"conversos\", breaking out in a riot at Toledo. Instigated by two canons, Juan Alfonso and Pedro Lopez Galvez, the mob plundered and burned the houses of Alonso Cota, a wealthy converso and tax-farmer. They also attacked the residences of wealthy New Christians in the quarter of la Magdelena. Under Juan de la Cibdad, the conversos opposed the mob, but were repulsed. They were executed with their leader. As a result, several prominent converso men were deposed from office, in obedience to a new statute.\n\nNearly 20 years later in July 1467, another riot occurred where a mob attacked \"conversos\" in Toledo. The chief magistrate (\"alcalde mayor\") of the city was Alvar Gomez de Cibdad Real, who had been private secretary to King Henry IV of Castile. He was a protector of the conversos. Together with prominent conversos Fernando and Alvaro de la Torre, Alvar wished to take revenge for an insult by the counts de Fuensalida, leaders of the Old Christians. His intention was to seize control of the city, but fierce conflict erupted. Opponents set fire to houses of New Christians near the cathedral. The conflagration spread so rapidly that 1,600 houses were consumed. Both Old Christians and conversos perished. The brothers De la Torre were captured and hanged.\n\nTensions arose in Córdoba between Old Christians and conversos, where they formed two hostile parties. On March 14, 1473, during a dedication procession, a girl accidentally threw dirty water from the window of the house of one of the wealthiest conversos (the customary way to dispose of it.) The water splashed on an image of the Virgin being carried in procession in honor of a new society (from which conversos had been excluded by Bishop D. Pedro.) A local blacksmith started arousing a rabble against the Jews, who he blamed for the insult, which immediately joined in a fierce shout for revenge.\n\nThe mob went after conversos, denouncing them as heretics, killing them, and burning their houses. To stop the excesses, the highly respected D. Alonso Fernandez de Aguilar, whose wife was a member of the converso family of Pacheco, together with his brother D. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (\"El Gran Capitán\"), and a troop of soldiers, hastened to protect the New Christians. D. Alonso called upon the mob to retire. Its leader insulted the count, who immediately felled him with his lance. Aroused, the people considered him a martyr. Incited by Alonso de Aguilar's enemy, they again attacked the conversos. The rioting lasted three days. Those who escaped sought refuge in the castle, where their protectors also took shelter. The government decreed that Jews and Conversos should remain in their neighborhood or leave the city.\n\nIn 1473, attacks on conversos arose in numerous other cities: Montoro, Bujalance, Adamuz, La Rambla, Santaella, and elsewhere. Mobs attacked conversos in Andújar, Úbeda, Baeza, and Almodóvar del Campo also. In Valladolid, groups looted the belongings of the New Christians. At Segovia, there was a massacre (May 16, 1474). D. Juan Pacheco, a converso, led the attacks. Without the intervention of the alcalde, Andres de Cabrera, all New Christians might have died. At Carmona, it was reported that not one converso was left alive.\n\nTens of thousands of Jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion, some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by Kamen: most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion, rather than as a sincere change of faith. These \"conversos\" were the principal concern of the Inquisition; being suspected of continuing to practice Judaism put them at risk of denunciation and trial.\n\nDuring 1492, about 12,000 conversos entered Navarre from Aragon's repression, where they were allowed to remain. Tudela in Navarre turned into a converso haven. The Tudelans had already proclaimed in 1486 that \"if any inquisitor enters their city, he will be thrown into the Ebro river.\" Later the resistance to the inquisitors was so strong that its aldermen ordered commissioners and attorneys to ask the Catholic Monarchs to limit the power of the Inquisition in 1510.\n\nThe most intense period of persecution of \"conversos\" lasted until 1530. From 1531 to 1560, however, the percentage of \"conversos\" among the Inquisition trials dropped to 3% of the total. There was a rebound of persecutions when a group of crypto-Jews was discovered in Quintanar de la Orden in 1588; and there was a rise in denunciations of \"conversos\" in the last decade of the sixteenth century. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, some \"conversos\" who had fled to Portugal began to return to Spain, fleeing the persecution of the Portuguese Inquisition, founded in 1536. This led to a rapid increase in the trials of crypto-Jews, among them a number of important financiers. In 1691, during a number of \"autos-da-fé\" in Majorca, 37 \"chuetas\", or \"conversos\" of Majorca, were burned.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century the number of \"conversos\" accused by the Inquisition decreased significantly. Manuel Santiago Vivar, tried in Córdoba in 1818, was the last person tried for being a crypto-Jew.\n\nThe \"conversos\" of Seville and other cities of Castile, and especially of Aragon, bitterly opposed the Spanish Inquisition established in 1478. They rendered considerable service to the king, and held high legal, financial, and military positions. The government issued an edict directing traditional Jews to live within a ghetto and be separated from \"conversos\". Despite the law, however, the Jews remained in communication with their New Christian brethren.\n\n\"They sought ways and means to win them from Catholicism and bring them back to Judaism. They instructed the Marranos in the tenets and ceremonies of the Jewish religion; held meetings in which they taught them what they must believe and observe according to the Mosaic law; and enabled them to circumcise themselves and their children. They furnished them with prayer-books; explained the fast-days; read with them the history of their people and their Law; announced to them the coming of the Passover; procured unleavened bread for them for that festival, as well as kosher meat throughout the year; encouraged them to live in conformity with the law of Moses, and persuaded them that there was no law and no truth except the Jewish religion.\" These were the charges brought by the government of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile against the Jews. They constituted the grounds for their expulsion and banishment in 1492, so they could not subvert conversos. Jews who did not want to leave Spain had to accept baptism as a sign of conversion.\n\nThe historian Henry Kamen's \"Inquisition and Society in Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\" questions whether there were such strong links between conversos and Jewish communities. Whilst historians such as Yitzhak Baer state, \"the conversos and Jews were one people\", Kamen claims, \"Yet if the conversos were hated by the Christians, the Jews liked them no better.\" He documented that \"Jews testified falsely against them [the conversos] when the Inquisition was finally founded.\" This issue is being debated by historians.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of Spain's 250,000 \"conversos\" abandoned Judaism and simply assimilated into Spain's dominant Catholic culture, many of those continuing to secretly practice their former religion felt threatened and persecuted by the Inquisition which continued to actively persecute heresy. Some of these chose to leave Spain, in bands or as individual refugees. Many migrated to Italy, attracted by the climate, which resembled that of the Iberian Peninsula, and by the kindred language. When they settled at Ferrara, Duke Ercole I d'Este granted them privileges. His son Alfonso confirmed the privileges to twenty-one Spanish \"conversos\": physicians, merchants, and others (ib. xv. 113 et seq.). A thoroughly researched history of these migrations is also contained in the book about one of their leaders called, \"The Woman Who Defied Kings\", by the historian and journalist Andree Aelion Brooks.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese \"conversos\" also settled at Florence and contributed to make Livorno a leading seaport. They received privileges at Venice, where they were protected from the persecutions of the Inquisition. At Milan, they materially advanced the interests of the city by their industry and commerce. At Bologna, Pisa, Naples and numerous other Italian cities, they freely exercised the Jewish religion again. They were soon so numerous that Fernando de Goes Loureiro, an abbot from Oporto, filled an entire book with the names of \"conversos\" who had drawn large sums from Portugal and had openly avowed Judaism in Italy.\n\nIn Piedmont, Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy welcomed \"conversos\" from Coímbra and granted them commercial and industrial privileges, as well as the free exercise of their religion. Rome was full of \"conversos\". Pope Paul III received them at Ancona for commercial reasons. He granted complete liberty \"to all persons from Portugal and Algarve, even if belonging to the class of New Christians.\" By 1553, three thousand Portuguese Jews and \"conversos\" were living at Ancona.\n\nTwo years later, Pope Paul IV issued orders to have all the \"conversos\" in Italy be thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition which he had instituted. Sixty of them, who acknowledged the Catholic faith as penitents, were transported to the island of Malta; twenty-four, who adhered to Judaism, were publicly burned (May 1556). Those who escaped the Inquisition were received at Pesaro by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. Guidobaldo had hoped to have the Jews and \"conversos\" of Turkey select Pesaro as a commercial center; when that did not happen, he expelled the New Christians from Pesaro and other districts in 1558 (ib. xvi. 61 et seq.).\n\nMany \"conversos\" also went to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable Croatian seaport on the Adriatic Sea. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled with Portuguese refugees.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, some \"conversos\" migrated to the Americas, often the Castilian territories of the Viceroyalties of New Spain (North and Central America) and Peru (South America and Colombia). Legal emigration to the New World was strictly controlled and required proof of three generations of Christian ascendance. Nevertheless, many Conversos managed to evade these restrictions and managed to obtain encomiendas in the New World.\n\nAccording to Isidore Loeb, in a special study of the subject in the \"Revue des Études Juives\" (xiv. 162–183), about 3,000 Jews came to Provence after the Alhambra Decree expelled Jews from Spain in 1492.\n\nFrom 1484, one town after another had called for expulsion, but the calls were rejected by Charles VIII. However, Louis XII, in one of his first acts as king in 1498, issued a general expulsion order of the Jews of Provence. Though not enforced at the time, the order was renewed in 1500 and again in 1501. On this occasion, it was definitively implemented. The Jews of Provence were given the option of conversion to Christianity and a number chose that option. However, after a short while – if only to compensate partially for the loss of revenues caused by the departure of the Jews – the king imposed a special tax, referred to as \"the tax of the neophytes.\" These converts and their descendants soon became the objects of social discrimination and slanders.\n\nThere was no significant wave of emigration of \"conversos\" from Spain, the majority of Sephardic communities, such as that of Salonika having been formed as a result of the Alhambra Decree in 1492. However, there was a steady trickle of crypto-Jewish marranos who wished to practice their faith freely to more liberal environments. One of their leaders who helped them get there was the Lisbon-born international banker, Gracia Mendes Nasi. They also migrated to Flanders, where they were attracted by its flourishing cities, such as Antwerp and Brussels. \"Conversos\" from Flanders, and others direct from the Iberian Peninsula, went under the guise of Catholics to Hamburg and Altona about 1580, where they established a community and held commercial relations with their former homes. Some migrated as far as Scotland. Christian IV of Denmark invited some New Christian families to settle at Glückstadt about 1626, granting certain privileges to them and to \"conversos\" who came to Emden about 1649.\n\nThe vast majority of Spain's \"conversos\", however, remained in Spain and Portugal and were suspected of \"Marranism\" by the Spanish Inquisition. Although the wealthier among them could easily bypass discriminatory \"Limpieza de sangre\" laws, they constituted a significant portion of the over three thousand people executed for heresy by the Spanish Inquisition. The New Christians of Portugal breathed more freely when Philip III of Spain came to the throne. By the law of April 4, 1601, he granted them the privilege of unrestricted sale of their real estate as well as free departure from the country for themselves, their families, and their property. Many, availing themselves of this permission, followed their coreligionists to North Africa and Turkey. After a few years, however, the privilege was revoked, and the Inquisition resumed its activity.\n\nSome migrated to London, whence their families spread to Brazil (where \"conversos\" had settled at an early date) and other colonies in the Americas. Migrations to Constantinople and Thessaloniki, where Jewish refugees had settled after the expulsion from Spain, as well as to Italy, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Vienna, and Timișoara, continued into the middle of the 18th century.\n\nLate 20th century political and social changes in Spain caused reappraisal of Jewish and Muslim contributions to its culture. There has been much new scholarship on Sephardic Jews, Moors and the consequences of conversion and expulsion. In addition, there have been official governmental efforts to welcome tourists of both ancestries to Spain. Towns and regions have worked to preserve elements of Jewish and Moorish pasts.\n\nBy Spanish Civil Code Art. 22.1, the government created concessions for gaining citizenship to nationals of several countries and Sephardi Jews historically linked with Spain, allowing them to seek citizenship after five years rather than the customary ten required for residence in Spain. Later it was dropped to two years. In November 2012, the residency requirement was eliminated completely. In October 2006, the Parliament of Andalusia asked the three parliamentary groups that form the majority to support an amendment that would similarly ease the way for nationals of Morisco descent to gain Spanish citizenship. The proposal was originally made by IULV-CA, the Andalusian branch of the United Left.\n\nIn 2004, Shlomo Moshe Amar traveled to Portugal to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the Lisbon synagogue Shaare Tikvah. During his stay, Shlomo Moshe Amar met descendants of Jewish families persecuted by the Inquisition who still practice Judaism (Bnei Anusim) at the house of rabbi Boaz Pash. This was an historical meeting that had not happened between a Chief Rabbi and Portuguese marranos (Bnei Anusim) in centuries. Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar promised to create a committee to evaluate the Halachic situation of the community. The delay of the Chief Rabbi to create the committee and help the descendents of Sephardi Jews in Portugal forced the creation of a second Jewish community in Lisbon, Comunidade Judaica Masorti Beit Israel, to ensure the recognition of the Bnei Anussim as Jews.\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1963 the museum has been located in the south wing of the Würzburg Residence.\n\nThe Museum contains a collection of antiquities, an art gallery and a graphic collection.\n\nThe collection of antiquities includes artworks and antiquities of the Mediterranean from the third century BC until Late Antiquity. Works from Ancient Greece are the focus, but the collection also includes material from Imperial Rome, the Etruscans, Ancient Egypt and Near Eastern cultures (e.g. the Aegean civilizations, Mesopotamia, and Cyprus). The collection of Greek vases is particularly significant - it is among the three largest collections of Greek vases in Germany, containing around five thousand objects and documents Greek pottery from the Mycenaean period through to the Hellenistic period. Important items include the Mamarce Oinochoe, the Four seasons altar of Würzburg and the Brygos Cup of Würzburg.\n\nThe art gallery contains German, Dutch and Italian paintings from the fifteenth century to the twentieth century, including pictures by Hans Leonhard Schäufelein, Bartholomäus Spranger, Pieter Claesz, Luca Giordano, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Friedrich Overbeck, Carl Rottmann, Franz von Lenbach, Max Liebermann, August von Brandis and Hans Purrmann. This section also contains the collection of sculpture. Notable among these are works of Tilman Riemenschneider and his school.\n\nThe graphic collection contains some eleven thousand sketches and fourteen thousand prints. These include, among others, copper engravings and woodcuts of Albrecht Dürer, sketches by Federico Barocci and drawings by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and his son Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo.\n\n\n"}

Since its formation in 2006, the Nationalist Front of Mexico claims it was formed by people coming from different political tendencies, social positions and cultural backgrounds who fight legally and peacefully for the national renewal of their country and for the unity of the Mexican nation.\n\nThe organization opposes what it sees as \"Anglo\"-U.S. culture and influences and rejects the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, as well as what its members consider the \"American occupation\" of territory formerly belonging to Mexico and now form the southwestern United States.\n\nOn its website, the front states:\n\"We reject the occupation of our nation in its northern territories, an important cause of poverty and emigration. We demand that our claim to all the territories occupied by force by the United States be recognized in our Constitution, and we will bravely defend, according to the principle of self-determination to all peoples, the right of the Mexican people to live in the whole of our territory within its historical borders, as they existed and were recognized at the moment of our independence.\"\nSimilarly, it promotes the reincorporation of Central America to Mexico, advocates the Second Mexican Empire, and deplores the establishment of the republic, which it considers decadent and against the nation. In recent years, the group has gained notoriety for honoring Maximilian I of Mexico and conservatives of the 19th century such as Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía Camacho.\n\nIdeologically, it proposes a distributist economy, socialization and the Third-Positionist ideology as an alternative to both communism and capitalism. The group also wants Mexico to withdraw from the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP), World Trade Organization (WTO), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the World Bank.\n\nAlso, the movement believes to have a strong alliance with the Confederacy, due to the CSA being anti-USA.\n\nIn its official website, the organization declares its opposition to all forms of violence and states that its primary goal is to win Mexicans' approval and adherence to their nationalist points of view. However, the front held protests in various cities to demand the immediate expulsion of Haitian and African immigrants who flooded Mexico's borders in the fall of 2016. Representatives of the front have also made open calls for Mexicans to join in their struggle against foreigners, sexual minorities and leftists. Human right advocates in Mexico raised their concerns about the group's rhetoric and increasing popularity among the youth.\n\nIt is not a political party and thus cannot nominate candidates directly.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "69654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69654", "title": "Ophir", "text": "Ophir\n\nOphir (; ) is a port or region mentioned in the Bible, famous for its wealth. King Solomon received a cargo from Ophir every three years, which consisted of gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes, and peacocks.\n\nOphir in Genesis 10 (the Table of Nations) is said to be the name of one of the sons of Joktan. The Books of Kings and Chronicles tell of a joint expedition to Ophir by King Solomon and the Tyrian king Hiram I from Ezion-Geber, a port on the Red Sea, that brought back large amounts of gold, precious stones and 'algum wood' and of a later failed expedition by king Jehoshaphat of Judah. The famous 'gold of Ophir' is referenced in several other books of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nIn Septuagint, other variants of the name are mentioned: \"Ōpheír\", \"Sōphír\", \"Sōpheír\" and \"Souphír\".\n\nThe New Testament apocrypha book \"Cave of Treasures\" contains a passage: \"And the children of Ophir, that is, Send, appointed to be their king Lophoron, who built Ophir with stones of gold; now, all the stones that are in Ophir are of gold.\"\n\nIn 1946 an inscribed pottery shard was found at Tell Qasile (in modern-day Tel Aviv) dating to the eighth century BC. It bears, in Paleo-Hebrew script, the text \"gold of Ophir to/for Beth-Horon [...] 30 shekels\" The find confirms that Ophir was a place where gold was imported from.\n\n\"A Dictionary of the Bible\" by Sir William Smith, published in 1863, notes the Hebrew word for parrot \"Thukki\", derived from the Classical Tamil for peacock \"Thogkai\" and Cingalese \"tokei\", joins other Classical Tamil words for ivory, cotton-cloth and apes preserved in the Hebrew Bible. This theory of Ophir's location in Tamilakkam is further supported by other historians. Locations on the coast of Kerala conjectured to be Ophir include Poovar and Beypore.\n\nEarlier in the 19th century Max Müller and other scholars identified Ophir with Abhira, near the Indus River in modern-day state of Gujarat, India. According to Benjamin Walker Ophir is said to have been a town of the Abhira tribe.\n\nBiblical scholars, archaeologists and others have tried to determine the exact location of Ophir. Vasco da Gama's companion Tomé Lopes reasoned that Ophir would have been the ancient name for Great Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe, the main center of sub-African trade in gold in the Renaissance period — though the ruins at Great Zimbabwe are now dated to the medieval era, long after Solomon is said to have lived. The identification of Ophir with Sofala in Mozambique was mentioned by Milton in \"Paradise Lost\" (11:399-401), among many other works of literature and science.\n\nAnother, more serious, possibility is the African shore of the Red Sea, with the name perhaps being derived from the Afar people living in the Danakil desert (Ethiopia, Eritrea) between Adulis and Djibouti.\n\nAfri was a Latin name used to refer to the Carthaginians, who dwelt in North Africa, in modern-day Tunisia. This name, that later gave the rich Roman province of Africa and the subsequent medieval Ifriqiya, are from which the name of the continent Africa is ultimately derived, seems to have referred to a native Libyan tribe originally, however, see Terence for discussion. The name is usually connected with Phoenician \"afar\", \"dust\", but a 1981 hypothesis has asserted that it stems from the Berber word \"ifri\" (plural \"ifran\") meaning \"cave\", in reference to cave dwellers. This is proposed to be the origin of \"Ophir\" as well.\n\nThe theologian Benito Arias Montano (1571) proposed finding Ophir in the name of Peru, reasoning that the native Peruvians were thus descendants of Ophir and Shem.\n\nIn 1568 Alvaro Mendaña became the first European to discover the Solomon Islands, and named them as such because he believed them to be Ophir.\n\nIn Jewish tradition, Ophir is often associated with a place in India, named for one of the sons of Joktan. The 10th-century lexicographer, David ben Abraham al-Fasi, identified Ophir with Serendip, the old Persian name for Sri Lanka (aka Ceylon).\n\nIn Tomo III (1519-1522), pages 112-138, of the book Colección general de documentos relativos a las Islas Filipinas existentes en el Archivo de Indias de Sevilla, found in the Archivos de Indias de Sevilla in Spain, Document No. 98 describes how to locate the land of Ophir. The travel guide started from the Cape of Good Hope in Africa to India, to Burma, to Sumatra, to Moluccas, to Borneo, to Sulu, to China, then finally Ophir which is said to be the Philippines. While all other probable locations of Ophir are based on expert opinion, this is the only probable location with documentary support.\n\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes an introduction to, or stepping stone to, consensus decision-making in which simple majorities have less power.\n\nThe progressive stack technique attempts to counter what its proponents believe is a flaw in traditional representative democracy, where the majority is heard while the minority or non-dominant groups are silenced or ignored. In practice, \"majority culture\" is interpreted by progressive stack practitioners to mean White people, men and young adults, while non-dominant groups include women, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, people of color, and very young or older people.\n\nThe \"stack\" in the Occupy movement is the list of speakers who are commenting on proposals or asking questions in public meetings. Anyone can request to be added to the stack. In meetings that don't use the progressive stack, people speak in the order they were added to the queue. In meetings that use the progressive stack, people from non-dominant groups are allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, by facilitators, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to \"step forward, or step back\" based on which racial, age, or gender group they belong to. \n\nA. Barton Hinkle, a columnist for the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\", has expressed the opinion that \"lining up speakers by race and gender might not seem fair on an individual level\", and suggests that proponents of the progressive stack care more about class struggle than individual concerns.\n\nAmong those opposed to the concept of \"progressive stack\", conservative journalist and author Jim Goad commented satirically on the concept in these terms: \"The concept of intersectionality is also related to the \"progressive stack,\" which assumes that white males at all times bear noxious degrees of unearned power, which is why they have to get to the back of the line and let all the legless black lesbians speak first.\"\n"}
{"id": "8216055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8216055", "title": "Protection of sources", "text": "Protection of sources\n\nThe protection of sources, sometimes also referred to as the confidentiality of sources or in the U.S. as the reporter's privilege, is a right accorded to journalists under the laws of many countries, as well as under international law. It prohibits authorities, including the courts, from compelling a journalist to reveal the identity of an anonymous source for a story. The right is based on a recognition that without a strong guarantee of anonymity, many would be deterred from coming forward and sharing information of public interests with journalists. As a result, problems such as corruption or crime might go undetected and unchallenged, to the ultimate detriment of society as a whole. In spite of any such legal protections, the pervasive use of traceable electronic communications by journalists and their sources provides governments with a tool to determine the origin of information.\n\nA famous instance of the use of an anonymous source is the series of articles by \"Washington Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein which uncovered the Watergate Scandal, ultimately leading to the resignation of US President Richard Nixon. Woodward and Bernstein relied extensively on information provided by someone known to the world only under the nickname Deep Throat. Woodward and Bernstein were not forced to invoke the protection of sources, since the US authorities made no attempt to uncover the identity of \"Deep Throat\". In 2005 W. Mark Felt, who at the time had been Associate Director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, revealed that he was \"Deep Throat\".\n\nAn example of the legal operation of the right is the case of Bart Mos and Joost de Haas, of the Dutch daily \"De Telegraaf\". In an article in January 2006, the two journalists alleged the existence of a leak in the Dutch secret services and quoted from what they claimed was an official dossier on Mink Kok, a notorious criminal. They further alleged that the dossier in question had fallen into the hands of Kok himself. A subsequent police investigation led to the prosecution of Paul H., an agent accused of selling the file in question. Upon motions by the prosecution and the defence, the investigative judge in the case ordered the disclosure of the source for the news story, on the grounds that it was necessary to safeguard national security and ensure a fair trial for H. The two journalists were subsequently detained for refusing to comply with the disclosure order, but were released on appeal after three days, on November 30. The Hague district court considered that the national security interest served by the order was minor and should not prevail over the protection of sources.\n\nIn the modern era of telecommunications, journalists' ability to protect their sources increasingly depends on the adequacy of the computer and communications security measures they employ. In June 2010, Bill Keller, then the executive editor of \"The New York Times\", and Alan Rusbridger, editor of \"The Guardian\", discussed classified cables provided to them by WikiLeaks over a non-encrypted international telephone line. The Times did not have a readily available means of secure telecommunications for dealing with such matters, despite its history of dealing with whistle-blowers in reporting stories like the interception of international calls made by Americans by the National Security Agency.\n\nVarious authorities in international law point to a recognition that a right to protection of sources is implicit in the right to freedom of expression.\n\nIn Europe, the European Court of Human Rights stated in the 1996 case of \"Goodwin v. United Kingdom\" that \"[p]rotection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom ... Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest. As a result the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected.\" The Court concluded that absent \"an overriding requirement in the public interest\", an order to disclose sources would violate the guarantee of free expression in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn the wake of \"Goodwin\", the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers issued a Recommendation to its member states on how to implement the protection of sources in their domestic legislation. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has also called on states to respect the right.\n\nIn the Americas, protection of sources has been recognised in the \"Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression\", which states in Principle 8 that \"every social communicator has the right to keep his/her source of information, notes, personal and professional archives confidential.\"\n\nIn Africa, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights has adopted a \"Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa\" which includes a right to protection of sources under Principle XV.\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Paul C. Mawhinney, who claimed he built the world's biggest record collection.\n\nRecord-Rama was founded by Paul C. Mawhinney, a collector of vinyl records. According to the store's website, Mawhinney was a significant help in restarting David Bowie's career by getting fellow Pittsburgher and RCA boss Tom Cossie to re-release the album \"Space Oddity\" in 1972 after its initial release in 1969 failed to hit. Mawhinney started the shop after his personal collection reached the many thousands. It was his wife who told him to get rid of the records or start a business around them. By the mid-1990s, Record-Rama was doing $5 million ($ million today) a year of business. In the years that followed, Mawhinney built the world's biggest record collection. He also cataloged records in a directory called the \"MusicMaster\". Mawhinney released the first edition in 1982, and it came in two volumes: one listing by artist, the other by title. By 2003, the business had dropped to $500,000 a year, one tenth of what it had been. Mawhinney attributed the drop in sales to large retailers who were able to sell recorded music below cost and illegal Internet downloading.\n\nRecord-Rama closed in the summer of 2008 during the global credit crunch. Mawhinney stated that he had been squeezed out of business by the recording industry and large retailers who can sell compact discs to the public for less than his wholesale costs.\n\nMawhinney started his record collection in 1951. The first record he bought was Frankie Laine's \"Jezebel\". Mawhinney built his collection into the thousands before he founded Record-Rama. After he set up shop, he decided to keep and archive one copy of every record he sold. In 2003, at over 2 million items, Mawhinney's collection was more than twice the size of the collection at the Library of Congress. By the time the store closed in 2008, the collection stood at more than three million items and was valued at $50 million ($ million today).\n\nMawhinney first attempted to sell the collection in 1997. According to the owner, CD Now offered $28.5 million ($ million today) for the collection plus a $100,000/year job ($ today) to Mawhinney to administer the archive. Mawhinney claims the sale fell through three weeks later when CD Now went to bankruptcy court.\n\nIn the fall of 2002, Mawhinney and the Library of Congress were actively discussing the sale of Mawhinney's collection. The parties were unable to reach an agreement due to the scarcity of federal funding and difficulties justifying the purchase using taxpayer dollars. The Library of Congress denies the parties had reached an agreement. \n\nIn 2008, Mawhinney closed his shop and needed to sell the record archive. Mawhinney listed the collection for sale on eBay in February 2008. He received a winning bid of $3,002,150 ($ million today) from a buyer in Ireland. A few days later, however, eBay suspended the bidder's account and advised Mawhinney that the bid was not legitimate. Mawhinney relisted the collection in March 2008 but it did not sell.\n\nBy 2012, Mawhinney had sold various sections of the archive and various formats to other interested individuals. The remains of a once-great collection were housed in a number of storage units that were in danger of being auctioned off due to the cost of maintenance by somebody on a fixed income with no retirement funds.\n\nPlans for preservation of the archive were set in motion by \"Audio Preservation Fund\" in 2012 with the intent to open a museum, online database, and shop under the name \"The Worlds Greatest Music Collection\". Efforts to raise funds to purchase the collection failed, and the Audio Preservation Fund and Mawhinney parted ways when, once again, the prospector went out of business.\n\nIn 2013, a friend of Mawhinney’s told him about a classified ad in Billboard Magazine: \"RECORD COLLECTIONS. We BUY any record collection. Any style of music. We pay HIGHER prices than anyone else.\" Mawhinney made contact with the buyer's agent, and in the fall of 2013, eight long semis pulled up to Mawhinney's warehouse and departed with what remained of the archive. The buyer was Zero Freitas of São Paulo, Brazil, a Brazilian bus magnate. As of August 2014, Freitas had 17 interns cataloging and recording a day, and he planned to open an online museum.\n\n\n"}

A 1999 report from the International Federation of Library Associations identified several advantages and disadvantages with roving reference in the pre-mobile era. The roving model allowed librarians to engage with \"the majority of users who have questions in mind [who] do not approach the reference desk for assistance\". However, libraries reported that some staff were uncomfortable with the practice, and that there were concerns about user privacy.\n\nBeginning in the 2000s, librarians used laptops or laptop carts to engage in technology-supported roaming reference. Since the development of mobile technologies, roving reference can be facilitated with the use of such technologies, such as tablet computers, which allow librarians to readily check the online public access catalogue or the library's electronic databases while away from their desk. This has contributed to the increased popularization of roving-reference programs as supplements for more traditional reference desks. The model has also been extended to service beyond the library building (library outreach), for example in a dormitory or faculty building at an academic institution.\n"}

The journal was edited by Gavin Lambert from 1949 to 1955, and from 1956 to 1990 by Penelope Houston. The relaunch editor was Philip Dodd. It is currently edited by Nick James. The magazine reviews all film releases each month, including those with a limited (art house) release, as opposed to most film magazines which concentrate on those films with a general release. \"Sight & Sound\" features a full cast and crew credit list for each reviewed film, as well as the entire plot of said film.\n\nEvery decade, \"Sight & Sound\" asks an international group of film professionals to vote for their ten greatest films of all time. Until 1992, the votes of the invited critics and directors were compiled to make one list. However, since 1992, directors have been invited to participate in a separate poll.\n\nThe individual results are eclectic; in the 2002 poll, 885 different films received at least one mention from one voter.

In 2002, both the critics and the directors selected Stanley Kubrick films in their top ten; however, the critics chose \"\", while the directors preferred \"Dr. Strangelove\".\n\nThe \"Sight & Sound\" accolade has come to be regarded as one of the most important of the \"greatest ever film\" polls. Roger Ebert described it as \"by far the most respected of the countless polls of great movies—the only one most serious movie people take seriously.\" The first poll, in 1952, was topped by \"Bicycle Thieves\". The five subsequent polls (1962–2002) were won by \"Citizen Kane\" (which finished 13th in 1952), while \"Vertigo\" received the most votes in 2012. Only \"La Règle du jeu (The Rules of the Game)\" has appeared in all seven of the magazine's decennial polls. Among the directors that participated in 2012 are Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Ken Loach and Francis Ford Coppola.\n\n\"Sight & Sound\" has in the past been the subject of criticism, notably from Raymond Durgnat, who often accused it of elitism, puritanism and snobbery, although he did write for it in the 1950s, and again in the 1990s.

Crenshaw, 98 Wash. 2d 789, 659 P.2d 488 (1983), is a criminal case interpreting the relationship of the insanity defense to a deific decree. The Supreme Court of Washington carved out the deific exception from the standard set forth in \"People v. Schmidt\" (1915), that a person can be found not guilty by reason of insanity even if they knew their act was morally wrong by the standards of society and wrong under the law, if their mental disorder was a delusion that God commanded their act. A mother insanely killed her child in the delusional belief that she was obeying God's command. It was found that \"it would be unrealistic to hold her responsible for the crime, since her free will has been subsumed by her belief in the deific decree.\n"}

One year later, he became a chaplain in Zlonice. Hajek initially was a member of the Bohemian Unity of the Brethren, who later converted to Catholicism. In 1524 he served as a preacher at the St. Thomas' Church in Prague Malá Strana; from 1527 as a dean of Karlštejn Castle and a priest in Tetín. In May 1533, he was appointed royal administrator of the Vyšehrad Chapter. Hajek reached the peak of ecclesiastical career when he became provost of Stará Boleslav Chapter, however, he fell from grace shortly afterwards and retired to Prague.\n\nHis famous \"Annales\" cover the History of the Czech lands from the legendary early medieval rulers Lech, Czech, and Rus up to the coronation of King Ferdinand I in 1526. They were translated into German by Johann Sandel (1596), and were extensively studied by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832). Long considered one of the best sources of Bohemian history, modern criticism has found it to be quite inaccurate, although still useful for information about Czech literature traditions of the time.\n\n\n"}
