In 2005 it merged with the Israeli company Espro Information Technologies.\n\nAcoustiguide launched an early mobile interpretation guide in 1957, with a tour of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Hyde Park narrated by his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. Audioguides in museums had been available in the United States since 1954, with the Guide-A-Phone system at the American Museum of Natural History. Available on then-new portable reel-to-reel players, the tour led visitors through the estate's public and private spaces, and told stories of day-to-day life and special visits by dignitaries. \n\nIn 1959, the Phoenix Art Museum was the first museum to use an Acoustiguide to interpret their permanent collection, which was narrated by Vincent Price. Cassette players were used though the 1960s and infrared and radio frequency tour systems were used in the 1970s with a specific cassette model, called the M1 player. Concurrently, AM and FM wands were introduced at Centrepoint Tower in Sydney, Queen´s House (National Maritime Museum), and the Mary Rose Trust. \n\nAcoustiguide gained popularity in museum education with \"blockbuster\" exhibitions in the 1980s. P2s or Panasonic XBS cassette players were bought off-the-shelf and the company built a mass charging system with custom made charging racks, in order to satisfy the increasing needs by museums.\n\nWith this increase in demand, the company opened offices in Europe and Asia, which included one of the first American-based companies to be opened in Mainland China (at Beijing's Forbidden City). In 1993, Acoustiguide created digital wands with \"random access tours\" which allowed visitors to choose the objects they wanted to learn more about and to go at their own pace in a sequence of their own choosing. These players debuted at the Louvre, in Paris.\n\nAcoustiguide offers digital audio and multimedia interpretative tours via a variety of platforms including smartphones, multimedia MP3 players, radio transmission systems and the internet, as well as proprietary hardware and software guiding solutions designed and manufactured specifically for the cultural and tourism markets. Acoustiguide also offers Acoustiguide Mobile, a multimedia app for iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. Acoustiguide's products are solid state and include keypads to allow visitors to choose content appropriate to their location in the exhibit, as well as additional material such as multimedia and video vignettes. Acoustiguide technology is in use at hundreds of sites worldwide\n\nThe first digital wand player which allowed for 'random access' tours. Still used in some institutions throughout the United States.\n\nIn 1996, Acoustiguide and Denon co-created the second generation of digital players. These are used infrequently.\n\nThe third generation of digital random access audio equipment was launched in 2000. It came with the ability to use it as a wand or with headphones, increased memory capacity, MP3 sound, customized data collection, LCD screens, features for individuals with disabilities and the ability to update via the internet. This model is no longer available for new purchases, but can be found in a few locations throughout the United States.\n\nFour models of exSite have been launched since 2000. Each exSite unit is wand-based and capable of collecting data about the use of the tour via a survey. exSite units are still sold by Acoustiguide.\n\nLaunched at the Museums and Heritage Show in 2007, it comes in two models: Click (with keypad) and Touch (with touch screen). Both have color screens and provide audio content, images, video, photos, animation and maps. Both can be used as a wand or a headset player. This is the most popular unit available .\n\nAcoustiguide is owned and managed by Espro-Acoustiguide Group. The Group operates worldwide through 7 subsidiaries and a network of distributors with offices in New York, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Amsterdam, Salzburg, Madrid, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Sydney, St. Petersburg, Prague, Mexico City, Shanghai, and Tokyo. The company’s list of clients include New York’s MoMA and the UN visitor center, San Francisco’s Asian Art Museum, Paris’ Musèe du Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, and Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, London’s Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London, Jerusalem’s Israel Museum, Taipei’s 101 Tower, Beijing’s National Museum of China, and Sydney’s Opera House.\n\n\nSystems such as Acoustiguide's, and those of competitors Tour-Mate, ArtTours , and Cuseum, are identified as providing \"industrial-strength systems that can be used as audio guides in museums and other cultural heritage sites and support typically a very wide range of human languages (reaching 20 or more.)\"\n\nAmong competitors, there is another company, which was set up in Italy in 1959, almost at the same time as Acoustiguide and which is still active in the digital interpretation field: D'Uva www.duva.eu.\n"}

{"id": "17952329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17952329", "title": "BCM Classification", "text": "BCM Classification\n\nThe British Catalogue of Music Classification (BCM Classification) is a faceted classification that was commissioned from E. J. Coates by the Council of the British National Bibliography to organize the content of the British Catalogue of Music. The published schedule (1960) was considerably expanded by Patrick Mills of the British Library up until its use was abandoned in 1998. Entries in the catalogue were organized by BCM classmark from the catalogue's inception in 1957 until 1982. From that year the British Catalogue of Music (which from 1974 onward was published by The British Library) was organized instead by Dewey Decimal Classification number, though BCM classmarks continued to be added to entries up to the 1998 annual cumulation.\n\nThe schedule is divided into two main parts: A–B representing Musical literature and C–Z representing Music – Scores and Parts. There are also seven auxiliary tables dealing with various sub-arrangements, sets of ethnic/locality subdivisions and chronological reference points.\n\nThe notation is retroactive using uppercase alphabetic characters omitting I and O, with the addition of slash / and parentheses ( ) which have specific anteriorizing functions. Retroactive notation requires that the classifier combines terms in reverse schedule order. This has the benefit of producing a compact notation by removing the need for facet indicators.\n\nThe schedule at A (Music Literature) parallels that from the Scores and Parts schedules thus Choral Music is at D while books about Choral Music are at AD; Harp Music is at TQ so books on harp music are at ATQ. The schedule at B accommodates books about specific composers and music in non-European traditions.\n\nAs a fully faceted scheme after the ideas of S. R. Ranganathan, BCM class numbers are capable of being chain-indexed, allowing index access to each step of the hierarchy.\n\nBCM classification had a strong influence on Russell Sweeney's so-called Phoenix Dewey 780 schedule which in turn influenced the 780 Music schedule in the 20th edition of Dewey Decimal Classification. The music schedule of the second edition of the Bliss Classification is also strongly influenced by BCM.\n\nThis classification system is still in use at a number of libraries, including the State Library of Western Australia and the Library at Edith Cowan University.\n"}

{"id": "97585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97585", "title": "Citation", "text": "Citation\n\nA citation is a reference to a published or unpublished source. More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.\n\nCitations have several important purposes: to uphold intellectual honesty (or avoiding plagiarism), to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used. As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words. Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.\n\nThe forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford, Harvard, MLA, American Sociological Association (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.\n\nBibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.\n\nA bibliographic citation is a reference to a book, article, web page, or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely. Different citation systems and styles are used in scientific citation, legal citation, prior art, the arts, and the humanities.\n\nCitation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:\n\nAlong with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include unique identifiers depending on the type of work being referred to.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing. However, the Council of Science Editors (CSE) adds a third, the\" citation-name system\".\n\nThe Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both. The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.\n\nFor example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system \"without\" a full bibliography could look like:\n\nThe note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:\n\nIn a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:\n\nThe bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:\n\nIn the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.\n\nParenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.\n\nAn example of a parenthetical reference:\n\nDepending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called \"References\", \"Bibliography\", \"Works cited\" or \"Works consulted\".\n\nIn-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a tooltip. This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.\n\nSuperscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.\n\nCitation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as the Chicago Manual of Style, are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as MLA and APA styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles. The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.\n\nA number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: Stephanus pagination for Plato; Bekker numbers for Aristotle; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or Shakespeare notation by play.\n\n\nIn some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional footnotes (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term \"footnote\" is actually used as a synonym for \"reference\", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.\n\n\n\n\nIn their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a \"half-life\", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.\n\nOther experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.\n\nAnother important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.\n\nResearch suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article. Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared. For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.\n\nCitation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles. On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.\n\n"}

It is named for its place of origin, the Benedictine Abbey of Croyland or Crowland, in Lincolnshire, England. It was formerly also known as the Chronicle of Ingulf or Ingulphus after its supposed original compiler, the 11th-century abbot Ingulf. As that section of the text is now known to have been a later forgery, its author is instead known as Pseudo-Ingulf.\n\nSeveral historical chronicles were written at the Abbey of Croyland, which was the wealthiest religious foundation in eastern England during the Middle Ages. Alison Weir writes that the chronicles dated before 1117 are \"spurious\", while the three anonymously written \"continuations\" that span the periods from 1144-1469, 1459-1468 and 1485-1486 are genuine.\n\nThe first entry of the chronicle concerns 655. A forged part of the text was formerly used to support the existence of a form of the \"congé d'élire\"—royal power over investiture of bishops—in Anglo-Saxon England prior to the Norman Conquest.\n\nThe part that covers the years 1459–1486, called the Second Continuation, was written in April 1486, after Henry Tudor had become King Henry VII of England. It was written someone who had access to information from the court of Richard III—described as being a doctor of canon law and member of Edward IV's council. Some historians believe that author was John Russell, Bishop of Lincoln, who was Richard's Chancellor for most of his reign (until Richard dismissed him on 24 July 1485) but who now wanted to please the new king Henry. Others conclude the work was written by a monk of Crowland who has edited a secular source.\n\nOver the years, there has been confusion between the second and third continuators, and the fourth continuator claims not to know the identity of the third. It is, in fact, the second continuator (covering the period 1459–1486) who claims to be writing in April 1486, and, sure enough, this section ends with the marriage of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York and the rebellion that followed. This date ties in with the survival of a copy of \"Titulus Regius\" in the text, and Russell is known to have been at Crowland during April, 1486.\n\n"}
{"id": "29104979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29104979", "title": "Cunning folk", "text": "Cunning folk\n\nCunning folk, also known as folk healers, are practitioners of folk medicine, folk magic, and divination within the context of the various traditions of folklore in Christian Europe (from at least the 15th up until at least the early 20th century). \n\nNames given to folk healers or magicians in parts of Europe include the French \"devins-guérisseurs\" (soothsayer-healers) and \"leveurs de sorts\" (curse lifters), the Italian \"benandanti\" (\"good walkers\"), the Dutch \"toverdokters\" or \"duivelbanners\", the German \"Hexenmeister\" or \"Kräuterhexen\", the Spanish \"curanderos\", the Portuguese \"curandeiros/as\", \"benzedeiros/as\" or \"mulheres de virtude\" (this last one applies only to females, translating as \"women of virtue\"), the Danish \"kloge folk\", Swedish \"klok gumma\" (\"\"wise old woman\") or \"klok gubbe\" (\"wise old man\"\"), and the Slavic \"Vedmak\". Some historians and folklorists have opted to apply the term \"cunning folk\" as an umbrella term for the entire range of the phenomenon.\n\nIn Scandinavia the \"klok gumma\" (\"wise woman\") or \"klok gubbe\" (\"wise man\"), and collectively \"De kloka\" (\"The Wise ones\"), as they were known in Swedish, were usually elder members of the community who acted as folk healers and midwives as well as using folk magic such as magic rhymes. In Denmark, they were called \"klog mand\" (\"wise man\") and \"klog kone\" (\"wise woman\") and collectively as \"kloge folk\" (\"wise folk\").\n\nMany Norwegian and Danish practitioners of folk magic and medicine would have a copy of the \"Svartebok\" (or \"black book\"), a tome that, according to some, was written by \"Cyprianus\", that is, the Saint of Necromancers, Cyprian of Antioch, and by others to have been the Sixth and Seventh books of the Bible (or \"Books of Moses\" as the Pentateuch is known in Denmark and Norway) that were left out of the official Old Testament by the learned so that the common folk would not learn the knowledge held within the text. A formulary found in a \"black book\" recovered from a farm near Elverum contains many formulas such as one for a toothache that commands the user of the charm to write the words \"Agerin, Nagerin, Vagerin, Jagerin, Ipagerin, Sipia\" on a piece of paper using a new pen, cut the paper into three small pieces, place the first piece onto the tooth in the evening and in the morning spit the piece into the fire. This should then be repeated with the other pieces. Another charm used for helping a woman who is having a difficult labour says to take two white lily roots and give them to the mother to eat.\n\nThere is an old idea that it was \"Klok gumma\" who often fell victim to the Witch Trials in the 17th century, but this does not appear to be true. However, some \"wise women\" and \"wise men\" were punished, not for witchcraft but often under the indictment point of \"superstition\" (Swedish: \"Vidskepelse\"). In the 1670s, the wise man Johan Eriksson of Knutby was sentenced to seven gauntlet for \"superstition\", and again in the 1680s to nine. Per Ericsson of Dalarna, who read the diseases in wine, was punished both in 1720 and 1726. Brita Biörn of Gotland said in court that she learned to heal the sick when she spent some time in the underworld, and she was sentenced to prison terms in both 1722 and 1737. The punishment of Sweden's \"cunning folk\" only seemed to have the opposite effect. Ericsson said that his clients had been coming in greater numbers after the rulings against him, and that he would be forced to hide if he was to obey the court and refrain from his practice, and in the Biörn case, the vicar complained that people from throughout the country came to seek her help, and relied on her as a God after her first sentence. The sentences, in reality, had the effect of good advertising, and Brita's daughter and granddaughter's daughter were also healing women.\n\nThere are many examples of well-known \"cunning folk\" who were known far beyond their village boundaries, such as Ingeborg i Mjärhult in the 18th century and Kisamor and Gota-Lena in the 19th century. In the 16th century, Brigitta Andersdotter was often hired by Queen Margaret Leijonhufvud. In Norway some women such as Mor Sæther (1793–1851), Anna Brandfjeld (1810–1905) and Valborg Valland (1821–1903) achieved national fame, unusual for women of the time.\n\nThe customs persisted well into the 20th century, until the medical doctor became more accessible to the public. In the 19th century, every neighbourhood in Norway had at least one folk-healer. Such beliefs in folk-medicine, magic, and the use of \"black books\" were taken by migrants to the Americas. However, many beliefs died out in Norwegian-American communities around the 1920s with many not having knowledge of the subject or of the \"black book\". Knowledge of these beliefs did last longer in Norway, even if they were not commonly believed in by Norwegians.\n\nThe term \"cunning man\" or \"cunning woman\" was most widely used in southern England and the Midlands, as well as in Wales. Such people were also frequently known across England as \"wizards\", \"wise men\" or \"wise women\", or in southern England and Wales as \"conjurers\" or as \"dyn(es) hysbys\" (knowing man or woman) in the Welsh language. In Cornwall they were sometimes referred to as \"pellars\", which some etymologists suggest originated from the term \"expellers\", referring to the practice of expelling evil spirits. Folklorists often used the term \"white witch\", though this was infrequently used amongst the ordinary folk as the term \"witch\" had general connotations of evil. \n\nCertain Christian theologians and Church authorities believed that the cunning folk, being practitioners of magic, were in league with the Devil and as such were akin to the more overtly Satanic and malevolent witches. Partly because of this, laws were enacted across England, Scotland and Wales that often condemned cunning folk and their magical practices, but there was no widespread persecution of them akin to the Witch Hunt, largely because most common people firmly distinguished between the two: witches were seen as being harmful and cunning folk as useful.\n\nIn England during the Early Mediaeval period, various forms of folk magic could be found amongst the Anglo-Saxons, who referred to such practitioners as \"wicca\" (male) or \"wicce\" (female), or at times also as \"dry\", practitioners of \"drycraeft\", the latter of which have been speculated as being anglicised terms for the Irish \"drai\", a term referring to druids, who appeared as anti-Christian sorcerers in much Irish literature of the period.\n\nSome of the spells and charms that had been used in the Anglo-Saxon polytheist era continued to be used following Christianization. However, as historian Owen Davies noted, \"although some such pre-Christian magic continued, to label it pagan is to misrepresent the people who used it and the context in which it was used.\"\n\nIn England and Wales, cunning folk had operated throughout the latter part of the Mediaeval and into the Early Modern period. In the 15th and 16th centuries, there had been no attempt to illegalise the cunning craft, although private lawsuits had been brought against some of them by those clients who felt that they had been cheated out of their money. This changed with the first of the Witchcraft Acts, the Witchcraft Act of 1542, enacted under the reign of Henry VIII, which targeted both witches and cunning folk, and which prescribed the death penalty for such crimes as using invocations and conjurations to locate treasure or to cast a love spell. This law was repealed no later than 1547, under the reign of Henry's son Edward VI, something that the historian Owen Davies believed was due to those in power changing their opinion on the law: they believed that either the death penalty was too harsh for such crimes or that the practice of the cunning craft was a moral issue that was better for the Church to deal with in ecclesiastic courts rather than a problem that had to be sorted out by the state.\n\nFor the following few decades, the magical practices of the cunning folk remained legal, despite opposition from certain religious authorities. It was a time of great religious upheaval in the country as Edward's successor, his sister Mary I, reimposed Roman Catholicism, before Anglicanism was once again restored under Elizabeth I. In 1563, after the return of power to the Anglican Church of England, a bill was passed by parliament designed to illegalise \"Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts\", again being aimed at both the alleged witches and the cunning folk. However, this law was not as harsh as its earlier predecessor, with the death penalty being reserved for those who were believed to have conjured an evil spirit or murdered someone through magical means, whilst those for whom the use of magic was a first offence faced a year's imprisonment and four stints in the pillory. Nonetheless, this law would have little effect on the cunning folk, as \"the attention and focus of the courts shifted away from the activities of cunning-folk and towards the \"maleficium\" of supposed witches\" - the Witch Hunt that had been raging in Scotland and in many parts of continental Europe had finally arrived in England.\n\nWhilst across England, many people were accused of witchcraft by members of their local communities and put on trial, the cunning folk very rarely suffered a similar fate. It was unusual for a cunning man or woman to actually be accused of witchcraft; in the county of Essex for instance, whereas around four hundred people had been put on trial for witchcraft, only four of those were identifiably cunning folk. However, many of the professional witch-hunters and theologians continued to proclaim the cunning craft as being the same as witchcraft, with them both being caused by the Devil.\n\nWith the decline in the witch trials in the latter part of the 17th and early 18th centuries, partly due to the rise of the Enlightenment amongst the educated elite, a new law was introduced, the Witchcraft Act of 1736. Unlike earlier laws, this did not accept the existence of magic, and took the opinion that there never had been any witches, and it therefore came down heavier on the cunning folk, who were claiming to perform genuine magical spells. It portrayed the cunning folk as practitioners of \"explicitly fraudulent practices designed to fool the credulous\" in order to gain money off of them.\n\nThe belief in \"cunning folk\" and the use of \"white magic\" to be used for healing and as protection against \"black magic\" was once widespread in Germany; however, during the early modern period such practices gradually became less accepted by the authorities, partly because the belief in \"white magic\" was viewed by the church authorities to be contrary to Biblical teachings and partly due to the loss of revenues for certain groups such as barber-surgeons and physicians, as was the case in Rothenburg ob der Tauber in which periodical action was taken against users of \"white magic\". The usual punishment was banishment rather than execution as was common for others convicted of witchcraft and the use of \"black magic\" \n\nIn Germany practitioners of folk-magic were almost always female; however, by contrast the \"Hexenmeister\" (also a term for a warlock) or \"Hexenfinder\" who hunted witches and \"neutralised\" them on behalf of society was always male.\n\nThe names used for cunning-folk in Italy vary from region to region, although such names include \"praticos\" (wise people), \"guaritori\" (healers), \"fattucchiere\" (fixers), \"donne che aiutano\" (women who help) and \"mago\", \"maga\" or \"maghiardzha\" (sorcerers). At times, they were sometimes called \"streghe\" (witches), although usually only \"behind their backs or by those who either are sceptical of their powers or believe they deal in black magic.\" Unlike in other parts of Europe, such as Britain, the cunning profession survived the 20th century and into the early 21st, allowing Italian-American sociologist Sabina Magliocco to make a brief study of them (2009).\n\nAs in the rest of Europe, the primary role of the Italian cunning-folk was apparently in healing, both through the use of herbs and through spiritual healing. The former required knowledge about various plants and herbs on the behalf of the cunning-person, although the spiritual healing was believed to come from an inner power, known as \"la forza\" (power), \"la virtù\" (virtue) or \"il Segno\" (the sign). Such healing was often in the form of removing the malocchio, or evil eye, which had cursed someone.\n\nItalian cunning craft was, and continued to remain rooted in the country's Roman Catholicism, which is evident from the use of charms and prayers, which often call upon the aid of saints. Such magical practitioners also widely believed that they dealt with spirit beings, both benevolent (who would aid them) and malevolent (whom they would have to combat). The latter included the unquiet dead as well as supernatural witches who were believed to cause harm to people, whilst the former included ancestors, the helpful dead and saints, who could help defeat these malevolent entities. Magical tools were also utilised by Italian cunning-folk, and whilst these varied between both regions and practitioners, these commonly include fiber ropes or cords to bind, knives or scissors to cut away illness, and mirrors and weapons to reflect or scare away malevolent spirits.\n\n"}

He competed in the southern United States from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\nMcShain was born on October 30, 1912 in Little Rock, Arkansas. He made his professional wrestling debut in Little Rock, Arkansas on October 30, 1930. McShain later joined the United States Navy, where he excelled as a boxer and won several championships.\n\nMcShain's family moved to Glendale, California, where he competed for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He won his first championship, the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, on October 11, 1937. Over the next ten years, he held the title another nine times.\n\nHe later moved to Alvin, Texas, where he continued to compete for the NWA. He won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship on ten occasions between in 1948 and 1960 by defeating such wrestlers as Antonino Rocca and Verne Gagne. On November 19, 1951, he also defeated Gagne to win the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. In 1954, McShain won the MWA American Tag Team Championship with partner Oyama Kato while competing for the Midwest Wrestling Association in Ohio.\n\nAfter his retirement, McShain worked as a referee in Texas.\n\nMcShain wrestled as a \"tough guy\"; he proudly advertised his list of injuries to demonstrate the amount of punishment his body could take. He was also known for blading, as he often cut his own forehead during matches to draw blood. McShain was a stiff worker, as he put legitimate force behind his punches and made contact with his opponents rather than pretending to hit them. He used a piledriver as one of his ring moves, in which he would hold his opponents upside-down and then drop them head-first to the ring floor. McShain attributed the piledriver to the deaths of two opponents.\n\nMcShain used a cocky strut to anger opponents and spectators. His brother-in-law Donn Lewin stated that the strut was so arrogant that it \"made you want to kill him\" and that he walked the same way in real life. McShain was arrested once after starting a riot by spitting tobacco juice from his trademark cigar on an opponent. His behavior was considered so inappropriate that he was summoned to appear in front of the Texas Gaming Commission. He was also the subject of another inquiry, as he changed the pre-planned outcome of a bout midway through the match. Because there was a championship on the line and two promoters were arguing over the wrestling territory in which the match took place, the United States Department of Justice became involved. The match was the origin of the rule used in many promotions that prevents a title belt from changing hands when the match ends with a disqualification.\n\nIn a match against Donn Lewin, McShain broke Lewin's nose. Shortly thereafter, Lewin's father invited McShain to dinner. McShain met Donn's sister Sallee, whom he later married.\n\nMcShain appeared in the 1949 movie The Inspector General, as well as several other films.\n"}

Ole and Chic arrive in the midst of the mayhem by taxi, and after a bit of funny business step back to reveal that it's a movie sound stage. They work for Miracle Pictures, a company using the slogan \"If it's a good picture, it's a Miracle!\" A mousy screenwriter (Elisha Cook, Jr.) outlines his script for the screen adaptation of \"Hellzapoppin\"', and the rest of the movie depicts Cook's script.

Completed in 2000, it was originally a showcase of the latest green building technologies, but was later transformed into an education centre. It was described by architectural writer Owen Hatherley as \"a rather ambitiuous gesture for a place devoted to reconstructing the past\".\n\nThe House of the Future project was a joint venture between the National Museum of Wales, BBC Wales and Redrow Homes with support from Malcolm Parry, head of the Welsh School of Architecture. An architectural competition was launched to design an adaptable, eco-home, which received 321 expressions of interest. These were reduced to a shortlist of six finalists, from which the winner was announced in July 1999 as London firm Jestico & Whiles. \n\nRedrow Homes were tasked with constructing the building within a £120,000 budget, but because many of the components of the project were not widely available (for example the oak frame and the green roof) the costs spiralled. It was completed in December 2000 and the process also resulted in three 40 minute BBC television programmes. \n\nA competition was then held to choose a family to live in the house for a week. It was won by the Powell family from Bridgend, who enjoyed the open plan kitchen, but disliked the bedrooms and had problems with the computer controls.\n\nThe house was officially opened by Welsh Assembly Minister for Culture, Jenny Randerson, at the end of April 2001.\n\nIt went on to win several design awards, including the National Homebuilder Design Award (2001) and the Welsh Housing Design award (2002). Redrow meanwhile were criticised for building houses only 10 minutes away that were the antithesis of the St Fagans house, with \"The Telegraph\" saying they were \"getting ever further away, not closer, to the house of the future it has sponsored.\"\n\nThe house was designed to make a net carbon dioxide emission of zero.\n\nAfter ten years many of the futuristic elements had been superseded by current technology, for example recycling of refuse was now common and low wattage lightbulbs were widely used in households. Other systems, for example the solar panels and ground source heat pumps remained prohibitively expensive. The contents had begun to look dated and it was claimed the museum's culture did not support serious investment to keep the technology ahead of fashion. With its days numbered as a futuristic exhibit, plans were put in place in 2009 to convert the house into an educational centre, named Ty Gwyrdd ('Green House'), to host environmental courses.\n\nDuring refurbishment of the museum's main building during the 2010s, Ty Gwyrdd was used as the main gift shop.\n\n"}

It aired on Fox in the United States on October 23, 2016, and is written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Joe Vaux. In this episode, viewers are taken behind the scenes of what happens when the characters of \"Family Guy\" are not involved in the production of their show and what they do during their free time, hosted by James Woods.\n\nIn this behind the scenes episode hosted by James Woods, viewers get to see what happens to the characters when they're off the air. Through interviews, we see the characters acting like they do when on the show, like Peter acting stupid and Brian acting pretentious. Stewie reveals that he dislikes the show and hosts a pizza commercial that promotes his online crepe delivery website.\n\nAs James Woods takes the people through the halls of the production offices, different props are seen like Gary the No-Trash Cougar from \"Blind Ambition\", the Petoria flag from \"E. Peterbus Unum\", the Banana Brian suit from \"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\", a cartoon version of Muppet Lois from \"Foreign Affairs\", a \"What Really Grinds My Gears\" poster from \"Stewie B. Goode\", Meg's \"Megatron\" birth certificate from \"A Fistful of Meg\", Stewie's ray gun, Stewie's \"Die Lois\" needlework from \"North by North Quahog\", a Peter vs. the Giant Chicken fight poster, and artwork from the 2009 Emmy screener DVD. Quagmire is revealed to be a writer on the show as well. Mayor Adam West is shown passing by Meg and Chris during their interview, dressed as Batman, doing the Batclimb from the 1960s' \"Batman\" TV show despite Seth MacFarlane's deal with Adam West to not make his \"Family Guy\" counterpart be dressed as Batman as West has gained excessive attention as the '60s Batman.\n\nThe characters are interviewed as Lois' dressing room has pictures of \"Family Guy\" guest stars Liam Neeson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gene Simmons. Due to Peter's behavior and an anonymous complaint from Stewie, FOX's CEOs Dana Walden and Gary Newman decide to fire him. Peter is oblivious to this. At a table-read, Peter slowly discovers the news when he reads a script that depicts him dying and being replaced by David Spade as a character named Uncle Ricky and other possibilities in the show that may cause him to return (like Stewie's time machine catching a virus and Chris dreaming) are thrown out of the window. When confronted by Peter about the script mentioning Peter's death, Gary tells him that the network has decided that they can't deal with his attitude anymore. When they give Peter another chance, he acts up again saying \"Fuck you!\" to Gary, and Gary fires him. When his family backs them up, Peter leaves the studio in a huff as everyone nods at his departure. As Peter approaches the gate, the gate guard Smitty tells Peter that his penis is out.\n\nAt a hotel, Peter tries to find acting work someplace else along with other interests. After Peter is evicted from the hotel for selling the towels and is thrown out by \"their Uncle Phil\" in the style of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", he decides to stay in an apartment room that has a \"Brooks Was Here\" carving from \"The Shawshank Redemption\".\n\nOther behind-the-scenes works are shown like:\n\n\nAt the tape night, the Griffins admit that they have trepidation at doing the show without Peter and Spade is revealed to be needy. At Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Peter's attempt to blend in using an obscure character fails. Upon seeing a bus with a \"Family Guy\" logo, he decides to go back to the FOX Studio. Once at FOX Studios, Peter tries to make it past Smitty. He was only admitted after pitching an idea to FOX of a show to Dana Walden and Gary Newman that doesn't make sense and is in its third season.\n\nOn the air, Peter storms in and apologizes for his behavior and even gives Chris a t-shirt of Kermit the Frog dressed as a hip-hop star. The Griffin family are able to accept him. When he thinks it's too late since they don't have a script, Lois conveniently takes out a script for a new episode with Peter in it alive. Peter also commented that he got David Spade removed from the show by having \"Sofía Vergara deported.\" It is then shown that David Spade is dressed as Sofía Vergara when working on \"Modern Family\".\n\nIn the interviews, it's revealed that the process of Peter being fired was staged and that the script of Peter being fired was fake. Peter has since returned to his old ways soon. So the family and crew now do this every week as an intervention for Peter, not letting him know it's already been done the week before.\n\nJames Woods then closes out the episode by showing moments where Peter was hit in the crotch with a bag full of nickels. That moment was dedicated in memory of Peter's left testicle.\n\nThe episode was watched by an audience of 2.49 million viewers, a decrease from the previous episode, and making it the third most-watched show of the night, behind \"Bob's Burgers\" and \"The Simpsons\".\n\n"}

His name is occasionally seen as \"Jasper Stewart\".\n\nJoseph Stewart was born in Adair County, Kentucky and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1842. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery and later the 3rd U.S. Artillery during the Mexican War. On January 3, 1856 he was promoted captain of Company H in the 3rd Artillery. In December 1859 Captain Stewart took command of Fort Alcatraz. In the years immediately preceding the Civil War, Stewart transformed the fort into the most powerful coastal defense in the west. It was also during Stewart's time on Alcatraz that it took on the role of a prison for the first time. 11 soldiers under Stewart's command were imprisoned there and soon other nearby forts were sending prisoners there too.\n\nIn 1860 a vigilante force was soundly defeated by Paiute Indians in a battle near Pyramid Lake in present-day Nevada. This defeat prompted the Federal government to dispatch a contingent of the U.S. Army to the area. Captain Stewart took command of the so-called \"Carson Valley Expedition\" composed of 200 regular army soldiers from the 3rd Artillery and 6th U.S. Infantry. Stewart was, however, subordinated to Col. John C. Hays who was in command of a regiment of U.S. Volunteers. Hays and Stewart defeated the Paiutes in the second Battle of Pyramid Lake.\n\nWhile Hays' volunteers disbanded shortly after the battle, Stewart's regulars remained in the area for some time. Stewart was ordered to construct a permanent army post in the area. Eventually, he chose a site along the Carson River which he suggested should be named in honor of General Sylvester Churchill. The U.S. Army confirmed the site and name in August and construction of Fort Churchill began. Construction was completed in 1861 with Stewart as the post's first commander.\n\nDuring the American Civil War Stewart briefly returned to command Fort Alcatraz. In 1861 he was transferred to the defenses of Washington, DC and commanded the artillery in George A. McCall's division of the Army of the Potomac from December 1861 to February 1862. From April to October 1862 he served as recruiting officer for San Francisco and was the Inspector General of the Humboldt Military District during the Winter of 1862/1863. He was chief of artillery for the Department of the Pacific from April to July 1863 and ended the war as recruiting officer for Salem MA from November to December 1865. On December 11, 1865, Stewart was promoted Major in the 4th U.S. Artillery.\n\nFollowing the Civil War Stewart commanded various forts along the eastern United States including Fort McHenry and Fort Macon. He served as the fifth commander of the Department of Alaska, from January 4, 1873 to April 20, 1874, then returned to California in command of the Presidio of San Francisco from May 8 to June 17, 1875. From 1876-1879 Stewart was in command of Fort Canby engaged against Native Americans during the Bannock War. On July 18, 1879, Stewart was promoted Lieutenant Colonel of the 3rd U.S. Artillery. He retired on August 25, 1879 and died in Berkeley, CA on April 23, 1904.\n\nHe is buried at the Presidio in San Francisco, CA.\n\nTotton, Kathryn, \"Fort Churchill: Nevada Military Outpost of the 1860s\", 1981 Nevada Natural History Association\n"}

Former presidents Carlos Menem, Eduardo Duhalde, Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner have been elected from this party. Justicialists have been the largest party in the Congress covering nearly the entire period since 1987.\n\nThe Justicialist Party is the largest party in the Congress; however, this does not reflect the divisions within the party over the role of Kirchnerism, the left-wing populist faction of the party, which is opposed by the dissident Peronists, the right-wing conservative faction of the party.\n\nThe Justicialist Party was founded in 1947 by Juan and Evita Perón, and superseded the Labour Party on which Perón had been elected a year earlier. Following the enactment of women's right to vote in 1948, a Peronist Women's Party, led by the First Lady, was also established. All Peronist entities were banned from elections after 1955, when the \"Revolución Libertadora\" overthrew Perón, and civilian governments' attempt to lift Peronism's ban from legislative and local elections in 1962 and 1965 resulted in military coups.\nBasing itself on the policies espoused by Juan Perón as president of Argentina, the party's platform has from its inception centered around populism, and its most consistent base of support has historically been the CGT, Argentina's largest trade union. Perón ordered the mass nationalization of public services, strategic industries, and the critical farm export sector, while enacting progressive labor laws and social reforms, and accelerating public works investment.\n\nHis tenure also favored technical schools while harassing university staff, and promoted urbanization as it raised taxes on the agrarian sector. These trends earned Peronism the loyalty of much of the working and lower classes, but helped alienate the upper and middle class sectors of society. Censorship and repression intensified, and following his loss of support from the influential Catholic Church, Perón was ultimately deposed in a violent 1955 coup.\n\nThe alignment of these groups as pro or anti-Peronist largely endured, though the policies of Peronism itself varied greatly over the subsequent decades, as did, increasingly, those put forth by its many competing figures. During Perón's exile, it became a big tent party united almost solely by their support for the aging leader's return. A series of violent incidents, as well as Perón's negotiations with both the military regime and diverse political factions, helped lead to his return to Argentina in 1973, and to his election.\n\nAn impasse followed in which the PJ had a place both for leftist armed organizations such as \"Montoneros\", and far-right factions such as José López Rega's Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance. Following Perón's death in 1974, however, this tenuous understanding disintegrated, and a wave of political violence ensued, ultimately resulting in a March 1976 coup. The Dirty War of the late 1970s, which cost hundreds of Peronists (among thousands more) their lives, solidified the party's populist outlook, particularly following the failure of conservative Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz's free trade and deregulatory policies after 1980.\n\nIn the first democratic elections after the end of the dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process, in 1983, the Justicialist Party lost to the Radical Civic Union (UCR). Six years later, it returned to power with Carlos Menem, during whose term the Constitution was reformed to allow for presidential reelection. Menem (1989–1999) adopted neoliberal right-wing policies which changed the overall image of the party.\n\nThe Justicialist Party was defeated by a coalition formed by the UCR and the centre-left FrePaSo (itself a left-wing offshoot of the PJ) in 1999, but regained political weight in the 2001 legislative elections, and was ultimately left in charge of managing the selection of an interim president after the economic collapse of December 2001. Justicialist Eduardo Duhalde, chosen by Congress, ruled during 2002 and part of 2003.\n\nThe 2003 elections saw the constituency of the party split in three, as Carlos Menem, Néstor Kirchner (backed by Duhalde) and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá ran for the presidency leading different party coalitions. After Kirchner's victory, the party started to align behind his leadership, moving slightly to the left.\n\nThe Justicialist Party effectively broke apart in the 2005 legislative elections when two factions ran for a Senate seat in Buenos Aires Province: Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (then the first lady) and Hilda González de Duhalde (wife of former president Duhalde). The campaign was particularly vicious. Kirchner's side allied with other minor forces and presented itself as a heterodox, left-leaning Front for Victory (FpV), while Duhalde's side stuck to older Peronist tradition. González de Duhalde's defeat to her opponent marked, according to many political analysts, the end to Duhalde's dominance over the province, and was followed by a steady defection of his supporters to the winner's side.\n\nNéstor Kirchner proposed the entry of the party into the Socialist International in February 2008. His dominance of the party was undermined, however, by the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector, when a bill raising export taxes was introduced with presidential support. Subsequent growers' lockouts helped result in the defection of numerous Peronists from the FpV caucus, and further losses during the 2009 mid-term elections resulted in the loss of the FpV absolute majorities in both houses of Congress.\n\nThe Justicialist Party was, since its foundation, a Peronist catch-all party, which focuses on the figure of Juan Perón and his wife Eva.\n\nHowever, another wing of the party was well more than the left-wing because of extraction, socialist or radical, which was headed by Héctor José Cámpora. In the years '60 '70 was also very active in the movement of the Montoneros, Marxist-inspired closer to Peronism.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1976, under the leadership of Isabel Peron (which was maneuvered by José López Rega, leader of the internal right-wing after the death of Lastiri) the Justicialist Party is no longer characterized by anti-imperialists tones and revolutionaries, but for the rabid anti-communism, which became the main bulwark in South America, and for the support to economic liberalism. This line continued even after the military dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process, with the Government of Carlos Menem until that of Eduardo Duhalde. Since the return of Peron in 1973 the party actually had already moved to Third Position left-wing of Argentine political spectrum, assuming the characteristics of a centre-right party.\n\nIn 2003 the party has undergone an abrupt turnaround, with the rise of a faction, known as the \"Front for Victory\", led by Néstor Kirchner. These led to the coinage of the term \"Kirchnerismo\", to indicate a left-wing ideology that mixed of socialism, left-wing nationalism and radicalism. Néstor Kirchner was elected President of Argentina, becoming popular in a short time. After his death, his wife Cristina Fernández took over the leadership of the Front for Victory, which continues to be a major faction of the Justicialist Party, with the head of the party being Eduardo Fellner.\n\n"}
{"id": "30927934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30927934", "title": "Landrush period", "text": "Landrush period\n\nA landrush period is the time during which domain names are available for registration, usually to a closed group (usually through a premium price), to entities that do not own a trademark in the name they wish to register, for example generic terms like \"loan\" or \"car\", and thus would not qualify for registration during the sunrise period. Orders may or may not be treated on a first-come-first-served basis. This period follows the sunrise period just after the launch of a new top-level domain or second-level domain during which, for example, owners of trademarks may register a domain name containing the owned mark, but a landrush period precedes a period of general availability, when any qualifying entity can register any name on a first come first-served basis.\n\nAs launches occur, gTLDs will follow a cycle of different launch phases. All launch phases start with the Sunrise Period, there is flexibility with the other stages.\n\nThe Sunrise period is often a 30-day (or longer) phase during which trademark owners can purchase domain names before they are offered to the general public. This period of time allows for companies to keep the domain name associated with their brand before someone can publicly purchase the domain. Often domains such as info, mobi, and eu are picked up by companies during the sunrise period that precedes the larger landrush period. In order to participate in the sunrise period, one has to be a registered trademark holder with the Trademark Clearing House. The allowance of time for each registered domain name in the sunrise period is two years. After that, the trademark holder needs to reclaim their domain.\n\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) defines the landrush period as the time between the Sunrise Period and General availability during which applications for a domain name may be received from any interested eligible party.\n\nRegistries often have the option of including a landrush period, but this process is not mandatory. In the landrush period registration is open to everyone, but the registration is sold at a higher price than the regular price. Also some domains during a landrush period could be auctioned or on a \"first come, first-served\" basis.\n\nThe only domains not offered to everyone during the landrush period are Premium Domains. Each registry reserves the right to reserve high value or \"Premium\" domains and to sell or auction those domains at elevated prices.\n\nOn average, a Landrush Period will last about 30 days and, in this period, applications for domain names may be received from any interested and eligible parties before registration is open for general availability.\n\nIn 2012 a digital land rush was expected because of a possible creation of new domain names and web addresses. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit, is currently responsible for regulation of domain names, and ICANN predicted a landrush period for the new domain names. ICANN surveyed the public for new possible names, and the organization had a goal of trying to expand new top-level domain names. As new domain names are created, ICANN hopes for many overseers to sell their name to registrars. According to ICANN, the front-runner for a new domain name is \".shop\" and the goal is to increase supply and demand for domain names. A landrush period will occur over the creation of new domain names because as the new domain names are created, overseers will sell their domain names, which will cause businesses and individuals to rush to buy new names. This increase in demand causes a landrush period and leads to increase consumption of domain names. In addition to an increase of demand in a landrush period, ICANN hopes to have a greater landrush period than \".jobs\", which was a failure.\n\nAccording to The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in order to participate in a Landrush period applicants must submit an application for a domain name that was not previously allocated, not eligible for allocation, and is not subject of an application that is being currently processed by the auction provider. Also multiple applications for the same domain name will be settled with an auction. In addition, a claims period will be in effect during the entire duration of the Landrush period and the applicant must accept the information contained within a Claim Notice.\n\nThe General Availability phase follows all Sunrise and Landrush periods. This is an open period based on the \"first come, first served\" policy to the public. Typically, 90 calendar days after General Availability opens for each new gLTD, registries must provide Trademark Claims.\n\nICANN defines General Availability is the point in time following which requests to register a domain name may be received from any eligible part on the same \"first come, first served\" basis. Another name for General Availability is also General Registration.\n\nThough generic top-level domains (gTLDs) were first established in 1984, the first major domain landrush was mostly centered around the dot-com bubble, which took place from 1997 until 2003. With the release of the official generic top-level domains, dot-com companies began to arise. This bubble involved investors pouring money into internet startups during the 1990s with hopes that those companies would one day become profitable. These companies were solely based on the World Wide Web, but usually had no strategic business model to support any revenue stream. The result was the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which ultimately ended the first major landrush period.\n\nA large part of the first major landrush was cybersquatting, a practice in which individuals strategically purchase high-value domain names for resale at a higher price. However, this practice was made illegal with the passage of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in 1999. There are companies, such as DomainMarket.com, based around similar practices yet are still considered legal ventures.\n\nFebruary 4, 2014, marked the beginning of the second major domain landrush. This landrush commenced the production of new web addresses, which has not occurred since 2000, when ICANN last accepted applications for top-level domains.The process of applying for new domain names runs through ICANN, the non-profit that manages several Internet-related tasks. ICANN’s process can be an expensive one, demanding an initial fee of $185,000. Additionally, the application process is a lengthy one, in which ICANN believes could take up to a year. Furthermore, the domain names are not simply given to anyone. ICANN reviews critical details regarding applicants’ financial stability, technical abilities and their intentions with the domain.\n\nAndy Vuong of the \"Denver Post\" wrote that some of these new domains will, \"target specific industries, such as .attorney and .ski, or social causes, such as .hiv, which will be dedicated to sites that contribute to the fight against HIV and AIDS\".\n\nThe essential reason to create new gTLDs is due to the fact that there are not enough domain names available for businesses or individuals to create sensible and logical URLs. A vast amount of .com’s are in use already, and individuals and businesses are having difficulties in creating a fitting and simple domain. ICANN’s Cyrus Namazi told Quartz that, “We’ve gone from an average of four or five letters in a second-level domain to something in excess of 14 to find what you’re looking for”.\n\nOne main argument against the creation of new domains is that the days of individuals typing in full URLs is slowly dying out. For example, internet browsers such as Google Chrome’s use an address bar which doubles as a search field.\n\nOne of the major landrush periods that occurred was the .eu TLD (top level domain). The “.eu [domain] is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union” and it was approved in March 2005. It is currently one of the largest European ccTLD. The sunrise period for this domain was divided into two separate parts—the first opened on December 7, 2005, while the second began on February 7, 2006. The first phase was meant for “registrants with prior rights based on trademarks and geographic names” leaving the second phase open to “company, trade, and personal names”.\n\nAfter the sunrise period comes the landrush, which, for .eu, occurred on April 7, 2006, when registration for the domain became possible for “non-trademark holders”. In order to request a domain, people had registrars place their requests into a long queue. Many registrars were backed up with too many requests, so registering for a domain essentially became a game. People would figure out which registrars had already completed many requests, which left these registrars with few requests, and “allow[ed] people to ‘beat the queue.’” The way that EURid (European Registry for Internet Domains) designed the land rush for the .eu domain allowed for over 700,000 domains to be registered within the first 4 hours. Four months later, in August 2006, there were 2 million registered .eu domains.\n\nThe process that EURid created for this domain was criticized for using “phantom” registrars. The difference between something known as a “phantom” registrar and a regular, official registrar, is that an official registrar has only one chance to register a specific domain, while a “phantom” registrar crowds out the .eu domain and has multiple opportunities to register the same domain. This suspicion arose due to 400 registered LLC companies that had similar addresses and contact information. Bringing this realization to the public's attention was the founder of Go Daddy who felt that these 400 companies were classified as \"phantom registrars 'created to hijack the .EU land rush.'\" \n"}

In its domestic market of the United States and Canada, it set the records for the highest-grossing film and second through seventh weekends, as well as the fastest to gross $500 million through $750 million. Elsewhere, it became the highest-grossing film of all time in over 30 markets including China, Hong Kong, Romania, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.\n\nBox office analysts identified several factors contributing to the film's box office success. Among these were the relative lack of competition owing to the release date, a marketing strategy that emphasized the novelty of the cinematic experience leading viewers to watch it in the theater rather than at home, positive word of mouth and repeat viewings increasing the film's staying power in cinemas, an ability to attract audiences across the globe, and premium ticket prices from 3D and IMAX showings. Many of the records set by the film are listed below. Data on the previous record and records that have since been surpassed are presented where available and applicable. All grosses are given in unadjusted US dollars, except where noted otherwise.\n\nThe film set the worldwide record for the highest gross of all time, surpassing the previous record by more than 50%, and grossed $2 billion in less time than it had taken the previous fastest-grossing film to gross half as much. It also exceeded the previous record for highest gross in the IMAX format by a factor of more than three.\n\nIn the domestic market, \"Avatar\" set the record for the highest-grossing film of all time as well as several weekend records. It also set speed records for grosses at and above $500 million, and had the widest IMAX and 3D releases of any film up to that time.\n\"Avatar\" became the highest-grossing movie of all time in more than 30 markets spanning all six continents (not counting Antarctica).

Its discovery traces back to 1845, several years before the start of the California Gold Rush.\n\nThe various versions of the legend tend to agree on a few key points :\n\nOne version states that a wagon train got lost off the Meek Cutoff of the Oregon Trail, near the Malheur River. Three young men (or boys, or a single girl — accounts vary) went to fetch water, and while doing so put some shiny rocks into a blue bucket. Older members of the party said it was copper. Someone asked, \"Was there much of it?\" One replied, \"We could have filled one of these blue buckets\". This was 1845, before the California Gold Rush, and back then many could not recognize gold. A Mrs. Fisher kept one nugget and left the rest behind. The wagons eventually reached what is now The Dalles, Oregon in October, 1845. The single nugget was eventually recognized as gold.\n\nAnother version holds that when the Stephen Meek Wagon train stopped along the trail in present-day Crook County near Bear Creek, children went to gather water at some distance from the camp. They returned with a blue bucket filled with shiny pebbles. An old-timer in the party stated that the pebbles were made of copper. One of the families, however, kept several of the pebbles as souvenirs. Years later, and after having moved to California, the family came across the pebbles in a dresser drawer. By this time, the California Gold Rush had occurred, and the expertise was available to recognize that the pebbles were in fact gold. However, no-one could remember the precise location in which the pebbles had been found.\n\nThe legend sparked a gold rush to the area of modern-day Baker City, Oregon.\n\nIf the mine existed, its location is unknown; the area comprises perhaps . It is believed to be on a tributary of the John Day River, or in another version, on a Bear Creek tributary of the Crooked River. There are three real mines in the U.S. named the \"Blue Bucket\", including one in Grant County, Oregon, that are unrelated to the lost mine.\n\n\n"}

Written in Latin by Hartmann Schedel, with a version in German, translation by Georg Alt, it appeared in 1493. It is one of the best-documented early printed books—an incunabulum—and one of the first to successfully integrate illustrations and text.\n\nLatin scholars refer to it as Liber Chronicarum (Book of Chronicles) as this phrase appears in the index introduction of the Latin edition. English-speakers have long referred to it as the \"Nuremberg Chronicle\" after the city in which it was published. German-speakers refer to it as Die Schedelsche Weltchronik (Schedel's World History) in honour of its author.\n\nTwo Nuremberg merchants, Sebald Schreyer (1446–1503) and his son-in-law, Sebastian Kammermeister (1446–1520), commissioned the Latin version of the chronicle. They also commissioned George Alt (1450–1510), a scribe at the Nuremberg treasury, to translate the work into German. Both Latin and German editions were printed by Anton Koberger, in Nuremberg. The contracts were recorded by scribes, bound into volumes, and deposited in the Nuremberg City Archives. The first contract, from December, 1491, established the relationship between the illustrators and the patrons. Wolgemut and Pleydenwurff, the painters, were to provide the layout of the chronicle, to oversee the production of the woodcuts, and to guard the designs against piracy. The patrons agreed to advance 1000 \"gulden\" for paper, printing costs, and the distribution and sale of the book. A second contract, between the patrons and the printer, was executed in March, 1492. It stipulated conditions for acquiring the paper and managing the printing. The blocks and the archetype were to be returned to the patrons once the printing was completed.\nThe author of the text, Hartmann Schedel, was a medical doctor, humanist and book collector. He earned a doctorate in medicine in Padua in 1466, then settled in Nuremberg to practice medicine and collect books. According to an inventory done in 1498, Schedel's personal library contained 370 manuscripts and 670 printed books. The author used passages from the classical and medieval works in this collection to compose the text of Chronicle. He borrowed most frequently from another humanist chronicle, \"Supplementum Chronicarum\", by Jacob Philip Foresti of Bergamo. It has been estimated that about 90% of the text is pieced together from works on humanities, science, philosophy, and theology, while about 10% of the chronicle is Schedel's original composition.\n\nNuremberg was one of the largest cities in the Holy Roman Empire in the 1490s, with a population of between 45,000 and 50,000. Thirty-five patrician families comprised the City Council. The Council controlled all aspects of printing and craft activities, including the size of each profession and the quality, quantity and type of goods produced. Although dominated by a conservative aristocracy, Nuremberg was a center of northern humanism. Anton Koberger, printer of the \"Nuremberg Chronicle\", printed the first humanist book in Nuremberg in 1472. Sebald Shreyer, one of the patrons of the chronicle, commissioned paintings from classical mythology for the grand salon of his house. Hartmann Schedel, author of the chronicle, was an avid collector of both Italian Renaissance and German humanist works. Hieronymus Münzer, who assisted Schedel in writing the chronicle's chapter on geography, was among this group, as were Albrecht Dürer and Johann and Willibald Pirckheimer.\n\nThe \"Chronicle\" was first published in Latin on 12 July 1493 in the city of Nuremberg. This was quickly followed by a German translation on 23 December 1493. An estimated 1400 to 1500 Latin and 700 to 1000 German copies were published. A document from 1509 records that 539 Latin versions and 60 German versions had not been sold. Approximately 400 Latin and 300 German copies survived into the twenty-first century. The larger illustrations were also sold separately as prints, often hand-coloured in watercolour. Many copies of the book are coloured, with varying degrees of skill; there were specialist shops for this. The colouring on some examples has been added much later, and some copies have been broken up for sale as decorative prints.\n\nThe publisher and printer was Anton Koberger, the godfather of Albrecht Dürer, who in the year of Dürer's birth in 1471 ceased goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher. He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, eventually owning 24 printing presses and having many offices in Germany and abroad, from Lyon to Buda.\n\nThe chronicle is an illustrated world history, in which the contents are divided into seven ages:\n\nThe large workshop of Michael Wolgemut, then Nuremberg's leading artist in various media, provided the unprecedented 1,809 woodcut illustrations (before duplications are eliminated; see below). Sebastian Kammermeister and Sebald Schreyer financed the printing in a contract dated March 16, 1492, although preparations had been well under way for several years. Wolgemut and his stepson Wilhelm Pleydenwurff were first commissioned to provide the illustrations in 1487-88, and a further contract of December 29, 1491, commissioned manuscript layouts of the text and illustrations.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer was an apprentice with Wolgemut from 1486 to 1489, so may well have participated in designing some of the illustrations for the specialist craftsmen (called \"formschneiders\") who cut the blocks, onto which the design had been drawn, or a drawing glued. From 1490 to 1494 Dürer was travelling. A drawing by Wolgemut for the elaborate frontispiece, dated 1490, is in the British Museum.\n\nAs with other books of the period, many of the woodcuts, showing towns, battles or kings were used more than once in the book, with the text labels merely changed; one count of the number of original woodcuts is 645. The book is large, with a double-page woodcut measuring about 342 x 500mm. Only the city of Nuremberg is given a double-page illustration with no text. The illustration for the city of Venice is adapted from a much larger woodcut of 1486 by Erhard Reuwich in the first illustrated printed travel book, the \"Sanctae Perigrinationes\" of 1486. This and other sources were used where possible; where no information was available a number of stock images were used, and reused up to eleven times. The view of Florence was adapted from an engraving by Francesco Rosselli.\n\n"}

Pom Wonderful agreed to pay one million dollars for above-the-title billing (\"POM Wonderful Presents\"), though the full amount was contingent on the film grossing $10 million at the box office, selling a half-million downloads and DVDs, and generating 600 million media impressions.

For PHP, it is Plain Old PHP Object (POPO).\n\nThe POJO phenomenon has most likely gained widespread acceptance because of the need for a common and easily understood term that contrasts with complicated object frameworks.\n\nIdeally speaking, a POJO is a Java object not bound by any restriction other than those forced by the Java Language Specification; i.e. a POJO should not have to\nHowever, due to technical difficulties and other reasons, many software products or frameworks described as POJO-compliant actually still require the use of prespecified annotations for features such as persistence to work properly.\nThe idea is that if the object (actually class) was a POJO before any annotations were added, and would return to POJO status if the annotations are removed then it can still be considered a POJO. Then the basic object remains a POJO in that it has no special characteristics (such as an implemented interface) that makes it a \"Specialized Java Object\" (SJO or (sic) SoJO).\n\nA JavaBean is a POJO that is serializable, has a no-argument constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods that follow a simple naming convention. Because of this convention, simple declarative references can be made to the properties of arbitrary JavaBeans. Code using such a declarative reference does not have to know anything about the type of the bean, and the bean can be used with many frameworks without these frameworks having to know the exact type of the bean.\nThe JavaBeans specification, if fully implemented, slightly breaks the POJO model as the class must implement the Serializable interface to be a true JavaBean. Many POJO classes still called JavaBeans do not meet this requirement. Since Serializable is a marker (method-less) interface, this is not much of a burden.\n\nThe following shows an example of a JavaServer Faces (JSF) component having a bidirectional binding to a POJO's property:\n<h:inputText value=\"#{MyBean.someProperty}\"/>\nThe definition of the POJO can be as follows:\npublic class MyBean {\n\nBecause of the JavaBean naming conventions the single \"someProperty\" reference can be automatically translated to the \"getSomeProperty()\" (or \"isSomeProperty()\" if the property is of Boolean type) method for getting a value, and to the \"setSomeProperty(String)\" method for setting a value.\n\nAs designs using POJOs have become more commonly used, systems have arisen that give POJOs the full functionality used in frameworks and more choice about which areas of functionality are actually needed. In this model, the programmer creates nothing more than a POJO. This POJO purely focuses on business logic and has no dependencies on (enterprise) frameworks. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) frameworks then transparently add cross-cutting concerns like persistence, transactions, security, and so on.\n\nSpring was an early implementation of this idea and one of the driving forces behind popularizing this model.\n\nAn example of an EJB bean being a POJO:\n\n\nThe following shows a fully functional EJB bean, demonstrating how EJB3 leverages the POJO model:\npublic class HelloWorldService {\n\nAs given, the bean does not need to extend any EJB class or implement any EJB interface and also does not need to contain any EJB annotations. Instead, the programmer declares in an external XML file which EJB services should be added to the bean:\n<enterprise-beans>\n</enterprise-beans>\nIn practice, some people find annotations elegant, while they see XML as verbose, ugly and hard to maintain, yet others find annotations pollute the POJO model. \n\nThus, as an alternative to XML, many frameworks (e.g. Spring, EJB and JPA) allow annotations to be used instead of or in addition to XML. The following shows the same EJB bean as showed above but with an annotation added. In this case the XML file is no longer needed:\n@Stateless\npublic class HelloWorldService {\n\nWith the annotation as given above the bean isn't a truly pure POJO anymore, but since annotations are merely passive metadata this has far fewer harmful drawbacks compared to the invasiveness of having to extend classes and/or implement interfaces. Accordingly, the programming model is still very much like the pure POJO model.\n\n\nA Plain old Java Interface (POJI) is a basic form of Java interface and acceptable at points where more complex Java interfaces are not permitted.\n"}

{"id": "1272655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1272655", "title": "Pro-drop language", "text": "Pro-drop language\n\nA pro-drop language (from \"pronoun-dropping\") is a language in which certain classes of pronouns may be omitted when they are pragmatically or grammatically inferable (the precise conditions vary from language to language, and can be quite intricate). The phenomenon of \"pronoun-dropping\" is also commonly referred to as zero or null anaphora. In the case of pro-drop languages, null anaphora refers to the fact that the null position has referential properties, meaning it is not a null dummy pronoun. Pro-drop is only licensed in languages that have a positive setting of the pro-drop parameter, which allows the null element to be identified by its governor. In pro-drop languages with a highly inflected verbal morphology, the expression of the subject pronoun is considered unnecessary because the verbal inflection indicates the person and number of the subject, thus the referent of the null subject can be inferred from the grammatical inflection on the verb.\n\nEven though in everyday speech there are instances when who or what is being referred to can be inferred from context, non-pro-drop languages still require the pronoun. However, pro-drop languages allow those referential pronouns to be omitted, or be phonologically null. Among major languages, two of which might be called a pro-drop language are Japanese and Korean (featuring pronoun deletion not only for subjects, but for practically all grammatical contexts). Chinese, Slavic languages, and American Sign Language also exhibit frequent pro-drop features. In contrast, non-pro-drop is an areal feature of many northern European languages (see Standard Average European), including French, (standard) German, and English.\n\nSome languages might be considered only partially pro-drop in that they allow deletion of the subject pronoun. These null-subject languages include most Romance languages (French is an exception) as well as all the Balto-Slavic languages and to a limited extent Icelandic. Colloquial and dialectal German, unlike the standard language, are also partially pro-drop; they typically allow deletion of the subject pronoun in main clauses but not in subordinate clauses.\n\nThe term \"pro-drop\" stems from Noam Chomsky's \"Lectures on Government and Binding\" from 1981 as a cluster of properties of which \"null subject\" was one (for the occurrence of \"pro\" as a predicate rather than a subject in sentences with the copula see Moro 1997). \n\nThus, a one-way correlation was suggested between inflectional agreement (AGR) and empty pronouns on the one hand and between no agreement and overt pronouns, on the other. It is worth noting that in the classical version, languages which not only lack agreement morphology but also allow extensive dropping of pronouns—such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese—are not included, as is made clear in a footnote: \"The principle suggested is fairly general, but does not apply to such languages as Japanese in which pronouns can be missing much more freely.\" (Chomsky 1981:284, fn 47).\n\nThe term pro-drop is also used in other frameworks in generative grammar, such as in lexical functional grammar (LFG), but in a more general sense: \"Pro-drop is a widespread linguistic phenomenon in which, under certain conditions, a structural NP may be unexpressed, giving rise to a pronominal interpretation.\" (Bresnan 1982:384).\n\nThe empty category assumed (under government and binding theory) to be present in the vacant subject position left by pro-dropping is known as \"pro\", or as \"little pro\" (to distinguish it from \"big PRO\", an empty category associated with non-finite verb phrases).\n\nConsider the following examples from Japanese:\n\nThe words in bold in the English translations (\"it\" in the first line; \"I\", \"you\", and \"it\" in the second) appear nowhere in the Japanese sentences but are understood from context. If nouns or pronouns were supplied, the resulting sentences would be grammatically correct but sound unnatural. (Learners of Japanese as a second language, especially those whose first language is non-pro-drop like English or French, often supply personal pronouns where they are pragmatically inferable, an example of language transfer.)\n\nThe above-mentioned example from Japanese are readily rendered into Chinese:\n\nThough it is worthy to note that unlike Japanese, the inclusion of the dropped pronouns does not make the sentence sound unnatural.\n\nArabic is considered a null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:\n\nThe subject \"I\" above is easily inferable as the verb \"gör-mek\" \"to see\" is conjugated in the first person simple past tense form. The object is indicated by the pronoun \"seni\" in this case. Strictly speaking, pronominal objects are generally explicitly indicated, although frequently possessive suffixes indicate the equivalent of an object in English, as in the following sentence.\n\nIn this sentence, the object of the verb is actually the action of coming performed by the speaker (\"geldiğimi\" \"my coming\"), but the object in the English sentence, \"me\", is indicated here by the possessive suffix -im \"my\" on the nominalised verb. Both pronouns can be explicitly indicated in the sentence for purposes of emphasis, as follows:\n\nIn Swahili, both subject and object pronouns can be omitted as they are indicated by verbal prefixes.\n\nEnglish is considered a non-pro-drop language. Nonetheless, subject pronouns are almost always dropped in imperative sentences (e.g., \"Come here\"). In informal speech, pronouns may sometimes be dropped in other types of sentences, together with some other words, especially copulas and auxiliaries:\n\n\nIn speech, when pronouns are not dropped, they are more often reduced than other words in an utterance.\n\nRelative pronouns, provided they are not the subject, are often dropped in short restrictive clauses: \"That's the man [who] I saw.\"\n\nNote that the dropping of pronouns is generally restricted to very informal speech and certain fixed expressions, and the rules for their use are complex and vary among dialects and registers. A noted instance was the \"lived the dream\" section of George H. W. Bush's speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention.\n\nSubject pronouns can be often omitted in modern Greek. Example:\n\nMost Romance languages (with the notable exception of French) are often categorised as pro-drop too, most of them only in the case of subject pronouns. Unlike in Japanese, however, the missing subject pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the morphology of the verb, which inflects for person and number of the subject.\n\nIn Spanish, the verb is inflected for both person and number, thus expression of the pronoun is unnecessary because it is grammatically redundant. In the following example, the inflection on the verb \"ver,\" 'see', signals informal 2nd person singular, thus the pronoun is dropped. Similarly, from both the context and verbal morphology, the listener can infer that the second two utterances are referring to the log, so the speaker omits the pronoun that would appear in English as \"it.\" \n\nAlthough Spanish is a pro-drop language, not all grammatical contexts allow for a null pronoun. There are some environments that require an overt pronoun. In contrast, there are also grammatical environments that require a null pronoun. According to the \"Real Academia Española\", the expression or elision of the subject pronoun is not random. Rather there are contexts in which an overt pronoun is abnormal, while in other cases the overt pronoun is possible or even required.\n\nThe third person pronouns (\"él, ella, ellos\", \"ellas\") in most contexts can only refer to persons. Therefore, when referring to things (that are not people) an explicit pronoun is usually disallowed.\n\nSubject pronouns can be made explicit when used for a contrastive function or when the subject is the focus of the sentence. In the following example, the first person explicit pronoun is used to emphasize the subject.\n\nSubject pronouns can also be made explicit in order to clarify ambiguities that arise due to verb forms that are homophonous in the first person and third person. For example, in the past imperfect, conditional, and the subjunctive, the verb forms are the same for first person singular and third person singular. In these situations, using the explicit pronoun \"yo\" (1st person singular) or \"él, ella\" (3rd person singular) clarifies who the subject is, since the verbal morphology is ambiguous.\n\nExamples of omitted subject:\n\nOmission of object pronouns is likewise possible when the referent is clear, especially in colloquial or informal language:\n\nThe use of the object pronoun in these examples (\"aceitá-la\", \"comeu-o\") would be grammatical but rather unnatural, especially in Brazil.\n\nHere \"não me achou\" would also be possible.\n\nOmission of the object pronoun is possible even when its referent has not been explicitly mentioned, so long as it can be inferred. The next example might be heard at a store; the referent (a dress) is clear to the interlocutor. In both Brazilian and European Portuguese the pronoun is omitted.\n\n\"Modern\" Spanish and Portuguese are also notable amongst Romance languages because they have no specific pronouns for circumstantial complements (arguments denoting circumstance, consequence, place or manner, modifying the verb but not directly involved in the action) or partitives (words or phrases denoting a quantity of something). However, Medieval language had them, e.g. Portuguese \"hi\" and \"ende\".\n\nCompare the following examples in which Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, and Romanian have null pronouns for place and partitives, but Catalan, French, Occitan, and Italian have overt pronouns for place and partitive. \nCircumstantial complement denoting place\n\nPartitive denoting quantity\n\nAll Slavic languages behave in a similar manner to the Romance pro-drop languages. Example:\n\nHere \"he\" in the second sentence is inferred from context.\nIn the East Slavic languages even the objective pronoun \"его\" can be omitted in the present and future tenses (both imperfect and perfective). As with the Romance languages mentioned above, the missing pronoun is not inferred strictly from pragmatics, but partially indicated by the morphology of the verb (Вижу, Виждам, Widzę, Vidim, etc...). However, the past tense of both imperfective and perfective in modern East Slavic languages inflects by gender and number rather than the person due to the fact that the present tense conjugations of the copula \"to be\" (Russian \"быть\", Ukrainian \"бути\", Belorussian \"быць\") have practically fallen out of use. As such, the pronoun is often included in these tenses, especially in writing.\n\nIn Finnish, the verb inflection replaces first and second person pronouns in simple sentences, e.g. \"menen\" \"I go\", \"menette\" \"all of you go\". Pronouns are typically left in place only when they need to be inflected, e.g. \"me\" \"we\", \"meiltä\" \"from us\". There are possessive pronouns, but possessive suffixes, e.g. \"-ni\" as in \"kissani\" \"my cat\", are also used, as in \"Kissani söi kalan\" (\"my cat ate a fish\"). A peculiarity of colloquial Finnish is that the pronoun \"me\" (\"we\") can be dropped if the verb is placed in the passive voice (e.g. \"haetaan\", standard \"it is fetched\", colloquial \"we fetch\"). In the Estonian language, a close relative of Finnish, the tendency is less clear. It generally uses explicit personal pronouns in the literary language, but these are often omitted in colloquial Estonian.\n\nHungarian is also pro-drop, subject pronouns are used only for emphasis, as example \"(Én) mentem\" \"I went\", and because of the definite conjugation, object pronouns can be often elided as well; for example, the question \"(Te) láttad a macskát?\" \"Did (you) see the cat?\" can be answered with just \"láttam\" \"(I) saw (it)\", because the definite conjugation renders the object pronoun superfluous.\n\nModern Hebrew, like Biblical Hebrew, is a \"moderately\" pro-drop language. In general, subject pronouns must be included in the present tense. Since Hebrew has no verb forms expressing the present tense, the present tense is formed using the present participle (somewhat like English \"I am guarding\"). The participle in Hebrew, as is the case with other adjectives, declines only in grammatical gender and number (like the \"past\" tense in Russian), thus:\n\nSince the forms used for the present tense lack the distinction between grammatical persons, explicit pronouns must be added in the majority of cases.\n\nIn contrast, the past tense and the future tense the verb form is inflected for person, number, and gender. Therefore, the verb form itself indicates sufficient information about the subject. The subject pronoun is therefore normally dropped, except in third-person.\n\nMany nouns can take suffixes to reflect the possessor, in which case the personal pronoun is dropped. In daily modern Hebrew usage, inflection of nouns is common only for simple nouns, and in most cases, inflected possessive pronouns are used. In Hebrew, possessive pronouns are treated mostly like adjectives and follow the nouns which they modify. In biblical Hebrew, inflection of more sophisticated nouns is more common than in modern usage.\n\nSpanish, Italian, Catalan, Occitan and Romanian can elide subject pronouns only (Portuguese sometimes elides object pronouns as well), and they often do so even when the referent has not been mentioned. This is helped by person/number inflection on the verb. It has been observed that pro-drop languages are those with either rich inflection for person and number (Persian, Polish, Portuguese, etc.) or no such inflection at all (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.), but languages that are intermediate (English, French, etc.) are non-pro-drop.\n\nWhile the mechanism by which overt pronouns are more \"useful\" in English than in Japanese is obscure, and there are exceptions to this observation, it still seems to have considerable descriptive validity. As Huang puts it, \"Pro-drop is licensed to occur either where a language has full agreement, or where a language has no agreement, but not where a language has impoverished partial agreement.\"\n\nAmong the Indo-European and Dravidian languages of India, pro-drop is the general rule though many Dravidian languages do not have overt verbal markers to indicate pronominal subjects. Mongolic languages are similar in this respect to Dravidian languages, and all Paleosiberian languages are rigidly pro-drop.\n\nOutside of northern Europe, most Niger–Congo languages, Khoisan languages of Southern Africa and Austronesian languages of the Western Pacific, pro-drop is the usual pattern in almost all linguistic regions of the world. In many non-pro-drop Niger–Congo or Austronesian languages, like Igbo, Samoan and Fijian, however, subject pronouns do not occur in the same position as a nominal subject and are obligatory, even when the latter is present. In more easterly Austronesian languages, like Rapa Nui and Hawaiian, subject pronouns are often omitted even though no other subject morphemes exist. Pama–Nyungan languages of Australia also typically omit subject pronouns even when there is no explicit expression of the subject.\n\nMany Pama–Nyungan languages, however, have clitics, which often attach to nonverbal hosts to express subjects. The other languages of Northwestern Australia are all pro-drop, for all classes of pronoun. Also, Papuan languages of New Guinea and Nilo-Saharan languages of East Africa are pro-drop.\n\nAmong the indigenous languages of the Americas, pro-drop is almost universal, as would be expected from the generally polysynthetic and head-marking character of the languages. That generally allows eliding of all object pronouns as well as subject ones. Indeed, most reports on Native American languages show that even the emphatic use of pronouns is exceptionally rare. Only a few Native American languages, mostly language isolates (Haida, Trumai, Wappo) and the Oto-Manguean family are known for normally using subject pronouns.\n\nClassical Chinese exhibits extensive dropping not only of pronouns but also of any terms (subjects, verbs, objects, etc.) pragmatically inferable, giving a very compact character to the language. Note, however, that Classical Chinese was a written language, and such word dropping is not necessarily representative of the spoken language or even of the same linguistic phenomenon.\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on an earlier German encyclopedia, the Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche. \nLike the \"Realencyklopädie\", it focuses on Christianity from a primarily Protestant point of view.\nThe final edition, titled \"The New Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge\", was published\n1908–14 in 13 volumes, based on the third edition of the \"Realencyklopädie\" (1896—1909).\n\nThe \"Realencyklopädie\"'s publishing history was:\n\nThe \"Schaff-Herzog\"s publishing history was:\n\nChristian Classics Ethereal Library has digitized the work and made it available online. Logos Bible Software is also undertaking a digitization project of it.\n\nThe idea of translating \"Herzog\" in a slightly condensed form occurred to John Henry Augustus Bomberger, a minister of the German Reformed Church, and then president of Ursinus College, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and in 1856 he brought out in Philadelphia the first volume, whose title-page reads thus: \"The Protestant Theological and Ecclesiastical Encyclopedia: Being a Condensed Translation of Herzog’s Real Encyclopedia. With Additions from Other Sources. By Rev. J. H. A. Bomberger, D.D., Assisted by Distinguished Theologians of Various Denominations. Vol. I. Philadelphia: Lindsay & Blakiston, x 1856\". In this work he associated with himself twelve persons, all but one ministers. In 1860 he issued the second volume. But the American Civil War breaking out the next year put a stop to so costly an enterprise and it was never resumed. The first volume included the article \"Concubinage\", the second \"Josiah\". It had been issued in numbers, of which the last was the twelfth.\n\nIn 1877 Professor Philip Schaff (1819–93) was asked by Dr. Herzog himself to undertake an English reproduction of the second edition of his encyclopedia, and this work was fairly begun when, in the autumn of 1880, Clemens Petersen and Samuel Macauley Jackson were engaged to work daily on it in Dr. Schaff’s study in the Bible House, New York City. The next year Dr. Schaff’s son, the Rev. David Schley Schaff, later professor of church history in the Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny, Pa., joined the staff. The original publishers were S. S. Scranton & Company, Hartford, Conn., but a change was made before the issue of the first volume and the encyclopedia was issued by Funk & Wagnalls. The title-page read thus: \"A Religious Encyclopædia: or Dictionary of Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology. Based on the Real-Encyklopädie of Herzog, Plitt, and Hauck. Edited by Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., Professor in the Union Theological Seminary, New York. Associate editors: Rev. Samuel M. Jackson, M. A., and Rev. D. S. Schaff. Volume I. New York: Funk & Wagnalls, Publishers, 10 and 18 Dey Street\". The first volume was issued Wednesday, November 1, 1882, the second Thursday, March 1, 1883, and the third Tuesday, March 4, 1884. Volume I. had pp. xix. 1-847; volume II. pp. xvii. 848-1714; and volume III. pp. xix. 1715-2631. In November, 1886, a revised edition was issued and at the same time the \"Encyclopedia of Living Divines and Christian Workers of All Denominations in Europe and America, Being a Supplement to Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. Edited by Rev. Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., and Rev. Samuel Macauley Jackson, M. A. New York: Funk & Wagnalls, Publishers, 18 and 20 Astor Place, 1887\". In 1891 the third edition of the encyclopedia was issued and with it was incorporated the Encyclopedia of Living Divines, with an appendix, largely the work of Rev. George William Gilmore, bringing the biographical and literary notices down to December, 1890. The entire work was repaged sufficiently to make it one of four volumes of about equal size, and it is this four-volume edition which is known to the public as the \"Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia\", the volumes being respectively of pp. xlviii. 679 and four pages unnumbered; 680-1378; 1379-2086; iv. 2087-2629, viii. 296. As the German work at its base was overtaken by the time \"S\" had been reached, the \"Schaff-Herzog\" from that letter on was based on the first edition of \"Herzog\". Therefore, much of its matter is now very old. Yet it has been a useful work, and in 1903 its publishers determined on a new edition based on the third edition of \"Herzog\" which had been appearing since 1896. But inasmuch as there was a space of ten years between the beginnings of the two works, it has been necessary to bring the matter from the German down to date. This end has been accomplished by two courses: first by securing from the German contributors to \"Herzog\" condensations of their contributions, in which way matter contributed to the German work has in many instances been brought down to date, and second by calling on department editors for supplementary matter.\n\n\"The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopædia of Religious Knowledge\" followed the previous editions. The points of similarities were:\nThe points of dissimilarity were:\n\n\"The new Schaff-Herzog encyclopedia of religious knowledge, embracing Biblical, historical, doctrinal, and practical theology and Biblical, theological, and ecclesiastical biography from the earliest times to the present day.\" edited by Samuel MacAuley Jackson (Volumes 2 to 12 have abbreviated title which vary slightly; volume 13 is an Index volume, it was edited by George William Gilmore).\n"}
{"id": "231033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231033", "title": "Sex manual", "text": "Sex manual\n\nSex manuals are books which explain how to perform sexual practices; they also commonly feature advice on birth control, and sometimes on safe sex and sexual relationships.\n\nIn the Graeco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by\nPhilaenis of Samos, possibly a hetaira (courtesan) of the Hellenistic period (3rd–1st century BC). Preserved by a series of fragmentary papyruses which attest its popularity, it served as a source of inspiration for Ovid's \"Ars Amatoria\", written around 3 BC, which is partially a sex manual, and partially a burlesque on the art of love.\n\nThe \"Kama Sutra\" of Vatsyayana, believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual, although only a small part of its text is devoted to sex. It was compiled by the Indian sage Vatsyayana sometime between the second and fourth centuries CE. His work was based on earlier Kamashastras or \"Rules of Love\" going back to at least the seventh century BCE, and is a compendium of the social norms and love-customs of patriarchal Northern India around the time he lived. Vatsyayana's \"Kama Sutra\" is valuable today for his psychological insights into the interactions and scenarios of love, and for his structured approach to the many diverse situations he describes. He defines different types of men and women, matching what he terms \"equal\" unions, and gives detailed descriptions of many love-postures.\n\nThe \"Kama Sutra\" was written for the wealthy male city-dweller. It is not, and was never intended to be, a lover's guide for the masses, nor is it a \"Tantric love-manual\". About three hundred years after the \"Kama Sutra\" became popular, some of the love-making positions described in it were reinterpreted in a Tantric way. Since Tantra is an all-encompassing sensual science, love-making positions are relevant to spiritual practice.\n\nThe earliest East Asian sex manual is the \"Su Nü Jing\". Probably written during the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), the work was long lost in China itself, but preserved in Japan as part of the medical anthology \"Ishinpō\" (984). It is a Daoist text purporting to describe how one might achieve long life and immortality by manipulating the yin and yang forces of the body through sexual techniques, which are described in some detail.\n\nMedieval sex manuals include the lost works of Elephantis, by Constantine the African; \"Ananga Ranga\", a 12th-century collection of Hindu erotic works; and \"The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation\", a 16th-century Arabic work by Sheikh Nefzaoui. The fifteenth-century \"Speculum al foderi\" (The Mirror of Coitus) is the first medieval European work to discuss sexual positions. Constantine the African also penned a medical treatise on sexuality, known as \"Liber de coitu\". The medieval Jewish physician and writer Maimonides is author of a \"Treatise on Cohabitation.\"\n\nDespite the existence of ancient sex manuals in other cultures, sex manuals were banned in Western culture for many years. What sexual information was available was generally only available in the form of illicit pornography or medical books, which generally discussed either sexual physiology or sexual disorders. The authors of medical works went so far as to write the most sexually explicit parts of their texts in Latin, so as to make them inaccessible to the general public (see Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\" as an example).\n\nA few translations of the ancient works were circulated privately, such as \"The Perfumed Garden\"….\n\nIn the late 19th Century, Ida Craddock wrote many serious instructional tracts on human sexuality and appropriate, respectful sexual relations between married couples. Among her works were \"The Wedding Night\" and \"Right Marital Living\". In 1918 Marie Stopes published \"Married Love\", considered groundbreaking despite its limitations in details used to discuss sex acts.\n\nTheodoor Hendrik van de Velde's book \"Het volkomen huwelijk\" \"(The Perfect Marriage)\", published in 1926, was well known in Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Estonia. In Germany, \"Die vollkommene Ehe\" reached its 42nd printing in 1932 despite its being placed on the list of forbidden books, the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, by the Roman Catholic Church. In Sweden, \"Det fulländade äktenskapet\" was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s. In English, has 42 printings in its original 1930 edition, and was republished in new editions in 1965 and 2000.\n\nDavid Reuben, M. D.'s book \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\", published in 1969, was one of the first sex manuals that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s. Although it did not feature explicit images of sex acts, its descriptions of sex acts were detailed, addressing common questions and misunderstandings Reuben had heard from his own patients. Most notably, Reuben dismissed popular medical-psychiatric notions of \"vaginal\" vs. \"clitoral\" orgasm, explaining exactly how female physiology works.\n\n\"The Joy of Sex\" by Dr. Alex Comfort was the first visually explicit sex manual to be published by a mainstream publisher. It was followed by \"The Joy of Gay Sex\" and \"The Joy of Lesbian Sex\". Its appearance in public bookstores in the 1970s opened the way to the widespread publication of sex manuals in the West. As a result, hundreds of sex manuals are now available in print.\n\nSex manuals and works of the sort became so popular during the sexual revolution of the 1970s that even religious groups developed their own manuals. Most notably, the book \"The Act of Marriage\" by Christian Baptist authors Tim and Beverly LaHaye has sold over 2.5 million copies. While they began with the prerequisite of a heterosexual, complementarian relationship, the behavior they suggested went far beyond standard Christian teaching at that time. They suggested role play, experimentation with sex devices, masturbation to ensure climax and many other practices that were considered taboo up until the 1970s in protestant bedrooms. Other manuals such as Marabel Morgan's The Total Woman emphasized the importance of the female orgasm. While they all required marriage, heterosexuality and complementarianism, they did push the bounds of accepted practice within their respective spheres of influence. Today, Christian authors continue to produce similar manuals and guides to their constituents in search of appropriate, fulfilling behavior. Books such as Mark and Grace Driscoll's Real Marriage encourage Christians to experiment in the bedrooms with their spouses, even encouraging acts that have long been rejected by protestant tradition such as anal sex.\n\nOne of the currently most well known in America is \"The Guide to Getting it On!\" by Paul Joannides. Now in its seventh edition, it has won several prestigious awards and been translated into 12 foreign languages since appearing in 1996.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1636476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1636476", "title": "Strix (mythology)", "text": "Strix (mythology)\n\nThe strix (plural striges or strixes), in the mythology of classical antiquity, was a bird of ill omen, the product of metamorphosis, that fed on human flesh and blood. It also referred to witches and related malevolent folkloric beings.\n\nThe \"strix\" is described as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, greyish white wings, and hooked claws in Ovid's \"Fasti\". This is the only thorough description of the strix in Classical literature. Elsewhere, it is described as being dark-colored.\n\nThe \"strīx\" () was a nocturnally crying creature which positioned its feet upwards and head below, according to a pre-300 BC Greek origin myth. It is probably meant to be (and translated as) an owl, but is highly suggestive of a bat which hangs upside-down.\n\nThe \"strix\" in later folklore was a bird which squirted milk upon the lips of (human) infants. Pliny in his \"Natural History\" dismissed this as nonsense and remarked it was impossible to establish what bird was meant by this. The same habit, where the strix foul-smellingly lactates onto an infant's lips is mentioned by Titinius, who noted the placement of a garlic on the infant was the prescribed amulet to ward against it.\n\nIn the case of Ovid's \"striges\", they threatened to do more harm than that. They were said to disembowel an infant and feed on its blood. Ovid allows the possibilities of the \"striges\" being birds of nature, or products of magic, or transformations by witches using magical incantations.\n\nAccording to Antoninus Liberalis's \"Metamorphoses\", the \"strīx\" () was a metamorphosis of Polyphonte; she and her bear-like sons Agrios and Oreios were transformed into birds as punishment for their cannibalism. Here the strix is described as (a bird) \"that cries by night, without food or drink, with head below and tips of feet above, a harbinger of war and civil strife to men\".\n\nThe tale only survives in the form as recorded by Antonius who flourished 100-300 AD, but it preserved an older tale from the lost \"Ornithologia\" by Boios, dated to before the end of 4th century BC.\n\nIn this Greek myth, the ill-omened \"strīx\" herself did not perpetrate harm on humans. But one paper suggests guilt by association with her sons, and seeks to reconstruct an ancient Greek belief in the man-eating \"strīx\" dating back to this age (4th century BC). In an opposing view, one study failed to find the ancient Greeks subscribing to the \"strīx\" as a \"terror\" to mankind, but noted a widespread belief in Italy that it was a \"bloodthirsty monster in bird form.\" This study surmises that the Greeks later borrowed the concept of \"strix\" as witches, a concept articulated in Ovid, and one scholar estimates the Greeks adopted the \"strix\" as \"child-murdering horrors\" by the \"last centuries BC\". The modern Greek form may betray an influence of a Latin diminutive \"strigula\".\n\nThe first Latin allusion is in Plautus's comedy \"Pseudolus\" dated to 191 BC, in which an inferior cook's cuisine is metaphorized as the \"striges\" (\"vampyre owls\") devouring the diners' gastrointestinal organs while still alive, and shortening their life-span. Commentators point to this as attestation that the \"striges\" were regarded as man-eating (anthropophagism).\n\nIn Ovid's \"Fasti\" (8 AD) were the \"striges\" as already described, that targeted legendary king Procas in his cradle. The assault was detected and interrupted but left the infant with scars on his cheeks and discoloration of his skin complexion. A ritual to keep the \"striges\" away from the newborn prince was subsequently performed by the nymph Cranae (or goddess Carna), who owned a wand of whitethorn (\"spina\") given her by Janus, which could expel evil from all doors.\n\nPetronius's novel \"Satyricon\" (Late 1st century AD) includes a tale told by the character Trimalchio, describing the \"striges\" that snatched away the body of a boy who had already died, substituting it with a straw doll. The striges made their presence known by their scream, and a manservant attending to the intrusion discovered a woman and ran her through with a sword so that she groaned, but his whole body turned livid and would die a few days later.\n\nPliny's comment that \"[\"strix\"].. employed in maledictions\" signified that its name invoked in \"potent\" magic curses according to one interpretation, but it may have only been used as curse-word, reflecting its regard as an accursed creature.\n\nThere are several examples of the strix's plumage, etc. said to be used as an ingredient in magic. Horace in his \"Epodes\", wrote that the strix's feathers are an ingredient in a love potion, as has his contemporary Propertius. Medea's rejuvenating concoction which she boiled in a cauldron used a long list of ingredients, including the \"strix\"′s wings.\n\nThe \"striges\" also came to mean \"witches\". One paper speculates that this meaning is as old as the 4th century BC, on the basis that in the origin myth of Boios, various names can be connected to the Macedonia-Thrace region well known for witches. But more concrete examples occur in Ovid's \"Fasti\" (early 1st century AD) where the \"striges\" as transformations of hags is offered as one possible explanation, and Sextus Pompeius Festus (fl. late 2nd century) glossed as \"women who practice witchcraft\" \"(\"maleficis mulieribus\")\" or \"flying women\" (\"witches\" by transference)\n\nThere are \"striges\", vultures and \"bubo\" owls which cry in the marshes in Hades, by the edge of Tartarus according to Seneca the Younger's tragedy \"Hercules Furens\". Also, according to the legend of Otus and Ephialtes, they were punished in Hades by being tied to a pillar with snakes, with a strix perched on that column.\n\nThe legend of the strix survived into the Middle Ages, as recorded in Isidore's \"Etymologiae\". In the 7-8th century John of Damascus equated the \"stiriges\" (Greek plural: ) with the \"gelloudes\" (pl. of \"gelllo\") in his entry \"Perī Stryggōn )\". He wrote that they sometimes had corporeal bodies and wearing clothing, and sometimes appeared as spirits.\n\nThe Latin term \"striga\" in both name and sense as defined by Medieval lexicographers in was in use throughout central and eastern Europe.\n\n\"Strega\" (obviously derived from Latin \"striga\") is the Italian term for \"witch\", and in Romanian \"strigăt\" means 'scream', \"strigoaică\" is the name of the Romanian feminine vampire, and \"strigoi \"is the Romanian male vampire. Both can scream loudly, especially when they become poltergeists - a trait they have in common with the banshees. \"Strigăt\" is also the Romanian name of the barn owl and of the death's-head hawkmoth.\n\n\nPrimary sources\n\nSecondary sources\n"}

Her doctoral thesis, defended in 1987 and published by Rodopi in 1998, consists of a description of the Spanish fascist aesthetic system and the analysis of its progressive dissolution in postwar literary criticism. Specializing in literary theory, she has written books such as \"Introducción a la historia de las teorías literarias\" (1991) and \"Teoría de la literatura y de la interpretación literaria\" (2008).\n\nIn 1995 she began a line of research on the theater of García Lorca, a subject on which she continues to work today. In 1995 her book \"Lenguaje y literatura\" was released, in which she talks with the main representatives of the linguistic turn and hermeneutic skepticism. In 2000 she presented her hypothesis on the innocence of Josef K. in \"The Trial\", which she developed extensively in the book \"Kafka y la tragedia judía\" (2003). The hermeneutic discussion contained in this book is continued in more recent publications such as \"El problema de la interpretación literaria.

In Indonesian mythology, a Sundel Bolong is a mythical ghost from the archipelago which is a woman with beautiful long hair and a long white dress (her form is similar to Kuntilanak). The myth is closely linked to prostitutes, meaning a \"prostitute with a hole in her\", in reference to the large hole which is said to appear in her back.\n\nThe name \"sundel bolong\" derives from the physical appearance of the ghost. The word \"sundel\" which means \"prostitute\" or \"whore\" and \"bolong\" in Javanese which literally means \"hole.\" Modern folklore studies believe that the myth was developed in Java culture to deter prostitution that developed during the Dutch East Indies colonization.\n\nIn folklore, Sundel Bolong is the soul of a woman who died when she was pregnant outside of marriage and therefore gave birth in her grave, or who died during childbirth and the baby came out from her back (this is the reason why the hole was created in her back) which is concealed from men by her long black hair. \n\nVictims of Sundel Bolong spirit mainly consists of men and children.

R. R. Tolkien between 1920 and 1942 for his children, from Father Christmas. They were released posthumously by the Tolkien estate on 2 September 1976, the 3rd anniversary of Tolkien’s death. They were edited by Baillie Tolkien, second wife of his youngest son, Christopher. The book was warmly received by critics, and it has been suggested that elements of the stories inspired parts of Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe stories are told in the format of a series of letters, told either from the point of view of Father Christmas or his elvish secretary. They document the adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and his helpers, including the North Polar Bear and his two sidekick cubs, Paksu and Valkotukka. The stories include descriptions of the massive fireworks that create the northern lights and how Polar Bear manages to get into trouble on more than one occasion.\n\nThe 1939 letter has Father Christmas making reference to the Second World War, while some of the later letters feature Father Christmas' battles against Goblins which were subsequently interpreted as being a reflection of Tolkien's views on the German Menace.\n\nThe letters themselves were written over a period of over 20 years to entertain Tolkien's children each Christmas. Starting in 1920 when Tolkien's oldest son was aged three, each Christmas Tolkien would write a letter from Father Christmas about his travels and adventures. Each letter was delivered in an envelope, including North Pole stamps and postage marks as designed by Tolkien.\n\nPrior to publication, an exhibition of Tolkien's drawings was held at the Ashmolean Museum. These included works from \"The Hobbit\", \"Lord of the Rings\", and \"The Father Christmas Letters\". The first edition was by Allen and Unwin on 2 September 1976, three years after Tolkien's death. The Houghton Mifflin edition was released later that year on 19 October. It was the third work by Tolkien to be released posthumously, after a collection of poems and the \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\". Edited by Baillie Tolkien, the second wife of Christopher Tolkien, it includes illustrations by Tolkien for nearly all the letters; however, it omitted several letters and drawings.\n\nWhen the book was republished in 1999 it was retitled \"Letters from Father Christmas\" and several letters and drawings not contained in the original edition were added. One edition in 1995 featured the letters and drawings contained in individual envelopes to be read in the manner they were originally conceived to be.\n\nThe reception to the first two works published posthumously had been warm, which was subsequently thought to be due to Tolkien's recent death. The response to \"The Father Christmas Letters\" was much more measured and balanced. Jessica Kemball-Cook suggested in her book \"Twentieth Century Children's Writers\" that it would become known as a classic of children's literature, while Nancy Willard for \"The New York Times Book Review\" also received the book positively, saying \"Father Christmas lives. And never more merrily than in these pages.\" In 2002, an article in \"The Independent on Sunday\" described the work as rivalling \"\"The Lord of the Rings\" for sheer imaginative joy\".\n\nPaul H. Kocher, whilst writing for the journal \"Mythprint\", suggested that the creatures in \"The Father Christmas Letters\" may have been a precursor to those which appeared in Tolkien's later works such as the \"Lord of the Rings\", a view which was shared by Laurence and Martha Krieg in a review in the journal \"Mythlore\" (issue #14). For example, the 1933 letter features an attack on Polar Bear by a band of goblins. The Kriegs suggested that the wizard Gandalf may have been developed from Father Christmas.\n\n\n"}
