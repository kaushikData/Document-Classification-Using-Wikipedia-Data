{"id": "50619431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50619431", "title": "American immigrant novel", "text": "American immigrant novel\n\nAn American immigrant novel is a genre of American fiction novel which explores the process of assimilation and the relationship American immigrants have towards American identity and ideas. The novels often show and explore generational differences in immigrant families, especially the first and second generations. The extraordinary ethnic diversity of America allows for a type of immigrant novel which differs from other countries. America, often seen as a country of immigrants, opens up a unique canvas for expression and a better understanding of the american immigrant experience through literature. The narrative styles are diverse and can include memoirs, third person, first person, and biographies. The past twenty-five years alone have witnessed a major scholarly emphasis on multiculturalism in American studies, and a flood of new immigrant novels, reflecting the shifting demographics of United States immigration patterns.\n\nGenerational changes of attitude, identity, experience and demographics from real statistics are challenged and explored by immigrant novels, such as the change in income level and attitudes towards assimilation.\n\nIn these novels the immigrant experience often begins with a feeling of wild, open-ended adventure, as the protagonists make the move to the US and leave their previous homes halfway around the world. However once they arrive in America, the immigrant family often finds themselves in an unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming and introverted culture. Tensions appear within and without the family and manifest themselves in problems at work, with health, or strained family relationships.\n\nParents tend to retain their culture from their home country while their children, the second generation are fully assimilated americans who understand american culture and become the guides for their parents. Then often in this pattern the third generation, the grandkids of the original immigrants return to a fascination with their heritage and their grandparent’s culture. Recent research highlights the complexity of immigrant generations and their increases and declines in socioeconomic integration, and this genre of novel explores this complex theme. Age at the time of arrival, family relationships, and economic status all interact to create a diverse genre of novel, dealing with types of questions such as when the immigrants behind to consider themselves american, and when parents and children will end up switching roles as the younger caretaker and the older, but seemingly helpless beneficiary.\n\nThe powerful mother is a common pivotal figure in immigrant fiction, just as the sensitive child, torn between this matriarchal authority and a weaker, less adaptive father, often assumes the book’s central consciousness. Paule Marshall’s \"Brown Girl, Brownstones\" (1959), certainly fits the pattern, with its tense mother-daughter duo, Silla and Selina. Silla is the archetypal strong Barbadian woman who will scrub floors, work day and night, and save every penny to own someday a piece of America, a brownstone house, even if it means crushing her husband’s island-returning dreams in the process. Selena, her articulate, precocious daughter, seeks her own individual identity, with or without the approval of the community. (It is worth noting how many immigrant novels fit this \"Bildungsroman\" pattern of tracing the moral, psychological, and intellectual development of a youthful main character: The émigré group’s inexperience in the new country and the young protagonist’s viewpoint seem to dovetail nicely.) Marshall’s vivid, earthy prose thrillingly depicts the speech and singular folkways of the Barbadian colony, both its strivers and the idlers, as it re-roots itself in a Brooklyn ghetto.\n\n"}

{"id": "6497668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6497668", "title": "Banderia Prutenorum", "text": "Banderia Prutenorum\n\nThe Banderia Prutenorum is a manuscript of 48 parchment sheets, 18.6 by 29.3 cm (7.3 by 11.5 inches), composed by Jan Długosz and illuminated by Stanisław Durink, listing 56 \"vexillae\", or banners, of the Order of the Teutonic Knights. The title means \"Blazons of the Prussians\". \"Prutenorum\" is the genitive plural of \"Pruteni\", Prussians.\n\nIn Polish the name is \"Chorągwie Pruskie\". \"Chorągwie\" can mean \"banner\", \"standard\", or \"regiment\". The heraldic term blazon in English is probably the exact meaning.\n\nThe work describes the gonfalons, or battle flags, collected from the field after the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 AD. This battle was a major confrontation between the Teutonic Order and the allied forces of Poles and Lithuanians, whom the Order was trying to conquer. At that time, the Order had succeeded in subjecting or eliminating the western Balts, including the Prussians; however, the Teutonic Knights were decisively defeated by the joint forces of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania under the command of the Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło.\n\nAt the end of the battle, the major officers of the Order lay dead on the field beside the standards under which they had fought. Some units escaped with their standards. The Banderia does not describe all the order's flags. The flags were collected and stored at Wawel Cathedral in Cracow. They are known to have been there in 1603, after which they disappeared. They have been recreated, starting in the 1900. In October 2009, as part of the preparations for the battle's anniversairy, Polish scholars and artists in Kraków have finished reconstructing all known standards.\n\nIt was probably the Polish historian, Jan Długosz, who commissioned the painter, Stanisław Durink of Cracow, to illustrate the flags in 1448. Długosz then wrote the Latin descriptions. The work thus has the format of a catalog, with an illumination and Latin entry for each flag.\n\nThe flag is decorated with a heraldic blazon identifying the \"comturia\", or district, from which the soldiers of that unit came. The blazon might appear in any circumstances, such as in a coat of arms or on a shield, or in any conspicuous place. Its function was that of identification. The rules of heraldry were undoubtedly followed.\n\nThe title raises a few questions of language and society. In it a Polish scholar and historian is calling the conquerors of the Prussians by that very name, even though at the beginning of their conquest they found the name odious to them. Old Prussian speakers still lived in substantial numbers in east Prussia. As they were not excluded from military service, some must have fought for the order, and yet they are not distinguished from the Germans in any way.\n\n\"Banderium\" is in origin neither Latin nor Polish, but comes from the Germanic. The place names also are in their Germanic forms rather than their Polish ones. Why Długosz, a Polish historian, chose to use the Germanicized Prussian Latin is not clear.\n\nBy some miracle, the manuscript survived World War II, even though it was given to Malbork castle by the Nazis for political purposes. After the war it showed up at a London auction house and was brought to its current location in the library of Jagiellonian University.\n\nIn the scholarly Latin of manuscript terminology, a \"recto\" page is \"on the right side\". The \"verso\" or \"turned side\" (the other side of the page) is therefore a left-hand page. This terminology has nothing to do with Długosz.\n\nDurink states the width (\"latitudo\") and length (\"longitudo\") of each flag in units he calls \"ulne\" (classical \"ulnae\"). These must be cubits rather than ells; i.e., one \"ulna\" is 18 inches by today's standard ell. The flags are generally longer than they are wide.\n\nPage 1 recto bears the following introduction:\nPro libraria universitatis studii Cracouiensis datum per dominum Johannem Dlugosch.

In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of \"difference\" versus \"equality\" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.\n\nDifference feminism did not require a commitment to essentialism. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise \"essential\" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called \"ways of knowing\"), or personality traits. These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued \"feminine\" characteristics.\n\nSome strains of difference feminism, for example Mary Daly's, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's. This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.\n\nDifference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as \"equality feminism\"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally. Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women \"whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men\".\n\nDifference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer Elise Oelsner, which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see ethics of care]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase \"difference feminism\" in a way that asks \"what difference does feminism make?\" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than \"what differences are there between men and women\"?\n\nSome have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist Carol Gilligan and radical feminist theologian Mary Daly, is \"essentialist.\" In philosophy essentialism is the belief that \"(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties.\" In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that \"women\" and \"men\" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of \"essentialism\" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence, and do not accurately reflect Gilligan or Daly's views.\n\n"}

Einstein's visit to give the Rhodes Lectures, and also to receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Oxford University on 23 May 1931, was hosted by the physicist Frederick Lindemann. Einstein's first lecture was on relativity, the second on cosmology, and the third on unified field theory. All the lectures were delivered in German. A brief report of the second lecture was given in \"The Times\" and in \"Nature\". A summary of all three lectures can be found in the Archives of the Oxford Museum for the History of Science.\n\nThe blackboard was rescued with another by dons (including the chemist E. J. Bowen, zoologist Gavin de Beer, and historian of science Robert Gunther) and formally donated by the Warden of Rhodes House, Sir Francis James Wylie. The writing on the blackboard, although ephemeral in nature, is of historic interest because the equations displayed are taken from a model of the universe proposed by Einstein in May 1931 known as The Friedmann-Einstein universe. The last three lines on the blackboard are estimates of the density of matter in the universe \"ρ\", the radius of the universe \"P\" and the timespan \"t\" of the expansion of the universe respectively (\"L.J.\" on the blackboard indicates \"light years\" in German). It has recently been shown that these estimates contain a systematic numerical error.\n\nThe blackboard is considered a \"mutant\" object or artefact in that it is very different from most of the objects in the collection of the museum (mainly scientific instruments such as astrolabes). A second blackboard used by Einstein during the lecture is also in the collection of the Museum of the History of Science, but is not on display. However it is of less interest because it was wiped clean after the lecture.\n\nEinstein returned to Oxford again in 1932 and 1933 before he settled at Princeton University in the United States for the rest of his life.\n\nIt has recently been pointed out that the equations on the Oxford blackboard are taken directly from a key paper on relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in April 1931 and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science on May 9 of that year. The paper, known as The Friedmann-Einstein universe, is of historic significance because it constituted the first scientific publication in which Einstein embraced the possibility of a cosmos of time-varying radius. In the paper, Einstein adopts Alexander Friedman’s 1922 analysis of relativistic models of a universe of time-varying radius and positive curvature, but sets the cosmological constant to zero, declaring it redundant, predicting a universe that expands and contracts over time. (The work is sometimes known as the Friedman-Einstein model of the universe). With the use of Edwin Hubble’s observations of a linear redshift/distance relation for the spiral nebulae, Einstein extracts from his model estimates of \"ρ\" ~ 10 g/cm, \"P\" ~ 10 light-years and \"t\" ~ 10 years for the density of matter, the radius of the cosmos and the timespan of the cosmic expansion respectively. These values are displayed in the last three lines on the Oxford blackboard (although the units of measurement are not specifically stated for the density estimate, cgs units are implied by the other calculations).\n\nIt has also been noted that the numerical estimates of cosmic parameters in Einstein’s 1931 paper – and on the blackboard – contain a systematic error. Analysis of the 1931 paper shows that, given the contemporaneous Hubble constant of 500 km sMpc, Einstein's estimates of cosmic density, radius and timespan should have been \"ρ\" ~ 10 g/cm, \"P\" ~ 10 light-years and \"t\" ~ 10 years respectively. One line on the blackboard, not included in the published paper, makes the nature of Einstein's error clear. In the fourth line on the blackboard, Einstein obtains a value of 10 cm for the quantity \"D\", defined in the top line of the blackboard as \"D\" = (1/c). (1/P).(dP/dt), i.e., the Hubble constant divided by the speed of light. Simple calculation shows that the contemporaneous value of the Hubble constant in fact implied a value of \"D\" ~ 10 cm (or 10 m) for this quantity. It appears that Einstein stumbled in converting megaparsecs to cm, giving a density of matter that was too high by a factor of a hundred, a cosmic radius that was too low by a factor of ten, and a timespan for the expansion that was too high by a factor of ten. These errors were corrected in a later review of relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in 1945.\n\nA blackboard used by Einstein in a public lecture at the University of Nottingham on 6 June 1930 was also preserved after the lecture and is now in the university's archives.\n\n"}

Released in October 2004, the work is the result of a ten-year collaboration between the Newberry Library and the Chicago Historical Society. It exists in both a hardcover print edition and an online format, known as the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago. The print edition is 1117 pages and includes 1400 entries, 2000 biographical sketches, 250 significant business enterprise descriptions, and hundreds of maps. Initially, the internet edition included 1766 entries, 1000 more images and sources.\n\nThe concept was fueled by other regional encyclopedias that had met with commercial success in 1980s and 1990s. Eventually, the vision to create the book found initial financing from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The book was well received and became a bestseller during the 2004 Christmas season following its October 2004 release. The following May the \"Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago\" was released. Northwestern University joined the Newberry Library/Chicago Historical Society collaboration to publish the internet edition. The internet edition was the second of its kind for a U.S. city.\n\nIndividual entries were compiled by historians, graduate assistants and authors. Most contributors were professors. About 600 people contributed entries at a rate of $.10/per word. The contributors consulted reliable secondary sources, such as newspapers, to compile historical accounts. The book was edited by James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and Janice L. Reiff. At the time, Grossman was the vice president for research and education at the Newberry Library and visiting professor of history at the University of Chicago. Keating was a professor of history at North Central College. Reiff was an associate professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nUnlike resource compilation efforts for the cities that inspired this encyclopedia, the work was not bounded by the city limits. Instead, every suburb was provided an entry, as were each of Chicago's 77 official community areas. Entries ranged from 50 to 4000 words long. Eventually, the coverage of the subject matter expanded to include Southwest Michigan and Northwest Indiana. Newberry Library describes the work as \"one of the most significant historical projects undertaken in the last twenty years\".\n\nInspired by encyclopedia compilation efforts of cities such as New York City, Indianapolis and Cleveland, Keating approached the Newberry Library in 1991 to strategize on how to best to study and teach Chicago history. Eventually she and Grossman agreed to prepare a funding request from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Their initial proposal was declined, but after working with Grossman to refine the specifics of their proposal, the NEH accepted their idea. The book venture was originally announced in 1994 as a project funded by a NEH US$200,000 ($ today) grant. The grant also included a $300,000 challenge grant to be met by Newberry Library for the first three years of work. The original plan was to publish a hardcover book by 2001 and then to follow with what at the time was referred to vaguely as \"hypermedia\" in reference to possible internet and CD-ROM auxiliary products. After Grossman and Keating obtained the initial grant, Reiff, a computer technology expert, and encyclopedia veteran Carol J. Summerfield all became part of the team. The editors sought the advice of Chicago-area librarians who were organized into focus groups to determine the proper components for the planned publication. The editors also organized into task forces of experts in dozens of specialized fields. Early on they sought the expertise of University of Chicago cartographer Michael P. Conzen, who helped develop 56 original maps. Conzen is credited as the cartographic editor.\n\nBy 1997, the text had taken shape and the plan was that the average biographical entry would be 150 words. The longest biographical entries, about 450 words, were written for former Chicago Mayors Harold Washington and Richard J. Daley. Neither Richard M. Daley nor Michael Jordan had entries because only notable deceased persons were included. By 1998, the editors had settled on the table of contents and begun the job of assigning, editing, fact-checking and re-editing the hundreds of entries, some of them as long as 4000 words. By March 2000, 1100 of the targeted 1400 entries were completed. Also, the growth of the internet had clarified the vision of an online version of the print edition. In 2000, the final volume was expected to be 1300 pages set for release in fall 2002. The internet version was expected the following year. By June 2001, nearly 1300 of the entries had been submitted and a third had been edited and reviewed for accuracy. The effort had become a $2.5 million effort and was aspiring towards the success of earlier encyclopedic efforts projecting a fall 2003 publication of a 1.3-million-word 1300-page edition. At this time, the final electronic form available through the Chicago Historical Society had been conceptualized.\n\nBy 2001, two editions of \"The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History\" (1987) had sold 24,000 copies; \"The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis\" (1994) had sold 9000 copies and \"The Encyclopedia of New York City\" (1995) had sold 70,000 (50,000 in its first year). Hardcover versions of these works had sold for $59.95 and up. The commercial success of these other regional encyclopedias made it clear that there is a market for such products. Several university presses released regional encyclopedic publications in 2004. In April, Rutgers University Press published \"The Encyclopedia of New Jersey\". In September, the University of Nebraska Press published \"Encyclopedia of the Great Plains\". In October, the University of Chicago Press released \"The Encyclopedia of Chicago\". Additionally, Yale University Press was scheduled to publish both \"Encyclopedia of New England\" and the second edition of \"The Encyclopedia of New York City\".\n\nUsing press releases from the Copley News Service, the book was widely publicized throughout the state of Illinois, and it was even reviewed by \"The Wall Street Journal\". When first published in 2004, the book was on the \"USA Today\" recommended Christmas gifts list. That year it was at the top of the Chicago area bestseller lists at bookstores during the Christmas holiday season. Major funding for the $65 list price four-color print version of the publication, which cost $1.7 million in the end, was provided by the NEH, the MacArthur Foundation, the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois.\n\nAt the time of the print release, the online version, known as the \"Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago\", was being developed to include additional features, which relied on hyperlinks, that were not available in the print edition. At the time, it was expected to be released by the Chicago Historical Society in April 2005. On May 11, the Electronic edition, which cost nearly $1 million to create and is continuously available for free to the public, was released. It included hundreds of additional entries (bringing the total to 1766), more than 1000 additional images, video of historic figures and events, and extensive primary source material. The online version includes 1000 more sources than the print edition. The Web site includes many tables and maps that date to the 19th Century. Northwestern University media specialists developed the Web architecture for the electronic version. The electronic edition made Chicago the second major U.S. city (following Cleveland) with an extensive Internet encyclopedia dedicated to its history and its release was covered by newspapers throughout the Midwest. The extra features of the online edition would have required 10,000 pages to produce in print-edition format. Initially, the online edition was a static version, but updates and adjustments were planned.\n\n\"USA Today\"' referred to it as a good coffee table book. \"Chicago Tribune\" journalist Rick Kogan describes this as a massive undertaking with the natural foibles of the human element in it selections and accuracy, and by nature of its attempt to serve as a historical compilation an immediately dated product due to the dynamic nature of the city. However, he feels it is sure to amaze its audience. A \"Chicago Sun-Times\" reviewer describes it as a scholarly product that is \"easily the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published\". \"The State Journal-Register\", the Springfield, Illinois newspaper, reviewers complain that downstate cities and regions are neglected in the book. A \"Daily Herald\" review describes it as a book accurately \"billed as the city's most definitive historical reference book\". The \"Peoria Journal Star\" notes that although there are complaints about omissions and underserved topics, the online version should quell the demands for further knowledge.\n\nThe online version was noted for its \"large number of tables and maps that date to the 19th Century\" by the \"Chicago Tribune\". Dubuque, Iowa's \"Telegraph Herald\" newspaper and Indiana's \"Post-Tribune\" referenced an Associated Press press release that described the online version as a compilation assembled \"with more than Chicagoans in mind\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" described the online version as an extension of \"the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published\" that is unlimited by physical bounds.\n\n\"Journal of American History\" along with the website History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web published a review by University of Southern California professor Philip J. Ethington that spoke glowingly about both versions of the encyclopedia describing it as \"one of the finest collective works (with 633 listed authors) of North American historical scholarship of our era\". They praised it for its breadth and coherence. The online version was noted for its meticulous hyperlinking. The online review was cursory in the sense that it did not realize the expansion of the online version. However, the review notes that the online version provides \"powerful and substantive\" interactive resources that are not possible in the print edition. The review is especially respectful of the cartographic contributions, which it describes in detail. It dismisses the alphabetical structure of the online version as an unnecessary complication. The review also complains about biographical omissions that necessitate extensive navigation to related articles. The review felt some of the online foibles left open the possibility that the production might get overshadowed by future ventures that leverage the electronic possibilities more fully.\n\n\"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" reviewed the \"Encyclopedia\" along with several of its peers and mentioned early in the review that the advent of online encyclopedias makes the works much easier to correct and update. However, the availability of online encyclopedias diminished the significance of the print editions according to the review because it made gifting them less significant and it reduced sales at libraries. The review also noted that the online approach is becoming so successful that the state of Georgia has produced the online-only \"New Georgia Encyclopedia\", which started as a 300-article venture and has blossomed to a 1300-article work. However, they noted that when the \"Encyclopedia of Chicago\" was first released that the local media supported the book; some Chicago disc jockeys read passages from it on air. It enjoyed successful marketing as both a popular gift item and a must-have for local historians.\n\nThe encyclopedia is composed of 1117 pages that feature over 1400 entries by more than 600 contributors. Additionally, it includes 442 maps, more than 400 vintage photographs, over 250 sketches of \"historically significant business enterprises\", a dictionary of Chicago-area businesses, a biographical dictionary and a 21-page timeline that traces the history of Chicago from 1630 to 2000.\n\nThe 1400-entry main alphabetical section of the \"Encyclopedia\" covers all Chicago neighborhoods, suburbs, and ethnic groups as well as the major cultural institutions. Topics covered include technology and science, architecture, religions, immigration, transportation, business history, labor, music, health and medicine. It is considered the most geographical diverse city encyclopedia of its kind because it fully encompasses the suburbs in eight of the region's counties. 386 thumbnail maps of neighborhoods and municipalities are complemented by 400 black-and-white photographs plus hundreds of color photographs and thematic maps. There are separate lengthy interpretive essays woven into the alphabetical section on topics such as the built environment, literary images of Chicago, and the city's sports culture. The Encyclopedia includes a 2000-entry comprehensive biographical dictionary and a detailed listing of approximately 250 of the city's historically significant business enterprises. A color insert features a timeline of Chicago history and photo essays exploring nine pivotal years in this history. The photo essays feature the city’s urban art and artifacts.\n\n"}

Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is an example of deforestation, a program optimization strategy. A related type of function is a metamorphism, which is a catamorphism followed by an anamorphism.\n\nA hylomorphism formula_1 can be defined in terms of its separate anamorphic and catamorphic parts.\n\nThe anamorphic part can be defined in terms of a unary function formula_2 defining the list of elements in formula_3 by repeated application (\"unfolding\"), and a predicate formula_4 providing the terminating condition.\n\nThe catamorphic part can be defined as a combination of an initial value formula_5 for the fold and a binary operator formula_6 used to perform the fold.\n\nThus a hylomorphism\nmay be defined (assuming appropriate definitions of formula_8 & formula_9).\n\nAn abbreviated notation for the above hylomorphism is formula_10.\n\nLists are common data structures as they naturally reflect linear computational processes. These processes arise in repeated (iterative) function calls. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to generate a temporary list of intermediate results before reducing this list to a single result.\n\nOne example of a commonly encountered hylomorphism is the canonical factorial function.\n\nIn the previous example (written in Haskell, a purely functional programming language) it can be seen that this function, applied to any given valid input, will generate a linear call tree isomorphic to a list. For example, given \"n\" = 5 it will produce the following:\n\nIn this example, the anamorphic part of the process is the generation of the call tree which is isomorphic to the list codice_1. The catamorphism, then, is the calculation of the product of the elements of this list. Thus, in the notation given above, the factorial function may be written formula_11 where formula_12 and formula_13.\n\nHowever, the term 'hylomorphism' does not apply solely to functions acting upon isomorphisms of lists. For example, a hylomorphism may also be defined by generating a non-linear call tree which is then collapsed. An example of such a function is the function to generate the \"n\" term of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nThis function, again applied to any valid input, will generate a call tree which is non-linear. In the example on the right, the call tree generated by applying the codice_2 function to the input codice_3.\n\nThis time, the anamorphism is the generation of the call tree isomorphic to the tree with leaf nodes codice_4 and the catamorphism the summation of these leaf nodes.\n\n\n"}

For a system of order \"k\" (the number of time lags in discrete time, or the order of the largest derivative in continuous time) and dimension \"n\" (that is, with \"n\" different evolving variables, which together can be denoted by an \"n\"-dimensional coordinate vector), generally \"nk\" initial conditions are needed in order to trace the system's variables forward through time. \n\nIn both differential equations in continuous time and difference equations in discrete time, initial conditions affect the value of the dynamic variables (state variables) at any future time. In continuous time, the problem of finding a closed form solution for the state variables as a function of time and of the initial conditions is called the initial value problem. A corresponding problem exists for discrete time situations. While a closed form solution is not always possible to obtain, future values of a discrete time system can be found by iterating forward one time period per iteration, though rounding error may make this impractical over long horizons.\n\nA linear matrix difference equation of the homogeneous (having no constant term) form formula_1 has closed form solution formula_2 predicated on the vector formula_3 of initial conditions on the individual variables that are stacked into the vector; formula_3 is called the vector of initial conditions or simply the initial condition, and contains \"nk\" pieces of information, \"n\" being the dimension of the vector \"X\" and \"k\" = 1 being the number of time lags in the system. The initial conditions in this linear system do not affect the qualitative nature of the future behavior of the state variable \"X\"; that behavior is stable or unstable based on the eigenvalues of the matrix \"A\" but not based on the initial conditions.\n\nAlternatively, a dynamic process in a single variable \"x\" having multiple time lags is \n\nHere the dimension is \"n\" = 1 and the order is \"k\", so the necessary number of initial conditions to trace the system through time, either iteratively or via closed form solution, is \"nk\" = \"k\". Again the initial conditions do not affect the qualitative nature of the variable's long-term evolution. The solution of this equation is found by using its characteristic equation formula_6 to obtain the latter's \"k\" solutions, which are the characteristic values formula_7 for use in the solution equation\n\nHere the constants formula_9 are found by solving a system of \"k\" different equations based on this equation, each using one of \"k\" different values of \"t\" for which the specific initial condition formula_10 Is known.\n\nA differential equation system of the first order with \"n\" variables stacked in a vector \"X\" is\n\nIts behavior through time can be traced with a closed form solution conditional on an initial condition vector formula_3. The number of required initial pieces of information is the dimension \"n\" of the system times the order \"k\" = 1 of the system, or \"n\". The initial conditions do not affect the qualitative behavior (stable or unstable) of the system.\n\nA single \"k\" order linear equation in a single variable \"x\" is\n\nHere the number of initial conditions necessary for obtaining a closed form solution is the dimension \"n\" = 1 times the order \"k\", or simply \"k\". In this case the \"k\" initial pieces of information will typically not be different values of the variable \"x\" at different points in time, but rather the values of \"x\" and its first \"k\" – 1 derivatives, all at some point in time such as time zero. The initial conditions do not affect the qualitative nature of the system's behavior. The characteristic equation of this dynamic equation is formula_14 whose solutions are the characteristic values formula_15 these are used in the solution equation\n\nThis equation and its first \"k\" – 1derivatives form a system of \"k\" equations that can be solved for the \"k\" parameters formula_17 given the known initial conditions on \"x\" and its \"k\" – 1 derivatives' values at some time \"t\".\n\nNonlinear systems can exhibit a substantially richer variety of behavior than linear systems can. In particular, the initial conditions can affect whether the system diverges to infinity or whether it converges to one or another attractor of the system. Each attractor, a (possibly disconnected) region of values that some dynamic paths approach but never leave, has a (possibly disconnected) basin of attraction such that state variables with initial conditions in that basin (and nowhere else) will evolve toward that attractor. Even nearby initial conditions could be in basins of attraction of different attractors (see for example Newton's method#Basins of attraction).\n\nMoreover, in those nonlinear systems showing chaotic behavior, the evolution of the variables exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions: the iterated values of any two very nearby points on the same strange attractor, while each remaining on the attractor, will diverge from each other over time. Thus even on a single attractor the precise values of the initial conditions make a substantial difference for the future positions of the iterates. This feature makes accurate simulation of future values difficult, and impossible over long horizons, because stating the initial conditions with exact precision is seldom possible and because rounding error is inevitable after even only a few iterations from an exact initial condition.\n\n"}

He is now best known for launching the eponymous \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" in 1864, the year after he retired from first-class cricket.\n\nWisden was born in Crown Street, Brighton. His father, William, was a builder. He attended Brighton's Middle Street School (formerly the Royal Union School, founded as a charity school in 1805). He moved to London after his father died, and lived with the wicket-keeper Tom Box.\n\nIn July 1845, aged 18, only 5 ft 6 in and weighing just , he made his first-class debut for Sussex against MCC, taking 6 wickets in the first innings and three in the second. He joined the All-England Eleven in 1846, moving allegiance to the United All-England Eleven in 1852. He was engaged to marry George Parr's sister Annie in 1849, but she died before the wedding, and he never married.\n\nInitially a fast roundarm bowler, before overarm bowling was permitted, his pace slowed in later years so he bowled medium pace; he also bowled slow underarm. While bowling fast, he took on average nearly 10 wickets in each game. In 1850, when he was playing for the South against the North at Lord's, his off-cutter technique won him 10 wickets in the second innings, all clean bowled (still the only instance of all ten wickets being taken \"bowled\" in any first-class match). He was also a competent batsman, and scored two first-class centuries, the first, exactly 100, against Kent at Tunbridge Wells in 1849, and in 1855 he notched up 148 against Yorkshire, the only first-class century scored in 1855.\n\nHe played almost all of his cricket in England, mostly for Sussex, but once for Kent and thrice for Middlesex. He travelled with a touring team led by George Parr to Canada and the US in 1859, where eight matches in Montreal, Hoboken, Philadelphia, Hamilton and Rochester were won easily.\n\nOf moderate height, he was nicknamed the \"Little Wonder\" after the winner of The Derby in 1840, and later the \"Cardinal\". He was said to be the best all-rounder of his day. In all, he took 1,109 first-class wickets with a bowling average of 10.32. He scored 4,140 first-class runs with a batting average of 14.12, an average which was very good for the time.\n\nWisden began a cricket-equipment business in Leamington Spa in 1850 and five years later opened a \"cricket and cigar\" shop in Coventry Street near The Haymarket in central London, in partnership with Fred Lillywhite until 1858. He was also the cricket coach at Harrow School from 1852 to 1855, and owned \"The Cricketers\", a public house at Duncton in Sussex.\n\nHe retired from cricket in 1863 at the relatively early age of 37 as a result of rheumatism, and started publishing his annual \"Cricketers' Almanack\" the following year. He also published in \"Cricket and How to Play It\" in 1866. In retirement he developed his business into a manufacturer and retailer of equipment for many sports, not just cricket. The shop moved to Cranbourn Street near Leicester Square in 1872.\n\nAfter his death the business grew into a major international sports brand, receiving a Royal Warrant in 1911 as \"Athletic Outfitters to the King\". The business went into receivership in 1939, and was acquired in 1943 by a Co-operative society, which sold it on to Grays of Cambridge in 1970. Grays then ceased to use Wisden as an equipment brand, but re-established John Wisden & Co as the publisher of the \"Cricketers' Almanack\". It is now an imprint of Wisden's owner, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.\n\nWisden died of cancer, at the age of 57, in the flat above his Cranbourn Street shop (next to Leicester Square tube station).

Three years later, in 1916, he became a stockbroker and earned $168,000 that year. A shrewd investor, he sold off his Wall Street investments two months before the collapse of 1929, realizing $4 million in cash. Hirshhorn made his fortune in the mining and oil business. In the 1930s, he focused much of his attention on gold and uranium mining prospects in Canada, establishing an office in Toronto in 1933.\n\nIn the 1950s, he and geologist Franc Joubin were primarily responsible for the \"Big Z\" uranium discovery in northeastern Ontario and the subsequent founding of the city of Elliot Lake. Hirshhorn Avenue, a residential street in that city, is named after him. By 1960, when he sold the last of his uranium stock, he had made over $100 million in cash from the uranium business.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1976, Hirshhorn lived in a three-story Norman chateau in a estate at the summit of Round Hill, a rise in north-central Greenwich, Connecticut, with a view of the Manhattan skyline. \n\nWhen Hirshhorn began to make money, he began to buy art, both paintings and sculpture. He amassed a collection of paintings and sculptures from the 19th and 20th centuries. Applying himself seriously to the study of art, he would question dealers, critics, and curators, and visit artists in their studios. He made quick decisions on buying a piece. \"If you've got to look at a picture a dozen times before you make up your mind\", he once said, \"there's something wrong with you or the picture\".\n\nHirshhorn graced his Greenwich mansion with paintings by Willem de Kooning, Raphael Soyer, Jackson Pollock, Larry Rivers, and Thomas Eakins, and the grounds outside with sculptures by Auguste Rodin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Alberto Giacometti, Alexander Calder, Richard Bernstein (artist), and Henry Moore. He allowed many nonprofit groups to use tours of his sculpture garden for fundraising.\n\nIn 1966 Hirshhorn donated much of his collection, consisting of 6,000 paintings and sculptures from the 19th and 20h centuries (and constituting one of the world's largest private art treasures), to the United States government, along with a $2 million endowment. The Smithsonian Institution established the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., in 1966 to hold the collection; the museum opened in 1974. At Hirshhorn's death in 1981, he willed an additional 6,000 works and a $5 million endowment to the museum.\n\nHis business dealings in Canada were not without controversy. He was investigated by the Ontario Securities Commission, convicted twice of breaking Canadian foreign exchange laws, deported from Canada for illegal stock manipulation (which he later appealed and won by having himself declared a landed immigrant), and fined for an illegal securities sale and illegally smuggling cash out of Canada.\n\nHirshhorn's first wife was Jennie Berman. They were married in 1922 and separated in 1941. They had four children, daughters Robin Gertrude (b. 1923), Gene Harriet (b. 1926), and Naomi Caryl (b. 1931), and son Gordon (b. 1929). He was married to portraitist and book illustrator Lily Harmon from 1947–1956. The couple adopted two daughters, Amy (b. 1948) and Jo Ann (b. 1951). Hirshhorn's third wife was named Brenda Hawley Heide. In 1964 he married his fourth wife, Olga Hirshhorn (nee Zatorsky). He remained married to her until his death in 1981\n</ref>.\n\n"}

{"id": "56774442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56774442", "title": "Music collections in Prato", "text": "Music collections in Prato\n\nBeginning with the recognition of musical collections in Prato conducted by the Center of Musical Documentation of Tuscany, it is possible to trace a synthesis of the history of the citizen’s musical production. \nFollowing a chronological path linked to the most important musical subjects in Prato - institutions, composers and interpreters - and studying the handwritten and printed music brought to us, we were able to delineate a historical and cultural itinerary of the pratese musical life. \nThe most antique musical collections of the city of Prato are the “pergamenacei” (made of parchment) liturgical book of the fourteenth century of Chapter origin, which are now preserved at the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. \nThe fourteenth-century cappella left little trace and merged with the new one, established in 1535. Beginning in 1981, a great deal of musical material of the latter institution belongs to the Archivio Storico Diocesano (Historical Diocesan Archive), in which there are many sources regarding its activities, as in the Archivio del Capitolo della Cattedrale (Archive of the Chapter in the Cathedral).\nThe cappella saw rotations of Kappellmeister such as Giovanni Francesco Beccatelli (1679-1734), Giuseppe Becherini (1758-1840), Augusto Borgioli (1821-1879), Luigi Borgioli (1864-1939) whose works are conserved in the Historical Archive of the Cappella of the Duomo, together with the works of the most performed artists of the different time periods (Giovan Carlo Maria Clari, Nicola Benvenuti, Giuseppe Gherardeschi). In 1981, The Historical Diocesan Archive also gathered the materials of 61 parishes together, which is preserved today in the Archives of the parishes. There are many chorals and sacred music, manuscripts and printed, that cover a vast period of time, from the fourteenth century to the twentieth century. \nThe activities of the chapel were sided with the production of secular music, which left traces mostly beginning in the eighteenth century.\nThe Cicognini Boarding School has manuscripts of the performances staged by the boarders from 1780 until 1870, including comic operas and dance music from Mozart to Zandonai. Starting in 1842, the group «Concerto Cittadino Edoardo Chiti», of which the archive conserves a large amount of music of various genres used in their frequent concerts; and at the end of the eighteenth century, the choir «Guido Monaco» was formed, which has a musical archive consisting of a large amount of printed edition vocal music.\n\nThese institutions represented the musical vocation of the citizens for over a century, offering an example of one of the most important civil musical activities in Tuscany, to which many talented composers contributed. In the 19th century Cesare Ciardi, Attilio Ciardi, Attilio Nuti were active in Prato, and whose autographs are spread throughout the institutions in Prato. The personal archive of Attilio Ciardi is preserved in the Music School «Giuseppe Verdi», which today inherits the civil musical vocation that had inspired the Chiti Band and the «Guido Monaco» Choir. The 1900s saw the revival of the sacred production with the organist of the Cathedral, Guido Guasti, whose documents (especially those regarding the years between 1939 and 1947) are in the Historic Diocesan Archive, with the reopening of the Cappella in 1951, whose materials (printed sacred music in modern editions) are today in the Church of San Francesco, but above all with the activities of the secular composers who most influenced the musical possessions of Prato the 20th century. Dante Nuti, Giovanni Castagnoli, and especially Luciano Bettarini, one of the most important musicians of the 20th century, worked in Prato. What they left behind is preserved in the Historic Diocesan Archive and in great part, in their personal collections at the Music School «Giuseppe Verdi», which possesses also the enormous collections, of recordings and music, of some Pratese collectionists.\nIn 1969, the «Guido Monaco» Choir founded their children’s choir, and promoted of a competition for the citizens in which music by Nino Rota was also performed. Today this is preserved in the archive of the choir. Books dedicated to musical subjects (some of which come from the antique cappella of the 16th century) are in Roncioniana Library, in the Teatro Metastasio, and in the Salvi Cristiani Collection at the State Archive.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "346264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346264", "title": "Résumé", "text": "Résumé\n\nA résumé or resume is a document used by a person to present their backgrounds and skills. Résumés can be used for a variety of reasons, but most often they are used to secure new employment.\n\nA typical résumé contains a \"summary\" of relevant job experience and education, as its French origin implies. The résumé is usually one of the first items, along with a cover letter and sometimes an application for employment, which a potential employer sees regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an interview.\n\nThe curriculum vitae (CV) used for employment purposes in the UK (and in other European countries) is more akin to the résumé—a shorter, summary version of one's education and experience—than to the longer and more detailed CV that is expected in U.S. academic circles.\n\nGenerally, the résumé is substantially shorter than a CV in English Canada, the U.S. and Australia.\n\nIn South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, biodata is often used in place of a résumé.\n\nAs has been indicated above, the word résumé comes from the French word meaning \"summary\". Leonardo da Vinci is credited with the first résumé, though his \"résumé\" takes the form of a letter written about 1481–1482 to a potential employer, Ludovico Sforza. For the next roughly 450 years, the résumé continued to be a mere description of a person, and included their abilities and past employment. In the early 1900s, résumés listed things like weight, height, marital status, and religion. It was not until 1950 that the résumé evolved into something more than words written on scraps of paper. By then, résumés were considered very much mandatory, and started to include information like personal interests and hobbies. It was not until the 1970s, the beginning of the Digital Age, that résumés took on a more professional look in terms of presentation and content.\n\nIn many contexts, a résumé is typically limited to one or two pages of size A4 or letter-size, highlighting only those experiences and qualifications that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. Many résumés contain keywords or skills that potential employers are looking for via applicant tracking systems, make heavy use of active verbs, and display content in a flattering manner. Acronyms and credentials after the applicant's name should be spelled out fully in the appropriate section of the résumé, greater chance of being found in a computerized keyword scan. Résumés can vary in style and length, but should always contain accurate contact information of the job seeker. A recent hiring simulation by ResumeGo concluded that a two-page resume was more likely to lead to being hired than a one-page resume.\n\nA résumé is a marketing tool in which the content should be adapted to suit each individual job application or applications aimed at a particular industry. The transmission of résumés directly to employers became increasingly popular as late as 2002. Job seekers were able to circumvent the job application process and reach employers through direct email contact and résumé blasting, a term meaning the mass distribution of résumés to increase personal visibility within the job market. However, the mass distribution of résumés to employers can often have a negative effect on the applicant's chances of securing employment as the résumés tend not to be tailored for the specific positions the applicant is applying for. It is usually, therefore, more sensible to optimize the résumé for each position applied for and its keywords. In order to keep track of all experiences, keeping a 'master résumé' document is recommended, providing job-seekers with the ability to customize a tailored résumé while making sure extraneous information is easily accessible for future use if needed.\n\nThe complexity or simplicity of various résumé formats tends to produce results varying from person to person, for the occupation, and to the industry. Résumés or CVs used by medical professionals, professors, artists and people in other specialized fields may be comparatively longer. For example, an artist's résumé, typically excluding any non-art-related employment, may include extensive lists of solo and group exhibitions.\n\nRésumés may be organized in different ways. The following are some of the more common résumé formats:\n\nA reverse chronological résumé lists a candidate's job experiences in chronological order, generally covering the previous 10 to 15 years. Positions are listed with starting and ending dates. Current positions on a résumé typically list the starting date to the present. The reverse chronological résumé format is most commonly used by those who are not professional résumé writers. In using this format, the main body of the document becomes the Professional Experience section, starting from the most recent experience and moving chronologically backwards through a succession of previous experience. The reverse chronological résumé works to build credibility through experience gained, while illustrating career growth over time and filling all gaps in a career trajectory. A chronological résumé is not recommended to job seekers with gaps in their career summaries. In the United Kingdom the chronological résumé tends to extend only as far back as the applicant's GCSE/Standard Grade qualifications.\n\nA functional résumé lists work experience and skills sorted by skill area or job function.\n\nThe functional résumé is used to focus on skills that are specific to the type of position being sought. This format directly emphasizes specific professional capabilities and utilizes experience summaries as its primary means of communicating professional competency. In contrast, the chronological résumé format will briefly highlight these competencies prior to presenting a comprehensive timeline of career growth through reverse chronological listings, with the most recent experience listed first. The functional résumé works well for those making a career change, having a varied work history or with little work experience. A functional résumé is also preferred for applications to jobs that require very specific skills or clearly defined personality traits. A functional résumé is a good method for highlighting particular skills or experiences, especially when those particular skills or experiences may have derived from a role which was held some time ago. Rather than focus on the length of time that has passed, the functional résumé allows the reader to identify those skills quickly.\n\nThe hybrid résumé balances the functional and chronological approaches. A résumé organized this way typically leads with a functional list of job skills, followed by a chronological list of employers. The hybrid has a tendency to repeat itself and is, therefore, less widely used than the other two.\n\nAs the search for employment has become more electronic, it is common for employers to only accept résumés electronically, either out of practicality or preference. This has changed much about the manner in which résumés are written, read, and processed. Some career experts are pointing out that today a paper-based résumé is an exception rather than the rule.\n\nMany employers now find candidates' résumés through search engines, which makes it more important for candidates to use appropriate keywords when writing a résumé. Larger employers use Applicant Tracking Systems to search, filter, and manage high volumes of résumés. Job ads may direct applicants to email a résumé to a company or visit its website and submit a résumé in an electronic format.\n\nMany employers, and recruitment agencies working on their behalf, insist on receiving résumés in a particular file format. Some require Microsoft Word documents, while others will only accept résumés formatted in HTML, PDF, or plain ASCII text.\n\nAnother consideration for electronic résumé documents is that they are parsed with natural language processors. Résumé parsers may correctly interpret some parts of the content of the résumé but not other parts. The best résumé parsers capture a high percentage of information regarding location, names, titles, but are less accurate with skills, industries and other less structured or rapidly changing data. Résumés written in a standard format are more likely to be correctly interpreted by résumé parsers, and thereby may make the candidate more findable.\n\nOne advantage for employers to online résumés is the significant cost saving compared to traditional hiring methods. Another is that potential employers no longer have to sort through massive stacks of paper.\n\nAs the Internet becomes more driven by multimedia, job-seekers have sought to take advantage of the trend by moving their résumés away from the traditional paper and email media.\n\nVideo, infographic, and even Vine résumés have gained popularity, though mainly in the creative and media industries.\n\nThis trend has attracted criticism from human resources management professionals, who warn that this may be a passing fad and point out that multimedia-based résumés may be overlooked by recruiters whose workflow is designed only to accommodate a traditional résumé format.\n\nMany résumé development agencies offer résumé evaluation services wherein they evaluate the résumé and suggest any necessary changes. Candidates are free to either do those changes themselves or may take help of the agency itself. Some career fields include a special section listing the lifelong works of the author: for computer-related fields, the softography; for musicians and composers, the discography; for actors, a filmography.\n\nKeeping résumés online has become increasingly common for people in professions that benefit from the multimedia and rich detail that are offered by an HTML résumé, such as actors, photographers, graphic designers, developers, dancers, etc. Job seekers are finding an ever-increasing demand to have an electronic version of their résumé available to employers and professionals who use Internet recruiting. Online résumé distribution services have emerged to allow job seekers to distribute their résumés to numerous employers of their choice through email.\n\nIn some sectors, particularly in the startup community, use of traditional résumé has seen a consistent decline. While standalone résumés are still used to apply for jobs, job-seekers may also view their résumés as one of a number of assets which form their personal brand and work together to strengthen their job application. In this scenario, résumés are generally used to provide a potential employer with factual information (e.g., achievements), while the social media platforms give insight into the job-seekers' motivations and personality in development.\n\n\n"}

He has been cited by a number of peers and fans as the greatest in-ring performer in history.\nMichaels wrestled consistently for WWE, formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from 1988 until his first retirement in 1998. He held non-wrestling roles from 1998 to 2000 and resumed wrestling in 2002 until retiring ceremoniously in 2010, before being assigned as a trainer in 2016 and returning for one match in 2018.\n\nIn the WWF/WWE, Michaels headlined major pay-per-view events between 1989 and 2010, closing the company's flagship annual event, WrestleMania, five times. He was the co-founder and original leader of the successful stable, D-Generation X. Michaels also wrestled in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), where he founded The Midnight Rockers with Marty Jannetty in 1985. After winning the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice, the team continued to the WWF as The Rockers and had a high-profile breakup in January 1992. Within the year, Michaels twice challenged for the WWF Championship and won his first Intercontinental Championship, heralding his arrival as one of the industry's premier singles stars.\n\nMichaels is a four-time world champion, having held the WWF Championship three times and WWE's World Heavyweight Championship once. He is also a two-time Royal Rumble winner (and the first man to win the match as the number one entrant), the first WWF Grand Slam Champion and the fourth WWF Triple Crown Champion, as well as a WWE Hall of Fame class of 2011 inductee. Michaels won the \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" \"Match of the Year\" reader vote a record eleven times, and his match against John Cena on April 23, 2007 was ranked by WWE as the best match ever aired on the company's flagship \"Raw\" program.\n\nHickenbottom was born on July 22, 1965 in Chandler, Arizona. The last of four children – Randy, Scott, and Shari are his older siblings – he was raised in a military family and spent a brief part of his early years in Reading, Berkshire, England, but grew up in San Antonio, Texas. As a child, Hickenbottom disliked the name Michael, so his family and friends just called him Shawn. Ever since, he has been referred to as Shawn. Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military.\n\nHe knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was not for him. He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.\n\nHickenbottom began to train under Mexican professional wrestler Jose Lothario. During his training, Hickenbottom adopted the ring name, \"Shawn Michaels\". After his training with Lothario, he debuted as Shawn Michaels with the National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) Mid-South Wrestling territory on October 16, 1984, against Art Crews, losing to Crews via swinging neckbreaker. Michaels' performance in his debut match impressed many veterans, including Terry Taylor.\n\nIn January 1985, he debuted for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), the NWA territory in Dallas, Texas. In April 1985, Michaels went to work for another NWA territory in Kansas City called Central States Wrestling. There, he and tag team partner Marty Jannetty defeated The Batten Twins for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, later losing it back to the Battens.\n\nAfter leaving Kansas City, he returned to Texas to wrestle for Texas All-Star Wrestling (TASW). During his time with TASW, Michaels replaced Nick Kiniski in the American Breed tag team, teaming with Paul Diamond. Michaels and Diamond were awarded the TASW Tag Team Championship by Chavo Guerrero Sr. The team was later renamed American Force. While in TASW, Michaels and Diamond feuded with Japanese Force.\n\nMichaels made his national-level debut, as Sean Michaels, at the age of 20 in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), in a victory over Buddhakhan on ESPN. He was once again teamed with Marty Jannetty, billed as The Midnight Rockers. The Midnight Rockers won the AWA World Tag Team Championship, defeating Doug Somers and Buddy Rose.\n\nIn 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). They were fired from WWF two weeks later, for a bar incident (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography). They then returned to AWA, where they won the AWA tag team titles for a second time, but were re-signed by WWF a year later.\n\nThe Rockers redebuted at a WWF live event on July 7, 1988. Due to WWF chairman Vince McMahon's desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive ring names, Michaels and Jannetty were renamed, as simply The Rockers. The team proved popular with both children and women and was a mid-card stalwart of television and pay-per-view shows for the next two years. During this time, Michaels headlined his first pay-per-view for the WWF when The Rockers were involved in the 4-on-4 Survivor Series match main event of the 1989 Survivor Series.\n\nOn October 30, 1990, The Rockers unofficially won the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), as Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company. The match was taped with The Rockers winning the title, but soon after Neidhart came to an agreement with management and was rehired. The championship was returned to the Hart Foundation, while the title change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on television (though The Rockers did actually have a successful title defence on November 3, 1990 against Power and Glory (Hercules and Paul Roma) before the title was returned to the Hart Foundation). When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed turnbuckle in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broke, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match. The Rockers continued their partnership, eventually splitting on December 2, 1991 during an incident on Brutus Beefcake's televised \"Barber Shop\" talk show promotional segment. Michaels superkicked Jannetty and threw him through a glass window on the set of Beefcake's talk show. Jannetty returned to the WWF the following year and enjoyed moderate success before leaving the company in 1994, while Michaels became a prominent villain of the early to mid-1990s as \"The Boy Toy\".\n\nAt the suggestion of Curt Hennig, Michaels adopted the nickname \"The Heartbreak Kid\". Along with his new name came a new gimmick as a vain, cocky villain. He was put together with mirror-carrying manager, Sensational Sherri, who according to the storyline had become infatuated with him. Sherri even sang the first version of his new theme music, \"Sexy Boy\". During that period, after Michaels had wrestled his scheduled match at live events, his departure was announced with \"Shawn Michaels has left the building\", alluding to the phrase \"Elvis has left the building\".\nAt WrestleMania VIII, Michaels defeated Tito Santana in his first pay-per-view singles match after both men had simultaneously eliminated each other from that year's Royal Rumble. Michaels subsequently became a contender to the promotion's singles titles and failed to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from champion Randy Savage in his first opportunity to compete for that title at British event UK Rampage, held on April 19 at the Sheffield Arena and broadcast on Sky Movies Plus (the match later aired in the US on the edition of June 15 of \"Prime Time Wrestling\"). Michaels was also unable to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart in the WWF's first ladder match at a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping on July 21, which was subsequently made available on multiple Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases. However, he won the title from The British Bulldog on the October 27 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", which aired on November 14. Shortly thereafter, he faced Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the Survivor Series, but lost the match. Originally the secondary main event, Michaels and Hart became the primary main event after The Ultimate Warrior was unable to compete and was replaced by Mr. Perfect (Cut Hennig) in the tag team match that involved Randy Savage against the team of Ric Flair and Razor Ramon. During this time, Michaels and Sherri split and he engaged himself in a feud with former tag team partner Marty Jannetty. Michaels lost the Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on the May 17, 1993 episode of \"Raw\", but regained it on June 6 with the help of his debuting \"bodyguard\" (and off-air friend) Diesel.\n\nIn September 1993, Michaels was suspended for testing positive for steroid – a charge he never admitted. On WWF programs, his suspension was explained by his having neglected to defend the title often enough. After turning down World Championship Wrestling (WCW)'s advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television in November at the Survivor Series substituting for Jerry Lawler, who was dealing with legal issues, in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's \"Knights\" against the Hart brothers, Bret, Bruce, Keith and Owen.\n\nIn 1994, Michaels entered a staged rivalry with Razor Ramon, who had won the Intercontinental Championship, which had been vacated during Michaels' absence. Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt. This feud culminated in a ladder match between the two at WrestleMania X. Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's championship belts suspended above a ladder in the ring. This match was voted by fans as \"Match of the Year\" by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\". It also received a five-star rating from \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" editor Dave Meltzer, one of five WWF/WWE matches to do so. Over the next few months, Michaels battled various injuries and launched the \"Heartbreak Hotel\" television talk show segment, mainly shown on \"Superstars\".\n\nOn August 28, Michaels and Diesel captured the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The next day at SummerSlam, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ramon when Michaels accidentally superkicked Diesel. This triggered a split between Michaels and Diesel, a storyline that was drawn out until Survivor Series that November. Michaels went on to win the Royal Rumble in 1995, which set up a championship grudge match at WrestleMania XI against Diesel (who had gone on to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Bob Backlund). As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited Sid as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match and was attacked by Sid the following night. After this, Michaels took time off because Vince McMahon wanted Michaels to become a fan favorite.\n\nMichaels returned to the ring as a fan favorite in May 1995 and he went on to defeat Jeff Jarrett to win his third Intercontinental Championship in July at In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks. This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at SummerSlam in a ladder match, which Michaels won. Around this time, Michaels became the leader of a backstage group known as The Kliq. Critics perceive the group to have sufficient clout with WWF owner Vince McMahon, becoming dominant wrestling figures in the WWF for several years in the mid-1990s, causing friction with other wrestlers. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers. Michaels' fan base was later nicknamed \"The Kliq\" as an inside reference to the real \"Kliq\". In October 1995, Michaels was the victim of a legit assault outside a bar in Syracuse, New York. Due to not being able to compete, Michaels was forced to forfeit the Intercontinental Championship to his original opponent Dean Douglas at In Your House: Great White North, who in turn Douglas lost the championship to Razor Ramon, another member of the Kliq. This event has been cited as an example of the Kliq holding others down. During a match with Owen Hart on a November episode of \"Raw\", Hart performed an enzuigiri that struck the back of Michaels' head. They continued the match, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion. The concussion was scripted, which was kept from most fans at the time. A retirement angle was written so that Michaels could take some time off after he came back from an injury too soon.\n\nAfter teasing a retirement, Michaels returned to the WWF at the Royal Rumble match in 1996, which he wound up winning for a second year in a row, to receive a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match in the main event at WrestleMania XII. Around this time, Jose Lothario became Michaels' on-screen manager. At WrestleMania XII, Michaels defeated WWF Champion Bret Hart in the overtime of their sixty-minute Iron Man match, which had ended in a scoreless tie. On May 19, Michaels and his fellow Kliq members were involved in the incident known as \"\". Diesel and Razor Ramon were about to leave WWF to company rival WCW. After Michaels won a match against Diesel, Ramon and Hunter Hearst Helmsley came to the ring and joined Michaels and Diesel in a group-hug. As Diesel and Helmsley were seen as villains at the time, in contrast to Michaels and Ramon, this constituted a breach of \"kayfabe\", as acting out of character, which was rare and controversial at the time. As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Hall and Nash, Michaels held the championship for most of the year. Michaels' championship reign ended at the Survivor Series event, where he lost to Sycho Sid, his former bodyguard. Michaels recaptured the championship from Sid in January 1997 at the Royal Rumble.\n\nOn a special episode of \"Raw\" dubbed \"Thursday Raw Thursday\", Michaels vacated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He explained to fans that he was informed by doctors that he had conjured a knee injury and that he had to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted that he was going to have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he \"had to find his smile again\", which he had \"lost\" somewhere down the line. After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. In his autobiography, Michaels reveals about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Hart did interviews on live television claiming that he [Michaels] was faking his whole injury.\nBy spring of 1997, the real-life backstage conflict between Michaels and Hart were reaching its heights. Both men were going out on television and frequently making personal, true to heart remarks about one another. Michaels briefly left the WWF in June of that year after a real backstage fight with Hart, just hours before a \"Raw Is War\" show, which allegedly resulted from Michaels making an on-air remark, known as the \"Sunny Days\" comment, implying that Hart (who was married at the time) was having an affair with Tammy Sytch, a manager and valet who was signed to the WWF as Sunny. Michaels and Austin were still WWF Tag Team Champions at the time during an ongoing feud with the Hart Foundation and a tournament was made to decide new tag team champions. Michaels eventually returned that summer in July. At SummerSlam, Michaels officiated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels hitting Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after he spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the championship to his nemesis, Bret Hart. The next night on \"Raw Is War\", signs of a heel turn started to show as Michaels told the WWF fans what happened at SummerSlam was an accident and that he dealt with the Undertaker when the time came. At WWF One Night Only, held in Birmingham, England in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the European Championship. The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with garbage, cementing his second heel turn. With this win, Michaels became the first Grand Slam Champion. At , Michaels defeated Undertaker in the first Hell in a Cell match, during which Michaels fell off the side of the high structure through a table. The match received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer.\n\nIn the fall, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend Hunter Hearst Helmsley (later known as Triple H), Helmsley's then real life girlfriend Chyna, and Rick Rude to form the stable D-Generation X (DX). Michaels continued his rivalry with Bret Hart and his reformed Hart Foundation, which was now a pro-Canada stable. Michaels taunted the group and Canada by engaging in acts such as blowing his nose with and humping the Canadian Flag. Michaels later claimed the flag desecration was Hart's idea. Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a championship match at Survivor Series in November 1997 against Hart. Michaels came out of this match, dubbed by fans the \"Montreal Screwjob\", as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Michaels now held both the WWF World Heavyweight and European championship at the same time. Michaels dropped the European Championship to D-Generation X member Hunter Hearst Hemsley in a farcical match.\n\nAt the 1998 Royal Rumble, in a casket match against The Undertaker, Michaels took a back body drop to the outside of the ring and hit his lower back on the casket, causing him to herniate two discs and crush one completely. Michaels went on to win the match but the injury rendered him unable to compete on the following month's as advertised, and forced him into retirement a night after losing the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIV.\n\nAfter being away for nearly four months, Michaels made a surprise return to the WWF as a guest commentator on the July 13 episode of \"Raw Is War\". Michaels continued to make non-wrestling appearances on WWF programming and on November 23 he replaced Sgt. Slaughter as the WWF Commissioner, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, eventually joining Vince McMahon's group of wrestlers called The Corporation as a villain. Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular television appearances on \"Raw\", in which he scheduled matches, throwing around his authority, and sometimes even deciding the outcome of matches. On the January 4, 1999 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Michaels re-joined DX as a fan favorite, but disappeared from WWF television for a few weeks to have back surgery and by the time he returned DX was on the way of dissolving within the next couple of months.\n\nOn November 23, 1999, Michaels made a special appearance for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling at the 10th Anniversary Show at the Yokohama Arena, serving as the guest referee for the H vs fake Hayabusa (Mr. Gannosuke) main event. He got himself involved in the match when Gannosuke delivered a low blow on him and he responded later on with \"Sweet Chin Music\".\n\nMichaels made occasional appearances as the WWF Commissioner during the spring and summer of 1999, but remained absent from television after August until May 15, 2000, when he returned on \"Raw Is War\" to declare himself the special guest referee for The Rock and Triple H's Iron Man match at Judgment Day. One month later, Michaels briefly reappeared on \"Raw Is War\" to hand over the role of Commissioner to Mick Foley and after another appearance in October he did not make any in-ring appearances until mid-2002, although he appeared briefly on television to make a speech at WWF New York during Armageddon in December 2000. Michaels also had no part at all in the Invasion storyline.\n\nBelieving that his wrestling career was over, Michaels was interested in training individuals who wanted to become professional wrestlers. He saw potential in using his name and opened the Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy in 1999, after his lawyer Skip McCormick suggested the idea. Michaels left the academy in 2002, giving co-founder Rudy Boy Gonzalez sole responsibility due to Michaels' new contract with WWE. Michaels was also a sportscaster for San Antonio's local news for a short period during his retirement.\n\nMichaels was still contracted to the WWF (known by May 2002 as World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE) during this period.\n\nOn the June 3 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels returned to WWE television after 18 months of absence when Kevin Nash announced him as a new member of the recently reformed New World Order (nWo). Michaels was the only nWo member to have never worked in WCW. After the nWo had disbanded, Triple H appeared to make amends with Michaels. This was solidified when Michaels pleaded Triple H to return to \"Raw\". Later on, they came down to the ring sporting their DX music and attire. When the pair was about to perform their trademark \"Suck It\" taunt, Triple H turned on Michaels by performing a Pedigree on him. Continuing the angle, a week later, Triple H attacked Michaels from behind in a parking lot and put his head through a car window, in storyline. In response, Michaels challenged Triple H to \"a fight\" (a non-sanctioned match) at SummerSlam, which Triple H accepted, laying the foundation for a rivalry that lasted for several years. In his first official wrestling match since WrestleMania XIV, Michaels won at SummerSlam, but was attacked by Triple H with a sledgehammer after the match. At Survivor Series, Michaels won the World Heavyweight Championship from Triple H in the first Elimination Chamber match. Michaels' reign as champion came to an end a month later when he lost the championship to Triple H in a Three Stages of Hell match, a series of three matches in which wrestlers attempt to win the majority of matches, at Armageddon.\nMichaels then began a rivalry with Chris Jericho, after Jericho claimed that he was the next Shawn Michaels. On January 13, 2003, after Jericho won a battle royal to select his entry number for the Royal Rumble, choosing number two in order to start the match with Michaels, who had already been named number one. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels. Michaels defeated Jericho at WrestleMania XIX. Despite this, Michaels was low-blowed after hugging with Chris Jericho. On the final episode of \"Raw\" of 2003, Michaels defeated Triple H after a Sweet Chin Music for the World Heavyweight title in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee (Earl Hebner originally refereed the match, only to be knocked out by Triple H in the middle of the match). However, Bischoff reversed the decision due to both men's shoulders being on the mat. Angered by this, Michaels attacked Ric Flair and Bischoff. He was subsequently fired by Bischoff but rehired by Steve Austin.\n\nAs a part of an ongoing feud with Triple H, the two competed alongside Chris Benoit in the main event match at WrestleMania XX for the World Heavyweight Championship. The former DX partners both came up short in the match, however, as Benoit won the championship. The night before this, Shawn Michaels inducted Tito Santana in the WWE Hall of Fame. At Bad Blood in June, Michaels lost to Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match. Four months later, he lost a World Heavyweight championship match against Triple H, after Edge interfered at Taboo Tuesday, when the fans voted for him ahead of Edge and Chris Benoit to face Triple H one more time. Following this, Michaels was out of action for a few months with a legit torn meniscus.\n\nAt the Royal Rumble in 2005, Michaels competed in the Rumble match and eliminated Kurt Angle. In seeking revenge, Angle re-entered the ring and eliminated Michaels, and thus placed him in an ankle lock submission hold, outside the ring. Michaels issued a challenge to Angle for a match at WrestleMania 21, which Angle accepted when he appeared on \"Raw\" to attack Michaels. The following week on \"Raw\", Marty Jannetty and Michaels had a one time reunion as The Rockers and defeated La Résistance (Robért Conway and Sylvain Grenier). Three days later on \"SmackDown!\", Angle defeated Jannetty, after Angle made Jannetty submit to the ankle lock. To send a \"message\" to Michaels, Angle also humiliated Michaels' former manager, Sensational Sherri, when he applied the ankle lock hold on her. At WrestleMania 21 in April, Angle defeated Michaels by submission, again with an ankle lock. Two months later, at a WrestleMania 21 rematch, Michaels defeated Angle at the Vengeance pay-per-view event.\nFollowing the events of WrestleMania 21, the next night on \"Raw\", Muhammad Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault Michaels. On the April 11 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels approached authority figure Eric Bischoff, in which he demanded a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused to schedule such a match and instead told Michaels to find a partner. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan to come back and team with him. On the April 18 episode of \"Raw\", Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer. At Backlash, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels when Daivari was pinned. On the July 4 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels and Hulk Hogan had a tag team match, which they won. During the post-match pose, Michaels hit Hogan with his superkick, knocking Hogan to the ground and making Michaels a villain for the first time since returning in 2002. The following week on \"Raw\", Michaels appeared on \"Piper's Pit\" where he superkicked Roddy Piper and then challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam. Hogan defeated Michaels at SummerSlam, and after the match Michaels extended his hand to him, saying \"I needed to know, and I found out\" and he and Hogan shook hands. Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd, and Michaels once again became a fan favorite.\n\nMichaels followed this up with a short feud with Chris Masters, becoming the first person to cleanly defeat him at Unforgiven with \"Sweet Chin Music\". On the October 3 \"WWE Homecoming\" episode of \"Raw\", he wrestled old rival Kurt Angle to a 2-2 draw in a 30-Minute Iron Man match. Afterwards, he challenged Angle to a sudden death overtime, but Angle refused and walked out. He was part of Team Raw at Survivor Series in a losing effort.\nOn the December 26, 2005, episode of \"Raw\", Vince McMahon lauded Michaels for his part in the \"Montreal Screwjob\". Michaels said he was only being loyal to his company, he had moved on, and McMahon should move on as well. McMahon then began setting unusual stipulations for Michaels' matches and interfering on behalf of Michaels' opponents. During the Royal Rumble, McMahon made his way to the ring, and as Michaels stared at McMahon, Shane McMahon made a surprising appearance, eliminating Michaels from the match. On the February 13 episode of \"Raw\", McMahon tried unsuccessfully to force Michaels to sign retirement papers. The following week, Michaels won a handicap match against the Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky and Mikey) and after the match, Michaels' former partner, Marty Jannetty, came down to help Michaels from the assault by the Spirit Squad. After the two reunited, McMahon offered Jannetty a contract if he \"kissed his ass.\" The following week, Jannetty refused McMahon's offer and instead took Chris Masters' \"Masterlock challenge.\" Michaels tried to help Jannetty, which ultimately resulted in Shane attacking Michaels and forcing him to kiss his father's behind. At \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", Shane defeated Michaels in a Street Fight, a match without disqualifications and where scoring conditions can occur anywhere, after he applied a sharpshooter on Michaels, which led to McMahon immediately ordering for the bell to be rung, even though Michaels did not submit, which was an allusion to the \"Montreal Screwjob\". Despite interference from the Spirit Squad and Shane, Michaels defeated McMahon at WrestleMania 22 in a No Holds Barred match, a match where there are no disqualifications. At Backlash, The McMahons (Vince and Shane) defeated Michaels and \"God\" in a tag team match, with help from the Spirit Squad in a no disqualification match. On the May 22 episode of \"Raw\", the Squad was scripted to injure Michaels' knee. This was angle was written so that Michaels could have surgery on his knee, which had been legitely injured for some time.\n\nIn 2006, a series of events took place which suggested a reunion of Michaels and Triple H as DX. They began at WrestleMania 22, where both Michaels and Triple H performed the crotch chop, during their matches. On \"Raw\", the two continued to deliver chops, as Michaels feuded with Vince McMahon and Triple H went to challenge John Cena for the WWE Championship, repeatedly butting heads with Vince McMahon in the process. On the June 12 episode of \"Raw\", DX officially reunited. During Triple H's gauntlet match, which had him compete against the Spirit Squad. Michaels came in to help Triple H, and the two did the DX \"crotch chops.\" At Vengeance, DX defeated the Spirit Squad in a 5–on–2 handicap match. They also defeated the Spirit Squad at \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" in a 5-on-2 elimination match and defeated The McMahons at SummerSlam. At Unforgiven, DX once again defeated the McMahons and ECW World Champion The Big Show in a Hell in a Cell match, finally ending the nine-month long feud.\n\nAt Cyber Sunday, DX took on Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). The fan-selected referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal use of a steel chair to give Rated-RKO the ill-gotten win and the plaudit of being the first tag team to defeat DX in a tag team match since their reformation in June 2006. At Survivor Series, however, Team DX emerged victorious against Team Rated-RKO in a clean sweep victory. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H suffered a legit torn right quadriceps during their match with Rated-RKO. Rated-RKO claimed victory over DX, citing Triple H's injury, as the \"end\" of DX. On January 15, Michaels lived up to his word of \"dealing\" with Rated-RKO, from his comments the previous week before, when he took out Randy Orton with a con-chair-to after a handicap match against Edge and Orton.\n\nOn the January 29 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels captured the World Tag Team Championship with WWE Champion John Cena after defeating Rated-RKO. He then defeated both Edge and Orton in a Triple Threat number one contender's match on another episode of \"Raw\" to earn a shot at the WWE Championship. At WrestleMania 23, Cena retained the championship, after he made Michaels submit to the STFU. The next night on \"Raw\", Michaels and Cena competed in two back-to-back ten team battle royals, winning the first and losing the titles in the second to The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) when Michaels threw Cena over the top rope. Michaels' feud with Cena continued and he faced off with Cena, Edge and Randy Orton in a Fatal Four-Way Match at Backlash for the WWE Championship. Cena retained the championship when Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on Cena causing him to fall on Orton, which gained Cena the pinfall.\n\nMichaels then entered a feud with Randy Orton when Orton claimed that he could beat Michaels. The week before their scheduled match at Judgment Day, after Michaels won a match against Edge, Orton interfered, punting Michaels in the head. Orton assaulted Michaels again, just prior to their match at Judgment Day, interrupting Michaels' interview segment. Michaels collapsed during the course of their match, causing Orton to win by referee stoppage. Afterwards, Orton continued the beating, when he performed an RKO to a fallen Michaels. Michaels was then removed out of the ring in a stretcher. During the feud, Michaels conjured a storyline concussion. This injury was used to keep Michaels out of action, as he required surgery for his knee. Michaels made his return on the October 8 episode of \"Raw\", performing a superkick to newly crowned WWE Champion, Randy Orton, during his title ceremony at the end of the show and then celebrating over the knocked-out champion as Vince McMahon watched. At Cyber Sunday, Michaels was voted by the fans to face Orton for the WWE Championship; though he won via disqualification when Orton hit Michaels with a low blow, which resulted in Orton retaining the championship. Michaels got another opportunity at the WWE Championship, when he was granted his rematch against Orton at Survivor Series. In their match, Michaels was banned from using Sweet Chin Music upon request by Orton, referring to as Michaels superkicking Orton week after week. Michaels lost the match, when Orton performed an RKO for the win which ended their feud.\nAs part of the storyline involving Ric Flair, Michaels faced Flair in a Career Threatening match at WrestleMania XXIV, in which he won by performing Sweet Chin Music and thus ending Flair's career. Afterwards, Batista confronted Michaels about his actions at WrestleMania, calling him selfish and egotistical. The two faced off at Backlash with Chris Jericho as the guest referee. Michaels won after faking a knee injury and performing Sweet Chin Music. Jericho then confronted Michaels on this matter, in which Michaels admitted to faking the injury in order to defeat Batista. Michaels then defeated Jericho at Judgment Day. At One Night Stand, Michaels lost to Batista in a stretcher match, thus ending their feud. On the June 9 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels was attacked by Chris Jericho during his talk show segment, \"The Highlight Reel\", being thrown directly through a television screen. The following week, it was revealed that, within the context of the storyline, Michaels had suffered a detached retina. At The Great American Bash, a match between Michaels and Jericho was scheduled, in which Jericho assaulted Michaels' eye, which caused Jericho to win by referee stoppage.\nA month later at SummerSlam, Michaels announced his retirement from professional wrestling. That night, Jericho punched Michaels' wife in the face. On the next \"Raw\", Michaels renounced his retirement and challenged Jericho to an unsanctioned match at Unforgiven, which Jericho accepted. The next week, they had an in-ring contract signing for the unsanctioned match. During this, they started to fight, causing a legit small triceps tear for Michaels. He was medically cleared to compete at Unforgiven, and beat Jericho so severely that the referee called the match. Later that night, Jericho replaced CM Punk in the World Heavyweight Championship scramble match, and won the title. The next month. at No Mercy, Michaels lost a championship ladder match to Jericho.\n\nIn December 2008, Michaels, having lost his family's savings due to the global recession, grudgingly accepted a one-year general employment contract from John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL). After failing to help JBL win the World Heavyweight Championship from John Cena at the Royal Rumble, and being derided for it, Michaels agreed to face JBL in \"All or Nothing\" match at No Way Out in February. Michaels won the match, letting him out of his contract early, while still receiving full payment.\n\nOn the March 2 \"Raw\", Michaels became the first person to defeat Vladimir Kozlov, and so earned a match with The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV in April. The Undertaker defeated Michaels in a highly acclaimed match to extend his WrestleMania winning streak to 17–0. After WrestleMania, Michaels took a hiatus from WWE.\n\nMichaels returned to WWE programming in a series of segments that aired on the August 10, 2009 episode of \"Raw\", where he had, in storyline, left the WWE. Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where he was working as a chef; throughout the segments, Triple H tried to convince Michaels to return to WWE and reform DX. After several incidents during the segments, Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) at SummerSlam. At the pay-per-view event, DX defeated Legacy. The two teams exchanged victories, with their feud concluding in October. Two months later, at , DX defeated Chris Jericho and Big Show to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC). On the January 4, 2010 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels buried the hatchet with long-time rival Bret Hart, as they shook hands and hugged in the ring. In contrast to the storylines featured on the show, this was in fact a real-life reconciliation which laid to rest animosities surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. While some cast doubts on its sincerity, both men have confirmed that it was indeed genuine. DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat match to the team of The Miz and Big Show on the February 8 episode of \"Raw\", the match also included The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Michaels cost The Undertaker the World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. At WrestleMania XXVI, Michaels lost to The Undertaker and, as a result, he was forced to retire due to the match stipulation, the same way HBK ended Ric Flair's career. The following night, on the March 29 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels gave an emotional farewell speech, departing with the familiar sentence, \"Shawn Michaels has left the building.\"\n\nIn an interview with Bill Simmons of ESPN.com shortly after his retirement, Michaels stated that his decision to retire came a month before WrestleMania XXV, when a backstage employee asked about his son Cameron, and, in response to Shawn telling the employee that he'd just turned nine, the employee said that he was \"halfway gone\"; meaning that he was halfway to his eighteenth birthday, and after that, he'd be \"gone\". The statement affected Michaels deeply; he did not want be absent when his son left home, so he decided that year would be his last year as an active wrestler.\n\nOn the December 14 \"Raw\", Michaels won the Slammy Award for Moment of the Year for his match against The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVI. Michaels accepted the award via satellite. Three days later, he announced a long-term deal with WWE, where he will serve in an ambassadorial role. He made his in-person TV return at the December 11 \"Tribute to the Troops\" taping, where he and Triple H had a one-night only DX reunion.\n\nHe appeared on the January 10, 2011 \"Raw\", where he was announced as a WWE Hall of Fame class of 2011 inductee. After being ridiculed by Alberto Del Rio later that night, Michaels hit him with Sweet Chin Music. On the March 28 \"Raw\", Michaels addressed Triple H and The Undertaker about their match at WrestleMania XXVII. Michaels was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 2 by Triple H. They were also joined by fellow Kliq members Kevin Nash (who had returned to WWE for the Royal Rumble) and Sean Waltman. He returned on the June 27 \"Raw\", where he was confronted by CM Punk, and superkicked David Otunga and Michael McGillicutty. Later that night, when Diamond Dallas Page's special appearance was interrupted by Drew McIntyre, he superkicked McIntyre.\n\nIn June 2011, Jim Ross, Michaels and Hart announced that the three were working on a DVD chronicling the careers of Hart and Michaels that the WWE was planning to release in October 2011. The subject of the DVD was their on-screen rivalry and real-life conflicts, with a particular focus on the Montreal screwjob. In his tweet, Hart described working on the DVD as a \"cathartic\" experience, and Ross asserted that both Hart and Michaels had been very honest and emotional in their interviews. The DVD, \"Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart: WWE's Greatest Rivalries\", was released in November 2011.\n\nOn February 13, 2012, he confronted Triple H about accepting The Undertaker's challenge for a Hell in a Cell at Wrestlemania XXVIII, and announced he'd be the special guest referee for it. August 6 was \"Shawn Michaels Appreciation Night\". He appeared on \"Raw\", where he was confronted by Brock Lesnar, then again after the broadcast for the Appreciation Night ceremonies.\n\nOn the January 24 \"NXT\", he announced a tournament to crown the inaugural NXT Tag Team Champions. On the April 1, 2013 \"Raw\", Michaels returned to offer to corner Triple H in his match with Lesnar at WrestleMania 29. During that match, Michaels superkicked an interfering Paul Heyman, helping Triple H win and keep his job. He returned on the May 27 \"Raw\" in a backstage segment with John Cena, and again on the SummerSlam pre-show.\n\nIn October 2013, Michaels won a fan poll to become special guest referee for the Hell in a Cell match between Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton for the vacant WWE Championship. He performed Sweet Chin Music on Bryan, allowing Orton to win. The next night on \"Raw\", he explained that he was upset with Bryan for attacking Triple H during the match. He degraded Bryan for not showing him respect, turning heel for the first time since 2005. Bryan applied the \"\"Yes!\" Lock\" on Michaels to end the segment. On December 9, he presented Bryan with the award for Superstar of the Year. Later that night, Bryan attacked Michaels with a running knee after Michaels attacked CM Punk with Sweet Chin Music.\n\nOn the August 25, 2014 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels returned along with fellow legends Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair in a legends panel segment, where he predicted Bray Wyatt to win the rumble. All three legends then became involved in an altercation with Big Show. Michaels appeared at WrestleMania 31, interfering as a member of DX in the Sting vs. Triple H match, performing Sweet Chin Music to Sting. At a WWE tour in Australia Michaels was confronted by Bo Dallas and was called a has-been and got a Sweet Chin Music for his troubles turning face again in the process. Michaels appeared on the October 19, 2015 episode of \"Raw\", confronting Seth Rollins who was cutting a promo on relieving Kane of his duties as Director of Operations.\n\nAt WrestleMania 32, Michaels made an appearance during the event in his in-ring attire, confronting The League of Nations alongside Mick Foley and Stone Cold Steve Austin where Michaels delivered Sweet Chin Music to Alberto Del Rio and King Barrett before celebrating with Foley, Austin and The New Day.\n\nIn late 2016, Michaels became a trainer at the WWE Performance Center.\n\nOn the January 9, 2017 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels returned to WWE, promoting his new film. Michaels was then confronted by Rusev, Lana and Jinder Mahal, before Enzo Amore and Big Cass came to Michaels' side, leading to a match between Big Cass and Mahal, with Michaels being in Big Cass' corner. Big Cass won the match, after Michaels superkicked Rusev at ringside, distracting Mahal. On the March 13 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels gave Roman Reigns advice about The Undertaker for their match at WrestleMania 33, before Braun Strowman attacked Reigns on the entrance ramp.\n\nAccording to \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" in 2017, Michaels along with Terry Taylor teach the finishing class at the WWE Performance Center, the last of four levels of classes.\n\nMichaels and numerous other WWE legends appeared on the January 22, 2018 episode of Raw 25 Years.\n\nOn the September 3, 2018 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels made a special appearance to promote the match between Triple H and The Undertaker at Super Show-Down, during which he was confronted by The Undertaker himself. At Super Show-Down, Michaels assisted Triple H in defeating The Undertaker. After the match, Michaels and Triple H were attacked by Undertaker and Kane.\nOn the October 8th edition of \"Raw\", Michaels announced that he was coming out of retirement at WWE Crown Jewel, reforming D-Generation X with Triple H to take on The Undertaker and Kane. At the event, they defeated the Brothers of Destruction in the main event after Triple H pinned Kane. During the match, Triple H was legitimately injured, tearing his right pectoral muscle.\n\nMichaels is considered one of the greatest wrestlers in history. He received praises for several matches, including 15 Match of the Year awards between Pro Wrestling Illustrated and Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Also, his match at WrestleMania 24 against Ric Flair was named Match of the Decade by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Dave Meltzer, from Wrestling Observer Newsletter, gave him two 5 stars matches (the Ladder match against Razor Ramon at WrestleMania X and the first Hell in a Cell against The Undertaker at Bad Blood 1998). After several acclaimed matches at WrestleMania, Michaels has been known as Mr. WrestleMania. Sumit Rehal of Independent UK in his top 10 WrestleMania matches listed Michels 3 times (vs Razor Ramor at WrestleMania X, vs Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII and vs The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXV). In 2016, Dave Richard of CBS Sports ranked his match against Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIV as the best main event in WrestleMania history.\n\nHis rivalry with Bret Hart has been named one of the best rivalries in WWE history.\n\nAfter 8 years retired from in-ring competition, Michaels made his return at Crown Jewel, receiving criticism from the fans and media. After his match, Brad Shepard from Oh You Didn't Know? said \"he [Michaels] had a total disaster of a match at Crown Jewel\". PWTorch's Wade Keller said \"Michaels shows glimpses and didn’t embarrass himself\".\n\nHickenbottom's first marriage, to Theresa Wood, soon ended in an amicably settled divorce. He married Rebecca Curci, a former WCW Nitro Girl known as Whisper, on March 31, 1999, at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Only the couple and an Elvis impersonator were present. Their son, Cameron Kade, was born on January 15, 2000, and a daughter, Cheyenne, born on August 19, 2004 followed. His cousin Matt Bentley is also a professional wrestler, having wrestled in TNA and WWE.\n\nIn 1996, Hickenbottom posed for a non-nude layout in \"Playgirl\" magazine. Only after he posed did he discover \"Playgirl\" has a mostly homosexual readership, for which some of his fellow wrestlers teased him.\n\nHe is ambidextrous, and had trouble differentiating between right and left, which affected his football games as a boy. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically kicks with his right leg in Sweet Chin Music, but uses either arm for his signature elbow drop, depending on position.\n\nIn 1987, Hickenbottom developed a pattern of \"heavy\" substance abuse, which eventually alienated some of his closest friends. He contemplated suicide in the late 1980s, and suggested that psychological intervention was \"probably sorely needed\" by the late 1990s. His wife Rebecca observed: \"There was something in him that he despised, and he was self-destructing.\" Hickenbottom's fear that he was going to negatively influence his young son, prompted him to abandon his previous lifestyle.\n\nHickenbottom became a born-again Christian on April 24, 2002. He was raised a Catholic, but became a non-denominational Christian because of his wife. His later ring attire often incorporated cross symbols and he made a praying gesture on his knees during ring entrances. Hickenbottom was in the audience for a televised service of John Hagee's Cornerstone Church in his hometown, San Antonio, where he is also a Bible teacher. In 2008, he appeared on a Trinity Broadcasting Network program with fellow professional wrestler Sting.\n\nMichaels is the host of the outdoor television show, \"Shawn Michaels' MacMillan River Adventures\". Michaels joins his hunting partner and longtime friend, Keith Mark, owner and operator of the original MacMillan River Adventures camp in Yukon, Canada, as they hunt big-game animals around the world. This series airs on CarbonTV.\n\nDuring their 2015-16 season, the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League named a line, consisting of Carl Hagelin, Nick Bonino and Phil Kessel, the \"HBK Line\" due to the fact that the trio's first initials, of their last names, recall Michaels' \"Heartbreak Kid\" moniker.\n\nAfter weeks of having fun with Penguins fans on Twitter, the team officially invited Michaels for their Eastern Conference Finals Game 5 matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning (which consists of several wrestlers in its fanbase, including Hulk Hogan and Titus O'Neil) at Consol Energy Center, upon which Michaels accepted. Michaels met with Penguins' owner Mario Lemieux and sat with former Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive lineman Brett Keisel during the game. Keisel also gave Michaels a tour of the city including at the Steelers headquarters and having lunch at Primanti Brothers in the city's Strip District. The Penguins lost the game in overtime 4-3, but went on to defeat the Lightning in the series and advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, eventually defeating the San Jose Sharks for the Stanley Cup. Michaels eventually befriended Keisel and attended his annual \"Shear Da Beard\" event in 2017.\n\nOutside of his numerous appearances with WWE, it was not Michaels first visit to Pittsburgh. In 2013, he appeared at the opening of the first Field & Stream store in suburban Cranberry Township.\n\nWhile the Penguins successfully defended their Stanley Cup championship the following year, the HBK Line was broken up when Kessel was moved to the 2nd line with Evgeni Malkin and Bonino left the team in free agency.\n\nOn February 10, 2015, Hickenbottom published an autobiography entitled \"Wrestling for My Life: The Legend, the Reality, and the Faith of a WWE Superstar\". It was co-written by David Thomas.\n\n\n\n"}

The center is part of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's library system and the University of Illinois School of Music.\n\nAmong the center's important collections are archives of John Philip Sousa, Albert Austin Harding (Illinois' first band-master), Herbert L. Clarke and the University of Illinois Bands. The center is devoted to collection and preservation, public access, exhibitions, publications, and scholarship.\n\nThe center is located in the Harding Band Building on the campus of the University of Illinois. It operates as a museum, with annual rotating exhibits on themes such as Baseball and Music, Women and Music, Technology and Music, and events during the annual November Music Month in Champaign-Urbana. All collections are accessible to the public and are regularly used in exhibit displays and public programming.\n\nThe center opened in 1994 with the transfer from the University Bands of the Sousa and Clarke personal papers, and related materials. (The Bands had previous acquired Sousa's papers from a personal connection between Sousa and Harding, the University of Illinois' first band-master.) Since then, additional collections have been added. These include over 50 record series documenting the history of American music, and music and performing arts at the University of Illinois. In addition to the Sousa, Clarke and Harding material, there are papers and music by and about Harry Partch, Harry Begian, Salvatore Martirano, Pietro A. Cipollone, Elbern Alkire, Paul Martin Zonn, Kenneth Gaburo, Paul Bierley and Virginia Root. There are instrument collections from Alkire and Carl Busch, and the Jack Linker Sound Recording Collection. The archives of the Association of Concert Bands is also held by the center, including administrative files, convention and concert programs, photographs, and sound recordings. The center also houses the Sal-Mar Construction, an electronic music system created by Salvatore Martirano, which enabled him to write and perform music that mixed human and computer-generated sounds and composition.\n\nThe Sousa collection also includes The Claude Gordon Personal Papers and Music Instrument Collection, 1888–1992, which consists of music and correspondence with Herbert L. Clarke and other notable trumpet artists, educational material, publicity and memorabilia, and performance contracts. Claude Gordan, a long time student of Herbert L. Clarke, was an internationally renowned trumpet soloist, band leader and teacher with many methods published worldwide in several languages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40131894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40131894", "title": "The Negro Motorist Green Book", "text": "The Negro Motorist Green Book\n\nThe Negro Motorist Green Book (at times styled The Negro Motorist Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was an annual guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, commonly referred to simply as the \"Green Book\". \n\nIt was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. \n\nAlthough pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles as soon as they could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.\n\nMany Black Americans took to driving, in part to avoid segregation on public transportation. As the writer George Schuyler put it in 1930, \"all Negroes who can do so purchase an automobile as soon as possible in order to be free of discomfort, discrimination, segregation and insult.\" Black Americans employed as athletes, entertainers, and salesmen also traveled frequently for work purposes.\n\nAfrican-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from whites-only \"sundown towns\". Green founded and published the \"Green Book\" to avoid such problems, compiling resources \"to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable.\"\n\nFrom a New York-focused first edition published in 1936, Green expanded the work to cover much of North America, including most of the United States and parts of Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. The \"Green Book\" became \"the bible of black travel during Jim Crow\", enabling black travelers to find lodgings, businesses, and gas stations that would serve them along the road. It was little known outside the African-American community. Shortly after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed the types of racial discrimination that had made the \"Green Book\" necessary, publication ceased and it fell into obscurity. There has been a revived interest in it in the early 21st century in connection with studies of black travel during the Jim Crow era.\n\nFour issues (1940, 1947, 1954, and 1963) have been republished in facsimile (as of December 2017), and have sold well.\n\nBefore the legislative accomplishments of the Civil Rights Movement, black travelers in the United States faced major problems unknown to most whites. White supremacists had long sought to restrict black mobility, and were uniformly hostile to black strangers. As a result, simple auto journeys for black people were fraught with difficulty and potential danger. They were subjected to racial profiling by police departments (\"driving while black\" or \"DWB\"), sometimes seen as \"uppity\" or \"too prosperous\" just for the act of driving, which many whites regarded as a white prerogative. They risked harassment or worse on and off the highway. A bitter commentary published in a 1947 issue of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's magazine, \"The Crisis\", highlighted the uphill struggle blacks faced in recreational travel: \n\nSuch restrictions dated back to colonial times, and were found throughout the United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North and later in the South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from New Orleans to resorts along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African Americans in public accommodations and public transportation.\n\nThey encountered a white backlash, particularly in the South, where by 1877 white Democrats controlled every state government. The Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) in 1883, resulting in states and cities passing numerous segregation laws. White governments in the South required even interstate railroads to enforce their segregation laws, despite national legislation requiring equal treatment of passengers. SCOTUS ruled in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" (1896) that \"separate but equal\" accommodations were constitutional, but in practice, facilities for blacks were far from equal, generally being of lesser quality and underfunded. Blacks faced restrictions and exclusion throughout the United States: if not barred entirely from facilities, they could use them only at different times from whites or in (usually inferior) \"colored sections\".\n\nIn 1917, the black writer W. E. B. Du Bois observed that the impact of \"ever-recurring race discrimination\" had made it so difficult to travel to any number of destinations, from popular resorts to major cities, that it was now \"a puzzling query as to what to do with vacations\". It was a problem that came to affect an increasing number of black people in the first decades of the 20th century. Tens of thousands of southern African Americans migrated from farms in the south to factories and domestic service in the north. No longer confined to living at a subsistence level, many gained enough disposable income and time to engage in leisure travel. \n\nThe development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the \"Jim Crow cars\" – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages. As one black magazine writer commented in 1933, in an automobile \"it's mighty good to be the skipper for a change, and pilot our craft whither and where we will. We feel like Vikings. What if our craft is blunt of nose and limited of power and our sea is macademized; it's good for the spirit to just give the old railroad Jim Crow the laugh.\"\n\nMiddle-class blacks throughout the United States \"were not at all sure how to behave or how whites would behave toward them\", as Bart Landry puts it. In Cincinnati, the African-American newspaper editor Wendell Dabney wrote of the situation in the 1920s that \"hotels, restaurants, eating and drinking places, almost universally are closed to all people in whom the least tincture of colored blood can be detected.\" Areas without significant black populations outside the South often refused to accommodate them: not one hotel or other accommodation was open to blacks in Salt Lake City in the 1920s. Black travelers were stranded if they had to stop there overnight. Only six percent of the more than 100 motels that lined U.S. Route 66 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, admitted black customers. Across the whole state of New Hampshire, only three motels in 1956 served African Americans.\n\nGeorge Schuyler reported in 1943, \"Many colored families have motored all across the United States without being able to secure overnight accommodations at a single tourist camp or hotel.\" He suggested that black Americans would find it easier to travel abroad than in their own country. In Chicago in 1945, St. Clair Drake and Horace A. Cayton reported that \"the city's hotel managers, by general agreement, do not sanction the use of hotel facilities by Negroes, particularly sleeping accommodations.\" One incident reported by Drake and Cayton illustrated the discriminatory treatment meted out even to blacks within racially mixed groups:\nWhile automobiles made it much easier for black Americans to be independently mobile, the difficulties they faced in traveling were such that, as Lester B. Granger of the National Urban League puts it, \"so far as travel is concerned, Negroes are America's last pioneers.\" Black travelers often had to carry buckets or portable toilets in the trunks of their cars because they were usually barred from bathrooms and rest areas in service stations and roadside stops. Travel essentials such as gasoline were difficult to purchase because of discrimination at gas stations. To avoid such problems on long trips, African Americans often packed meals and carried containers of gasoline in their cars. Writing of the road trips that he made as a boy in the 1950s, Courtland Milloy of the \"Washington Post\" recalled that his mother spent the evening before the trip frying chicken and boiling eggs so that his family would have something to eat along the way the next day.\n\nOne black motorist observed in the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a \"small cloud\" had appeared. By the late afternoon, \"it casts a shadow of apprehension on our hearts and sours us a little. 'Where,' it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'\". They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.\n\nThe civil rights leader John Lewis has recalled how his family prepared for a trip in 1951:\nFinding accommodation was one of the greatest challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves \"sundown towns,\" which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were an estimated 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S. – including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was \"Ain't No Niggers Allowed\". \n\nEven in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that \"after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting.\"\n\nAfrican-American travelers faced real physical risks because of the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, and the possibility of extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few miles down the road. Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger. Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the Mississippi Delta region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars. A pattern emerged of whites purposefully damaging black-owned cars to put their owners \"in their place\". Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents would urge him and his brother to control their need to use a bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as \"those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee\".\n\nRacist local laws, discriminatory social codes, segregated commercial facilities, racial profiling by police, and sundown towns made road journeys a minefield of constant uncertainty and risk. Road trip narratives by blacks reflected their unease and the dangers they faced, presenting a more complex outlook from those written by whites extolling the joys of the road. Milloy recalls the menacing environment that he encountered during his childhood, in which he learned of \"so many black travelers ... just not making it to their destinations.\"\n\nEven foreign black dignitaries were not immune to the discrimination that African-American travelers routinely encountered. In one high-profile incident, Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, the finance minister of newly independent Ghana, was refused service at a Howard Johnson's restaurant at Dover, Delaware, while traveling to Washington, D.C., even after identifying himself by his state position to the restaurant staff. The snub caused an international incident, to which an embarrassed President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by inviting Gbedemah to breakfast at the White House. Repeated and sometimes violent incidents of discrimination directed against black African diplomats, particularly on U.S. Route 40 between New York and Washington, D.C., led to the administration of President John F. Kennedy setting up a Special Protocol Service Section within the State Department to assist black diplomats traveling and living within the United States. The State Department considered issuing copies of \"The Negro Motorist Green Book\" to black diplomats, but eventually decided against steering them to black-friendly public accommodations as it wanted them \"to have all of the privileges of whiteness.\"\n\nJohn A. Williams wrote in his 1965 book, \"This Is My Country Too\", that he did not believe \"white travelers have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America.\" He achieved it with \"nerve, courage, and a great deal of luck,\" supplemented by \"a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and \"Travelguide\", a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse.\" He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of \"insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars.\" There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, \"[black] people have a way of disappearing on the road.\"\n\nSegregation meant that facilities for African-American motorists were limited, but entrepreneurs of both races realized the lucrative opportunities in marketing goods and services to black patrons. The challenge for travelers was to find such oases in the middle of a desert of discrimination. To address this problem, African-American writers produced a number of guides to provide travel advice. These included directories of hotels, camps, road houses, and restaurants which would serve African Americans. Jewish travelers, who had long experienced discrimination at many vacation spots, created guides for their own community, though they were at least able to visibly blend in more easily with the general population. African Americans followed suit with publications such as \"Hackley and Harrison's Hotel and Apartment Guide for Colored Travelers\", published in 1930 to cover \"Board, Rooms, Garage Accommodations, etc. in 300 Cities in the United States and Canada\".\n\n\"The Negro Motorist Green Book\" was one of the best known of the African-American travel guides. It was conceived in 1932 and first published in 1936 by Victor H. Green, a World War I veteran from New York City who worked as a mail carrier and later as a travel agent. He said his aim was \"to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable.\" According to an editorial written by Novera C. Dashiell in the Spring 1956 edition of the \"Green Book\", \"the idea crystallized when not only [Green] but several friends and acquaintances complained of the difficulties encountered; oftentimes painful embarrassments suffered which ruined a vacation or business trip.\"\n\nGreen asked his readers to provide information \"on the Negro motoring conditions, scenic wonders in your travels, places visited of interest and short stories on one's motoring experience.\" He offered a reward of one dollar for each accepted account, which he increased to five dollars by 1941. He also obtained information from colleagues in the US Postal Service, who would \"ask around on their routes\" to find suitable public accommodations. The Postal Service was (and is) one of the largest employers of African Americans, and its employees were ideally situated to inform Green of which places were safe and hospitable to African-American travelers.\nThe \"Green Book's\" motto, displayed on the front cover, urged black travelers to \"Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it\". The 1949 edition included a quote from Mark Twain: \"Travel is fatal to prejudice\", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotton Seiler puts it, \"here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter.\" Green commented in 1940 that the \"Green Book\" had given black Americans \"something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro.\" Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: \"Where will you spend the night?\" As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. \n\nThe listings focused on four main categories – hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving the name and address of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in bold type or have a star next to it to denote that they were \"recommended\".\n\nMany such establishments were run by and for African Americans and in some cases were named after prominent figures in African-American history. In North Carolina, such black-owned businesses included the Carver, Lincoln, and Booker T. Washington hotels, the Friendly City beauty parlor, the Black Beauty Tea Room, the New Progressive tailor shop, the Big Buster tavern, and the Blue Duck Inn. Each edition also included feature articles on travel and destinations, and included a listing of black resorts such as Idlewild, Michigan; Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts; and Belmar, New Jersey. The state of New Mexico was particularly recommended as a place where most motels would welcome \"guests on the basis of ‘cash rather than color.'\" <syntaxhighlight>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe \"Green Book\" attracted sponsorship from a number of businesses, including the African-American newspapers \"Call and Post\" of Cleveland, Ohio, and the \"Louisville Leader\" of Louisville, Kentucky. Standard Oil (later Esso) was also a sponsor, owing to the efforts of James \"Billboard\" Jackson, a pioneering African-American Esso sales representative. Esso's \"race group\", part of its marketing division, promoted the \"Green Book\" as enabling Esso's black customers to \"go further with less anxiety\". By contrast, Shell gas stations were known to refuse black customers. \n\nThe 1949 edition included an Esso endorsement message that told readers: \"As representatives of the Esso Standard Oil Co., we are pleased to recommend the \"Green Book\" for your travel convenience. Keep one on hand each year and when you are planning your trips, let Esso Touring Service supply you with maps and complete routings, and for real 'Happy Motoring' – use Esso Products and Esso Service wherever you find the Esso sign.\" Photographs of some African-American entrepreneurs who owned Esso gas stations appeared in the pages of the \"Green Book\".\n\nAlthough Green usually refrained from editorializing in the \"Green Book\", he let his readers' letters speak for the influence of his guide. William Smith of Hackensack, New Jersey, described it as a \"credit to the Negro Race\" in a letter published in the 1938 edition. He commented:\n\nEarl Hutchinson Sr., the father of journalist Earl Ofari Hutchinson, wrote of a 1955 move from Chicago to California that \"you literally didn't leave home without [the \"Green Book\"].\" Ernest Green, one of the Little Rock Nine, used the \"Green Book\" to navigate the from Arkansas to Virginia in the 1950s and comments that \"it was one of the survival tools of segregated life\". According to the civil rights leader Julian Bond, recalling his parents' use of the \"Green Book\", \"it was a guidebook that told you not where the best places were to eat, but where there was \"any\" place.\" Bond comments:\n\nWhile the \"Green Book\" was intended to make life easier for those living under Jim Crow, its publisher looked forward to a time when such guidebooks would no longer be necessary. As Green wrote, \"there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go as we please, and without embarrassment.\"\n\nLos Angeles is now considering offering special protection to the sites that kept black travelers safe. Ken Bernstein, principal planner for the city's Office of Historic Resources notes, \"At the very least, these sites can be incorporated into our city's online inventory system. They are part of the story of African Americans in Los Angeles, and the story of Los Angeles itself writ large.\"\n\nThe \"Green Book\" was published locally in New York, but its popularity was such that from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the United States Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the \"Green Book's\" publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946. Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities in most of the United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which – unusual for the oil industry at the time – were franchised to African Americans.\n\nIt originally sold for 25 cents, increasing to $1.25 by 1957. With the book's growing success, Green retired from the post office and hired a small publishing staff that operated from 200 West 135th Street in Harlem. He also established a vacation reservation service in 1947 to take advantage of the post-war boom in automobile travel. From 10 pages in its first edition, by 1949 he had expanded the \"Green Book\" to more than 80 pages, including advertisements.\n\nThe 1951 \"Green Book\" recommended that black-owned businesses raise their standards, as travelers were \"no longer content to pay top prices for inferior accommodations and services\". The quality of black-owned lodgings was coming under scrutiny, as many prosperous blacks found them to be second-rate compared to the white-owned lodgings from which they were excluded. In 1952, Green renamed the publication \"The Negro Travelers' Green Book\", in recognition of its coverage of international destinations requiring travel by plane and ship. Although segregation was still in force, by state laws in the South and often by practice elsewhere, the wide circulation of the \"Green Book\" had attracted growing interest from white businesses that wanted to tap into the potential sales of the black market. The 1955 edition noted: \nA few years after its publication ... white business has also recognized its [\"The Green Book\"’s] value and it is now in use by the Esso Standard Oil Co., The American Automobile Assn. and its affiliate automobile clubs throughout the country, other automobile clubs, air lines, travel bureaus, travelers aid, libraries and thousands of subscribers.\n\nBy the start of the 1960s, the \"Green Book\"s market was beginning to erode; African-American civil rights activism was having effects, even before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit racial segregation in public facilities. An increasing number of middle-class African Americans were beginning to question whether guides such as the \"Green Book\" were accommodating Jim Crow by steering black travelers to segregated businesses rather than encouraging them to push for equal access. Black-owned motels in remote locations off state highways lost customers to a new generation of integrated interstate motels located near freeway exits. The 1963 \"Green Book\" acknowledged that the activism of the civil rights movement had \"widened the areas of public accommodations accessible to all,\" but it defended the continued listing of black-friendly businesses because \"a family planning for a vacation hopes for one that is free of tensions and problems.\"\n\nThe 1966 edition was the last to be published after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made the guide effectively obsolete by outlawing racial discrimination in public accommodations. The last edition of the \"Green Book\" included significant changes that reflected the post-Civil Rights Act outlook. The title was changed to \"Traveler's Green Book: International Edition\" – no longer just for the Negro, or the motorist – as its publishers sought to widen its appeal. Although the content continued to proclaim its mission of highlighting leisure options for black travelers, the cover featured an affluent white blonde water-skiing – a sign of how, as Michael Ra-Shon Hall puts it, \"the Green Book ‘whitened’ its surface and internationalized its scope, while still remaining true to its founding mission to ensure the security of African-American travelers both in the US and abroad.\"\n\nIn the 2000s, academics, artists, curators, and writers exploring the history of African-American travel in the United States during the Jim Crow era revived interest in the \"Green Book\". The result has been a number of projects, books and other works referring to the \"Green Book\". The book itself has acquired a high value as a collectors' item; a \"partly perished\" copy of the 1941 edition sold at auction in March 2015 for $22,500. Some examples are listed below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
