It wasn't convenient for the project team to use JNDI which indicated to them it wouldn't be easy for typical users either. Eventually, all of the necessary LDAP data structures (_Attribute_, _Entry_, _DN_, ...) were re-implemented by the project team.\n\nAt some point it became necessary to communicate with other LDAP servers without using the JNDI library, so a new _LdapConnection_ class was developed. This was the first step toward a full Java API specifically designed for LDAP usage on the Java platform.\n\nAfter starting this effort (back in 2007), some people from Sun (Microsystems), who was working on the OpenDS project, contacted the Apache Directory project team to gauge interest in helping create a new version of JNDI.

{"id": "6298644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6298644", "title": "Galton's problem", "text": "Galton's problem\n\nGalton's problem, named after Sir Francis Galton, is the problem of drawing inferences from cross-cultural data, due to the statistical phenomenon now called autocorrelation. The problem is now recognized as a general one that applies to all nonexperimental studies and to experimental design as well. It is most simply described as the problem of external dependencies in making statistical estimates when the elements sampled are not statistically independent.\nAsking two people in the same household whether they watch TV, for example, does not give you statistically independent answers. The sample size, \"n\", for independent observations in this case is one, not two. Once proper adjustments are made that deal with external dependencies, then the axioms of probability theory concerning statistical independence will apply. These axioms are important for deriving measures of variance, for example, or tests of statistical significance.\n\nIn 1888, Galton was present when Sir Edward Tylor presented a paper at the Royal Anthropological Institute. Tylor had compiled information on institutions of marriage and descent for 350 cultures and examined the correlations between these institutions and measures of societal complexity. Tylor interpreted his results as indications of a general evolutionary sequence, in which institutions change focus from the maternal line to the paternal line as societies become increasingly complex. Galton disagreed, pointing out that similarity between cultures could be due to borrowing, could be due to common descent, or could be due to evolutionary development; he maintained that without controlling for borrowing and common descent one cannot make valid inferences regarding evolutionary development. Galton's critique has become the eponymous \"Galton's Problem\", as named by Raoul Naroll, who proposed the first statistical solutions.\n\nBy the early 20th century unilineal evolutionism was abandoned and along with it the drawing of direct inferences from correlations to evolutionary sequences. Galton's criticisms proved equally valid, however, for inferring functional relations from correlations. The problem of autocorrelation remained.\n\nStatistician William S. Gosset in 1914 developed methods of eliminating spurious correlation due to how position in time or space affects similarities. Today's election polls have a similar problem: the closer the poll to the election, the less individuals make up their mind independently, and the greater the unreliability of the polling results, especially the margin of error or confidence limits. The effective \"n\" of independent cases from their sample drops as the election nears. Statistical significance falls with lower effective sample size.\n\nThe problem pops up in sample surveys when sociologists want to reduce the travel time to do their interviews, and hence they divide their population into local clusters and sample the clusters randomly, then sample again within the clusters. If they interview \"n\" people in clusters of size \"m\" the effective sample size (efs) would have a lower limit of if everyone in each cluster were identical. When there are only partial similarities within clusters, the \"m\" in this formula has to be lowered accordingly. A formula of this sort is where \"d\" is the intraclass correlation for the statistic in question. In general, estimation of the appropriate efs depends on the statistic estimated, as for example, mean, chi-square, correlation, regression coefficient, and their variances.\n\nFor cross-cultural studies, Murdock and White\nestimated the size of patches of similarities in their sample of 186 societies. The four variables they tested – language, economy, political integration, and descent – had patches of similarities that varied from size three to size ten. A very crude rule of thumb might be to divide the square root of the similarity-patch sizes into \"n\", so that the effective sample sizes are 58 and 107 for these patches, respectively. Again, statistical significance falls with lower effective sample size.\n\nIn modern analysis spatial lags have been modelled in order to estimate the degree of globalization on modern societies.\n\nSpatial dependency or auto-correlation is a fundamental concept in geography. Methods developed by geographers that measure and control for spatial autocorrelation do far more than reduce the effective \"n\" for tests of significance of a correlation. One example is the complicated hypothesis that \"the presence of gambling in a society is directly proportional to the presence of a commercial money and to the presence of considerable socioeconomic differences and is inversely related to whether or not the society is a nomadic herding society.\" Tests of this hypothesis in a sample of 60 societies failed to reject the null hypothesis. Autocorrelation analysis, however, showed a significant effect of socioeconomic differences.\n\nHow prevalent is autocorrelation among the variables studied in cross-cultural research? A test by Anthon Eff on 1700 variables in the cumulative database for the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, published in World Cultures, measured Moran's I for spatial autocorrelation (distance), linguistic autocorrelation (common descent), and autocorrelation in cultural complexity (mainline evolution). \"The results suggest that ... it would be prudent to test for spatial and phylogenetic autoccorrelation when conducting regression analyses with the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample.\"\nThe use of autocorrelation tests in exploratory data analysis is illustrated, showing how all variables in a given study can be evaluated for nonindependence of cases in terms of distance, language, and cultural complexity. The methods for estimating these autocorrelation effects are then explained and illustrated for ordinary least squares regression using again the Moran I significance measure of autocorrelation.\n\nWhen autocorrelation is present, it can often be removed to get unbiased estimates of regression coefficients and their variances by constructing a respecified dependent variable that is \"lagged\" by weightings on the dependent variable on other locations, where the weights are degree of relationship. This lagged dependent variable is endogenous, and estimation requires either two-stage least squares or maximum likelihood methods.\n\nA public server, if used externally at http://SocSciCompute.ss.uci.edu, offers ethnographic data, variables and tools for inference with R scripts by Dow (2007) and Eff and Dow (2009) in an NSF supported Galaxy (http://getgalaxy.org) framework (https://www.xsede.org) for instructors, students and researchers to do \"CoSSci Galaxy\" cross-cultural research modeling with controls for Galton's problem using Standard Cross-Cultural Sample variables at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9256203/SCCScodebook.txt.\n\nIn anthropology, where Tylor's problem was first recognized by the statistician Galton in 1889, it is still not widely recognized that there are standard statistical adjustments for the problem of patches of similarity in observed cases and opportunities for new discoveries using autocorrelation methods. Some cross-cultural researchers (see, e.g., Korotayev and de Munck 2003)\nhave begun to realize that evidence of diffusion, historical origin, and other sources of similarity among related societies or individuals should be renamed Galton's Opportunity and Galton's Asset rather than Galton's Problem. Researchers now use longitudinal, cross-cultural, and regional variation analysis routinely to analyze all the competing hypotheses: functional relationships, diffusion, common historical origin, multilineal evolution, co-adaptation with environment, and complex social interaction dynamics.\n\nWithin anthropology, Galton's problem is often given as a cause to reject comparative studies altogether. Since the problem is a general one, common to the sciences and statistical inference generally, this particular criticism of cross-cultural or comparative studies – and there are many – is one that, logically speaking, amounts to a rejection of science and statistics altogether. Any data collected and analyzed by ethnographers, for example, is equally subject to Galton's problem, understood in its most general sense. A critique of the anticomparative critique is not limited to statistical comparison since it would apply as well to the analysis of text. That is, the analysis and use of text in argumentation is subject to critique as to the evidential basis of inference. Reliance purely on rhetoric is no protection against critique as to the validity of argument and its evidentiary basis.\n\nThere is little doubt, however, that the community of cross-cultural researchers have been remiss in ignoring Galton's problem. Expert investigation of this question shows results that \"strongly suggest that the extensive reporting of naïve chi-square independence tests using cross-cultural data sets over the past several decades has led to incorrect rejection of null hypotheses at levels much higher than the expected 5% rate.\" The investigator concludes that \"Incorrect theories that have been 'saved' by naïve chi-square tests with comparative data may yet be more rigorously tested another day.\" Once again, the adjusted variance of a cluster sample is given as one multiplied by 1 + \"d\" (\"k\" + 1) where \"k\" is the average size of a cluster, and a more complicated correction is given for the variance of contingency table correlations with \"r\" rows and \"c\" columns. Since this critique was published in 1993, and others like it, more authors have begun to adopt corrections for Galton's problem, but the majority in the cross-cultural field have not. Consequently, a large proportion of published results that rely on naive significance tests and that adopt the \"P\" < 0.05 rather than a \"P\" < 0.005 standard are likely to be in error because they are more susceptible to type I error, which is to reject the null hypothesis when it is true.\n\nSome cross-cultural researchers reject the seriousness of Galton's problem because, they argue, estimates of correlations and means may be unbiased even if autocorrelation, weak or strong, is present. Without investigating autocorrelation, however, they may still mis-estimate statistics dealing with relationships among variables. In regression analysis, for example, examining the patterns of autocorrelated residuals may give important clues to third factors that may affect the relationships among variables but that have not been included in the regression model. Second, if there are\nclusters of similar and related societies in the sample, measures of variance will be underestimated, leading to spurious statistical conclusions. for example, exaggerating the statistical significance of correlations. Third, the underestimation of variance makes it difficult to test for replication of results from two different samples, as the results will more often be rejected as similar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1211751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1211751", "title": "Hausos", "text": "Hausos\n\nHausos (Proto-Indo-European: *\"\") is the reconstructed name for the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn. Derivatives of her found throughout various Indo-European mythologies include the Greek goddess Eos, the Roman goddess Aurōra, the Vedic goddess Uṣás, the Lithuanian goddess Aušrinė (cf. Lith. \"aušrà\" \"dawn\"), and possibly also the (West) Germanic goddess *\"Austrǭ\" (Old English \"Ēostre\", Old High German *\"Ōstara\").\n\nThe Dawn Goddess is hypothesised to have been one of the most important deities to the Proto-Indo-Europeans, due to the consistency of her characterisation as well as the relevance of Ushas in the Rig Veda. Her attributes have not only been mixed with those of solar goddesses in some later traditions, but have subsequently expanded and influenced female deities in other mythologies.\n\nThe Dawn Goddess is thought to have been envisioned as the daughter of Dyeus. This is partially reflected in Vedic mythology, where Ushas is the daughter of Dyaus Pita, though in some other Indo-European derivations this is not the case (Eos is a titan daughter of Hyperion and Theia while Aušrinė is the daughter of Saulė and Mėnulis; even Ushas is inversely sometimes considered the daughter of Surya), though nonetheless the epithet \"daughter of heaven\" remains in nearly all Indo-European mythologies. This reflects her status as a relevant goddess as well as a celestial deity.\n\nShe is also envisioned as the sister of the Divine Twins, with Ushas still maintaining this relation to the Ashvins. Although the \"marriage drama\" myth (in which one or both of the Divine Twins compete for the hand of a woman in marriage) is usually linked to the sun goddess rather than the dawn goddess, there is a possible degree of syncretism in this regard, particularly as the Baltic Aušrinė is in a similar marriage drama situation, albeit in relation to her father and her mother.\n\nDue to the dawn heralding the sun and inducing the daily routine, the Dawn Goddess is associated with instilling the cosmic order. Ushas is the arouser of Ṛta, while the role of Aušrinė as the maid of the sun renders her a moral example in Lithuanian traditions and helped her syncretism with the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe Dawn Goddess was probably the original love and lust deity in Proto-Indo-European religion, an aspect maintained in nearly all reflexes but noticeably lost in later stages of Hellenic and Indu myth (Eos replaced by Aphrodite and Eros, Ushas replaced by Kamadeva). Notably, the Greek myth of Aphrodite cursing Eos with lust may be a representation of usurpation of the role as love goddess by the former.\n\nIn spite of the association of the dawn with life, counterintuitively the dawn was possibly also associated with aging and decay in Proto-Indo-European myth, probably under the assumption that each dawn brings human beings closer to death or alternatively that sun rays induce rot. In the Rig Veda, Ushas is \"The ancient goddess, born again and again, dressed in the same color, causes the mortal to age and wears away his life-span, as a cunning gambler carries off the stakes\" and \"Bringing old age, thou hast come, O unageing Dawn … Unageing, thou dost make to age all else\", while in Greek Mythology Eos famously asks Zeus for Tithonus to maintain his life but not his youth, reducing him to a cricket.\n\nThe birch tree is consistently associated with purity, spring, moral purity and light in Indo-European religions, indicating that it was possibly emblematic of the Dawn Goddess.\n\nThe Dawn Goddess was associated with weaving, a behaviour sometimes used as a metaphor for the generative properties of sunlight.

The office was rendered in Latin documents as \"capitalis plegius\" (\"chief pledge\") or \"decennarius\" (\"tenner\").\n\nIn the Anglo-Saxon system of frankpledge, or \"frith-borh\", the headborough presided over the borhsmen in his jurisdiction, who in turn presided over the local tithingmen. Frankpledge was a system that existed to create an incentive for a tithing to police itself, and consequently, the headborough was effectively obliged to police his tithing, as well as dealing with more administrative matters. By the early 16th century, it had evolved into the position of parish constable, a parochial officer subordinate to a hundred-constable.\n\nAlthough the parish constable and hundred-constable share the term \"constable\", the two roles had different functions, and origins. While the hundred-constable originated from senior military officers enforcing civil order, the parish constable had a wide range of civil administration functions in addition to a recognisable policing role. It is the hundred-constable which originated the term \"constable\", and the parish constable acquired it by comparison; where the term \"headborough\" or \"chief pledge\" is used in contrast to a \"constable\", the term \"constable\" is likely to refers specifically to the role of a hundred-constable.\n\nIn this sense it is found in the induction to Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (written c. 1590–92), when the Hostess of an alehouse, arguing with a drunken troublemaker, declares, \"I know my remedie, I must go fetch the Headborough\" (Induction, i); and again in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (written c. 1598–9), where the dramatis personae describes Verges as a Headborough, subordinate to Constable Dogberry (Act 3, scene 5).\n\n"}

All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome. The version 18 (launched December 1, 2017) consists of three separate parts, each focusing on a particular aspect of the genome-wide analysis of the human proteins; the Tissue Atlas showing the distribution of the proteins across all major tissues and organs in the human body, the Cell Atlas showing the subcellular localization of proteins in single cells, and finally the new Pathology Atlas showing the impact of protein levels for survival of patients with cancer. The Human Protein Atlas program has already contributed to several thousands of publications in the field of human biology and disease and it was recently (July 25, 2017) selected by the organization ELIXIR as a European core resource due to its fundamental importance for a wider life science community. The HPA consortium is funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.\n\nThe Human Protein Atlas consists of three sub-atlases:\n\nThe Tissue Atlas: contains information regarding the expression profiles of human genes both on the mRNA and protein level. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based protein profiling using immunohistochemistry. Altogether 76 different cell types, corresponding to 44 normal human tissue types, have been analyzed and the data is presented as pathology-based annotation of protein expression levels. All underlying images of immunohistochemistry stained normal tissues are available as high-resolution images in the normal tissue atlas.\n\nThe Cell Atlas: provides high-resolution insights into the spatial distribution of proteins within cells. The protein expression data is derived from antibody-based profiling using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. A panel of 56 cell lines, selected to represent various cell populations in different organs of the human body, forms the basis of the Cell Atlas. In this cell line panel the mRNA expression of all human genes have been characterized using deep RNA-sequencing. The subcellular distribution of proteins is investigated in a subset of the cell lines, and classified into 32 different organelles and fine cellular structures.\n\nThe Pathology Atlas: is based on the analysis of 17 main cancer types using data from 8,000 patients. In addition, a new concept for showing patient survival data is introduced, called Interactive Survival Scatter plots, and the atlas includes more than 400,000 such plots. A national supercomputer center was used to analyze more than 2.5 petabytes of underlying publicly available data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to generate more than 900,000 survival plots describing the consequence of RNA and protein levels on clinical survival. The Pathology Atlas also contains 5 million pathology-based images generated by the Human Protein Atlas consortium.\n\nThe Human Protein Atlas program was started in 2003 and funded by the non-profit organization Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW). The main site of the project is the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), School of Biotechnology (Stockholm, Sweden). Professor Mathias Uhlén is the director of the program.\n\nThe research underpinning the start of the exploration of the whole human proteome in the Human Protein Atlas program was carried out in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A pilot study employing an affinity proteomics strategy using affinity-purified antibodies raised against recombinant human protein fragments was carried out for a chromosome-wide protein profiling of chromosome 21. Other projects were also carried out to establish processes for parallel and automated affinity purification of mono-specific antibodies and their validation.\n\nAntibodies and antigens, produced in the Human Protein Atlas workflow, are used in research projects to study potential biomarkers in various diseases, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, ovarian cancer and renal failure.\n\nThe Human Protein Atlas program has participated in 9 EU research projects ENGAGE, PROSPECTS, BIO_NMD, AFFINOMICS, CAGEKID, EURATRANS, ITFoM, DIRECT and PRIMES.\n"}

If you find PBIs that are tightly dependent, a good idea might be to combine them into a single PBI.\n\nThe only thing that is fixed and set in stone in an agile project is an iteration backlog (and, even then, this \"can be clarified and re-negotiated... as more is learned.\"). While the PBI lies in the product backlog, it can be rewritten or even discarded, depending on business, market, technical or any other type of requirement by team members.\n\nThe focus here is to bring actual project-related value to the stakeholder. Coming up with technical PBIs that are really fun to code but bring no value to the stakeholders violates one of the Agile Principles, which is to continuously deliver valuable software.\n\nIf a PBI size cannot be estimated, it will never be planned or tasked; thus, it will never become part of an iteration. So, there's actually no point in keeping this kind of PBI in the Product Backlog at all. Most of the time, estimation cannot be executed due to the lack of supporting information either in the story description itself or directly from the Product Owner.\n\nTry to keep your PBI sizes to typically a few person-days and at most a few person-weeks (a good rule of thumb is that any single Product Backlog Item does not take more than 50% of an iteration; for example a single item won't take more than 5 days for a 2 week / 10 day sprint). Anything beyond that range should be considered too large to be estimated with a good level of certainty - Scrum calls these large PBIs \"Epics\" where an Epic will take more than one iteration to deliver and, necessarily, will need to be broken down into smaller PBIs that can fit comfortably within Iterations. There's no problem in starting with epic PBIs, as long as they are broken down when the time to place them in an iteration backlog comes closer. This implements Lean's Just In Time analysis concept.\n\nBear in mind that a PBI should only be considered DONE, among other things, if it was tested successfully. If one cannot test a PBI due to lack of information (see \"Estimable\" above), the PBI should not be considered a good candidate to be part of an iteration Backlog. This is especially true for teams employing TDD - Test Driven Development.\n\n"}

The findings are presented in units of global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated by that source. The scale uses the global warming potential unit, the carbon dioxide equivalent (e), and the unit of electrical energy, the kilowatt hour (kWh). The goal of such assessments is to cover the full life of the source, from material and fuel mining through construction to operation and waste management.\n\nIn 2014, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change harmonized the carbon dioxide equivalent (e) findings of the major electricity generating sources in use worldwide. This was done by analyzing the findings of hundreds of individual scientific papers assessing each energy source.\n\nFor all technologies, advances in efficiency, and therefore reductions in e since the time of publication, have not been included. For example, the total life cycle emissions from wind power may have lessened since publication. Similarly, due to the time frame over which the studies were conducted, nuclear Generation II reactor's e results are presented and not the global warming potential of Generation III reactors, presently under construction in the United States and China. Other limitations of the data include: a) missing life cycle phases, and, b) uncertainty as to where to define the cut-off point in the global warming potential of an energy source. The latter is important in assessing a combined electrical grid in the real world, rather than the established practice of simply assessing the energy source in isolation.\n\n see also environmental impact of reservoirs#Greenhouse gases.\n\nA Yale University review of hundreds of prior papers, as published in the \"Journal of Industrial Ecology\" analyzing life cycle assessment (LCA) emissions from nuclear power determined: \"The collective LCA literature indicates that life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies.\" The study also noted that for the most common category of reactors, the Light water reactor: \"Harmonization decreased the median estimate for all LWR technology categories so that the medians of BWRs, PWRs, and all LWRs are similar, at approximately 12 g -eq/kWh.\n\nSpeaking of the numerous assumptions and therefore wide results returned by authors of previous individual studies, the Warner and Heath Yale paper states: \"the difference between nuclear power life cycle GHG emissions constructed in an electric system dominated by nuclear (or renewables) and a system dominated by coal can be fairly large (in the range of 4 to 22 g -eq/kWh compared to 30 to 110 g -eq/kWh, respectively)\". The already established electric grid being a necessary input to drive the uranium enrichment systems.\n\nWith Figure 4 of the paper, expanding on these figures, displaying the median result returned from these other papers as approximately 35 g -eq/kWh when a nation's background electricity \"energy mix\" is \"high carbon\" that is, primarily coal powered, combined with a slightly lower than typical uranium ore grade input in the range of 0.01% U3O8. To put this number in perspective, average uranium ores are between 0.05% to 0.40% U3O8, with the ore at the most productive uranium mine in the world, McArthur River uranium mine, at approximately 15.76%. The high rate of near 110 grams of GHGs mentioned in this Yale paper, as shown in Figure 4 and discussed in the body of the article, is derived from what the authors consider to be a \"worst-case scenario\" that is not \"considered very robust\". As it is inclusive of a combination of unrealistic factors not seen in any country. This is, a high coal usage in the electricity energy-mix combined with the terrestrial mining by conventional methods, of ultra low-grade \"uranium ore\" with a \"0.0001%\" concentration of U3O8.\n\nAs a way to put this \"ore\" concentration into perspective, vast quantities of presently uneconomical uranium in many lignite coal ashes have uranium concentrations five times greater than this. On the other hand, the 4 g -eq/kWh rate mentioned in the body of the paper is, again as Figure 4 shows, a result of an electricity energy-mix that is already low-carbon combined with a more typical, but still low, uranium ore grade of 0.01% U3O8. This combination is considerably different than the hypothetical \"worse-case scenario\" of 110 grams, as this latter combination is seen in some select countries. Namely Sweden, Switzerland and the French electricity grid as the most prominent. With this close to 4 gram value, reported by the Swedish Vattenfall study discussed below.\n\nIn the most common and pertinent case of GHG data from countries with a \"medium carbon\" intensity electric grid and input ores of about 0.01%. The median value of GHG emissions was determined to be about 9 grams, as depicted in figure 4 of the Yale paper, when the now world-standard \"centrifuge\" enrichment approach alone, is assessed. In 2013 the other less economic approach of \"diffusion\" enrichment, that is similarly depicted in figure 4 was retired worldwide. When it operated the median GHG value that the Yale analyst's depict for this old technology was about 15 grams under the same \"medium carbon\" grid conditions.\n\nThe authors of the Yale paper also note that a \"similar but less extreme dynamic relationship between ore grades and fossil energy consumption could apply to rare-earth materials used in some renewable technologies\".\n\nLastly, although the paper primarily dealt with data derived from legacy Generation II reactors, it did also summarize the Life Cycle Assessment literature of more advanced reactor designs, of which presently only small numbers are in operation, e.g. the BN-800. \"\"Fast Breeder Reactors\" have been evaluated in the LCA literature. The limited literature that evaluates this potential future technology reports median life cycle GHG emissions... similar to or lower than LWRs and purports to consume little or no uranium ore.\"\n\nA literature review conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2011, of numerous energy sources emissions per unit of electricity generated, found that the emission values that fell within the 50th percentile of all total life cycle emissions studies were as follows.\n\nA meta analysis of 103 nuclear power life-cycle studies by Benjamin K. Sovacool found that nuclear power plants produce electricity with a mean of 66 g equivalent life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions per kWh, compared to renewable power generators, which produce electricity with 9.5 to 38 g carbon dioxide per kWh, and fossil-fuel power stations, which produce electricity with about 443 to 1,050 g equivalent life cycle carbon dioxide emissions per kWh. Sovacool thus concludes that nuclear energy technologies are seven to sixteen times more effective at fighting climate change than fossil fuel power plants on a per-kWh basis. Renewable electricity technologies are \"two to seven times more effective than nuclear power plants on a per kWh basis at fighting climate change.\" Sovacool has said that his estimates already include all conceivable emissions associated with the manufacturing, construction, installation and decommissioning of renewable power plants.\n\nSovacool has been criticized by his peers, as it was noted that his paper was overly based on data from Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen. Beerten et al. state:\n\"Most recently, Sovacool (2008) calculated a mean value for the overall emissions by averaging the global results of 19 LCA [Life-Cycle Analysis] studies forming a subset of, as stated by the author, 'the most current, original and transparent studies' out of 103 studies. However, a critical assessment reveals that a majority of the studies representing the upper part of the spectrum are studies that can be traced back to the same input data and performed by the same author, namely Storm van Leeuwen. After careful analysis, it must be concluded that the mix of selected LCAs results in a skewed and distorted collection of different results available in the literature. Furthermore, since many studies use different energy mixes and other assumptions, averaging GHG emissions of those studies is no sound method to calculate an overall emission coefficient, as it gives no site specific information needed for policy makers to base their decisions.\"\n\nBeerten, et al., proceed to discuss reasons why LCA analysis for nuclear power plants can give such widely varying estimates. For example, life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of nuclear power depend on the enrichment method, the carbon intensity of the electricity used for enrichment, the efficiency of the plant, as well as on chosen mining technologies. Averages and means from multiple sources can be skewed by inharmonious data, clustering bias, by outliers and so on.\n\nThere have been responses to these criticisms, particularly in reference to Sovacool applying his methodology to nuclear power but using other researchers' results, from different methodologies, as the source of the above-tabled Wind and Solar energy figures. For example, Sovacool and his colleague Daniel Nugent would embark on studying these other energy sources by the same methodology in 2013. Their paper reports that wind energy has a mean value of 34.11 grams of CO-eq/kWh and solar PV a mean value of 49.91 grams of CO-eq/kWh, with the minimum for wind being 0.4 g and the maximum 364.8 g and a minimum for Solar PV of 1 g and a maximum of 218 g.\n\nAlthough the life cycle assessments of each energy source should attempt to cover the full life cycle of the source from cradle-to-grave, they are generally limited to the construction and operation phase. The most rigorously studied phases are those of material and fuel mining, construction, operation, and waste management. However, missing life cycle phases exist for a number of energy sources. At times, assessments variably and sometimes inconsistently include the global warming potential that results from decommissioning the energy supplying facility, once it has reached its designed life-span. This includes the global warming potential of the process to return the power-supply site to greenfield status. For example, the process of hydroelectric dam removal is usually excluded as it is a rare practice with little practical data available. Dam removal however may become increasingly common as dams age. An example of this is the decommissioning of the Bull Run Hydroelectric Project, which was the largest concrete dam ever removed in the United States as of 2012. Larger dams, such as the Hoover Dam and the Three Gorges Dam, are intended to last \"forever\" with the aid of maintenance, a period that is not quantified. Therefore, decommissioning estimates are generally omitted for some energy sources, while other energy sources include a decommissioning phase in their assessments.\n\nAlong with the other prominent values of the paper, the median value presented of 12 g -eq/kWhe for nuclear fission, found in the 2012 Yale University nuclear power review, a paper which also serves as the origin of the 2014 IPCC's nuclear value, does however include the contribution of facility decommissioning with an \"Added facility decommissioning\" global warming potential in the full nuclear life cycle assessment.\n\nIndividual studies show a wide range of estimates for fuel sources arising from the different methodologies used. Those on the low end tend to leave parts of the life cycle out of their analysis, while those on the high end often make unrealistic assumptions about the amount of energy used in some parts of the life cycle.\n\nIn 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that total life-cycle GHG emissions per unit of electricity produced from nuclear power are below 40 g -eq/kWh (10 g C-eq/kWh), similar to those for renewable energy sources. The Swedish utility Vattenfall did a study in 1999 of full life cycle emissions of nuclear, hydro, coal, gas, solar cell, peat, and wind. All the energy sources that the electricity utility actively has experience using to generate electricity. The findings of their study showed that nuclear power produced 3.3 grams of carbon dioxide per kW-hr of produced power. This compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO of any of their electricity sources.\n\nAnother report, \"Life-Cycle Energy Balance and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Nuclear Energy in Australia,\" conducted by the University of Sydney in 2008, produced the following results: nuclear = 60-65 g /kWh; wind power = 20 g/kWh; solar PV = 106 g/kWh. The likely range of values from this study produced the following results: nuclear = 10-130 g /kWh; wind power = 13-40 g /kWh; solar PV = 53-217 g /kWh. Furthermore, the study criticised the Vattenfall report: \"it omits the energy and greenhouse gas impacts of many upstream [mining] contributions.\" In a study conducted in 2006 by the UK's Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST), which used figures from Torness Nuclear Power Station-an Advanced gas-cooled reactor, nuclear power's life cycle was evaluated to emit the least amount of carbon dioxide (very close to wind power's life cycle emissions) when compared to the other alternatives (fossil fuel, coal, and some renewable energy including biomass and PV solar panels).\nA 2005 study, by Jan Willem Storm van Leeuwen, reported that carbon dioxide emissions from nuclear power plants per kilowatt hour could range from 20% to 120% of those for natural gas-fired power stations depending on the availability of high grade ores. Although the study was heavily criticized, the paper was used by anti-nuclear organizations to claim that nuclear power is not suitable for a warming world.\n\nHigh electric grid penetration by intermittent power sources (e.g. wind power) which have low capacity factors due to the weather, requires either: a) the construction of energy storage projects, which have their own emission intensity, or b) more frequent back up than the reserve requirements necessary to back up more dependable/baseload power sources, such as hydropower and nuclear energy. This higher dependence on back up/load following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output has the knock-on effect of more frequent inefficient (in e g/kWh) throttling up and down of these other power sources in the grid to facilitate the intermittent, or variable output, of these energy supplying systems. When one includes the total effect of these intermittent sources as it pertains to the other power sources in the grid system, that is, including the inefficient start-up emissions of the backup power supplies to cater for wind energy; into wind energy's total system-wide life cycle, the result is a higher real-world wind energy emission intensity than the calculated and isolated wind energy g/kWh value. As these calculations look at the wind power source in isolation and exclude all down stream detrimental/inefficiency effects on the grid. In a 2012 paper in the \"Journal of Industrial Ecology\", Dolan and Heath state:\n\nThermal power plants, that is, those that produce thermal/heat energy, with common low carbon power examples such as biomass, nuclear and geothermal energy stations, directly add heat energy to the earth's global energy balance. According to David JC MacKay, assuming that all future energy is derived from these thermal power stations operating with their present thermal efficiency of ~30%, and that the world population is 10 billion in 100 years time (~2100) with each individual enjoying a per capita energy usage rate similar to that of the average European standard of living of 125 kWh per day, the extra power contributed by this thermal energy use to the planet would be a global surface area average of 0.1 Watt per square meter, which is one fortieth of the 4 W/m that is believed to be likely if a doubling of atmospheric CO concentrations occur, and a little smaller than the \"0.25 W/m effect\" of Solar variations. \"Under these assumptions, human power production would \"just\" show up as a contributor to global climate change.\"\n\nAn MIT peer-reviewed study suggested that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could have a warming effect, causing temperatures to rise by in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions. This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulation. While turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of . Author Ron Prinn said that the study hadn't conclusively proved this and cautioned against interpreting the study \"as an argument against wind power.\" He urged instead that it guide future research. \n\nWhile observations of the regional temperature increase from the operation of wind farms has since become incontrovertible. Models on projections for 2020 and 2030 have found varying levels of effects depending on placement and the percentage contribution to total electricity generation.

Peoni, 100 F.2d 401 (2d Cir. 1938), was a criminal case that the prosecution must establish that the mental state (mens rea) of an accomplice to a crime include a purpose to aid or encourage, and thereby facilitate the criminal conduct of the principal. This showing of purpose is contrasted with showing knowledge that the principal would commit the crime, which does not necessarily imply that the purpose of acting to aid or abet was to facilitate the criminal act of the principal.\n\nThe defendant Peoni possessed bills that he knew to be counterfeit. He sold the bills to Regno, and Regno sold the bills to Dorsey. Dorsey was arrested with the bills while trying to pass them in Brooklyn. At the trial level, Peoni was convicted as an accomplice to Dorsey's possession of the counterfeit bills.\n\nIn an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, the Second Circuit reversed Peoni's conviction. The court looked to the statute under which Peoni was indicted, 18 U.S.C. § 550 (the predecessor to 18 U.S.C. § 2), which punished anyone who \"aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures\" the commission of a crime. The court read this language to require purpose, and held that Peoni had no purpose regarding the use of the counterfeit bills once he had passed them to Regno. Peoni had no purpose regarding Dorsey's possession because Regno was free to do whatever he wanted with the bills.\n"}
