{"id": "9423557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9423557", "title": "Act of Independence of Lithuania", "text": "Act of Independence of Lithuania\n\nThe Act of Reinstating Independence of Lithuania () or Act of 16 February was signed by the Council of Lithuania on 16 February 1918, proclaiming the restoration of an independent State of Lithuania, governed by democratic principles, with Vilnius as its capital. The Act was signed by all twenty representatives of the Council, which was chaired by Jonas Basanavičius. The Act of 16 February was the result of a series of resolutions on the issue, including one issued by the Vilnius Conference and the Act of 8 January. The path to the Act was long and complex because the German Empire exerted pressure on the Council to form an alliance. The Council had to carefully maneuver between the Germans, whose troops were present in Lithuania, and the demands of the Lithuanian people.\n\nThe immediate effects of the announcement of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence were limited. Publication of the Act was prohibited by the German authorities, and the text was distributed and printed illegally. The work of the Council was hindered, and Germans remained in control over Lithuania. The situation changed only when Germany lost World War I in the fall of 1918. In November 1918 the first Cabinet of Lithuania was formed, and the Council of Lithuania gained control over the territory of Lithuania. Independent Lithuania, although it would soon be battling the Wars of Independence, became a reality.\n\nThe laconic Act is the legal basis for the existence of modern Lithuania, both during the interwar period and since 1990. The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all Constitutions of Lithuania. The Act itself was a key element in the foundation of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence in 1990. Lithuania, breaking away from the Soviet Union, stressed that it was simply re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.\n\nOn 29 March 2017, the original document was found at the Diplomatic archive in Berlin, Germany.\n\nLithuania had a centuries long tradition of statehood following the coronation of Mindaugas the King of Lithuania.\nAfter the last Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, both the Lithuanians and the Poles attempted to restore their independence. Lithuanians rebelled during the 1830 November Uprising and the 1863 January Uprising, but their first real opportunity arose when both Russia and Germany were weakened during World War I.\n\nIn 1915, Germany occupied western parts of the Russian Empire. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Germany conceived the geopolitical strategy of Mitteleuropa – a regional network of puppet states that would serve as a buffer zone – and agreed to allow the Vilnius Conference, hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to detach itself from Russia and establish a closer relationship with Germany. However, this strategy backfired; the conference, held on 18–22 September 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would be conditional on Germany's formal recognition of the new state. On 21 September, the 214 attendees at the conference elected a 20-member Council of Lithuania to codify this resolution. The German authorities did not allow that resolution to be published, but they did permit the Council to proceed. The Vilnius Conference also resolved that a constituent assembly be elected \"in conformity with democratic principles by all the inhabitants of Lithuania\".\n\nThe Act of 11 December was the second stage in the progression towards the final Act of Independence. The first draft, demanded by chancellor Georg von Hertling, was prepared by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 1. Further changes were jointly prepared by the German chancellery and by a delegation of the Council of Lithuania. The delegation's members were Antanas Smetona, Steponas Kairys, Vladas Mironas, Jurgis Šaulys, Petras Klimas and Aleksandras Stulginskis. After discussion amongst the parties, a compromise was reached on the document's text. The German representative, Kurt von Lersner, insisted that not one word be changed in the agreed-upon text and that all the Council members sign the document.\n\nAfter the delegation returned to Vilnius, a session of the Council was held on 11 December in order to discuss the Act. It was adopted without any further changes. Fifteen voted in favor of the Act, three voted against it, one member abstained, and one did not participate. It is not entirely clear whether every member of the Council signed this document. The Act was written in German, and apparently no official Lithuanian translation was prepared. Therefore, different sources provide slightly different translations. The Act of 11 December pronounced Lithuania's independence, but also asked German government for protection (clause 2) and called for \"a firm and permanent alliance\" with Germany. Since the Act specified that the alliance was to be formed based on conventions concerning military affairs, transportation, customs, and currency, many Lithuanians argued that the Council had overstepped its authority: the September resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference clearly demanded that a constituent assembly decide these crucial matters of state.\n\nWhen peace talks started between Germany and Russia in 1918, German authorities asked the Lithuanian representatives to prepare two notifications of independence—one for Russia, in which Lithuania's ties with Russia would be denounced and nothing would be mentioned about an alliance with Germany, and a version to be released in Germany that would essentially repeat the Act of 11 December. The Council decided to amend the first part of the Act of 11 December. Petras Klimas included a sentence calling for the Constituent Assembly. Another important development was the statement that democratic principles would be the basis of the new state's governance, something that was declared by the Vilnius Conference, but omitted in the Act of 11 December. The second part, mentioning the \"firm and permanent alliance with Germany\", was completely omitted. Its final version was approved on 8 January 1918, the day that U.S. President Woodrow Wilson announced his Fourteen Points. In its essence, the Act of 8 January did not differ from the Act of 16 February.\n\nHowever, Ober Ost, the German military administration, rejected the changes. On 26 January, in compliance with the earlier request, the two versions of the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of 8 January. The texts were prepared based on the Act of 11 December. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the council members. Four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the Council in protest. Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of 11 December, stepped down. Jonas Basanavičius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected chairman.\n\nGermany failed to recognize Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations that started on 22 December 1917, between the Central Powers and Russia in order to settle territorial claims. During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was made clear that the Council would serve only as an advisory board. This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.\n\nThe four withdrawn members demanded that the Council return to the Act of 8 January and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany. After heated debates that lasted for several weeks, on 15 February, at 10 am, the new revision of the Act was ready. It included, with minor stylistic changes, wording of the Act of 8 January and promulgation and notification, drafted on 1 February. Promulgation and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change the meaning of a legal document. The Council, including the withdrawn members, was invited to return the next day for its finalization. On the next day, 16 February 1918, at 12:30 pm, all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims, at 30 Didžioji Street in Vilnius. The building has since been known as the House of the Signatories () and houses a museum. The Council first voted to approve the first part, the first two paragraphs up to the word \"drauge\", of the Act. This section was approved unanimously. The second part, however, did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word \"\"finally\" in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly (in \"... the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other countries will be finally determined by the Constituent Assembly ...\"\"). They were afraid that this word would give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly, while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non-negotiable and non-appealable nature of the future Assembly's decisions. Therefore, the Act was unanimously approved \"en bloc\" but did not have full-fledged support from all twenty men.\n\n\"Note: the colors of the functional sections correspond to the colored lines in the original text above.\"\n\nSoon after the signing, the Act was taken to Germany and handed to parties in the Reichstag. On 18 February, the text was reprinted in German newspapers, including \"Das Neue Litauen\", \"Vossische Zeitung\", \"Taegliche Rundschau\" and \"Kreuzzeitung\". In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers, particularly in \"Lietuvos aidas\", the Council's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona; but the German authorities prohibited this publication. Although the majority of the copies of the issue were confiscated, the newspaper's editor, Petras Klimas, managed to hide about 60 of them.\n\nOn 3 March 1918, Germany and the now-Bolshevik Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It declared that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On 23 March, Germany recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the 11 December declaration. However, in substance, nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish an administration were hindered. This situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on 2 November. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania. Complete international recognition took several years; the US affirmed it on 22 July 1922.\n\nTwo copies of the Act were signed: the original and a duplicate. The original was given to Jonas Basanavičius to safeguard and protect. The original was never published or used in any public matters; its existence was first mentioned in the press in 1933. The duplicate was used in day-to-day business, and was stored in the president's archives until 15 June 1940, the day when Lithuania received an ultimatum from the Soviet Union and lost its independence. After that date the document disappeared. Both the original and the duplicate were missing for decades; historians and adventurers hunted for them. In 2006, a team of engineers searched the walls of the former house of Petras Vileišis. Two facsimiles of the duplicate were produced, one in 1928 and the other in 1933. The 1928 facsimile is a closer reproduction of the Act in its original state. It contains spelling errors and the background is visually \"noisy\", while the 1933 facsimile shows the Act in an \"improved\" condition.\n\nIn 2017, Lithuanian businessman Darius Mockus offered a 1-million-Euro reward to anyone who could find the original document and give it to the State of Lithuania. The offer's deadline was set to 16 February 2018, when Lithuania will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its declaration of independence. On 29 March 2017, Vytautas Magnus University professor Liudas Mažylis announced he had found the original document in the Federal Foreign Office Political Archive in Berlin, Germany, hand-written in the Lithuanian language and signed by the twenty. He also announced that he had found the German-language version of the 16 February 1918 document and the Act of 11 December 1917. The latter displays nineteen signatures (without that of Pranas Dovydaitis). Germany confirmed the documents' authenticity on the following day and they were displayed publicly by two officials — Michael Roth, the German Minister of State for Europe, and Deividas Matulionis, Lithuania ambassador in Germany. On 5 October 2017, Lithuania Minister of Foreign Affairs Linas Linkevičius and Germany Minister of Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel signed an agreement that the original Act of Independence will be displayed for five years in the House of the Signatories where it was originally signed, making it the main symbol of the Lithuania's Centenary of the Restoration of the State celebrations. On 22 December 2017, experts from the Lithuanian Police Forensic Research Center after a thorough analysis announced that the hand-written act was written by one of the signatories Jurgis Šaulys hand.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, yet another version of the Act of Independence of Lithuania was found by historian Darius Antanavičius in the Vatican Secret Archives that was sent to the Holy See. This version of the Act was printed in German language and signed by Antanas Smetona, Jonas Vileišis, Jurgis Šaulys and Justinas Staugaitis.\n\nMost of the signatories of the Act remained active in the cultural and political life of independent Lithuania. Jonas Vileišis served in the Seimas and as mayor of Kaunas, temporary capital of Lithuania; Saliamonas Banaitis was involved in finance, opening several banks. Among the signatories were two future Presidents of Lithuania, Antanas Smetona and Aleksandras Stulginskis. Jonas Basanavičius, chairman of the Council of Lithuania, returned to an academic life, pursuing his research in Lithuanian culture and folklore. Five signatories died before World War II started; three died during the Nazi occupation. Those who did not emigrate to Western countries became political prisoners after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union.\n\nAleksandras Stulginskis and Petras Klimas were sent to prison in Siberia by Soviet authorities, but survived and returned to Lithuania; Pranas Dovydaitis and Vladas Mironas were also sent to Siberia but died there. Kazys Bizauskas disappeared during the summer of 1941 while being transported to a Soviet prison in Minsk; he is presumed to have been shot along with a number of other prisoners. Donatas Malinauskas was deported to Russia on 14 June 1941.\n\nSeveral of the surviving signatories emigrated. Jurgis Šaulys and Kazimieras Steponas Šaulys died in Switzerland. Antanas Smetona, Mykolas Biržiška, and Steponas Kairys emigrated to the United States and are buried there.\n\nThe Act of 16 February proclaimed the \"re\"-establishment (\"atstatyti\") of the Lithuanian state, making it the successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (\"sudaryti\") of a Lithuanian state. However, it was made clear that the new state would be quite different from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands (except for the Vilnius region which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by democratic principles, as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish-Lithuanian union.\n\nThe Act of 16 February 1918, is the legal basis for the existence of present-day Lithuania, both during the interwar period and since 1990. The Act became one of the key elements during the restoration of Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. A paragraph in the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, delivered on 11 March 1990, stated:\nThis formulation emphasized the continuity of the two legal Acts. The Act of 16 February 1918, and its successor, the Act of 11 March 1990, are regarded as two of the most important developments of Lithuanian society in the 20th century.\n\n16 February in Lithuania is an official holiday. On this day various ceremonies are hosted all across Lithuania. The 2014 commemoration included laying flowers at the signatories’ graves in Rasos Cemetery, awarding the Lithuanian National Prize, the hoisting of the three Baltic States’s flags at Daukantas Square, dedicated concerts at Cathedral Square in Vilnius and at the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society hall, and the lighting of 16 fires along Gediminas Avenue.\n\nIn 1992, an award was established in honor of Jonas Basanavičius, who led the Council of Lithuania when the Act of 16 February was signed. The Jonas Basanavičius Prize is bestowed for distinguished work within the previous five years in the fields of ethnic and cultural studies.\n\n"}

{"id": "4190430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4190430", "title": "Alte Nationalgalerie", "text": "Alte Nationalgalerie\n\nThe Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) in Berlin is an art gallery showing a collection of Neoclassical, Romantic, Biedermeier, Impressionist and early Modernist artwork, part of the Berlin National Gallery, which in turn is part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. It is the original building of the National Gallery, whose holdings are now housed in several additional buildings. It is situated on Museum Island, a UNESCO-designated World Heritage site.\n\nThe first impetus to founding a national gallery came in 1815. The idea gained momentum during the 1830s, but without an actual building. In 1841 the first real plans were created. These plans never made it out of the planning stages, but finally in 1861 the National Gallery was founded, after banker Johann Heinrich Wagener donated 262 paintings by both German and foreign artists. This donation formed the basis of the current collection. The collection was first known as \"Wagenersche und Nationalgalerie\" (Wagener and National Gallery) and was housed in the buildings of the Akademie der Künste. The current building, shaped like a Roman temple with an appended apse, was designed by Friedrich August Stüler and after his death, realised in detail under Carl Busse.\n\nFriedrich August Stüler began working on a design for the building in 1863, based on a sketch by King Frederick William IV of Prussia. Two years and two failed plans later, his third proposal was finally accepted. Stüler died before planning was completed and Carl Busse handled the remaining details in 1865. In 1866, by order of the king and his cabinet, the \"Kommission für den Bau der Nationalgalerie\" (Commission for the construction of the national gallery) was created. Ground was broken in 1867 under the supervision of Heinrich Strack. In 1872 the structure was completed and interior work began. The opening took place on March 22, 1876 in the presence of the Kaiser.\n\nBecause of the building's modern construction using brick and iron, it was widely believed to be fireproof. The exterior and outer staircase were constructed of Triassic sandstone from Nebra. At the opening the collection was still relatively small. Next to Wagener's collection, originally, was a display of cartoons by Peter von Cornelius that had been bequeathed to the Prussian government. The initial objective of the gallery was to collect contemporary, primarily Prussian art, as Berlin did not then have any repository of modern art.\n\nIn 1874 Max Jordan became the first director of the National Gallery. In 1896 he was succeeded by Hugo von Tschudi, who acquired Impressionist works, risking conflict with the Kaiser because this ended the collection's focus on German art. The German National Gallery thus became the most important museum for modern French Art at the turn of the century.\n\nIn 1909, Ludwig Justi assumed the post of director, and added Expressionist works to the collection. Following the German Revolution of 1918–19 that ended Imperial rule, he moved the modern art to the Kronprinzenpalais at the end of Unter den Linden, which became known as \"National Gallery II\".\n\nIn 1933, the new Nazi authorities dismissed Justi, who was followed by Eberhard Hanfstaengl. He remained until 1937, when he too was dismissed. His successor, Paul Ortwin Rave, remained until 1950, although because of World War II the building was closed during much of that time. It was heavily damaged in Allied air raids. It was partly reopened in 1949, but reconstruction continued until 1969. Between 1998 and 2001, the museum was renovated thoroughly by German architect HG Merz. Some extra halls were added on the uppermost floor and now contain the Romantic works. The three-year, $62 million renovation of the Alte Nationalgalerie was part of a refurbishment of Museum Island and the energetic effort by government and private institutions to re-establish Berlin as Germany's political and cultural heart.\n\nThe Alte Nationalgalerie, together with the Altes Museum, the Neues Museum, the Bode Museum, the Pergamon Museum, the Berlin Cathedral and the Lustgarten, make up the Museum Island complex in Berlin. It is situated in the middle of the island, between the rails of the Berlin Stadtbahn and Bode Street on the eastern banks.\n\nIt is connected to the Pergamon Museum to the north, and to the Neues Museum, the Altes Museum, and the Berlin Cathedral to the south. The building was designed by Friedrich August Stüler with details by Carl Busse, in an architectural style that is a mix between late Classicism and early Neo-Renaissance, and realised by Heinrich Strack. It was intended to express \"the unity of art, nation, and history\", and therefore has aspects reminiscent of a church (an apse) and a theatre (the grand staircase) as well as a temple. An equestrian statue of Frederick William IV tops the stairs, and the inside stairs have a frieze by Otto Geyer depicting German history from prehistoric times to the 19th century. The exterior of the building still retains its original appearance, whereas the interior has been renovated many times in order to suit the exhibits.\n\nThe collection contains works of the Neoclassical and Romantic movements (by artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, and Karl Blechen), of the Biedermeier, French Impressionism (such as Édouard Manet and Claude Monet) and early Modernism (including Adolph von Menzel, Max Liebermann and Lovis Corinth). Among the most important exhibits are Friedrich's \"Der Mönch am Meer\" (The Monk by the Sea), von Menzel's \"Eisenwalzwerk\" (The Iron Rolling Mill) and sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow's \"Prinzessinnengruppe\", a double statue of princesses Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Frederica of Prussia. The Alte Nationalgalerie houses one of the largest collections of 19th-century sculptures and paintings in Germany.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film stars John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener, with John Malkovich and Charlie Sheen as themselves. The film follows a puppeteer who finds a portal that leads into Malkovich's mind.\n\nReleased by USA Films, the film was nominated in three categories at the 72nd Academy Awards: Best Director for Jonze, Best Original Screenplay for Kaufman and Best Supporting Actress for Keener.\n\nCraig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife Lotte. Gaining a file clerk job through Dr. Lester at LesterCorp, in the strange Floor low-ceiling offices of the Mertin-Flemmer Building in New York City, he develops an attraction to his coworker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. Craig discovers and enters a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet, and crawls down a tunnel. Suddenly he is quickly drawn into the opposite end of the tunnel, and finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich.\n\nCraig is able to observe and sense whatever Malkovich does for fifteen minutes before he is ejected and dropped into a ditch near the New Jersey Turnpike. He reveals the portal to Maxine, who sees the profit in it, and they let others use it for $200 a turn.\n\nCraig tells Lotte, who becomes obsessed with the experience, which had allowed her to live out her transgender desires. Lotte becomes attracted to Maxine when she is experiencing Malkovich, and she and Malkovich begin a sexual relationship with Lotte inside Malkovich's head while Maxine and Malkovich have sex. Craig, forsaken by both women, binds and gags Lotte and locks her in a cage with the chimpanzee, then enters Malkovich's mind and has sex with Maxine.\n\nSoon Craig, with his expert puppeteer skills, discovers that he is able to control Malkovich's actions while in his head. This causes the actor to feel paranoid that he is being controlled by someone else. After Malkovich consults with his friend Charlie Sheen, Malkovich trails Maxine to the Mertin-Flemmer building, where he himself tries the portal into his own head. He finds himself in a world where everyone has his face and they only say \"Malkovich\", and views his own lifetime history. He is then ejected and meets Craig by the turnpike. Malkovich demands that the portal be closed, but Craig refuses.\n\nLotte escapes with the help of her pet chimpanzee, who learned how to untie knots in Africa during a zoological capture, which is shown viewed from the chimpanzee's point of view. Lotte phones Maxine, revealing that it was Craig having sex with her while inside Malkovich. Maxine is annoyed but accepts it, because she enjoyed the experience.\n\nSeeking help, Lotte finds Lester, who reveals himself to be Captain Mertin, the original founder of LesterCorp. Lester is aware of the portal, and has a room dedicated to Malkovich's life. Lester explains that the person who is connected to the portal becomes \"ripe\" for lasting occupation by others on the eve of their 44th birthday. However, when the host turns 44, the portal immediately moves to its next host, an unborn child.\n\nIf it is possible for a person to take advantage of the \"ripe\" host and enter the portal then, one can greatly increase one's lifespan, and then one can eventually move on to another host. However, if one misses the brief window of \"ripeness\", and enters the portal even a minute too late, one will find oneself trapped within the unborn child who will be the next host. Lester, who has been using the portal in order to prolong his life, reveals his plan to use Malkovich when \"ripe\" as the host for him and several of his elderly friends. Offered the chance to join Lester's group, Lotte warns him that Craig currently has control of Malkovich.\n\nCraig finds he is able to remain in Malkovich indefinitely. He spends the next eight months in Malkovich's body, and using his puppeteer's control, he is able to turn Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer. Malkovich marries Maxine. He learns that she is pregnant as their relationship grows distant.\n\nAs Malkovich's 44th birthday approaches, Lester and his friends cut a deal with Maxine, and fake her kidnapping. They call up Craig, threatening to kill her if Craig does not leave Malkovich. Craig ends the call, causing Lester to think that he is calling their bluff. Lotte loses hope and attempts to kill Maxine, but they end up at the turnpike after falling through the portal and through Malkovich's shame-ridden subconscious. Maxine reveals to Lotte that Maxine conceived when Lotte was inside Malkovich's body, and she kept the child because it is \"theirs\". The revelation cements their love for each other.\n\nCraig calls Lester back, thinking Maxine is still in danger. Realizing his opportunity, Lester continues his bluff, convincing Craig to leave Malkovich's body. Lester and his friends enter the portal, taking control of Malkovich. Craig, discovering that Lotte and Maxine are together again, decides to enter the portal to become Malkovich and regain Maxine, however he has unknowingly missed the deadline for getting into Malkovich. Years later, an aging Malkovich, containing the collective mind of Lester and his friends, reveals to Sheen a plan to prolong their lives via Maxine's daughter Emily, within whom Craig is now permanently trapped. Through Emily's eyes Craig is forced to watch Maxine and Lotte living happily together as he futilely pleads that Emily look away.\n\nKaufman's idea of \"Being John Malkovich\" originated simply as \"a story about a man who falls in love with someone who is not his wife.\" Gradually he added further elements to the story which he found entertaining, such as floor 7½ of the Mertin Flemmer building; among his first ideas, Malkovich was \"nowhere to be seen\". He wrote the script on spec in 1994 and though it was widely read by production company and film studio executives, all turned it down. Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Spike Jonze.\n\nJonze first read the script in 1996 and had agreed to direct the film by 1997. Jonze brought the script to Propaganda Films, which agreed to produce the film in partnership with production company Single Cell Pictures. Single Cell producers Michael Stipe and Sandy Stern pitched the film to numerous studios, including New Line Cinema, who dropped the project after chairman Robert Shaye asked: \"Why the fuck can't it be \"Being Tom Cruise\"?\". Jonze revealed in a September 2013 interview that Malkovich asked him the same question during their first meeting and also relayed Malkovich's attitude after filming commenced:\n\nJonze explained in the same interview that he didn't realize how brave Malkovich's performance in the film was.\n\nWith a budget of $10 million, principal photography of \"Being John Malkovich\" began on July 20, 1998, and continued through August. Filming took place primarily in Los Angeles; specific locations included the University of Southern California campus and the Observation Bar on board the RMS \"Queen Mary\".\n\nThe puppets in the film were created by Kamela Portuges and Images in Motion. Phillip Huber animated the puppets.\n\nDiaz's make-up artist Gucci Westman described styling Diaz in the role as \"a challenge, to make her look homely.\" The script included minimal physical descriptions of characters, and thus when Diaz took up the role she did not know that \"people weren't going to recognize me.\"\n\nCusack read the film's script after he had asked his agent to present him with the \"craziest, most unproduceable script you can find.\" Impressed with the script, he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, with which he won the role.\n\nKeener cited \"Being John Malkovich\" as an instance of her taking up a role based on the director's previous work. She had heard about Jonze's experience with music videos and took up the part of Maxine although she initially disliked the character and did not feel that she was right for the part.\n\nCharlie Kaufman said that there was never another actor in Malkovich's place in the script: \"The screenplay was always \"Being John Malkovich\", even before I had any expectation that John Malkovich would even read the script.\" He chose Malkovich because he believed there to be \"an enigmatic quality about him that works\", though Malkovich was partly chosen because of the sound of his name in repetition. Kaufman explained that \"When we were thinking of alternatives, we found that a lot of them weren't fun to say.\" Jonze's then-father-in-law Francis Ford Coppola was able to contact Malkovich, and Jonze flew with producer Sandy Stern to Malkovich's home in France. Stern said that Malkovich was \"half intrigued and half horrified\" when he first read the script, but he eventually agreed to star in the film.\n\nSpike Jonze makes a cameo appearance as Derek Mantini's assistant; Mantini is billed in the story as the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world and arouses Schwartz's envy. Brad Pitt also has a half-second-long cameo, as a miffed star in the documentary on Malkovich's career, who seems to be on the verge of saying something before the shot ends. Sean Penn appears as a fictionalized version of himself and a fan of Malkovich's puppeteer work. Film director David Fincher makes an uncredited appearance as Christopher Bing in the American Arts & Culture pseudo-documentary on John Malkovich. Winona Ryder, Andy Dick, and the members of Hanson can be seen in the audience of a Malkovich puppet show.\n\n\"Being John Malkovich\" was given limited release in the United States theatres on October 22, 1999, and opened across 25 screens. On its opening weekend, the film grossed US$637,731 across 25 screens with a per-screen average of $25,495. It expanded to another 150 screens the following week, bringing in $1.9 million with a per-screen average of $10,857. In its third week, the film's release widened to 467 locations and grossed $2.4 million, averaging a lower $5,041 per screen with a cumulative gross of $6.1 million. It moved into a wide release the next week, expanding to 591 screens, and grossed $1.9 million with a 20% drop in ticket sales. Its fifth week brought in $2.2 million with a 17% increase in ticket sales, which dropped a further 33% the following week despite further expansion to 624 screens. It finished its theatrical run after 26 weeks with a total gross of $22,863,596.\n\nThe film opened in the United Kingdom in March 2000, earning £296,282 in its debut week and closing after fifteen weeks with a total gross of £1,098,927. In France, the film opened in December 1999 with a gross of US$546,000 from 94 venues and went on to further success due to positive reviews and word of mouth. It grossed $205,100 from 109 screens on its opening weekend in Italy and ticket sales dropped by 37% the following week with a cumulative gross of $480,000 from 82 screens. Its German release brought in a total of $243,071. \"Being John Malkovich\" had a total foreign gross of $9,523,455, combined with its domestic gross to give an international total of over $32 million.\n\n\"Being John Malkovich\" was initially released in 2000 on VHS, both as a regular edition and a limited edition collector's set, and on DVD, with special features including a theatrical trailer, TV spots, cast and crew biographies, the director's photo album and featurettes on floor 7½ and puppeteering. A special edition DVD, released later the same year, included the aforementioned features, an interview with Jonze and two behind-the-scenes featurettes. It was released on HD DVD in 2008. The Criterion Collection released a special edition of the film on Blu-ray and DVD in 2012.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 93% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"\"Being John Malkovich\" is both funny and smart, featuring a highly original script.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" The film ranked 441st on \"Empire\" magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest films of all time.\n\nIn his review, Roger Ebert awarded the film a full four stars; he would later name it the best film of 1999. His comments of praise included: \"Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next\" and he also felt that \"Either \"Being John Malkovich\" gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\" Another top critic Peter Rainer, writing for \"New York\", commented that \"dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun\" in his review, and Owen Gleiberman, writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", called it \"the most excitingly original movie of the year.\"\n\nJohn Malkovich's performance as himself in \"Being John Malkovich\" is ranked No. 90 on \"Premiere\" magazine's '100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time'.\n\nFollowing the financial and critical success of the 2017 film \"Get Out\", varying fan theories arose delving into the social horror themes of the film. In December of that year, the film's writer/director/producer Jordan Peele had an interview with \"Vanity Fair\" in which he discussed the major fan theories surrounding the film, confirming which of the most popular were true and false. Peele stated that he and \"Being John Malkovich\" director Spike Jonze had discussed the theory that \"Get Out\" was a secret stand-alone sequel to \"Being John Malkovich\", and, although admitting that \"Get Out\" was never conceived as a sequel to \"Being John Malkovich\" or thought of as such until after the film was released, Peele stated that since hearing the theory both himself and Jonze viewed the connection as both films being set in the same continuity, saying that \"as far as I'm concerned, it's true\".\n\nThe theory states that Catherine Keener's \"Maxine\" in \"Being John Malkovich\" is the same character as \"Missy\" in \"Get Out\"; \"Being John Malkovich\" concludes with Maxine and Lotte raising a child fathered by John Malkovich, but unbeknownst to them, the spirit of Craig is trapped inside the child's mind. With the portal to Malkovich's mind officially closed, they sought out other avenues for mind-transplant experimentation, eventually coming across Roman Armitage (Richard Herd), a neurosurgeon. Lotte entered the body of Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), Roman's son, and Emily, combined with the spirit of Craig, living in his own \"Sunken Place\", grows up to become the malevolent sociopath that is Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), all completely complicit in the scheme. Regarding his video about the theory in the January 2018 issue of \"Empire\", Peele expressed interest in casting John Malkovich in a \"Get Out\" sequel, stating that it would be \"cool\" to \"do the full trilogy\".\n\n"}

He is also the author of the book \"Behind The Hits: Inside Stories of Classic Pop and Rock and Roll\".\n\nHe has a son, Scott (no relation to current WCBS-FM morning DJ Scott Shannon), and a daughter, Avery.\n\nDon Bombard was first introduced on radio by sportscaster Marv Albert as the winner of a guest deejay contest, while still a junior high school student in his hometown of Syracuse, New York.\n\nAt age 15, Bombard experimented with broadcasting from his home, using a radio that had the wiring reversed to become a transmitter. The radio's antenna was hooked to a radiator, utilizing the water pipes to get the signal out to his neighborhood. In high school he partnered with Jody Carmen and Mel Cowznofski in the Big 50 \"Hits of the Week Survey, which was printed and distributed in Syracuse, NY to local record stores.\n\nHe joined the staff of Syracuse University station WAER-FM as a freshman in 1965.\n\nBombard came to the attention of the local Syracuse Top 40 stations WNDR and WOLF when, as a teenager, he compiled and distributed his own weekly music survey known as The Big 50.\n\nBombard then went on to work at both stations from 1967 to 1977, where he gained experience as an announcer, music director, and programmer. He joined WNDR in 1967 as a part-time weekend dj. In 1968 he accepted an offer by WOLF to work full-time on their night show. He became the station's music director and atarted an all-request show. In 1969, he was part of the team that returned WOLF to a Top 40 format and remained as music director and night dj until the following year, when he was hired back full-time at WNDR.\n\nThere, he hosted a late-night \"Attitude Hours\" progressive rock show. Later he became assistant program director and afternoon drive DJ, as well as taking over the reins of the \"Saturday Night of Gold\" oldies show.\n\nIn 1975, he left radio briefly to run \"Don Bombard Disco\", a company formed with partner Guy Capone. He returned to WOLF the following year and became program director.\n\nWhile in Syracuse, Bombard collaborated with local music historian Ron Wray (aka Ron Gersbacher) on a documentary history of WOLF (\"The WOLF Story\") and a series of \"History of Syracuse Music\" albums. He also formed (with Wray) Piece Records.\n\nIn 1977, Bombard moved to Pittsburgh to work at station 13Q (WKTQ). He began as production director and then moved to afternoon drive dj. He originated and hosted “The Sunday Night Oldies Party”. Bombard also released (with record collector Frank DeMino) a compilation album called \"The Pittsburgh Hall of Fame\". He also did booth announcing for WIIC (now WPXI) television.\n\nIn late 1981 Bombard moved to New York City to work part-time at a recording studio owned by Wendell Craig, formerly dj Windy Craig at WOLF. While there, with Craig's blessings, he launched a radio syndication company called Sirius Productions. Bombard then began as a fill-in announcer at WYNY (now WQHT). Shortly after, he would leave WYNY for WCBS-FM and began doing some booth announcing for WOR-TV. He used his given name on WYNY, but at CBS-FM (which already had Don K. Reed) his on-air name was changed to Bobby Shannon by program director Joe McCoy. Gradually, his air name evolved to \"Bob Shannon\".\n\nShannon launched a weekend overnight spin-off of his Pittsburgh show on WCBS-FM called \"The Oldies Party\" and continued to tape a weekly Sunday night show for airing in Pittsburgh. He also briefly hosted the Saturday night show vacated by Jack Spector. In 1982, he was promoted to the full-time 6-10PM shift and originated (with music director Richard Lorenzo) a nightly \"Hall of Fame\" segment. This segment played \"wall-to-wall\" music from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. by a selected artist or a couple artists (if the artists each had only a few big hits). For bigger artists with many hits, the hall of fame feature sometimes began at 8 p.m. In 1986, with the exit of Dick Heatherton, he took over the afternoon drive time slot, where he remained until the station's two-year \"sabbatical\" that began in 2005. The Hall Of Fame was revamped in evenings to feature several to half a dozen songs an hour by a selected artists mixed in with other regularly played music. Bobby Jay took over except on Wednesdays. On Wednesday, Cousin Bruce Morrow took over. At that point, on Thursdays the Hall Of Fame was strictly 60s music and on Fridays strictly 50s.\n\nAt WCBS-FM, on the 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. timeslot, he programmed music features such as \"Rockeology\", \"Hands Across the Water\", \"First and Foremost\", \"lost hits\", \"songs with the same title but are different\", \"Wednesday Fourplay/Three For The Road\", and others. In 1986 he collected his interviews with music acts into a book, \"Behind The Hits: Inside Stories of Classic Pop and Rock and Roll\", co-authored with John Javna.\n\nShannon hosted a number of nationally syndicated radio shows, including \"The Oldies Countdown\" for MJI Broadcasting and \"Keeping The '70s Alive\" and \"Behind The Hits\" for On The Radio Broadcasting. He co-hosted, with WCBS-FM's Bobby Jay, live broadcasts for Westwood One from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies in New York.\n\nIn June 2005 WCBS-FM switched to an \"Adult Hits\" format called Jack FM which used no live DJs. Shannon began a weekly show with his wife, Connie T. Empress, on WLNG, Long Island, NY. He also hosted a weekly Internet program, “Behind the Hits”, on Vip radio in Europe. He also broadcast weekly internet radio shows at RadioMaxMusic, and was instrumental in the creation of the Across The Tracks format used there. He worked briefly at New Jersey's \"The Breeze\" WWZY/WBHX in 2007, and took part in the station's Radio Greats Weekend in July 2007 after his return to WCBS-FM.\n\nWhen WCBS-FM came back to New York radio on July 12, 2007, Shannon helped launch the return. On November 18, as part of CBS-FM's weekly Radio Greats feature, he hosted a show as Don Bombard.\n\nShannon stopped performing his mid-day shift at WCBS-FM in late December 2011 or early 2012.He was eventually replaced by Ron Parker.\n"}

However, key differences in population makeup, geography, government policies and productivity all result in different economies. While both countries are in the list of top ten economies in the world in 2018, the US is the largest economy in the world, with US$20.4 trillion, with Canada ranking tenth at US$1.8 trillion. The population of Canada in July 2018 was 37,058,856 while the population of the United States was 328,928,146 in November 2018, almost ten times larger than Canada. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s 2018 report, Canadians pay lower personal income taxes than Americans. According to KPMG the corporate tax rate in Canada was 26.50% compared to 27% in the United States based on January 2018 data. Canada's 2017 debt-to-GDP ratio was 89.7%, compared to the United States at 107.8%.

In 2016, Canada's tax revenue to GDP ratio was 31.7% ranking 24th out of 35 OECD countries, compared to the US at 26% ranking at 30th, according to the OECD.\n\nThe population of Canada in July 2018 was 37,058,856 while the population of the United States was 328,928,146 in November 2018, almost ten times larger than Canada. For the 2017 to 2018 period Canada's annual population growth rate was 1.4%. This was the highest annual population growth since 1989/1990. In 2016, the \"New York Times\" reported that based on December 2016 Census Bureau data, from July 2015 to July 2016, the US population increased by 2.2 million or 0.7%, represented its \"smallest annual expansion in 80 years\"...the slowest rate of annual growth since 1937, though census methods have changed over that time\".\n\nBased on International Monetary Fund (IMF) data reported in an April 2018 World Economic Forum article, the United States' economy increased from US$19.4 trillion in 2017 to US$20.4 trillion. The United States has the largest economy globally and Canada ranks tenth at US$1.8 trillion.

Canada has been the G7 leader in economic growth since 2016. The unemployment rate in Canada is at its lowest level since c.1978. Over 600,000 full-time jobs have been created in Canada since early 2016.\n\nThe IMF's 2018 annual Article IV Mission to the United States reported that, \"Unemployment is low, inflation is well contained, and growth is set to accelerate. During the course of this administration, the economy is expected to enter the longest expansion in recorded U.S. history.\" Topics covered include competition, debt, sustainability analysis, economic indicators, fiscal policy, fiscal sustainability, monetary policy, tax policy and trade policy.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's annual World Economic Outlook provides the main economic indicators in Canada in selected years between 1980 and 2017.

Inflation under 2% is in green.\n\nCanada and the United States are member states of international trade organizations, including NAFTA—replaced by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) negotiated in 2018, G7, G20, OECD and WTO.\n\nAccording to a Global Affairs Canada 2018 report, Canada's exports increased 5.7% to a record high in 2017 of $CAD546.7 billion—$29.2 billion above the exports level in 2016. In 2017 imports also rose to an all-time high of $CAD1,108 billion. In 2017, Canada’s exports increased to Japan, India, South Korea, Germany, the United Kingdom, and China. In September 2017, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) came into force. In March 2018, Canada signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In October 2018, Canada, Mexico and the United States negotiated the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) to replace NAFTA. In October 2017, Canada began new free trade negotiations with the Pacific Alliance Latin America trade bloc—formed by Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, and in March 2018 with the Mercosur South American member countries.\n\nAccording to Statscan, Canada's trade trade deficit shrank to CAN$416 million (US$318 million) in September 2018.\n\nAccording to the August 2018 International Trade Compliance (ITC) report, in 2017, US merchandise exports increased $95.7 billion or 6.6% from $1,451.0 billion in 2016 to $1,546.7 billion. During the same period, US imports increased by $155.1 billion or 7.1% up from $2,187.8 billion in 2016. In 2017 energy-related products represented the largest increase in both imports and exports in the US.\n\nBased on a purchasing power parity scale, which compares the \"relative purchasing power between two or more currencies\",—income levels and costs are used to calculate the difference in the affordability of a similar basket of goods—in 2014, Canada was rated as 26% more expensive than the US. According to a Statistics Canada report released in 2017, the purchasing power parity (PPP) for gross domestic income was US$0.84 per Canadian dollar. Comparable items cost one dollar in Canada compared to 84 cents in the United States. Since 1999, the PPP had been \"relatively stable\". The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tracks price comparisons for industrialized countries, and in June 2015 Canada was listed as 6% more expensive than the United States, when the US dollar was used as the reference currency.\n\nAlthough wealth is more highly concentrated in the US, the median (50th percentile) worker has about 23% more purchasing power as well. In terms of purchasing power parity, the most recent statistics from the IMF has Canada (US$35,494) lower than that in the United States (US$43,444).\n\nThe OECD tracks member countries debt-to-GDP ratio, the \"amount of a country's total gross government debt as a percentage of its GDP\", as an \"indicator of an economy's health and a key factor for the sustainability of government finance.\"\n\nThis compares United States public debt and Canadian public debt based on data from the CIA's World Factbook and the IMF.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau in his February 27, 2018 presentation of the Canadian federal budget for the fiscal year 2018–2019, the deficit was projected to be CDN$18.1 billion.\n\nAccording to the Fraser Institute, government spending at all levels (federal, state/provincial and local) has traditionally been higher in Canada than the United States.\n\nAccording to the OECD's report entitled \"Taxing Wages 2018\" in 2017, the \"employee net average tax rate for a single person in Canada with no children was 22.8%, compared to 26.1% in the United States. Canada placed \"11th lowest among 35 OECD countries\". The OECD \"estimates take into account federal and provincial or state taxes, as well as social security contributions and money returned in the form of family benefits\".\n\nIn 2016, Canada's tax revenue to GDP ratio was 31.7% ranking 24th out of 35 OECD countries, compared to the US at 26% ranking at 30th, according to the OECD.\n\nAccording to a table updated to January 2018, produced by the Netherlands-based KPMG, one of the world's Big Four auditors, the corporate tax rate in Canada was 26.50% compared to 27% in the United States. \n\nKPMG calculated the Canadian corporate tax by adding the federal and provincial tax components. The federal component is 15%. Each of the ten provinces and three territories have 2 different tax rates, one which is lower for small businesses which ranges from 0 to 4.5%, and higher for all other corporations, which ranges from 11.5 to 16%. Combined with the federal tax component the total can vary from 26.5% to 31%. \n\nAccording to KPMG, the US federal corporate income tax rate was 21% for \"taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017\". As well, \"[m]ost state and many local governments impose net income taxes\" with the \"top marginal rate generally rang[ing] from 0% to 12%\". The \"mean of the top state tax rates [was] roughly 7.5%.\" \"[M]any states and localities impose gross receipts taxes, capital-based taxes, and other taxes that are not reflected in the rates provided\". A corporation may deduct its state and local income tax expense when computing its federal taxable income, generally resulting in a net effective rate of approximately 27%.\"\n\nIn 2017, the unemployment rate in Canada in was 6.3%, compared to 4.4% unemployment rate in the United States. From November 2017 through October 2018, Canada's unemployment ranged from 5.8% to 6.0%. \n\nIn Canada in October 2018, 11,200 new full-time jobs were added, lowering the unemployment rate to 5.8%—a \"40-year low, underpinning expectations that the Bank of Canada would keep raising interest rates\". However, the \"labor participation rate fell to its lowest point since October 1998—65.2%.\n\nThe US government counts the \"unemployed\" as \"people who don’t have a job\" but have \"actively looked for one in the previous four weeks, and are available for work.\" A 2018 \"Bloomberg\" article described the \"disguised unemployed\", including workers described as \"marginally attached\" workers who are looking for work but have not actively in the last month. The \"disguised unemployed\" include \"discouraged\" workers who stopped looking because there were no jobs during the \"deep and long recession\". Others include 4.7 million part-time workers who want full time jobs. The government counts the \"unemployed\" as \"people who don’t have a job\" but have \"actively looked for one in the previous four weeks, and are available for work.\" In 2014, then-Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, said that because of the depth and length of the depression which created so many \"long-term unemployed\"—representing 1/3 of jobless workers, the \"high number of people who are working part-time even though they want full-time jobs\", and the number of people who voluntarily quit, \"we shouldn't focus only on the unemployment rate.\" By 2014, labor force participation rate had fallen to 63% in the US, the \"lowest level in a generation\".\nIn a June 7, 2008 article in \"The Globe and Mail\", Heather Scoffield wrote that for the first time since 1982, Canada's unemployment rate was lower than that of the United States. Scoffield said that this indicated that the economic recession was \"less painful in Canada\" where the May unemployment rate was 6.1% while the US rate was 5.5%. At the height of the 2008-2009 recession in Canada, unemployment peaked at 8.3 percent. The subprime mortgage crisis and the 2007–2009 which followed, increased the unemployment rate to a peak of 10% in October 2009. Since then, the unemployment rate has been steadily falling. It reached 5% in December 2015.\n\nThe United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) is one of several annual composite indices published by the UNDP Human Development Report (HDR) office. The HDI ranks countries based on life expectancy, education, per capita income. Canada and the United States were placed in the very high human development category in 2017 with Canada ranking 12 and the United States ranking 13th 0.924 out of 189 countries \n\nOther HDR annual composite indices include the Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) with Canada ranking 12th with an index of 0.852 compared to the US ranking 25th with an index of 0.797; the Gender Development Index (GDI), the Gender Inequality Index (GII), and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).\n\nIn Canada life expectancy at birth is 82.5 and 79.5 in the US; expected years of schooling is 16.4 years in Canada and 16.5 in the US; mean years of schooling is 13.3 years in Canada and 13.4 in the US; GNI per capita (2011 PPP$) is $43,433 in Canada and $54,941 in the United States.\n\nBased on the \"Economist\" Intelligence Unit's (EIU) annual Global Liveability Ranking, comparing 140 cities worldwide for urban quality of life based on assessments of stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure. For a number of years, Canada's cities—Calgary—#4 in 2018, #5 in 2017, Vancouver—#1 from 2002 to 2010, #3 in 2017 Toronto #4 in 2017, Montreal, and Ottawa—have ranked among the top 10 livable cities in the world.\n\nGovernment spending refers to public expenditure on goods and services. \n\nIn FY2017 the Canadian federal government spent $311 billion. Elderly benefits, which \"cost $48.1 billion, or 15 cents of every tax dollar\"—which include the Old Age Security (OAS) and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)—represented the \"biggest single expense\". Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the \"OAS and GIS are funded through general revenues—they not independently funded\". Other expenses included \"All other departments and agencies\" $51 billion, Other transfer payments 41.5 billion, Canada Health Transfer 36 billion, National Defence 25 billion, Public Debt Charges 24.15 billion, Children's Benefits 22 billion, Employment Insurance 20.7 billion, Fiscal Arrangements 17.1 billion, Canada Social Transfer 4.3 billion, Crown Corporations 8 billion, and Gas Tax Fund 2 billion.\n\nThe United States federal budget includes mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and interest on debt. In the United States in 2017, mandatory spending totaled $2.5 trillion or 13.1% of GDP and included Social security $939 billion or 4.9% of GDP, Medicare 591 billion or 3.1% GDP, Medicaid $375 billion or 2.0% of GDP, and Other 614 billion or 3.2% GDP. Discretionary spending totaled $1.2 trillion or 6.3% of GDP and included Defense 590 billion or 3.1%GDP, and Nondefense 610 billion or 3.2% GDP. Interest on debt totaled 263 billion representing 1.4% of GDP.\n\nThe United States spends more on health care than Canada. According to the OECD 2015 report comparing 35 OECD member countries, \"spending per person on health care remained highest in the United States (CDN$11,916)\". Canada spent CDN$5,782 per capita on health care in 2015. In their 2017 report, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) estimated that total health expenditure would reach \"$242.0 billion or $6,604 per Canadian in 2017\" representing 11.5% of Canada’s GDP. and total healthcare spending is much higher - 14.6% of GDP in the US vs. 10% in Canada. \n\nHealthcare coverage is universal for Canadians, and transferable outside a home province within Canada. In the United States, however, the most common complaint is that approximately 50 million people are uninsured, and thus do not have access to even the most basic healthcare services which Canadians have access to. This puts a burden on the emergency room services in the States and causes increases in healthcare costs significantly.Canadians, however, receive better care to those Americans who receive treatment, and result measures. \n\nIn Canada, health care is mostly paid through employee income taxes, while in the United States most companies choose to extend health benefits to full-time employees. The most common complaint regarding the Canadian system are the long lines and waiting periods that have appeared for minor and non-life-threatening procedures over the last 15 years, since the introduction of widespread cuts to public funding. Separately, a number of medical tests and screenings are not covered (or due to increasing costs, are no longer covered) by the Canadian health system, forcing patients to pay for these services out of their own pockets. For these reasons, some relatively wealthy Canadians undergo treatment at private healthcare facilities at their own expense, either in Canada, in India, or in other nations to avoid waiting for medical treatment, joining \"medical tourists\" from many nations, including the US. Despite these sporadic problems, Canada's healthcare performance has been of higher quality on most factors. Efforts were made to reduce wait times by many provincial governments in the 1990s and 2000s, in an effort to improve care.\n\nIn Canada in September 2018, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.2% on a year-over-year basis. The Bank of Canada's monthly CPI measures changes in consumer prices based on the price of a \"fixed basket of goods and services\" purchased by Canadian consumers, such as made up of goods and services that Canadians typically buy, such as food, housing, transportation, furniture, clothing, recreation, and other items, with the target of maintaining the rate of inflation (the \"year-over-year increase in the total CPI) at 2%—\"midpoint of an inflation-control target range of 1 to 3%\". On October 24, 2018 the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.75%, the highest it has reached in ten years to prevent inflation. The key interest rate had been kept low in response to the 2008 economic slowdown. By raising the rate, the Bank of Canada is indicating that the Canadian economy no longer needs \"stimulus.\"\n\nIn September 2018, The US Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate to 2.25%.\n\nLabor or workforce productivity measures the efficiency with which labor is used to produce goods and services. According to a 2017 Conference Board of Canada article, in 2015 \"Canada's level of labour productivity was US$49 per hour worked, much lower than that of the United States, at US$63.\" Alberta's level was 99%. The lowest was in Prince Edward Island at 58%. The article noted that over previous five year period, Canada \"outperformed\" the US on \"labour productivity growth\". In May 2018, Statistics Canada reported that across Canada, labor productivity rose 2.2%; the increase in 2016 was 0.6%.\n\nAccording to a 2004 article, Canadian workers were estimated to be 82% as productive per hour as their American counterparts. The industries with the largest productivity advantages for the US are the manufacturing (particularly electronics and computer), finance, and service sectors. Industries where Canada is more productive than the US are the construction and natural resources sectors with Canadian workers achieving 129% relative productivity.\n\nThe productivity gap was even larger in the 1950s but the difference narrowed, aided by the elimination of the smaller market problem through free trade. The gap closed somewhat in the 1980s but at a much slower pace than in the 1960s. From 1961 to 1973 labour productivity rose annually by 3.3 percent in Canada and 1.7 percent in the United States. According to a 1997 IMF report, from 1973 to 1995 productivity growth was 1.1% in Canada and 0.8% in the United States.\n\nThe productivity gap began to widen again in the 1990s, particularly in the manufacturing sector. According to a 2005 article, by 2000, this was called Canada's \"Excellence Gap\" by the Chief Economist of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters. The United States has the second-highest productivity of the G8 countries, while Canada's is 5th based on the 1997 estimate.\n\nFive main reasons for the productivity gap: the lower capital intensity of economic activity in Canada; an innovation gap in Canada relative to the United States; Canada's relatively underdeveloped high-tech sector; less developed human capital in Canada in terms of proportionately fewer university graduates and scientists and engineers in research and development; and more limited economies of scale and scope in Canada.\n\n"}

I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better\".\nIn the 1996 election Pauline Hanson was elected to the federal seat of Oxley. In her controversial maiden speech to the House of Representatives, she expressed her belief that Australia \"was in danger of being swamped by Asians\". Hanson went on to form the One Nation Party, which initially won nearly one quarter of the vote in Queensland state elections before entering a period of decline due to internal disputes. The name \"One Nation\" was meant to signify national unity, in contrast to what Hanson claimed to see as an increasing division in Australian society caused by government policies favouring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians.\n\nThousands of Bahraini Shia Muslims protested in March 2011 against the Bahraini government's naturalisation policy of granting citizenship to Sunni Muslims from other countries serving in the military of Bahrain.\n\nBhutan has a long-standing concern with the demographic threat posed by the immigration of ethnically distinct Nepali immigrants.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries (until the 1960s), the French-speaking Catholic minority of Canada managed to maintain its share of the population due to a high birth rate, dubbed the \"revenge of the cradle.\"\n\nIn Estonia, one of the causes of the Singing Revolution was the concern over the demographic threat to the national identity posed by the influx of individuals from foreign ethnic groups to work on such large Soviet development projects as phosphate mining.\n\nMany Hindu Indians see Muslims as a \"demographic threat\" because of their large population growth due to high fertility rates and because of the high rate of illegal immigration from Bangladesh.\n\nIn the 1950s, Shoham Melamad found that the high fertility rate of Arabs was viewed as a demographic threat to the Jewish nation. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, however, stated that Arabs in Israel should be treated equally to any other Israeli citizens and be allowed to have children just like any other citizen. A 1967 \"Maariv\" editorial suggested that Jews should be encouraged to have large families, while Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and in Israel should be encouraged to adopt birth control measures. Schnitzer also advocated for the adoption of an open policy encouraging Arabs to emigrate from Israel.\n\nIn 2003, Benjamin Netanyahu opined that if the percentage of Arab citizens of Israel rises above its current level of about 20 percent, Israel would not be able to retain a Jewish demographic majority, the basis of Israel's self-definition as a \"Jewish democratic state\". Netanyahu's comments were criticized as racist by Arab Knesset members and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel. In May 2009, Michael Oren wrote an article in \"Commentary\" in which he discussed the \"Arab Demographic Threat\" as one of \"Seven Existential Threats\" facing Israel. In 2005, Shimon Peres told US officials that Israel had \"lost\" land in the Negev \"to the Bedouin\" and would need to take steps to \"relieve\" the \"demographic threat\". In 2010, Netanyahu warned in a government meeting that a Negev \"without a Jewish majority\" would pose \"a palpable threat\". In February 2014, then Israeli finance minister Yair Lapid said failure to establish a Palestinian state would leave Israel facing a demographic threat that could undermine its Jewish and democratic nature.\n\nThe Malaysian government has been accused of masterminding Project IC to alter the demographic pattern of the East Malaysian state of Sabah.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, Protestants are more likely to favour continued political union with the UK, while Catholics are more likely to favour political union with the rest of Ireland. When Ireland was partitioned in the 1920s and Northern Ireland came into existence, Protestants were roughly 60% of the population, but as a result of higher fertility rates among Catholics, their share of the population has dropped to less than 50% in the 2011 census, while Catholics numbered only slightly fewer than Protestants. There is debate over whether and to what extent this trend will continue and its possible impact on the political situation.\n\nRussia fears the \"demographic threat\" posed by the potential for \"large-scale Chinese immigration\" to its thinly populated far east. Illegal immigration of Chinese nationals is a special concern.\n\nSome in the United States have expressed concern about the \"demographic threat\" posed by millions of migrants from Mexico and Latin America and their descendants.\n\nMigration Stock is the number of people that live in an area that they were not originally from and Migration Flow is the number of new people entering a new territory. It is important to know the difference because the main issue that is associated with immigration is the migration flow of new people entering United States. In the distant future, around 2050, the United States will be a diverse country and whites will no longer be the majority. The future economy for United States will depend heavily on the future immigrants that come to the United States, according to Joel Kotkin. United States has a high amount of debt and it does not look like it will reduce soon. Changing the immigration system to a more flexible system can help the U.S. future economy. So why the scare? It has always been thought that the more immigration there is the fewer Primary sector jobs for the population that was born in the United States. However according to Diana Furchtgott-Roth this statement is a fallacy. The United States can benefit from the immigration because they can use the migrants for Secondary sector jobs that mainly consist of intense labor that requires no skills. It does not ruin the opportunity but in turn actually raises the wages for working class Americans. If the stigma that immigration ruins the chances for working Americans ends and the United States puts in place more flexible immigration laws then the United States might see a brighter future with a better economy.\n\nSweden's main statistics bureau Statistics Sweden (SCB) does not keep any record of ethnicity but about 20% of Sweden's population is of foreign background. Some immigrants in Sweden feel that they experience \"betweenship\" which arises when others ascribe them an identity that they do not hold.\n\nThe growing numbers of immigrants has coincided with the rise of the anti-immigration political party Sweden Democrats which expresses fear of a\ndemographic threat, especially the rise of Islam in Sweden. Since the 1990s, polls show that people in Sweden have gradually become more positive to asylum refugees. Recently, the Sweden Democrats have become one of the most popular parties in Sweden which has sparked widespread debate about a possible increase of xenophobia and racism in Sweden.\n\n\n"}

They might be subsystems of larger systems and have subsystems of their own. For example, a subway rapid transit electrical system is composed of the wayside electrical power supply, wayside control system, and the electrical systems of each transit car. Each transit car’s electrical system is a subsystem of the subway system.

{"id": "728641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=728641", "title": "Everyman's Library", "text": "Everyman's Library\n\nEveryman's Library is a series of reprint of classic literature, primarily from the Western canon. It is currently published in hardback by Random House. It was originally an imprint of J. M. Dent (latterly a division of Weidenfeld & Nicolson and presently an imprint of Orion Books), who continue to publish Everyman Paperbacks.\nEveryman's Library was conceived in 1905 by London publisher Joseph Malaby Dent, whose goal was to create a 1,000 volume library of world literature that was affordable for, and that appealed to, every kind of person, from students to the working classes to the cultural elite. Dent followed the design principles and to a certain extent the style established by William Morris in his Kelmscott Press. This was later replaced in 1935 by Eric Ravilious's designs. Everyman's Library books were pocket-sized hardcovers that sold initially for what was then the remarkably low price of a shilling apiece. The original U.S. distribution rights were granted to New York City publishers, E. P. Dutton.\n\nThe name of the publication series was suggested by poet and editor Ernest Rhys, who was named head editor of the series initially, and asked to find a suitable name to encompass Dent's goal. Rhys tried and discarded many ideas before recalling a quotation from the medieval play \"Everyman\" in which the character of Knowledge says to Everyman:\nThis quotation appears on the title page of all Everyman's Library and Everyman Paperbacks volumes. \n\nJ. M. Dent and Company commenced the series in 1906 with a James Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\", published with a quotation on the title page from the works of John Milton: \"A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed and treasured upon purpose to a life beyond life.\" In 1910, 500 books had been published under the Everyman trademark, and in 1956, fulfilling Dent's original goal, the thousandth volume, Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\", having been selected for the honor, was published.\n\nBy 1975, Dent's vision had been well surpassed, as Everyman's Library consisted of 994 titles published in 1,239 volumes.\n\nEach book belonged to one of the following genres: Travel, Science, Fiction, Theology & Philosophy, History, Classical, For Young People, Essays, Oratory, Poetry & Drama, Biography, Reference, and Romance. The appropriate genre was printed inside and used to organize the periodically released lists of the series.\nAfter ceasing publication of new titles in the 1970s, the hardback rights to Everyman's Library were sold to the newly formed David Campbell Publishers in 1991 and relaunched with the support of the Random House Group in the United Kingdom and through Alfred A. Knopf (which had been acquired by Random House in 1960) in the United States, a move praised by many notable authors. Control of Everyman's Library passed to US-based Random House in 2002, who continue to publish it under the Knopf Publishers imprint there and (albeit without changes) as Random House UK elsewhere. \n\nJ. M. Dent & Sons was acquired by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in 1988, itself acquired by the Orion Publishing Group in 1991, now both part of Hachette Livre (UK). Orion continues to publish the unrelated Everyman Paperbacks under the J. M. Dent imprint in the UK and via Charles E. Tuttle Co. in the US.\n\nThe current membership of the Honorary Editorial Committee includes Harold Bloom, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Toni Morrison, Cynthia Ozick and Simon Schama.\n\nA notable addition to the library was a multi-volume encyclopedia, which was added to the range in 1913. Individual volumes could be purchased separately, enabling the set to be budgeted over time. The fifth edition was published in 1967, by which time it consisted of 12 volumes, containing 7763 pages.\n\nThe page size was , but as the printing was 8 point, a large amount of information was contained in each volume. As a volume only weighed about 1.25 kg (2.75 lbs), it was considered a better size for use by children.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3626096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3626096", "title": "Hirsau Abbey", "text": "Hirsau Abbey\n\nHirsau Abbey, formerly known as Hirschau Abbey, was once one of the most important Benedictine abbeys of Germany. It is located in the Hirsau borough of Calw on the northern slopes of the Black Forest mountain range, in the present-day state of Baden-Württemberg. In the 11th and 12th century, the monastery was a centre of the Cluniac Reforms, implemented as \"Hirsau Reforms\" in the German lands. The complex was devastated during the War of the Palatine Succession in 1692 and not rebuilt.\n\nA Christian chapel at Hirsau dedicated to Saint Nazarius had already been erected in the late 8th century. The monastery itself was founded in about 830 by the Rhenish Franconian count Erlafried of Calw at the instigation of his relative, Bishop Notting of Vercelli, who gave it the relics of Saint Aurelius of Riditio, an Armenian bishop who had died about 475, brought from Milan among other treasures; they were first placed in the oratory of St. Nazarius' Chapel, while the monastery at Hirsau was being built on the count's estates. It was settled by a colony of fifteen monks descending from Fulda Abbey, disciples of Rabanus Maurus and Walafrid Strabo, under one abbot Liudebert or Lutpert. Count Erlafried endowed the new foundation with extended lands and other gifts, and made a solemn donation of the whole into the hands of Lutpert, on condition that the Rule of Saint Benedict should be observed. A first aisleless church, dedicated to Saint Aurelius, was not completed until 838, when it was consecrated by Archbishop Odgar of Mainz, who at the same time translated the relics from their temporary resting place to the new church. \n\nAbbot Lutpert died in 853, having brought about a substantial increase both in the possessions of the abbey and in the number of the monks under his rule. Regular observance flourished under him and his successors and a successful monastic school was established. Over about a hundred and fifty years, under the care of the Counts of Calw, it enjoyed great prosperity, and became an important seat of learning. However, towards the end of the 10th century the ravages of pestilence, combined with the greed of its patrons and the laxity of the community, brought it to ruin. In 988 a severe plague devastated the neighbourhood and carried off sixty of the monks including the abbot, Hartfried. Only a dozen were left to elect a successor, and they divided into two parties. The more fervent chose one Conrad, whose election was confirmed by the Bishop of Speyer, but some of the others, who favoured a more relaxed rule, elected an opposition abbot in the person of Eberhard, the cellarer. For some time the dispute ran high between the rival superiors and their respective followers. The Count of Calw supported the claims of Eberhard, but neither party would give way to the other and in the end the count brought in an armed force to settle the quarrel. The result was that the abbey was pillaged, the monks dispersed, and the valuable library destroyed. The count became master of the property and the abbey remained empty for over sixty years, during which time the buildings fell into a ruinous state.\n\nIn 1049 Pope Leo IX, uncle of Count Adalbert of Calw and grandson of the spoliator, came to Hirschau, and required Adalbert to restore the abbey. The count had the abbey church rebuilt in the style of a Roman basilica with an attached cloister: He renovated the premises, but so slowly that they were not refurbished until 1065, when the monastery was resettled by a dozen monks from the renowned Einsiedeln Abbey in Swabia, with Abbot Frederick at their head.\n\nIt was however Frederick's successor who revived and even surpassed the former renown and prosperity of the abbey. This was the famous William of Hirsau, a monk descending from St. Emmeram's Abbey in the Bavarian capital Regensburg, who was appointed abbot in 1069. When he came the condition of the monastery was far from satisfactory. The monks were living in cramped conditions, as the buildings were still incomplete and furthermore repeatedly affected by floods of the Nagold river. Count Adalbert still retained possession of some of the monastic property, together with a certain amount of unhelpful influence over the community, and regular discipline was very much relaxed. Abbot William's zeal and prudence by degrees remedied this unsatisfactory state of affairs and inaugurated a period of great prosperity, both spiritual and temporal. During the Investiture Controversy that shook the Holy Roman Empire, he secured the independence of the abbey from the Counts of Calw and placed its finances on a sound footing.\n\nWilliam completed the buildings already begun and from 1082 afterwards greatly added to them, as the needs of the increasing community required, a new monastery complex on a high plateau on the opposite side of the Nagold river. The Sts Peter and Paul's abbey church, which was modelled on Cluny II finished about 981 under Abbot Majolus, was consecrated in 1091. The convent followed the next year, when it moved into the adjacent new monastic compound designed according to the Plan of Saint Gall, while old St Aurelius was converted into a priory. William also refounded the monastic school for which the abbey had formerly been famous throughout Germany.\n\nBut the abbot's greatest work, perhaps, and that for which his name is best remembered, was the reformation that he effected within the community itself. Cluny was then at the height of its fame and William sent some of his monks there to learn the Cluniac customs and rule, after which the Cluniac discipline was introduced at Hirsau. By his \"Constitutiones Hirsaugienses\", a new religious order, the \"Ordo Hirsaugiensis\", was formed. Known as the Hirsau Reforms, the adoption of this rule revitalised Benedictine monasteries throughout Germany, such as those of Zwiefalten, Blaubeuren Petershausen, Saint Peter and Saint George in the Black Forest in Swabia, as well as the Thuringian monastery of Reinhardsbrunn, Franconian Comburg and St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal in Carinthia. Hirsau priories were located at Reichenbach and Schönrain, in Bavarian Fischbachau and Thuringian Paulinzella.\n\nA friend and correspondent of Pope Gregory VII and Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, William took active part in the politico-ecclesiastical controversies of his time. He was also author of \"inter alia\" the treatise \"De musica et tonis\", as well as the \"Philosophicarum et astronomicarism institutionuin libri iii\". The abbot then wrote his well-known \"Consuetudines Hirsaugienses\" which for several centuries remained the standard of monastic observance. Under William monks were sent out from Hirsau to reform other German monasteries on the same lines, and from it seven new monasteries were founded. The numbers of the community increased to 150 under his rule, manual labour and the copying of manuscripts forming an important part of their occupations. Numerous exemptions and other privileges were obtained from time to time from emperors and popes.\n\nIn the twelfth century the autocratic rule of Abbot Manegold caused for a time some internal dissensions and a consequent decline of strict discipline, but the vigorous efforts of several abbots checked the decadence, and temporarily re-established the stricter observance. About the end of the 12th century Hirsau Abbey was again very perceptibly on the decline both materially and morally. It never afterwards again rose into importance.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, however, the famous \"Customs\" gradually became little more than a dead letter. Wolfram, the thirty-eighth abbot (1428–1460), introduced the contemporary Melk Reform. A few years later Hirsau adopted the Constitutions of Bursfelde Abbey and became part of the Bursfelde Congregation. Wolfram's successor, Bernhard, carried on the work of revival, freed the abbey from its debts, restored the monastic buildings, and also reformed several other monasteries.\n\nIn the days of Abbot John III (1514–1556) Hirsau fell on hard times: the Protestant Reformation began to make its influence felt, and after a brief period of struggle, the abbey, through the involvement of Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, passed into Lutheran hands, though still maintaining its monastic character. In consequence of the Reformation it was secularized in 1558. In 1630 it became Catholic again for a short time, but after the Peace of Westphalia (1648) it once more came under the control of the Dukes of Württemberg and another series of Lutheran abbots presided over it.\n\nThe community eventually came to an end and the once famous Hirsau Abbey was finally destroyed during the Nine Years' War by French troops under General Lieutenant Mélac in 1692. Only the ruins now remain to mark its site.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1985 it was joined by the complementary standard ISO 5964, \"Guidelines for the establishment and development of multilingual thesauri\".\nOver the years ISO 2788 and ISO 5964 were adopted as national standards in several countries, for example Canada, France and UK. In the UK they were given alias numbers BS 5723 and BS 6723 respectively. And it was in the UK around the turn of the century that work began to revise them for the networking needs of the new millennium. This resulted during 2005 - 2008 in publication of the 5-part British Standard BS 8723, as follows:\nEven before the last part of BS 8723 was published, work began to adopt and adapt it as an international standard to replace ISO 2788 and ISO 5964. The project was led by a Working Group of ISO's Technical Committee 46 (Information and documentation) Subcommittee 9 (Identification and description) known as “ISO TC46/SC9/WG8 Structured Vocabularies”.\n\nISO 2788 and ISO 5964 were withdrawn in 2011, when they were replaced by the first part of ISO 25964. The second part of ISO 25964 was issued in March 2013, completing the project.\n\nISO 25964 is for thesauri intended to support information retrieval, and specifically to guide the choice of terms used in indexing, tagging and search queries.\n\nThe primary objective is thus summarised in the introduction to the standard as:\nWhereas most of the applications envisaged for ISO 2788 and ISO 5964 were databases in a single domain, often in-house or for paper-based systems, ISO 25964 provides additional guidance for the new context of networked applications, including the Semantic Web. A thesaurus is one among several types of controlled vocabulary used in this context.\n\nA thesaurus compliant with ISO 25964-1 (as Part 1 is known) lists all the concepts available for indexing in a given context, and labels each of them with a preferred term, as well as any synonyms that apply. Relationships between the concepts and between the terms are shown, making it easy to navigate around the field while building up a search query. The main types of relationship include:\nIn multilingual thesauri equivalence also applies between corresponding terms in different natural languages. Establishing correspondence is not always easy, and the standard provides recommendations for handling the difficulties that commonly arise.\n\nISO 25964-1 explains how to build a monolingual or a multilingual thesaurus, how to display it, and how to manage its development. There is a data model to use for handling thesaurus data (especially when exchanging data between systems) and an XML schema for encoding the data. Both the model and the schema can be accessed 24/7, free of charge, on the official website hosted by NISO. The standard also sets out the features you should look for when choosing software to manage the thesaurus.\n\nISO 25964-2 deals with the challenges of using one thesaurus in combination with another, and/or with some other type of controlled vocabulary or knowledge organization system (KOS). The types covered include classification schemes, taxonomies, subject heading schemes, ontologies, name authority lists, terminologies and synonym rings. Within a single organization it is common to find several different such KOSs used in contexts such as the records management system, the library catalogue, the corporate intranet, the research lab, etc. To help users with the challenge of running a single search across all the available collections, ISO 25964-2 provides guidance on mapping between the terms and concepts of one thesaurus and those of the other KOSs. Where mapping is not a sensible option, the standard recommends other forms of complementary vocabulary use.\n\nSimilarly on the Internet there is an opportunity to make a simultaneous search of repositories and databases that have been indexed with different KOSs, on an even wider scale. Interoperability between the different networks, platforms, software applications, and languages (both natural and artificial) is reliant on the adoption of numerous protocols and standards. ISO 25964-2 is the one to address interoperability between structured vocabularies, especially where a thesaurus is involved.\n\nSince Part 1 of ISO 25964 was published it has been adopted by the national standards bodies in a number of countries. For example, The British Standards Institution (BSI) in the UK has adopted it and labelled it unchanged as BS ISO 25964-1. At the time of writing similar consideration is under way for Part 2.\nThe American standard ANSI/NISO Z39.19 - \"Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies\" covers some of the same ground as ISO 25964-1. It deals with monolingual lists, synonym rings and taxonomies as well as thesauri, but does not provide a data model, nor address multilingual vocabularies or other aspects of interoperability, such as mapping between KOSs. Where the two standards overlap, they are broadly compatible with each other. NISO is actively involved in both standards, having participated in the work of developing ISO 25964 as well as running its secretariat.\nThe W3C Recommendation \"SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)\" has a close relationship with ISO 25964 in the context of the Semantic Web. \"SKOS\" applies to all sorts of “simple KOSs” that can be found on the Web, including thesauri and others. Whereas ISO 25964-1 advises on the selection and fitting together of concepts, terms and relationships to make a good thesaurus, \"SKOS\" addresses the next step - porting the thesaurus to the Web. And whereas ISO 25964-2 recommends the sort of mappings that can be established between one KOS and another, \"SKOS\" presents a way of expressing the mappings when published to the Web.\n\n\n"}

This Latin term was coined by Sir Francis Bacon and used in his \"Novum Organum\", one of the earliest treatises arguing the case for the logic and method of modern science. He described them as deriving from \"the peculiar constitution, mental or bodily, of each individual; and also in education, habit, and accident\".\n\nThe \"idola specus\" are prejudices, by which individuals inappropriately extend norms or tenets that derive his or her own culture and social group, or to his or her own preferences. Racism, sexism and, more generally just \"biases\" are examples of \"idola specus\", but the concept goes beyond them to the criticism of all forms of irreflexive subjectivity or individual predisposition.\n\nThe term is one of four such \"idols\" which represent \"idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding, and have taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance is obtained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults\".\n\nBesides \"idola specus\", there are also \"idola tribus\" (Idols of the Tribe, caused by human nature), \"idola fori\", (Idols of the Market Place, caused by language) and \"idola theatri\" (Idols of the Theatre, which are caused by the influence of philosophers).\n\nIn more detail, Bacon said that there are a \"great number and variety\" of idols of the cave but he choose to select example which give \"the most important caution\", and which \"have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding\". He judged that they \"grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favorite subject, or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish, or out of partiality for particular ages, or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated.\" Concerning these most important variants he wrote in more detail:\n\n\nBacon also drew general advice for more methodical future study of nature, aimed at avoiding the idols of the cave: \"generally let every student of nature take this as a rule: that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion, and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "294545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294545", "title": "Indentation style", "text": "Indentation style\n\nIn computer programming, an indentation style is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey program structure. This article largely addresses the free-form languages, such as C and its descendants, but can be (and often is) applied to most other programming languages (especially those in the curly bracket family), where whitespace is otherwise insignificant. Indentation style is only one aspect of programming style.\n\nIndenting is not a requirement of most programming languages, where it is used as secondary notation. Rather, indenting helps better convey the structure of a program to human readers. Especially, it is used to clarify the link between control flow constructs such as conditions or loops, and code contained within and outside of them. However, some languages (such as Python and occam) use indenting to determine the structure instead of using braces or keywords; this is termed the off-side rule. In such languages, indenting is meaningful to the compiler or interpreter; it is more than only a clarity or style issue.\n\nThis article uses \"brackets\" to refer to what are termed \"parentheses\" in American English, and \"braces\" to refer to what are termed \"curly brackets\" in American English.\n\nThe main difference between indentation styles lies in the placing of the braces of the compound statement (codice_1) that often follows a control statement (codice_2, codice_3, codice_4...). The table below shows this placement for the style of statements discussed in this article; function declaration style is another case. The style for brace placement in statements may differ from the style for brace placement of a function definition. For consistency, the indentation depth has been kept constant at 4 spaces, regardless of the preferred indentation depth of each style.\n\nMany early programs used tab characters to indent, for simplicity and to save on source file size. Unix editors generally view tabs as equaling eight characters, while Macintosh and Windows environments would set them to four, creating confusion when code was transferred between environments. Modern programming editors can now often set arbitrary indentation sizes, and will insert the proper mix of tabs and spaces.\n\nThe issue of using hard tabs or spaces is an ongoing debate in the programming community. Some programmers such as Jamie Zawinski state that spaces instead of tabs increase cross-platform portability. Others, such as the writers of the WordPress coding standards state the opposite, that hard tabs increase portability.\n\nThe size of the indentation is usually independent of the style. In an experiment from 1983 performed on PASCAL code, a significant influence of indentation size on comprehensibility was found. The results indicate that indentation levels in the range from 2 to 4 characters ensure best comprehensibility. For Ruby, many shell scripting languages, and some forms of HTML formatting, two spaces per indentation level is generally used.\n\nThere are many computer programs that automatically correct indentation styles (according to the preferences of the program author) and the length of indents associated with tabs. A famous one is codice_5, a program included with many Unix-like operating systems.\n\nIn Emacs, various commands are available to automatically fix indenting problems, including hitting codice_6 on a given line (in the default configuration). codice_7 can be used to properly indent large sections of code. Depending on the mode, Emacs can also replace leading indentation spaces with the proper number of tabs followed by spaces, which results in the minimal number of characters for indenting each source line.\n\nElastic tabstops is a tabulation style which requires support from the text editor, where entire blocks of text are kept automatically aligned when the length of one line in the block changes.\n\nThe K&R style is commonly used in C, C++, and other curly brace programming languages. It was the style used in the original Unix kernel, Kernighan and Ritchie's book \"The C Programming Language\", as well as Kernighan and Plauger's book \"The Elements of Programming Style\".\n\nWhen following K&R, each function has its opening brace at the next line on the same indentation level as its header, the statements within the braces are indented, and the closing brace at the end is on the same indentation level as the header of the function at a line of its own.\n\n\"The C Programming Language\" does not explicitly specify this style, though it is followed consistently throughout the book. From the book:\n\nThe position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. We have chosen one of several popular styles. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.\nIn old versions of the C language, argument types needed to be declared on the subsequent line (i.e., just after the header of the function):\n\nAdvocates of this style sometimes refer to it as \"the one true brace style\" (abbreviated as 1TBS or OTBS). The main two differences from the K&R style are that functions have their opening braces on the same line separated by a space, and that the braces are not omitted for a control statement with only a single statement in its scope.\n\nIn this style, the constructs that allow insertions of new code lines are on separate lines, and constructs that prohibit insertions are on one line. This principle is amplified by bracing every if, else, while, etc., including single-line conditionals, so that insertion of a new line of code anywhere is always safe (i.e., such an insertion will not make the flow of execution disagree with the source code indenting).\n\nSuggested advantages of this style are that the starting brace needs no extra line alone; and the ending brace lines up with the statement it conceptually belongs to. One cost of this style is that the ending brace of a block needs a full line alone, which can be partly resolved in if/else blocks and do/while blocks: \n\nThere are many mentions of The One True Brace Style out there, but there is some confusion as to its true form. Some sources say it is the variation specified above, while others note it as just another \"hacker jargon\" term for K&R.\n\nA minor variant of the K&R style is the linux kernel style, which is known for its extensive use in the source tree of the Linux kernel. Linus Torvalds strongly advises all contributors to follow it. A detailed description of the style (which considers indenting, and naming conventions, comments, and various other aspects) can be found at kernel.org. The style borrows many elements from K&R:\n\nThe kernel style uses tabs (with tab stops set at 8 characters) for indenting. Opening curly braces of a function go to the start of the line following the function header. Any other opening curly braces go on the same line as the corresponding statement, separated by a space. Labels in a codice_10 statement are aligned with the enclosing block (there is only one level of indents). A single-statement body of a compound statement (such as if, while, and do-while) need not be surrounded by curly braces. If, however, one or more of the substatements in an codice_11 statement require braces, then both substatements should be wrapped inside curly braces. Line length is limited to 80 characters.\n\nThe linux kernel style specifies that \"if only one branch of a conditional statement is a single statement ... use braces in both branches\":\n\nSome advocate mandatory braces for control statements with only a single statement in its scope, ie., bracing every if, else, while, etc., including single-line conditionals, so that insertion of a new line of code anywhere is always \"safe\" (i.e., such an insertion will not make the flow of execution disagree with the source code indenting).\n\nThe cost of this style is that one extra full line is needed for the last block (except for intermedia blocks in if/else if/else constructs and do/while blocks).\n\nWhile Java is sometimes written in other styles, a significant body of Java code uses a minor variant of the K&R style in which the opening brace is on the same line not only for the blocks inside a function, but also for class or method declarations.\nThis style is widespread largely because Sun Microsystems's original style guides used this K&R variant, and as a result most of the standard source code for the Java API is written in this style. It is also a popular indentation style for ActionScript and JavaScript, along with the Allman style.\n\nStroustrup style is Bjarne Stroustrup's adaptation of K&R style for C++, as used in his books, such as \"Programming: Principles and Practice using C++\" and \"The C++ Programming Language\".\n\nUnlike the variants above, Stroustrup does not use a “cuddled else”. Thus, Stroustrup would write\n\nStroustrup extends K&R style for classes, writing them as follows:\n\nStroustrup does not indent the labels and . Also, in this style, while the opening brace of a \"function\" starts on a new line, the opening brace of a \"class\" is on the same line as the class name.\n\nStroustrup allows writing short functions all on one line. Stroustrup style is a named indentation style available in the editor Emacs. Stroustrup encourages a K&R-derived style layout with C++ as stated in his modern \"C++ Core Guidelines\".\n\nAlso termed Kernel Normal Form, this is the form of most of the code used in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating systems. Although mostly intended for kernel code, it is also widely used in userland code. It is essentially a thoroughly-documented variant of K&R style as used in the Bell Labs Version 6 & 7 Unix source code.\n\nThe SunOS kernel and userland uses a similar indenting style. Like KNF, this also was based on AT&T style documents and that is sometimes termed Bill Joy Normal Form. The SunOS guideline was published in 1996; ANSI C is discussed briefly. The correctness of the indenting of a list of source files can be verified by the \"cstyle\" program written by Bill Shannon.\n\nIn this style, the hard tabulator (ts in vi) is kept at eight columns, while a soft tabulator is often defined as a helper also (sw in vi), and set at four. The hard tabulators are used to indent code blocks, while a soft tabulator (four spaces) of additional indentation is used for all continuing lines that must be split over multiple lines.\n\nMoreover, function calls do not use a space before the parenthesis, although C language native statements such as codice_2, codice_3, codice_14, codice_10 and codice_16 do (in the case where codice_16 is used with parens). Functions that declare no local variables in their top-level block should also leave an empty line after their opening block brace.\n\nHere follow a few samples:\n\nThe Allman style is named after Eric Allman. It is also sometimes termed \"BSD style\" since Allman wrote many of the utilities for BSD Unix (although this should not be confused with the different \"BSD KNF style\"; see above).\n\nThis style puts the brace associated with a control statement on the next line, indented to the same level as the control statement. Statements within the braces are indented to the next level.\n\nThis style is similar to the standard indenting used by the Pascal languages and Transact-SQL, where the braces are equivalent to the keywords codice_18 and codice_19.\nConsequences of this style are that the indented code is clearly set apart from the containing statement by lines that are almost all whitespace and the closing brace lines up in the same column as the opening brace. Some people feel this makes it easy to find matching braces. The blocking style also delineates the block of code from the associated control statement. Commenting out or removing a control statement or block of code, or code refactoring, are all less likely to introduce syntax errors via dangling or missing braces. Also, it is consistent with brace placement for the outer-function block.\n\nFor example, the following is still correct syntactically:\n\nAs is this:\n\nEven like this, with conditional compilation:\nA popular variant for use in education, Allman-8 uses the 8-space indentation tabs and 80-column limit of the Linux Kernel variant of K&R. The style purportedly helps improve readability on projectors. Also, the indentation size and column restriction help create a visual cue for identifying excessive nesting of code blocks. These advantages combine to help provide newer developers and learners implicit guidance to manage code complexity.\n\nThe Whitesmiths style, also sometimes termed Wishart style, was originally used in the documentation for the first commercial C compiler, the Whitesmiths Compiler. It was also popular in the early days of Windows, since it was used in three influential Windows programming books, \"Programmer's Guide to Windows\" by Durant, Carlson & Yao, \"Programming Windows\" by Petzold, and \"Windows 3.0 Power Programming Techniques\" by Norton & Yao.\n\nWhitesmiths, along with Allman, have been the most common bracing styles with equal popularity according to the Jargon File.\n\nThis style puts the brace associated with a control statement on the next line, indented. Statements within the braces are indented to the same level as the braces.\n\nThe advantages of this style are similar to those of the Allman style. Blocks are clearly set apart from control statements. The alignment of the braces with the block emphasizes that the full block is conceptually, and programmatically, one compound statement. Indenting the braces emphasizes that they are subordinate to the control statement. The ending brace no longer lines up with the statement, but instead with the opening brace.\n\nAn example:\ncodice_20 are treated as statement, much like the codice_21 preprocessor statement.\n\nLike the Allman and Whitesmiths styles, GNU style puts braces on a line by themselves, indented by two spaces, except when opening a function definition, where they are not indented. In either case, the contained code is indented by two spaces from the braces.\n\nPopularised by Richard Stallman, the layout may be influenced by his background of writing Lisp code. In Lisp, the equivalent to a block (a progn) is a first-class data entity, and giving it its own indentation level helps to emphasize that, whereas in C, a block is only syntax. This style can also be found in some ALGOL and XPL programming language textbooks from the 1960s and 1970s. Although not directly related to indenting, GNU coding style also includes a space before the bracketed list of arguments to a function.\n\nThis style combines the advantages of Allman and Whitesmiths, thereby removing the possible Whitesmiths disadvantage of braces not standing out from the block. One disadvantage is that the ending brace no longer lines up with the statement it conceptually belongs to. Another possible disadvantage is that it might waste space by using two visual levels of indents for one conceptual level, but in reality this is unlikely because, in systems with single-level indenting, each level is usually at least 4 spaces, same as 2 * 2 spaces in GNU style.\n\nThe GNU Coding Standards recommend this style, and nearly all maintainers of GNU project software use it.\n\nThe GNU Emacs text editor and the GNU systems' indent command will reformat code according to this style by default. Those who do not use GNU Emacs, or similarly extensible/customisable editors, may find that the automatic indenting settings of their editor are unhelpful for this style. However, many editors defaulting to KNF style cope well with the GNU style when the tab width is set to two spaces; likewise, GNU Emacs adapts well to KNF style by simply setting the tab width to eight spaces. In both cases, automatic reformatting destroys the original spacing, but automatic line indenting will work properly.\n\nSteve McConnell, in his book Code Complete, advises against using this style: he marks a code sample which uses it with a \"Coding Horror\" icon, symbolizing especially dangerous code, and states that it impedes readability. The Linux kernel coding style documentation also strongly recommends against this style, urging readers to burn a copy of the GNU coding standards as a \"great symbolic gesture\".\n\nThe 1997 edition of \"Computing Concepts with C++ Essentials\" by Cay S. Horstmann adapts Allman by placing the first statement of a block on the same line as the opening brace. This style is also used in examples in Jensen and Wirth's \"Pascal User Manual and Report\".\n\nThis style combines the advantages of Allman by keeping the vertical alignment of the braces for readability, and identifying blocks easily, with the saving of a line of the K&R style. However, the 2003 edition now uses Allman style throughout.\n\nThis is the style used most commonly in the language Pico by its designers. Pico lacks return statements, and uses semicolons as statement separators instead of terminators. It yields this syntax:\n\nThe advantages and disadvantages are similar to those of saving screen real estate with K&R style. An added advantage is that the starting and closing braces are consistent in application (both share space with a line of code), relative to K&R style, where one brace shares space with a line of code and one brace has a line alone.\n\nIn the book \"Programmers at Work\", C. Wayne Ratliff discussed using the style below. The style begins much like 1TBS but then the closing brace lines up with the indentation of the nested block. Ratliff was the original programmer behind the popular dBase-II and -III fourth-generation programming languages. He indicated that it was originally documented in material from Digital Research Inc. This style has sometimes been termed \"banner\" style, possibly for the resemblance to a banner hanging from a pole. In this style, which is to Whitesmiths as K&R is to Allman, the closing control is indented as the last item in the list (and thus properly loses salience). The style can make visual scanning easier for some, since the \"headers\" of any block are the only thing exdented at that level (the theory being that the closing control of the prior block interferes with the visual flow of the next block header in the K&R and Allman styles). Kernighan and Plauger use this style in the Ratfor code in \"Software Tools\".\n\nor, in a markup language...\n\nA programmer may even go as far as to insert closing braces in the last line of a block. This style makes indenting the only way to distinguish blocks of code, but has the advantage of containing no uninformative lines. This could easily be called the Lisp style (because this style is very common in Lisp code) or the Python style (Python has no braces, but the layout is very similar, as shown in the code blocks below). In Python, layout is a part of the language, called the off-side rule.\n\nHaskell layout can make the placement of braces optional, although braces and semicolons are allowed in the language. The two segments below are equally acceptable to the compiler:\nIn Haskell, indentation is significant, and layout can replace braces.\nUsually the braces and semicolons are omitted for procedural codice_14 sections and the program text in general, but the style is commonly used for lists, records and other syntactic elements made up of some pair of parentheses or braces, which are separated with commas or semicolons.\n\nIn some situations, there is a risk of losing track of block boundaries. This is often seen in large sections of code containing many compound statements nested to many levels of indentations. By the time the programmer scrolls to the bottom of a huge set of nested statements, he or she may have lost track of which control statements go where. However, overly-long code could have other causes, such as being too complex, and a programmer facing this problem might instead consider whether code refactoring would help in the longer term.\n\nProgrammers who rely on counting the opening braces may have difficulty with indentation styles such as K&R, where the starting brace is not visually separated from its control statement. Programmers who rely more on indentations will gain more from styles that are vertically compact, such as K&R, because the blocks are shorter.\n\nTo avoid losing track of control statements such as codice_4, a large indentation can be used, such as an 8-unit-wide hard tab, along with breaking up large functions into smaller and more readable functions. Linux is done this way, while using the K&R style.\n\nIn text editors of the vi family, one means to track block boundaries is to position the text cursor over one of the braces, and press the codice_24 key. The cursor then jumps to the opposing brace. Since the text cursor's codice_25 key (viz., the codice_26 key) retained directional positioning information (whether the codice_27 or codice_28 key was formerly pressed), the dot macro (the codice_29 key) could then be used to place the text cursor on the next brace, given a suitable coding style. Instead, inspecting the block boundaries using the codice_24 key can be used to enforce a coding standard.\n\nAnother way is to use inline comments added after the closing brace:\n\nThe major disadvantage of this method is maintaining duplicate code in multiple locations.\n\nAnother solution is implemented in a folding editor, which can hide or reveal blocks of code via their indentation level or compound-statement structure. Many editors will also highlight matching brackets or braces when the cursor is positioned next to one.\n\nK&R style prevents another common error suffered when using the standard Unix line editor, ed. A statement mistakenly inserted between the control statement and the opening brace of the loop block turns the body of the loop into a single trip.\n\nK&R style avoids this problem by keeping the control statement and the opening brace on the same line.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44814787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44814787", "title": "International Committee for Museology", "text": "International Committee for Museology\n\nICOFOM, the International Committee for Museology of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) was founded in 1977 at the initiative of Jan Jelínek, in order to promote research and theoretical thinking within the museum world. This committee became one of the most popular in International Council of Museums (ICOM). It addresses the study of the theoretical foundation that guides museum activities around the world or, more generally, the analysis of the different forms that museums can have. The committee includes several hundred museologists from all over the world, organizes yearly symposia and publishes, among other monographs, the annual journal \"ICOFOM Study Series\", available online.\n\nThe work of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), begun in 1946, was based on much older programmes, specifically professional symposia, journals of national associations (\"Museums Journal\", Great Britain, 1902; \"Museumskunde\", Germany, 1905), and of course the work of the International Office of Museums, founded in 1926 by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, located in Paris. A large part of the research which grew out of these associations, as with international committees, focused on objectives relating to concrete professional concerns. In 1968 ICOM launched an international committee for the training of museum professionals (ICTOP) at a time when museum training courses were gaining popularity, in particular in Brno, Czechoslovakia (1963), Leicester, UK (1966) and Paris (1970). On the other hand, the development of specific theories linked to the museum phenomenon – long referred to as \"museography\", which became \"museology\" after WWII – was not a research interest for most museum professionals. Nevertheless, this field was particularly interesting for some researchers and university professors, in particular in Eastern European countries, first of all Jan Jelínek who was director of the Antropos Museum in Brno and president of ICOM. The International Committee for Museology was founded in 1977 at the General Conference of ICOM in Moscow. Its first president was Jan Jelínek (Vinoš Sofka succeeded him in 1981). Since that date we can say that three generations of museologists have continued to pursue the work of ICOFOM.\n\nMuseology was already developed in Eastern Europe at the time of the cold war. From the start ICOFOM would be a unique international platform that included researchers from both sides of the Iron Curtain, who were trying to set up museology as an autonomous discipline: without this independent status museology could not be taught in universities in Eastern countries, making this task a challenge of singular importance in the countries of the Warsaw Pact. The iconic personalities of museology, such as Georges Henri Rivière, and especially André Desvallées in France, worked at the same time as influential museologists in the Eastern bloc, among whom are Avram Razgon (URSS), Klaus Schreiner (DDR), Jiří Neustupný (Czechoslovakia), Josef Beneš (Czechoslovakia), Wojciech Gluzinski (Poland), and especially Zbyněk Stránský (Czechoslovakia). The stated aim of ICOFOM, under the dynamic leadership of Vinoš Sofka (Sweden), was to make an inventory of the different trends in museology throughout the world, and to develop this discipline in order to endow it with the status of science within the academic structure. At the beginning this essentially theoretical approach disconcerted many museum researchers who were much more pragmatic, for example George Ellis Burcaw, author of an influential manual on museum work in the United States. Additionally, the climate of the cold war, which was still going on, did not help in creating closer links between the two sides. On the other hand, many researchers from Latin countries, in particular Waldisia Russio (Brazil), are especially attracted to this approach.\n\nMuch enlarged new definitions of museology emerged, whose object of study reaches beyond the museum itself. The museum institution per se, the concept of museum as opposed to the specific museum, such as the Prado,is relatively recent, and what interests museologists is a specific attitude which led to the creation of museums, as well as cabinets of curiosity, or in the future new forms linked to digital technologies (Virtual museums): As already defined by the Czech museologist Anna Gregorová in 1980 \"Museology is a science studying the specific relation of man to reality, consisting in purposeful and systematic collecting and conservation of selected inanimate material, mobile, and mainly three-dimensional objects documenting the development of nature and society\" and \"the museum is an institution which applies and carries out the specific relation of man to reality\". From this point of view, which allowed for better describing the particular activity of selecting and describing an object in a museum – a phenomenon not too far from a sacred act – more specific concepts were developed, such as musealisation, a term used more in French and Spanish than in English, (the act of introducing an object into a museum context), and museality (the special value of the object which determines its musealisation). Zbyněk Stránský, the Czech museologist, was of major importance in this development, through his involvement in ICOFOM and also through the International Summer School of Museology, which he founded in Brno in 1987.\n\nFollowing this first generation of ICOFOM researchers, under the eight year presidency of Vinoš Sofka, came a second, more diverse group of researchers. A leading member of this generation was Peter van Mensch (Netherlands), author of a 1992 doctoral thesis on museology as a scientific discipline: Towards a Methodology of Museology, who followed Sofka as President of ICOFOM. Other outstanding museologists in this generation were Ivo Maroévić (Croatia), Bernard Deloche and Mathilde Bellaigue (France), Martin Schaerer (Switzerland), as well as Teresa Scheiner (Brazil), Tomislav Šola (Croatia) and Nelly Decarolis (Argentina). Alpha Oumar Konaré, (Mali), who was particularly attentive to the development of new museology, had a remarkable career: he was elected President of ICOM in 1989, but did not renew his mandate when he became President of Mali in 1992.\n\nBroader definitions of the museum phenomenon began at this time, in particular one by Judith Spielbauer: “The established museum is a means to an end, not the end itself. These ends have been stated in many ways. They include varying perspectives on broadening an individual’s perception of the interdependence of the social, aesthetic and natural worlds in which he lives by providing information and experience and fostering an understanding of self within this widening context. The increase and dissemination of knowledge, the improvement of the quality of life, and preservation for future generations are all included in the usual parades of rationales.” Other thinkers, such as Jennifer Harris and Kerstin Smeds, further expanded the definitions and added provocative nuances.\n\nA third generation, schooled in museology by the second one, gradually joined the work of researchers: in particular one can note Wanchen Chang (Taiwan) and Bruno Brulon Soares (Brazil). They all share a global vision of museology founded on critical thinking about the development of museums in the world and on the values that form the conditions for museum work. For the past thirty years the museum has undergone considerable changes, whether becoming more market oriented which has been the case in many countries, museums' relationship to collections, which is endlessly altered, and of course digital technologies whose development has transformed our way of seeing the world. In the light of this evolution of the museum world, it is important to understand and to prepare for the possible evolution of the museum itself.\n\nToday museology – as seen by ICOFOM – can be defined as \"comprising all the efforts at theorization\nand critical thinking about the museum field\". This vision, intentionally very broad, collects trends of thought that are often conflicting as they are linked to critical thinkers in different parts of the world, whether Benjamin Ives Gilman or Georges Brown Goode, John Cotton Dana or Joseph Veach Noble, and, more currently, Duncan F. Cameron, Neil Postman, Georges Henri Rivière, Zbyněk Stránský, André Desvallées, Stephen Weil or Roland Arpin. ICOFOM is harnessed to this work of research and synthesis, and strives to compile an inventory of the different ways to conceive of museums and museology and to generate, through these syntheses, the trends that emerge from the vast flux of change in the museum field. Within ICOFOM most working researchers teach at universities after having spent part of their career in a museum (or while continuing museum work at the same time). Presently there are about 700 members in the committee, of whom about 60% are from European countries and more than 20% live in Latin America.\n\nICOFOM is known for its expansion into parts of the world where museums are rapidly developing. In this regard, Nelly Decarolis and Tereza Scheiner started and sustained a subcommittee, ICOFOM LAM, or ICOFOM Latin America. The great success of this subcommittee prompted the formation of ICOFOM ASPAC, ICOFOM Asia and the South Pacific, under the strong leadership of Olga Truevtseva and Hildegard Vieregg. Regional subcommittees such as these provide important support and training for those interested in the work of ICOFOM but who cannot always get to annual meetings. in distant parts of the world.\n\nRight from the start publications were a major part of ICOFOM activities. The first issues of \"Museological Working Papers\", published in 1980 and 1981, were followed by \"ICOFOM Study Series\" (ISS) published annually, which comprise in all several thousand pages and are available on line at the ICOFOM site. In general, ISS publishes papers presented at the ICOFOM symposiums. In 2007, the ICOFOM editorial committee installed a double-blind peer review of papers submitted for publication.\n\nICOFOM has also published syntheses of museology: \"What is a museum?\", the translation into English of the French monograph \"Vers une redéfiniton du musée\", edited in the framework of discussions regarding a new definition of Museum by ICOM for its revised Statues in 2007. More recently, in 2010, ICOFOM edited \"Key Concepts of Museology\", a summary that has been translated into 8 languages, of the major points of the \"Dictionnaire Encyclopédique de Muséologie\" published in 2011. This encyclopaedic dictionary of 722 pages, with thematic articles and amply illustrated, is the result of work begun in ICOFOM in 1993.\n\n\nAndré Desvallées is permanent advisor of ICOFOM and honorary member of ICOM\n"}

With an early construction history between 1684 and 1723, it is an excellent example of First Period architecture, and as the subject of an early 20th-century restoration by antiquarian George Francis Dow, it is an important example of the restoration techniques. Now owned by the Peabody Essex Museum, it is also one of the first colonial-era houses in the United States to be opened as a museum. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968.\n\nThe Ward House was built in three distinct phases. John Ward, a currier by profession, built the first portion of the house in 1684. This consisted of a two-story structure with one room on each floor, and a large chimney at one end. This portion was extended by Ward to the right-side of the chimney, giving the house a typical colonial five-bay facade, with center entry and chimney. The last addition to the house was the lean-to at the rear, which gave the house a saltbox appearance, and was apparently added not long before Ward's death in 1734. By this time he was apparently sharing the house with his son Benjamin, who inherited the property. The house remained in the hands of the Ward family until 1816, when it was sold at auction as part of an estate.\n\nThe buyer at auction was Temple Hardy, who lived in the house for forty years, and operated a bakery on the premises. The house was then converted to a multi-unit residential tenement, which it remained until 1910. At some point in the 19th century a wing was added to the east end of the building; this was removed before 1905. Originally located on Prison Lane (now St. Peter Street), the house was moved to its present site in 1910 by splitting it into two and rolling it on ox-drawn logs from its original site three blocks away. In 1912 the house underwent a careful restoration under the direction of antiquarian George Francis Dow. Dow's work included decorating the space to meet his conception of the use of the house c. 1700.\n\nIn 1911, parts of the house were opened to the public, becoming the first outdoor museum of architecture in the country. The Peabody Essex Museum now offers guided tours of the house. Rooms on the first floor feature 17th-century furnishings and displays in the lean-to on retail premises of the period.\n\nThe house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney and a side-gable roof. The roof of the main facade has two large cross gable sections, each with a single window; these gables were removed at some time in the history of the house, and rebuilt at the time of its restoration. The windows on the first two floors of the main facade are doubled casement windows with diamond panes (all of the house's windows are diamond-paned), except that above the doorway, which is a single window. The exterior is finished in clapboards, with very simple cornerboards and trim. The second floor extends over the first floor by a modest amount.\n\nThe first floor interior is a somewhat typical center-chimney plan, with chambers on either side, and a narrow stairway rising to the second floor directly inside the front door. Both the front door and the staircase are restored elements. The room left of the chimney is the parlor, and is finished in pine. Traces of whitewash and paint are evident on the main beams, and the summer beam and posts are chamfered. The floor and some of its joists are partly original, and partly the work of the 1912 restorers. The only major structural member to have restorative work done was a post supporting the chimney girt. The right-side room, considered the kitchen, exhibits similar restorative work.\n\nOn the second floor, the left chamber is the finer of the two, but is framed in oak instead of pine. The right-side chamber was left unrestored by the 1912 work, and exhibits faded wallpaper and a plastered ceiling, much as it would have at that time. The roof, although many of its framing elements are numbered in a traditional way, shows evidence of having been extensively reworked during the restoration.\n\n\n"}

It mainly collects, preserves and exhibits visual arts created by LGBTQ artists or art about LGBTQ themes, issues, and people. The Museum offers exhibitions year-round in numerous locations and owns more than 22,000 objects, including, paintings, drawings, photography, prints and sculpture. It has been recognized as one of the oldest arts groups engaged in the collection and preservation of gay art. In May 2011, the Foundation was awarded Museum status by the New York State Board of Regents. The Museum is a member of the American Alliance of Museums and operates pursuant to their guidelines.\n\nThe Museum maintains a Permanent Collection into which more than 1,300 objects have been accessioned. The Permanent Collection contains works by a number of well-known gay artists such as Berenice Abbott, David Hockney, Ingo Swann, Catherine Opie, Andy Warhol, Tom of Finland, Delmas Howe, Jean Cocteau, David Wojnarowicz, Robert Mapplethorpe, George Platt Lynes, Horst, Duncan Grant, James Bidgood, Duane Michals, Charles Demuth, Don Bachardy, Attila Richard Lukacs, Jim French, Del LaGrace Volcano, Paul Thek, Peter Hujar, Arthur Tress and many others.\n\nTo exhibit and preserve art that speaks directly to the many aspects of the LGBTQ experience, and foster the artists who create it. We embrace the rich creative history of this community by educating, informing, inspiring, entertaining, and challenging all who enter our doors.\n\nThe Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation was founded by J. Frederic \"Fritz\" Lohman and Charles W. Leslie. The two men had been collecting art for several years, and mounted their first exhibition of gay art in their loft on Prince Street in New York City in 1969. They opened a commercial art gallery shortly thereafter, but this venue closed in the early 1980s at the advent of the AIDS pandemic.\n\nIn 1987, the two men applied for nonprofit status as a precursor to establishing a foundation to preserve their collection of gay art and continue exhibition efforts. The Internal Revenue Service objected to the word \"gay\" in the title of the foundation and held up the nonprofit application for several years. The Foundation was granted nonprofit status in 1990.\n\nThe Leslie-Lohman Gay Art Foundation's first location was in a basement at 127B Prince Street in New York City. In 2006, the Foundation moved into a ground floor gallery at 26 Wooster Street in historic SoHo; gallery space will be expanding in size in 2016-2017.\n\nThe Museum offers several principle programs, including the maintenance of its Permanent and Study Collections, 6-8 annual exhibitions at 26 Wooster Street, 4-6 annual exhibitions in the Wooster Street Windows Gallery, and multiple weekend exhibitions and drawing workshops at its Prince Street Project Space at 127b Prince Street in SoHo. The Museum's exhibitions are organized by Guest Curators who submit proposals which are reviewed by the Museum Director and Exhibition Committee.\n\nIn addition, the Museum offers a complete year-round schedule of educational programing, including talks, lectures (Slava Mogutin, Duane Michals, Catherine Opie, Jonathan David Katz, etc.), films and books signings. The LLGAF also publishes \"The Archive\" made available to its membership that includes information on the Leslie-Lohman collection, new acquisitions, events, and articles on artists and exhibitions. The Museum has a library with more than 2,500 volumes on gay art and maintains files on more than 2,000 individual artists. The Museum has begun to travel its exhibitions as its 2013 \"Sascha Schneider\" exhibition traveled to the Schwules Museum in Berlin. The Museum's \"Classical Nude: The Making of Queer History\" was on preview at the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives gallery in West Hollywood in the summer of 2014.\n\nThe Museum makes objects in its collection available for loan to qualified organizations and in recent years has borrowed works from other institutions, including the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institution. New York Public Library, The Andy Warhol Museum, and other organizations.\n\nThe Leslie-Lohman Museum is governed by an independent Board of Directors. The Foundation employs a full-time staff, and relies on the assistance of volunteers to implement its programs. The Museum also runs a Fellowship Program. It is financed by its endowment, contributions from private donors and foundations as well as a membership program. The Foundation expands its collection primarily by donations from artists and collectors. It files an IRS 990 tax return each year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "79575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79575", "title": "Orosius", "text": "Orosius\n\nPaulus Orosius (; born 375, died after 418 AD) — less often Paul Orosius in English — was a Gallaecian Chalcedonian priest, historian and theologian, a student of Augustine of Hippo. It is possible that he was born in \"Bracara Augusta\" (now Braga, Portugal), then capital of the Roman province of Gallaecia, and which would be the capital of the Kingdom of the Suebi by his death. Although there are some questions regarding his biography, such as his exact date of birth, it is known that he was a person of some prestige from a cultural point of view, as he had contact with the greatest figures of his time such as Saint Augustine of Hippo and Saint Jerome. In order to meet with them Orosius travelled to cities on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, such as Hippo Regius and Alexandria.\n\nThese journeys defined his life and intellectual output. Orosius did not just discuss theological matters with Saint Augustine; he also collaborated with him on the book \"City of God\". In addition, in 415 he was chosen to travel to Palestine in order to exchange information with other intellectuals. He was also able to participate in a Church Council meeting in Jerusalem on the same trip and he was entrusted with transporting the relics of Saint Stephen. The date of his death is also unclear, although it appears to have not been earlier than 418, when he finished one of his books, or later than 423.\n\nHe wrote a total of three books, of which his most important is his \"Seven Books of History Against the Pagans\" (), considered to be one of the books with the greatest impact on historiography during the period between antiquity and the Middle Ages, as well as being one of the most important Hispanic books of all time. Part of its importance comes from the fact that the author shows his historiographical methodology. The book is a historical narration focusing on the pagan peoples from the earliest time up until the time Orosius was alive.\n\nOrosius was a highly influential figure both for the dissemination of information (\"History Against the Pagans\" was one of the main sources of information regarding Antiquity that was used up to the Renaissance) and for rationalising the study of history (his methodology greatly influenced later historians).\n\nDespite the importance of his books many questions remain regarding his life, hampering efforts to construct a biography with any certainty. This is particularly true for sources of information regarding his birth and death. However, his life has been widely studied and there are a number of authors who propose dates for both events.\n\nThe main biographical references for Orosius come from the writings of Gennadius of Massilia and Braulio of Zaragoza, although his own writings should not be overlooked. In addition, Orosius is mentioned in letters written by Saint Augustine.\n\nWhile there is no doubt regarding his surname of Orosius, there are questions regarding the use of the name \"Paulus\". Basically the problem is that it is not completely certain if he used this name or if he was simply called Orosius and whether Paulus has been added with the passing of time. This could have happened given that the initial \"P\" for priest was always placed next to his name, and over time this could have led to the confusion.\n\nHowever, this idea is flawed as authors writing immediately after Orosius's death use the name Paulus. In fact, even Casimiro Torres Rodríguez, one of the main scholars of Orosius's life, indicates that Paulus might be his Christian name and Orosius his native name, a theory that cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nWhatever the truth of the matter this subject has been widely studied and the most current theory is probably that of Pedro Martínez Cavero, another important Orosius scholar.\n\n The subject of his birthplace is still disputed although a broad consensus has now been reached. Basically there are four theories regarding his birthplace, that can be summarised as follows:\n\n\nLastly, his supposed date of birth varies between sources, however, a likely date has now been calculated. It is known for certain that in 415 Saint Augustine referred to Paulus Orosius as \"a young priest\", which means that at that time he could not have been older than 40, as he was young, and he had to be older than 30, as he was a priest.\n\nTherefore, his date of birth can be fixed as being between 375 and 385, although the most widely accepted date is considered to be 383. This assumes that when Orosius met Saint Augustine he was 32 years old, that is, he had been an ordained priest for two years.\n\nDespite the scarcity of sources, if his date of birth is accepted as that given above or at least within the window between 375 and 385 it can be seen that Orosius grew up during a period of cultural flourishing along with Hydatius and the Ávitos. Priscillianism was an important doctrine at this time and it is considered likely that after entering the priesthood he took an interest in the Priscillianist controversy, which was being widely debated in his native country.\n\nThe classical theories suggest that Orosius belonged to a family with good social standing, which would have allowed him to gain a good education. This would have developed along Christian lines, although assuming that Orosius was born in Braga, he would also have had a good knowledge of the rural culture of that time.\n\nContemporary histories indicate that from an early age Orosius was loquacious and erudite, alluding to statements to this effect made by both Saint Augustine and Pope Gelasius I. In any case, any discussion of Orosius's youth is pure speculation and conjecture because, as discussed above, there is little knowledge regarding this period of his life.\n\nIt is thought that Paulus Orosius lived in Gallaecia (northwest Hispania) until 409, but after that time and up until 415, there is no concrete information regarding his life. The traditional chronology, or at least the most widespread, proposes the succession of events outlined in the following paragraphs.\n\nIt appears that Orosius had to leave Braga as a result of the barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire. The date of his departure is in some doubt, however, what is known for certain is that he had to leave suddenly. This is even confirmed by Orosius himself who states that he was pursued onto the beach from which he set sail.\n\nA number of dates have been suggested for his departure from Braga, ranging from 409 to 414, however, the best option is to stick with the two most widely accepted dates:\n\n\nWhat is certain is that once Orosius had left the Iberian Peninsula he was certain that his destination was Hippo (now Annaba in Algeria), and a meeting with Saint Augustine, who was the greatest thinker of his time. From his arrival Orosius formed part of a team that worked alongside Saint Augustine. It is therefore possible that Orosius collaborated in the writing of \"The City of God\" or at the least that he was aware of the book.\n\nIn 415 Saint Augustine entrusted Orosius with the task of travelling to Palestine to meet with the thinker Saint Jerome who at that time was living in Bethlehem. This indicates that Saint Augustine had a great deal of faith in Orosius as relations between Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome had not always been good.\n\nThe visit to Palestine had a double purpose: Orosius wanted to discuss a number of theological topics with Saint Jerome, particularly those relating to the soul's origins, and Saint Augustine wanted closer ties with the thinker and to gather information regarding the Priscillianists, Origenists and the Pelagian heresy.\n\nIn reality, it would seem that Orosius's main task was to assist Jerome and others against Pelagius, who, after the synod of Carthage in 411, had been living in Palestine, and finding some acceptance there. Orosius met with Pelagius on Saint Augustine's behalf and he represented the orthodox party against the Pelagians at the Synod of Jerusalem that was held in June 415.\n\nAt the synod Orosius communicated the decisions of the synod of Carthage and read several of Augustine's writings against Pelagius. Success, however, was not achieved among Greeks who did not understand Latin, and whose sense of reverence was unfased by Pelagius's famous question, \"Et quis est mihi Augustinus?\" (\"Who is Augustine to me?\")\n\nOrosius succeeded only in obtaining John's consent to send letters and deputies to Pope Innocent I of Rome; and, after having waited long enough to learn the unfavourable decision of the Synod of Diospolis (Lydda) in December of the same year, he returned to North Africa,\n\nOrosius had a confrontation with the Archbishop of Jerusalem, John II at the synod, in which Orosius was accused of heresy in front of the entire conclave. As his defence Orosius wrote his second book \"Liber Apologeticus\", in which he emphatically rejected the accusation.\n\nOrosius's first act on meeting Saint Jerome was to hand him the correspondence that he had brought from Saint Augustine. This implies that the journey was always conceived of as a return journey as Orosius would have to deliver the letters from Saint Jerome back to Saint Augustine. In parallel to this, the relics of Saint Stephen were uncovered at the end of 415 and part of the find was given to Orosius in order that he could take it back to Braga. This marks both the start of his return journey and, from our current perspective, a new epoch in Orosius's life that is lacking in sources of information for its study.\n\nGiven that Saint Stephen's relics were uncovered on 26 December 415, Orosius must have departed from Palestine after that date. Although his idea was to travel to Braga, he was forced to pass through Hippo as it is known that he delivered letters from Jerome to Saint Augustine, it is also generally agreed that he passed through Jerusalem and Alexandria, although it is not known if he visited the latter on his outward journey, on his return journey or on both occasions.\n\nDuring his second stay in Hippo he had a long conversation with Saint Augustine during which he handed over the letters he was carrying from Jerome and informed Saint Augustine about the meetings he had had with Pelagius. The idea for Orosius's great work, \"Historiae Adversus Paganos\", was born during this reencounter with Saint Augustine. However, it is difficult to estimate an exact date for when the book was written and for when the book was finished. This has given rise to a number of theories regarding the writing of the book:\n\n\nVery little information is available regarding the life of Paulus Orosius after the publication of his \"Histories\". It is known that he was in Menorca where he used the remains of Saint Stephen in attempts to convert members of the Jewish community to Christianity, but the date of his death is not known. This lack of information regarding Orosius could be due to cooling of relations with Saint Augustine, who never makes any clear unambiguous references to Orosius's \"Histories\" once they have been published. Gennadius of Massilia considers that Orosius lived at least until the end of the Roman emperor Flavio Honorio’s mandate, which lasted until 423. However, there is no news of Orosius after 417 and it seems unlikely that such an active author would go six years without publishing anything new.\n\nThere are other theories, from a sudden death to a range of legends that talk of Orosius's final arrival in Hispania and his founding of a monastery near to Cabo de Palos where he ended his days, although this latter idea now seems improbable.\n\nAlthough Paulus Orosius's most important book was the \"\", his other two surviving books must also be taken into account: \"Commonitorium\" and \"Liber Apologeticus\".\n\nThe full name of his first book is ' (in ). Its chronology is littered with the same grey areas as Orosius's biography. In principle it is a book intended for Saint Augustine and therefore it must have been written before Orosius arrived in Africa, between 409 and 414 as discussed above. The second chronological limit is 415, which is traditionally considered to be the date when Augustine's book ' was published, in which Augustine replies to Orosius's \"\".\n\nThe book is not only aimed at Saint Augustine but was also preceded by conversations with the saint. It not only describes Orosius journey to Africa, but also summarises the beliefs of Priscillianism and Origenism, and it asks for Saint Augustine's advice regarding these theological issues, thereby exposing some of Orosius's theological doubts.\n\nThe full name of Orosius's second book is \"\". It was published at the time of Orosius's participation in the Council of Jerusalem in 415. The book is the result of a theological debate during which Archbishop John II accused Orosius of heresy due to his idea that man cannot remain free of sin, not even with the help of divine intervention.\n\nIn order to defend himself from these accusations Orosius wrote \"\", in which he describes his motives for participating in the synod, he was invited by Saint Jerome, and rejects the accusation of heresy made against him. However, neither of these two books are of a historical nature, despite containing elements that help in the reconstruction of Orosius's life.\n\nPaulus Orosius's masterpiece is \"\", the only history book that he wrote, which gives insight into the historiographical methodology of the Spanish priesthood. It is not possible to be certain as to when it was written as there is no single theory that is unanimously accepted by all historians. The most common estimate places the drafting of the book between 416 and 417.\n\nMiguel Ángel Rábade Navarro offers a clear and concise definition on Orosius's history in one of his articles on the author. In this article Rábade calls the \"Histories\" a \"universalist history with an apologetic and providentialist character, whose main aim is to compare a pagan past with a Christian present, through their followers, their actions and their geographical and temporal location\".\n\nBe this as it may, the book had a definite origin and a clear purpose. The book's origins were a response to Saint Augustine's express desire for a book that would complement his \"\" which is a history focused on the pagan races. The date of the book is not our main focus here, what is more important is Orosius's objective in responding to Saint Augustine's request by writing a book aimed at proving that Rome’s decadence – it should be remembered that Rome was sacked by Alaric I in 410 – had nothing at all to do with the fact that the Romans had relatively recently converted to Christianity.\n\nIn a more general way Orosius wanted to show that the world has improved since the introduction of Christianity rather than declined as others had argued. In response to those who pointed to contemporary disasters, he simply argues that previous disasters occurring before Christianity were much worse. The work, a universal history of the calamities that have happened to mankind was the first attempt to write the history of the world as a history of God guiding humanity.\n\nThroughout the seven books that comprise the history, Orosius introduces several new methods and he also uses others that pick up on the traditional methods of Graeco-Roman historiography. It should be pointed out that Orosius never offers a negative image of the Pagans, in this way he is being true to the traditions of the Graeco-Roman historians of that time, who always tried to give a positive impression of their \"enemies\".\n\nThe Universalist nature of Orosius's work is perhaps its most notable aspect. In fact, despite the lack of agreement regarding all other aspects of Orosius's life, including his biography and his works, most experts agree on the universalist nature of this work, including classicists such as Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo and even more modern historians such as Torres Rodríguez. In addition, his works are not only identified as universalist but as the first Christian universalist history, or put another way, the last classical universalist history.\n\nPaulus Orosius is not only a widely studied author he also described his own thoughts on his historical methodology in some of the prologues to the volumes that comprise his “Histories”. He was always clear in his objectives, he wanted to write the history starting with the creation and leading up to the times in which he lived, which is a clear declaration of his universalist intentions as a historian.\n\nOrosius uses the so-called \"succession of the four world empires theory\" throughout his works, which traced world history based on the premise that out of the ruins of one great civilization another arose. Therefore, his theory was based on four historical empires, Babylonia, pagan Rome, Macedonia and Carthage, with a fifth empire, that of Christian Rome as the inheritor of all these. In fact, during the narration of their histories the four empires develop in the same way and there are a number of striking parallels between them that are markedly different from Rome, which Orosius praises.\n\nOrosius's basic innovation in dealing with the four empires theory was to introduce Carthage between Macedonia and Rome, which is something that scholars such as García Fernández point out as one of Orosius's defining and definitive acts.\n\nAnother important characteristic of Orosius's “Histories” is defined as patriotism. There are two clearly defined positions regarding Orosius's patriotism, a more traditional view espoused by Torres Rodríguez and a more novel view as recently outlined by García Fernández.\n\nTorres Rodríguez’ theory refers to patriotism is the sense that Orosius places special emphasis on the events that took place in Hispania. This is normal given Orosius's origins, but it can be thought of not only as patriotism but also as Hispanism. Examples of this tendency include narratives of events in the “Histories”, that occurred in Braga or the fact that Orosius himself was charged with transporting the reliquaries of Saint Stephen. It is even pointed out that Orosius's narrations are sometimes used by current day groups of Galician nationalists.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2005 García Fernández made an explicit allusion to Torres Rodríguez’ theory when he stated that it was an exaggeration to characterize Orosius's historical methodology as “patriotic”. This was a rejection of nearly all of the statements made by Torres Rodríguez on this matter. García Fernández used the idea of “localism”, which was a fashionable idea amongst historians at the beginning of the 21st century. This idea argues that beyond \"Hispanism” Orosius shows a “benevolent attitude” to Hispania.\n\nAnother interesting point is the pessimism with which Orosius deals with certain themes and the exaggerated optimism with which he refers to others. In general he is pessimistic about anything to do with paganism or the past and optimistic regarding Christianity and his present, which is remarkable given the difficult times that he was living in.\n\nThese characteristics infuse all the others, it is particularly noticeable in his narration when he places a special emphasis on the suffering of the defeated, and the terrors of war. This characteristic can clearly be attributed to the influence of Saint Augustine, as Orosius is showing us the two sides of a coin in the purest style of Augustinian dualism.\n\nOrosius is thereby able to present the past as a series of adversities with concrete examples, from Noah's flood to the shipwrecking of ships in the Mediterranean Sea, and the future as something positive despite the reality of the times in which he lived.\n\nIn order to follow a narrative of suffering and tragedy he often concentrated on defeats, which was different from the usual Roman historiography which normally gave pre-eminence to victories. However, from a historiographical point of view this approach led to some inconsistencies, as, in order to bring the reader round to his point of view, Orosius sometimes described myths and legends as if they were historic fact.\n\nAnother traditional criticism of Orosius's work relates to this dichotomy of pessimism/optimism, which often causes him to offer a narrative that in many ways lacks an objective viewpoint. This divides historians into those that view him as biased and others that reject this criticism and justify his approach by saying that Orosius viewed history in the same way as Christians view life. Put another way, his approach is justified as being founded in the author's Providentialist character.\n\nThe narrative ability of Orosius should also not be overlooked. The author had a clear objective: that the Christians be defended from the non-Christian Roman's accusations that the sacking of Rome in 410 was a reprimand because the Christians had forsaken the city's traditional pantheon of gods.\n\nOrosius's narrative abilities in forwarding this argument therefore went beyond the pessimism/optimism duality that was discussed in the previous section. His basic idea is that the past is always worse than the present, because it is always further from the true religion.\n\nThe fact that he had clear objectives ensured that he wrote his stories with a definite end in mind. Therefore, there are events that he narrated with little detail and others that he presents in full detail. Orosius never seems lacking in sources of information, he even affirms that an historian should be selective with those he has, it rather seems that this difference in level of detail reflects the emphasis that he wants to place on reinforcing his ideas.\n\nThe fact that his writing has a moral objective and apologist agenda means that he focuses on unusual events, such as the suffering of the general population during wartime. This selection of facts, in large part, enables him to write about patriotism, for example, as he always pays a lot of attention to events in Hispania.\n\nAnother important aspect of Orosius's work is the importance he placed on geography in his work as a historian. This is shown in his geographic description of the world in the second chapter of the first of the seven books that comprise the \"Histories\".\n\nOne failing of his geographical descriptions is his imprecision, such as, for instance, when he overuses the noun \"Caucasus\" to refer to other nearby ranges. Despite this vagueness it is notable that the \"Histories\" include a chapter on geography. This has lent an increased value to his work in modern historiography, mainly thanks to authors such as Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel.\n\nThe sources Orosius used have been investigated by Teodoro de Mörner; besides the Old and New Testaments, he appears to have consulted Caesar, Livy, Justin, Tacitus, Suetonius, Florus and a cosmography, attaching also great value to Jerome's translation of the \"Chronicles\" of Eusebius.\n\nThe assumed falling out of Paulus Orosius and Saint Augustine at the end of the former's life does not seem to have had a negative effect on the distribution and impact of his \"Histories\".\n\nDespite the previously highlighted criticisms of his work, Orosius's books were considered to be successes from virtually the day of their publication. His \"Histories\" was considered to be one of the main works of Spanish historiography right up until the time of the Reformation. This success has, to a large extent, meant that his other works have also been conserved.\n\n\"Historiae Adversus Paganos\" has been quoted by all types of author from Saint Braulio of Zaragoza to Dante Alighieri. Even Lope de Vega made Orosius a central character in his play \"The Cardinal of Bethlehem\", which shows how long-lived his fame was. In fact, the book was not just widely quoted, it was one of the main scholastic books used by students of Ancient History throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nNearly two hundred manuscripts of the “Histories” have survived. An abridged, free translation, often wrongly attributed to King Alfred is still extant. The Florentine Judge Bono Giamboni translated it into the Italian. A still unpublished 14th century Aragonese translation, made by Domingo de García Martín at the request of Juan Fernández de Heredia, comes from Bono Giamboni's Italian translation. The “Histories” was also translated into Arabic during the reign of al-Hakam II of Córdoba. It later became one of the sources of Ibn Khaldun in his history.\n\nThe printed book has been widely copied and there are at least 82 surviving copies and 28 incunables from the first printed editions. There are even copies still existing of editions in Italian and German from the 16th Century.\n\nThere are many 19th century versions of the book still in existence. In fact, a version of the book edited by Torres Rodríguez was used in compiling this article, although there are many equally valid versions in existence, both in Castilian Spanish and in other languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "338359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338359", "title": "Royal Ontario Museum", "text": "Royal Ontario Museum\n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum (ROM, ) is a museum of art, world culture and natural history in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of the largest museums in North America and the largest in Canada. It attracts more than one million visitors every year, making the ROM the most-visited in Canada. The museum is north of Queen's Park, in the University of Toronto district, with its main entrance on Bloor Street West. The Museum subway station of the Toronto Transit Commission is named after the ROM and since 2008, it is decorated to resemble the institution's collection. \n\nEstablished on 16 April 1912 and opened on 19 March 1914, the museum has maintained close relations with the University of Toronto throughout its history, often sharing expertise and resources. The museum was under the direct control and management of the University of Toronto until 1968, when it became an independent Crown agency of the government of Ontario. Today, the museum is Canada's largest field-research institution, with research and conservation activities that span the globe. \n\nWith more than 6,000,000 items and 40 galleries, the museum's diverse collections of world culture and natural history contribute to its international reputation. The museum contains notable collections of dinosaurs, minerals and meteorites, Near Eastern and African art, Art of East Asia, European history and Canadian history. It houses the world's largest collection of fossils from the Burgess Shale with more than 150,000 specimens. The museum also contains an extensive collection of design and fine arts, including clothing, interior, and product design, especially Art Deco.\n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum was formally established on 16 April 1912 and was jointly governed by the Government of Ontario and the University of Toronto. Its first assets were transferred from the University and the provincial Department of Education, coming from its predecessor the Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts at the Toronto Normal School. On 19 March 1914, at 3:00pm, the Duke of Connaught, also the Governor General of Canada, officially opened the Royal Ontario Museum to the public. The museum's location at the edge of Toronto's built-up area, far from the city's central business district, was selected mainly for its proximity to the University of Toronto. The original building was constructed on the western edge of the property along the university's Philosopher's Walk, with its main entrance facing out onto Bloor Street housing five separate museums of the following fields: Archaeology, Palaeontology, Mineralogy, Zoology, and Geology. This was the first phase of a two-part construction plan that intended to expand the museum towards Queen's Park Crescent, ultimately creating an H-shaped structure.\nThe first expansion to the Royal Ontario Museum publicly opened on 12 October 1933. The renovation saw the construction of the south wing fronting onto Queen's Park and required the demolition of Argyle House, a Victorian mansion at 100 Queen's Park. As this occurred during the Great Depression, an effort was made to use primarily local building materials and to make use of workers capable of manually excavating the building's foundations. Teams of workers alternated weeks of service due to the physically draining nature of the job. \n\nIn 1947, the ROM was dissolved as a body corporate, with all assets transferred to the University of Toronto. This continued until 1968, when the Museum and the McLaughlin Planetarium were separated from the University to form a new corporation. \n\nOn 26 October 1968, the ROM opened the McLaughlin Planetarium on the south end of the property after receiving a $2 million donation from Colonel R. Samuel McLaughlin. By the 1980s, however, the planetarium's audiences were dwindling and due to budget cuts, the facility was forced to shut down in November 1995. The space temporarily reopened from 1998 to 2002, after being leased to Children's Own Museum. In 2009, the ROM sold the building to the University of Toronto for $22 million and ensured that it would continue to be used for institutional and academic purposes.\n\nThe second major addition to the museum was the Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries on the north side of the building and a curatorial centre built on the south, which started in 1978 and was completed in 1984. The new construction meant that a former outdoor \"Chinese Garden\" to the north of the building facing Bloor, along with an adjoining indoor restaurant, had to be dismantled. Opened in 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II, a $55 million expansion took the form of layered volumes, each rising layer stepping back from Bloor Street-- hence creating a layered terrace effect. The design of this expansion won a Governor General's Award in Architecture. \n\nIn 1989, activists complained about its \"Into the Heart of Africa\" exhibit, which featured stereotypes of Africans, forcing curator Jeanne Cannizzo to resign. \n\nBeginning in 2002, the museum underwent a major renovation and expansion project dubbed as \"Renaissance ROM.\" The Provincial and Federal governments, both supporters of this venture, contributed $60 million towards the project. The campaign aimed not only to raise annual visitor attendance from 750,000 to between 1.3 and 1.6 million, but also to generate additional funding opportunities to support the museum's research, conservation, galleries and educational public programs. The centrepiece of the project, the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, was a major addition to the building's original framework. The structure was created by architect Daniel Libeskind, whose design was selected from among 50 finalists in an international competition. The design saw the Terrace Galleries torn down (the curatorial centre to the south remains) and replaced with a Deconstructivist crystalline-form structure, named after Michael Lee-Chin who pledged $30 million towards its construction. Existing galleries and buildings were also upgraded, along with the installation of multiple new exhibits over a period of months. The first phase of the Renaissance ROM project, the Ten Renovated Galleries in the Historic Buildings, opened to the public on 26 December 2005. The architectural opening for the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal, however, took place less than 18 months later, on 2 June 2007. The final cost of the project was about $270 million. \n\nThe original building was listed by the City of Toronto on the Municipal Heritage Register on 20 June 1973, designated under Part IV of the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" in 2003, with a Heritage Easement on the buildings.\n\nDesigned by Toronto architects Frank Darling and John A. Pearson, the architectural style of the original building is Italianate Neo-Romanesque, popular throughout North America until the 1870s. The structure is heavily massed and punctuated by rounded and segmented arched windows with heavy surrounds and hood mouldings. Other features include applied decorative eave brackets, quoins and cornices. \n\nThe eastern wing facing Queen's Park was designed by Alfred H. Chapman and James Oxley. Opened in 1933, it included the museum's elaborate art deco, Byzantine-inspired rotunda and a new main entrance. The linking wing and rear (west) façade of the Queen's Park wing were originally done in the same yellow brick as the 1914 building, with minor Italianate detailing. However, the Queen's Park façade of the expansion broke away from the heavy Italianate style of the original structure. It was built in a neo-Byzantine style with rusticated stone, triple windows contained within recessed arches and different-coloured stones arranged in a variety of patterns. This development from the Roman-inspired Italianate to a Byzantine-influenced style reflected the historical development of Byzantine architecture from Roman architecture. Common among neo-Byzantine buildings in North America, the façade also contains elements of Gothic Revival in its relief carvings, gargoyles and statues. The ornate ceiling of the rotunda is covered predominantly in gold back-painted glass mosaic tiles, with coloured mosaic geometric patterns and images of real and mythical animals.\n\nWriting in the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada in 1933, A.S. Mathers said of the expansion: \"The interior of the building is a surprise and a pleasant one; the somewhat complicated ornament of the façade is forgotten and a plan on the grand manner unfolds itself. It is simple, direct and big in scale. One is convinced that the early Beaux Arts training of the designer has not been in vain. The outstanding feature of the interior is the glass mosaic ceiling of the entrance rotunda. It is executed in colours and gold and strikes a fine note in the one part of the building which the architect could decorate without conflicting with the exhibits.\" \n\nThe original building and the 1933 expansion have been listed since 1973 as heritage buildings of Toronto. In 2005, a major renovation of the heritage wings saw the galleries made larger, windows uncovered, and the original early 20th-century architecture made more prominent. The exteriors of the heritage buildings were cleaned and restored. The restoration of the 1914 and 1933 buildings was the largest heritage project undertaken in Canada. The renovation also included the newly restored Rotunda with reproductions of the original oak doors, a restored axial view from the Rotunda west through to windows onto Philosophers' Walk and ten renovated galleries comprising a total of . \n\nIn the master plan designed by Darling and Pearson in 1909, the ROM took a form similar to that of J.N.L. Durand's ideal model of the museum (published in the early 19th century). It was envisioned as a square plan with corridors running through the centre of the composition, converging in the middle with a domed rotunda. Overall, it referenced the upper-class palaces of the 17th and 18th centuries and aimed at having a strong sense of monumentality. All the architectural elements—the deep cornice, decorative top, eave brackets—add to this strength that the ROM possessed, as it was purely a structure with the function of collecting, but not of exhibiting. \n\nDuring the mid-2010s, the original entrance was used as a café. Since late-2017, the original entrance is undergoing renovation to become an alternate entrance, complete with the addition of ramps to the original entrance.\n\nDesigned by Toronto architect Gene Kinoshita, with Mathers & Haldenby, the curatorial centre forms the southern section of the museum. Completed in 1984, it was built during the same expansion as the former Queen Elizabeth II Terrace Galleries, which stood on north side of the museum. The architecture is a simple modernist style of poured concrete, glass, and pre-cast concrete and aggregate panels. The curatorial centre houses the museum's administrative and curatorial services, and provides storage for artifacts that are not on exhibit. In 2006, the curatorial centre was renamed to Louise Hawley Stone Curatorial Centre in honour of the late Louise Hawley Stone, who devoted herself to the ROM throughout her life and she donated a number of artifacts and various collections to the museum. In her will, she transferred C$49.7 million to the Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, created to help with the upkeep of the building and to the acquisition of new artifacts.\n\nThe controversial Michael Lee-Chin \"Crystal,\" a multimillion-dollar expansion to the museum including a new sliding door entrance on Bloor Street, first opened in 2007. The Deconstructivist crystalline form is clad in 25 percent glass and 75 percent aluminium, sitting on top of a steel frame. \"The Crystal\"'s canted walls do not touch the sides of the existing heritage buildings, but are used to close the envelope between the new form and existing walls. These walls act as a pathway for pedestrians to travel safely across \"The Crystal.\" \n\nThe building's design is similar to some of Libeskind's other works, notably the Jewish Museum in Berlin, the London Metropolitan University Graduate Centre and the Fredric C. Hamilton Building at the Denver Art Museum. The steel framework was manufactured and assembled by Walters Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario. The extruded anodized aluminium cladding was fabricated by Josef Gartner in Germany, the only company in the world that can produce the material. The company also provided the titanium cladding for Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.\n\nThe overall aim of \"The Crystal\" is to provide openness and accessibility, seeking to blur the lines between the threshold linking the public area of the street and the more private area of the museum. \n\nThe goal is to act as an open threshold where people and artifacts animate the space. On 1 June 2007, the Governor General, Michaëlle Jean, attended the architectural opening of the \"Michael Lee-Chin Crystal.\" This caused controversy because public opinion had been divided concerning the merits of its angular design. On its opening, \"Globe and Mail\" architecture critic Lisa Rochon complained that \"the new ROM rages at the world,\" was oppressive, angsty and hellish, while others-- perhaps championed by her \"Toronto Star\" counterpart, Christopher Hume-- hailed it as a monument. Some critics have gone as far as ranking it as one of the ten ugliest buildings in the world. The project also experienced budget and construction time over-runs, and drew comparisons to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao for using so-called \"starchitecture\" to attract tourism.\n\nThe main lobby is a three-story high atrium, named the Hyacinth Gloria Chen Crystal Court. The lobby is overlooked by balconies and flanked by the J.P. Driscoll Family Stair of Wonders and the Spirit House, an interstitial space formed by the intersection of the east and west crystals that is intended as a space of emotional and physical diversion.\n\nInstallation of the permanent galleries of the Lee-Chin Crystal began mid-June 2007, after a ten-day period when all the empty gallery spaces were open to the public. Within \"The Crystal,\" there is a gift shop, C5 restaurant lounge (closed until further notice), a cafeteria, seven additional galleries and Canada's largest temporary exhibition hall. The galleries added to the Crystal gave different aspects to the ROM: fascinating visuals, architectural artifacts and environment, art, correspondence between object and space and stories within the visuals. The C5 restaurant Lounge is an award-winning designs firm lI BY IV Design Associated Inc. \n\nIn October 2007, the Lee-Chin Crystal was reported to have suffered from significant water leakage, causing concerns for the building's resilience to weather, especially in the face of the new structure's proximate first winter. Although a two-layer cladding system was incorporated into the design of the Crystal to prevent the formation of dangerous snow loads on the structure, past architectural creations of Daniel Libeskind (including the Denver Art Museum) have suffered from weather-related complications.\n\nOriginally, there were five major galleries at the ROM, one each for the fields of archaeology, geology, mineralogy, paleontology and zoology. In general, the museum pieces were labelled and arranged in a static fashion that had changed little since Edwardian times. For example, the insects' exhibit that lasted up until the 1970s housed a variety of specimens from different parts of the world in long rows of glass cases. Insects of the same genus were pinned to the inside of the cabinet, with only the species name and location found as a description.\n\nBy the 1960s, more interpretive displays were ushered in, among the first being the original dinosaur gallery, established in the mid-1960s. Dinosaur fossils were now staged in dynamic poses against backdrop paintings and models of contemporaneous landscapes and vegetation. The displays became more descriptive and interpretive sometimes, as with the extinction of the woolly mammoth, offering several different leading theories on the issue for the visitor to ponder. This trend continued and up until the present time, the galleries became less staid and more dynamic or descriptive and interpretive. This trend arguably came to a culmination in the 1980s with the opening of The Bat Cave, where a sound system, strobe lights and gentle puffs of air attempts to recreate the experience of walking through a cave as a colony of bats fly out. \n\nThe original galleries were simply named after their subject material, but in more recent years, individual galleries have been named in honour of sponsors who have donated significant funds or collections to the institution. There are now two main categories of galleries present in the ROM: the Natural History Galleries and the World Culture Galleries. \n\nThe \"Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery\" is an exhibition space on Level 1, connecting the east wing of the museum with its western half. The gallery serves as the building's main lobby past the museum's admission area. As opposed to the most galleries at the Royal Ontario Museum, the \"Samuel Hall Currelly Gallery\" is not dedicated to a single subject. Instead, the gallery exhibits an assortment of items from the museum's collection.\n\nThe \"Patricia Harris Gallery of Costumes and Textiles\" holds about 200 artifacts from the ROM's textile and costume collections. These pieces, which range from the 1st century BC to the present day, are rotated frequently due to their fragility. Throughout time, textiles and fashion have been used to establish identity and allow inferences to be drawn about a culture's social customs, economy and survival. The gallery is devoted to showcasing transformations in textile design, manufacturing, and cultural relevance throughout the ages. Weaving, needlework, printed archaeological textiles and silks are all located in this space.\n\nThe \"CIBC Discovery Gallery\" was designed to be a kids' learning zone. It houses three main areas: In the Earth, Around the World and Close to Home. The space is inspired by the ROM's collections and enables children to participate in interactive activities involving touchable artifacts and specimens, costumes, digging for dinosaur bones and examining fossils and meteorites. There is also a special area for pre-schoolers. \n\nThe \"Patrick and Barbara Keenan Family Gallery of Hands-On Biodiversity\" introduces visitors to the complicated relationships which occur among all living things in a fun and interactive space. People of all ages can explore touchable specimens and interactive displays while gallery facilitators help visitors discover the living world around them. Mossy frogs, a touchable shark jaw, snake skin and a replica fox's den are just some of the objects that connect visitors to the amazing diversity and interdependence of plants and animals.\n\nThe Roloff Beny Gallery of the Institute for Contemporary Culture (ICC) hosts the Royal Ontario Museum's contemporary art exhibitions. This high-ceilinged multimedia gallery of approximately serves as the ICC's main exhibition space and the ROM's window on contemporary society, striving to connect the ROM's vast natural history and world cultures collection to contemporary art and events. The gallery has featured exhibitions on fashion photography, street art, modern Chinese urban design and architecture, and contemporary Japanese art.\n\nThe Natural History galleries are all gathered on the second floor of the museum. The gallery contains collections and samples of various animals such as bats, birds, and dinosaur bones and skeletons. \n\n\"The Life in Crisis: Schad Gallery of Biodiversity,\" designed by Reich+Petch and opened in late-2009, features endangered species, including specimens of a polar bear, a giant panda, a white rhinoceros, a Burmese python, Canadian coral, a leatherback sea turtle, a coelacanth, a Rafflesia flower and many other rare species. Included among these specimens is Bull, a southern white rhinoceros that became a famous conservation success story for his species. There are also recently extinct species displayed, including specimens of a passenger pigeon and a great auk, as well as skeletons of a dodo and a moa with a specimen of a moa egg and many other recently extinct species. The gallery presents the need to protect the natural environment and the need to educate the public about the main causes of extinction—overhunting, habitat destruction, and climate change. In September 2009, the gallery received an Award of Excellence by the Association of Registered Interior Designers of Ontario. The Schad Gallery of Biodiversity is not merely an exhibition gallery showcasing Earth's wondrous specimens, but a lesson for the future care of the planet. \n\nThe \"Life in Crisis\" gallery is organized into three zones exploring the central themes: Life is Diverse, Life is interconnected, and Life is at Risk. \"Interestingly, biodiversity is a relatively new term popularized in 1985 as a contraction of biological diversity\" said Anthony Reich, Principal at Reich+Petch. \"It's a big subject that's become more relevant to everybody. The challenge was how to tell this big story in a space. We decided to design a dynamic, immersive experience with three core themes that hopefully will make a lasting impression on visitors.\" \n\nThe \"Tallgrass Prairies and Savannas\" is a part of the gallery that features one of the most endangered and diverse habitats in Ontario. The display features examples of the regions and the efforts by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, to maintain and restore the tall grass prairies and savannas.\n\nThe \"Gallery of Birds\" has on display many bird specimens from past centuries. The Gallery of Birds is dominated by the broad \"Birds in flight\" display where stuffed birds are enclosed in a glass display for visitors to experience. Dioramas allow visitors to learn about the many bird species and how environmental and habitual changes have put bird species in danger of extinction. Pull-out drawers let visitors examine eggs, feathers, footprints and nests more closely. The gallery included exhibits of other extinct species such as the passenger pigeon. These exhibits were later moved to the Schad Gallery. \n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum purchased a beached blue whale off the coast of Newfoundland at Trout River and displayed its skeleton and heart. It was displayed as a ROM original travelling exhibit until 4 September 2017. \n\nThe Bat Cave is an immersive experience for visitors that presents over 20 bats and 800 models in a recreated habitat, with accompanying educational panels and video. Originally opened in 1988, the bat cave reopened on 27 February 2010 after extensive renovations. The exhibit most notably includes a recreation of St. Clair Cave located in central Jamaica. The original cave was formed by an underground river that flowed below ground through the limestone and was three kilometres long. This cave was then recreated in the museum based on ROM fieldwork conducted in Jamaica in 1984. A large amount of bat research has been conducted with support from the ROM. In 2011, the ROM hosted a \"bat workshop\" connected with the 41st Annual North American Symposium on Bat Research.\n\nThe \"Teck Suite of Galleries: Earth's Treasures\" features almost 3,000 specimens of minerals, gems, meteorites and rocks ranging from 4.5 billion years ago to the present. These items were found in many different locations including the Earth, Moon and beyond, and represent the world's dynamic geological environment. Notable specimens at the \"Teck Suite of Galleries\" include fragments of the Tagish Lake meteorite. The Light of the Desert, the world's largest faceted cerussite, is another notable piece displayed in the gallery. \n\nGalleries that are a part of the \"Teck Suite of Galleries\" include the \"Barrick Gold Corporation Gallery,\" the \"Canadian Mining Hall of Fame Gallery,\" the \"Gallery of Gems and Gold\" and the \"Vale Gallery of Minerals.\"\n\nThe \"Reed Gallery of the Age of Mammals\" explores the rise of mammals through the Cenozoic Era that followed the extinction of the dinosaurs. There are over 400 specimens from North America and South America on display. Also included in the gallery are 30 fossil skeletons of extinct mammals, over 160 non-mammalian specimens and hundreds of fossil plants, insects, fish and turtles. The gallery's entrance begins with mammals that arose shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A highlight of this gallery is the sabre-toothed nimravid Dinictis. \n\nThe \"James and Louise Temerty Galleries of the Age of Dinosaurs\" and \"Gallery of the Age of Mammals\" feature many examples of complete dinosaur skeletons, as well as those of early birds, reptiles, mammals and marine animals ranging from the Jurassic to Cretaceous periods. The highlight of the exhibit is Gordo, one of the most complete examples of the \"Barosaurus\" in North America and the largest dinosaur on display in Canada.\n\nThe World Culture galleries display a wide variety of objects from around the world. These range from Stone Age implements from China and Africa to 20th-century art and design. In July 2011, the museum added to this collection when a number of new permanent galleries were unveiled. Both the Government of Canada and the Royal Ontario Museum committed $2.75 million toward the project. The galleries are located on the first, third and fourth levels of the museum.\n\nThe \"Shreyas and Mina Ajmera Gallery of Africa, the Americas and Asia-Pacific\" features a collection of 1,400 artifacts that reflect the artistic and cultural traditions of the indigenous peoples from four different geographical areas: Africa, the American continents, the Asia-Pacific region and Oceania. On display are objects such as ceremonial masks, ceramics and even a shrunken head. \n\nThe \"Sir Christopher Ondaatje South Asian Gallery\" holds a diverse collection of objects such as decorative art, armour and sculptures that represents the culture of South Asia. The gallery has approximately 350 objects that represent over 5,000 years of history. Due to the wide range of history and cultures on display, the gallery is split into numerous different sections-- the \"Material Remains,\" \"Imagining the Buddha,\" \"Visualizing Divinity,\" \"Passage to Enlightenment,\" \"Courtly Culture,\" \"Cultural Exchange\" and \"Home and the World.\" In this gallery, visitors can find one of the ROM's Iconic Objects, the (\"Untitled\") Blue Lady by Navjot Altaf, listed as one of the museum's \"must see\" objects.\n\nThe \"Eaton Gallery of Rome\" is home to a millennium of ancient Roman culture. It has the largest collection of classical antiquities in Canada, displaying more than 500 objects that range from marble or painted portraits of historical figures to magnificent Roman jewellery. The gallery also features the Bratty Exhibit of Etruria that sheds some light on the Etruscans, a neighbouring civilization.\n\nThe \"Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Gallery of Rome and the Near East\" depicts the lifestyle and culture of societies under Roman rule and their influence in the Near East. \n\nThe \"Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Gallery of Byzantium\" covers the history of the Byzantine Empire from 330 to 1453 AD, during which crucial changes took place in early eastern Christianity. There are over 230 artifacts that relate to the dedication of Constantinople, the fall of the Roman Empire, the Medieval Crusades and the conquest by the Ottoman Turks — items such as jewelry, glass work and coins help to illustrate the vast history of modern-day Istanbul. \n\nThe \"A.G. Leventis Foundation Gallery of Ancient Cyprus\" houses roughly 300 artifacts, focusing on the art created in Cyprus between 2200–30 BC. The gallery is divided into five sections: \"Cyprus and Commerce,\" \"Ancient Cypriot Pottery Types,\" \"Sculptures,\" \"Ancient Cyprus at a Glance\" and \"Art & Society: Interpretations.\" The collection includes a reconstructed open-air sanctuary and a rare bronze relief statue of a man carrying a large copper ingot.\n\nThe \"Gallery of Africa: Egypt\" focuses on the life (and the afterlife) of Ancient Egyptians. It includes a wide range of artifacts, ranging from agricultural implements, jewelry, cosmetics, funerary furnishings and more.

Other items featured in the gallery include the \"Book of the Dead of Amen-em-hat,\" a seven-metre long scroll from c. 320 BC and the \"Bust of Cleopatra\" from c. 47–30 BC.\n\nThe \"Galleries of Africa: Nubia\" feature a collection of objects that explore the once flourishing civilization of Nubia in modern-day Sudan. The Nubians were the first urban literary society in Africa south of the Sahara and were Egypt's main rival. \n\nThe \"Gallery of the Bronze Age Aegean\" features over 100 objects that include examples from the Cycladic, Minoan, Mycenaean and Geometric periods of Ancient Greece. The collection ranges in age from 3200–700 BC and contains a variety of objects that include a marble head of a female figure and a glass necklace. \n\nThe \"Gallery of Greece\" has a collection of 1,500 artifacts that span the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods. This time span witnessed the bit of Western art. The collection consists of items such as sculptures of deities, armour and a coin collection.\n\n\"The Daphne Cockwell Gallery of Canada: First Peoples\" provides a look inside the culture of Canada's earliest societies: the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada. The gallery contains more than 1,000 artifacts that help to reveal the economic and social forces that have influenced Native art. \n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum holds a major but little-known collection of Northwest coast native art and artifacts acquired by the Reverend Dr. Richard Whitfield Large at Bella Bella, British Columbia between 1899 and 1906 known as the \"R.W. Large Collection.\" Although the collection is one of the most important Heiltsuk collections in existence because of its unique documentation, there has never been a comprehensive study of it. Subject of the book Bella Bella: A Season of Heiltsuk Art, the collection was also part of the Kaxlaya Gvilas (Heiltsuk) exhibit put together collaboratively with the Heiltsuk Nation and the University of British Columbia. \n\nThere is also a rotating display of contemporary Native art, an area dedicated to the works of pioneer artist Paul Kane and a theatre devoted to traditional storytelling. Just outside this gallery, the central staircase winds around the Nisga'a and Haida Crest Poles of the Royal Ontario Museum, one of the museum's iconic objects. \n\nThe \"Sigmund Samuel Gallery of Canada\" is located on the Weston Family Wing, displaying collections of early Canadian memorabilia, the majority of which is historical decorative and pictorial arts, but also includes a number of historical artifacts among other things. The gallery has approximately 560 artifacts on display and covers the period from early European settlement to the beginning of the modern industrial era. The displays are split up into sections to display the strength and weaknesses of the collections and strongly reflect the French and British cultural heritage of Canada. A notable item from the museum's collection that are featured at the \"Sigmund Samuel Gallery of Canada\" include \"The Death of General Wolfe\" by Benjamin West.\n\nThe Chinese Galleries comprise four sections: the \"Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art,\" the \"Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Gallery of China,\" the \"Matthews Family Court of Chinese Sculpture\" and the \"ROM Gallery of Chinese Architecture.\"\n\nThe \"Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art\" gallery contains three of the world's best-preserved temple wall paintings from the Yuan dynasty (AD 1271–1386) and a number of wooden sculptures depicting various bodhisattvas from the 12th to 15th centuries. Chinese temple wall paintings featured in this gallery include the \"Homage to the Highest Power,\" a Daoist wall painting dating to c. 1300 and \"Paradise of Maitreya,\" another Chinese wall temple painting from 1298. \n\nThe \"Matthews Family Court of Chinese Sculpture\" has a wide variety of sculptures that span 2,000 years of Chinese sculptural art. It also displays a number of smaller objects that explore the development of religions in China from the 3rd to 19th centuries AD. The gallery features several notable items from the museum's collection, including Wei Bin's Temple Bell, a ceremonial bell crafted in 1518 and the , two statues that originate from the Tang dynasty. The gallery also features one of the Yixian glazed pottery luohans, a glazed sculpture that dates to the 11th century AD. \n\nThe \"Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Gallery of China\" consists of approximately 2,500 objects spanning almost 7,000 years of Chinese history. The gallery is divided into five sections: the \"T. T. Tsui Exhibit of Prehistory and Bronze Age\"; the \"Qin and Han Dynasties\"; the \"Michael C.K. Lo Exhibition of North, South, Sui and Tang\"; \"the Song, Yuan and Frontier Dynasties\"; and the \"Ming and Qing Dynasties.\" Each section focuses on a different period of Chinese history, displaying objects ranging from jade discs to pieces of furniture. \n\nThe \"ROM Gallery of Chinese Architecture\" houses one of the largest collection of Chinese architectural artifacts outside of China and is the first gallery of Chinese architecture in North America. Artifacts held in the gallery include the Tomb of General Zu Dashou. The tomb includes an assortment of related artifacts, including the altar, stone burial mound and archway. The gallery holds some spectacular exhibits such as a reconstruction of an Imperial Palace building from Beijing's Forbidden City and a Ming-era tomb complex.\n\nThe \"Gallery of Korea\" is the only gallery of Korean art in Canada. With approximately 260 objects and artifacts, the gallery brings to life Korean and culture. Furniture, ceramics, metalwork, printing technology, painting and decorative arts, dating from the 3rd to 20th centuries AD, illustrate the many accomplishments to Korean culture.\nBuddhism being a large part of the Korean culture was introduced to them through China and took hold on the general population. The influence of Buddhism on the Korean culture is portrayed with two statues, the first being a Sarira casket which originated in India and were made to enshrine the remains of a Buddha or enlightened masters and the second of a tomb guardian. \n\nThe \"Prince Takamado Gallery of Japan\" contains the largest collection of Japanese artworks in Canada, featuring a rotating display of ukiyo-e prints and the only tea master collection in North America. Notable pieces of Japanese art featured in the \"Prince Takamado Gallery of Japan\" include \"Fan print with two bugaku dancers\" and \"Unit 88-9.\" The gallery is split into a number of different sections, each home to the collection of objects that the name suggests: the \"Toyota Canada Inc. Exhibit of Ukiyo-e Pictures,\" the \"Sony Exhibit of Painting,\" the \"Canon Canada Inc. Samurai Exhibit,\" the \"Mitsui and Co. Canada Tea Ceremony Exhibit,\" the \"Maple Leaf Foods Exhibit of Lacquers\" and the \"Linamar Corporation Exhibit of Ceramics.\" The gallery is named in honour of the late Japanese Prince Takamado (also known as Norihito), who spent several years at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. \n\nThe \"Herman Herzog Levy Gallery\" is the primary venue for East Asian exhibitions visiting the museum. The Portrait of Namjar was previously displayed in the gallery, although it was later removed and taken to storage.\n\nThe \"Samuel European Galleries\" have over 4,600 objects that chronicle the development of decorative and other arts in Europe from the Middle Ages to the 20th century. The period rooms depict the development of decorative arts in Central and Western Europe by showcasing changes in style during the Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical and Victorian periods. Other specialized collections relating to Culture and Context, Judaica, Art Deco and Arms and Armour are also displayed. An iconic piece at the \"Samuel European Galleries\" is the Earl of Pembroke's Armour. Dating from 1550 to 1570, the armour was crafted for William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Another notable pieces from the museum's European collection is the Otho tazza. The piece was one of 12 tazzas that made up the Aldobrandini Tazze, a set of Renaissance era cups that featured the first 12 Roman emperors whose lives are described in \"The Twelve Caesars.\"\n\nThe \"Wirth Gallery of the Middle East\" explores civilizations from the Palaeolithic Age to 1900 AD found within the Fertile Crescent, which stretches from the Eastern Mediterranean and Persia (Iran) and Iraq to the Arabian Peninsula. The over 1,000 artifacts relate to the writing, technology, spirituality, everyday life and warfare of the ancient Babylonians, Sumerians, and Assyrians. These civilizations made huge advances in writing, mathematics, law, medicine and religion, which are represented throughout the gallery. Pieces from the museum's collection that are featured at the \"Wirth Gallery of the Middle East\" include plastered human skulls made in the Levant c. 8000 BC. Another notable piece in the gallery is the Striding Lion, a wall relief from the throne room of Nebuchadnezzar II's palace.\n\nCollections at the ROM not displayed are stored at various unclassified and offsite locations around the Greater Toronto Area and in the McLaughlin Planetarium.\n\nThe ROM provides access for a wide range of communities.\n\nThe ROM strives to recognize the diversity of visitor abilities and needs and offers programs and services to ensure accessibility for all and are available in both English and French. These include:\n\nIn 2008, ROMCAN was created to make the ROM more accessible to a variety of communities. ROMCAN provides free general admission tickets to participating community and charitable organizations. Each year, thousands of general admission tickets are distributed to these communities. ROMCAN tries to eliminate barriers that might stand between these communities and the museum. Since 2008, ROMCAN developed into a larger community initiative that seeks to enable learning experiences for visitors and organizations. A main goal of the program is to give the museum the power to engage, share and inspire a greater diversity of visitors by trying to break through economic and social barriers. Partners include United Way Toronto, Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada, The Hospital for Sick Children and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.\n\nThe novel \"Calculating God\" by Canadian science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer is mainly set in the ROM. The novel received nominations for both the Hugo and John W. Campbell Memorial Awards in 2001.\nIn the novel \"Bugs Potter Live at Nickaninny\" by Canadian children's author Gordon Korman, one of the primary characters searching for the lost Naka-mee-chee (fictional) tribe was from the ROM. A large part of \"Life Before Man,\" a novel by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood, takes place in ROM. Three of the four main characters of the novel work there. The museum is described in the novel in great detail, including the dinosaur gallery with its exhibits, contemporary to the time when the novel takes place. The novel was a finalist for the Governor General's Award.\n\nThe museum was also filmed in several television shows. It was featured in \"Zoboomafoo,\" an American-Canadian children's television series in the season 1 episode \"Dinosaurs\", where the Kratt brothers (Chris and Martin were invited to see the museum's dinosaur bones. The museum was also used as a filming location the police procedural \"Flashpoint\" for an episode of the third season.\n\n\"Galleries of the Royal Ontario Museum: Ancient Egypt and Nubia.\" 1994.

More precisely, this set of positions can be decomposed into the union of a finite set and finitely many full arithmetic progressions. Here, an infinite arithmetic progression is full if there exist integers \"a\" and \"b\" such that the progression consists of all positive integers equal to \"b\" modulo \"a\".\n\nThis result is named after Thoralf Skolem (who proved the theorem for sequences of rational numbers), Kurt Mahler (who proved it for sequences of algebraic numbers), and Christer Lech (who proved it for sequences whose elements belong to any field of characteristic 0). Its proofs use p-adic analysis.\n\nConsider the sequence\nthat alternates between zeros and the Fibonacci numbers.\nThis sequence can be generated by the linear recurrence relation\n(a modified form of the Fibonacci recurrence), starting from the base cases \"F\"(1) = \"F\"(2) = \"F\"(4) = 0 and \"F\"(3) = 1. For this sequence,\n\"F\"(\"i\") = 0 if and only if \"i\" is either one or even. Thus, the positions at which the sequence is zero can be partitioned into a finite set (the singleton set {1}) and a full arithmetic progression (the positive even numbers).\n\nIn this example, only one arithmetic progression was needed, but other recurrence sequences may have zeros at positions forming multiple arithmetic progressions.\n\nThe Skolem problem is the problem of determining whether a given recurrence sequence has a zero. There exist an algorithm to test whether there are infinitely many zeros, and if so to find the decomposition of these zeros into periodic sets guaranteed to exist by the Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem. However, it is unknown whether there exists an algorithm to determine whether a recurrence sequence has any non-periodic zeros .\n\n"}
{"id": "14171448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14171448", "title": "Specification (technical standard)", "text": "Specification (technical standard)\n\nA specification often refers to a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material, design, product, or service. A specification is often a type of technical standard.\n\nThere are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs), and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them. The word \"specification\" is broadly defined as \"to state explicitly or in detail\" or \"to be specific\". \n\nUsing the term \"specification\" without a clear indication of what kind is confusing and considered bad practice.\n\nA requirement specification is a documented requirement, or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc. It is a common early part of engineering design and product development processes, in many fields.\n\nA functional specification is a kind of requirement specification, and may show functional block diagrams.\n\nA design or product specification describes the features of the \"solutions\" for the Requirement Specification, referring to either a designed solution or final produced solution. It is often used to guide fabrication/production. Sometimes the term \"specification\" is here used in connection with a data sheet (or \"spec sheet\"), which may be confusing. A data sheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product, often published by a manufacturer to help people choose or use the products. A data sheet is not a technical specification in the sense of informing how to produce.\n\nAn \"in-service\" or \"maintained as\" specification, specifies the conditions of a system or object after years of operation, including the effects of wear and maintenance (configuration changes).\n\nSpecifications are a type of technical standard that may be developed by any of various kinds of organizations, both public and private. Example organization types include a corporation, a consortium (a small group of corporations), a trade association (an industry-wide group of corporations), a national government (including its military, regulatory agencies, and national laboratories and institutes), a professional association (society), a purpose-made standards organization such as ISO, or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements. It is common for one organization to \"refer to\" (\"reference\", \"call out\", \"cite\") the standards of another. Voluntary standards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract.\n\nIn engineering, manufacturing, and business, it is vital for suppliers, purchasers, and users of materials, products, or services to understand and agree upon all requirements. \n\nA specification may refer to a standard which is often referenced by a contract or procurement document, or an otherwise agreed upon set of requirements (though still often used in the singular). In any case, it provides the necessary details about the specific requirements.\n\nStandards for specifications may be provided by government agencies, standards organizations (ASTM, ISO, CEN, DoD, etc.), trade associations, corporations, and others. The following British standards apply to specifications:\n\nA design/product specification does not necessarily prove a product to be correct or useful in every context. An item might be verified to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number: this does not, by itself, indicate that the item is fit for other, non-validated uses. The people who use the item (engineers, trade unions, etc.) or specify the item (building codes, government, industry, etc.) have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications, specify the correct one, enforce compliance, and use the item correctly. Validation of suitability is necessary.\n\nSometimes a guide or a standard operating procedure is available to help write and format a good specification. A specification might include:\n\nSpecifications in North America form part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of building and infrastructure projects. Specifications describe the quality and performance of building materials, using code citations and published standards, whereas the drawings or Building Information Model (BIM) illustrates quantity and location of materials. The guiding master document of names and numbers is the latest edition of MasterFormat. This is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two professional organizations: Construction Specifications Canada and Construction Specifications Institute based in the United States and updated every two years.\n\nWhile there is a tendency to believe that \"Specifications overrule Drawings\" in the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings, the actual intent must be made explicit in the contract between the Owner and the Contractor. The standard AIA (American Institute of Architects) and EJCDC (Engineering Joint Contract Documents Committee) states that the drawings and specifications are complementary, together providing the information required for a complete facility. Many public agencies, such as the Naval Facilities Command (NAVFAC) state that the specifications overrule the drawings. This is based on the idea that words are easier for a jury (or mediator) to interpret than drawings in case of a dispute.\n\nThe standard listing of construction specifications falls into 50 Divisions, or broad categories of work types and work results involved in construction. The divisions are subdivided into sections, each one addressing a specific material type (concrete) or a work product (steel door) of the construction work. A specific material may be covered in several locations, depending on the work result: stainless steel (for example) can be covered as a sheet material used in Flashing and Sheet Metal in Division 07; it can be part of a finished product, such as a handrail, covered in Division 05; or it can be a component of building hardware, covered in Division 08. The original listing of specification divisions was based on the time sequence of construction, working from exterior to interior, and this logic is still somewhat followed as new materials and systems make their way into the construction process.\n\nEach Section is subdivided into three distinct Parts: \"General\", \"Products\" and \"Execution\". The MasterFormat and Section Format system can be successfully applied to residential, commercial, civil, and industrial construction. Although many Architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use ArCHspec (which was specifically created for residential projects). Master specification systems are available from multiple vendors such as Arcom, Visispec, BSD, and Spectext. These systems were created to standardize language across the United States and are usually subscription based.\n\nSpecifications can be either \"performance-based\", whereby the specifier restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the completed work, \"prescriptive\" where the specifier states the specific criteria such as fabrication standards applicable to the item, or \"proprietary\", whereby the specifier indicates specific products, vendors and even contractors that are acceptable for each workscope. In addition, specifications can be \"closed\" with a specific list of products, or \"open\" allowing for substitutions made by the Contractor. Most construction specifications are a combination of performance-based and proprietrary types, naming acceptable manufacturers and products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must be met.\n\nWhile North American specifications are usually restricted to broad descriptions of the work, European ones and Civil work can include actual work quantities, including such things as area of drywall to be built in square meters, like a bill of materials. This type of specification is a collaborative effort between a specwriter and a quantity surveyor. This approach is unusual in North America, where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of both drawings and specifications. In many countries on the European continent, content that might be described as \"specifications\" in the United States are covered under the building code or municipal code. Civil and infrastructure work in the United States often includes a quantity breakdown of the work to be performed as well. \n\nAlthough specifications are usually issued by the architect's office, specification writing itself is undertaken by the architect and the various engineers or by specialist specification writers. Specification writing is often a distinct professional trade, with professional certifications such as \"Certified Construction Specifier\" (CCS) available through the Construction Specifications Institute and the Registered Specification Writer (RSW) through Construction Specifications Canada. Specification writers are either employees of or sub-contractors to architects, engineers, or construction management companies. Specification writers frequently meet with manufacturers of building materials who seek to have their products specified on upcoming construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the estimates leading to their proposals.\n\nIn February 2015, ArCHspec went live, from ArCH (Architects Creating Homes), a nationwide American professional society of Architects whose purpose is to improve residential architecture. ArCHspec was created specifically for use by Licensed Architects while designing SFR (Single Family Residential) architectural projects. Unlike the more commercial CSI (50+ division commercial specifications), ArCHspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional Divisions, plus a Division 0 (Scope & Bid Forms) and Division 17 (low voltage). Many architects, up to this point, did not provide specifications for residential designs, which is one of the reasons ArCHspec was created: to fill a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use. Shorter form specifications documents suitable for residential use are also available through Arcom, and follow the 50 division format, which was adopted in both the United States and Canada starting in 2004. The 16 division format is no longer considered standard, and is not supported by either CSI or CSC, or any of the subscription master specification services, data repositories, product lead systems, and the bulk of governmental agencies.\n\nSpecifications in Egypt form part of contract documents. The Housing and Building National Research Center (HBRC) is responsible for developing construction specifications and codes. The HBRC has published more than 15 books which cover building activities like earthworks, plastering, etc.\n\nSpecifications in the UK are part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building. They are prepared by construction professionals such as architects, architectural technologists, structural engineers, landscape architects and building services engineers. They are created from previous project specifications, in-house documents or master specifications such as the National Building Specification (NBS). The National Building Specification is owned by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) through their commercial group RIBA Enterprises (RIBAe). NBS master specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive, and delivered using software functionality that enables specifiers to customize the content to suit the needs of the project and to keep up to date.\n\nUK project specification types fall into two main categories prescriptive and performance. Prescriptive specifications define the requirements using generic or proprietary descriptions of what is required, whereas performance specifications focus on the outcomes rather than the characteristics of the components.\n\nSpecifications are an integral part of Building Information Modeling and cover the non-geometric requirements.\n\nPharmaceutical products can usually be tested and qualified by various Pharmacopoeia. Current existing pharmaceutical standards include:\n\nIf any pharmaceutical product is not covered by the above standards, it can be evaluated by the additional source of Pharmacopoeia from other nations, from industrial specifications, or from a standardized formulary such as\n\n\nA similar approach is adopted by the food manufacturing, of which Codex Alimentarius ranks the highest standards, followed by regional and national standards.\n\nThe coverage of food and drug standards by ISO is currently less fruitful and not yet put forward as an urgent agenda due to the tight restrictions of regional or national constitution\n\nSpecifications and other standards can be externally imposed as discussed above, but also internal manufacturing and quality specifications. These exist not only for the food or pharmaceutical product but also for the processing machinery, quality processes, packaging, logistics (cold chain), etc. and are exemplified by \"ISO 14134\" and \"ISO 15609\"\n\nThe converse of explicit statement of specifications is a process for dealing with observations that are out-of-specification. The United States Food and Drug Administration has published a non-binding recommendation that addresses just this point.\n\nAt the present time, much of the information and regulations concerning food and food products remain in a form which makes it difficult to apply automated information processing, storage and transmission methods and techniques.\n\nData systems that can process, store and transfer information about food and food products need formal specifications for the representations of data about food and food products in order to operate effectively and efficiently.\n\nDevelopment of formal specifications for food and drug data with the necessary and sufficient clarity and precision for use specifically by digital computing systems have begun to emerge from government agencies and standards organizations.\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration has published specifications for a \"Structured Product Label\" which drug manufacturers must by mandate use to submit electronically the information on a drug label.\n\nRecently, ISO has made some progress in the area of food and drug standards and formal specifications for data about regulated substances through the publication of \"ISO 11238\"\n\nIn many contexts, particularly software, specifications are needed to avoid errors due to lack of compatibility, for instance, in interoperability issues.\n\nFor instance, when two applications share Unicode data, but use different normal forms or use them incorrectly, in an incompatible way or without sharing a minimum set of interoperability specification, errors and data loss can result. For example, Mac OS X has many components that prefer or require only decomposed characters (thus decomposed-only Unicode encoded with UTF-8 is also known as \"UTF8-MAC\"). In one specific instance, the combination of OS X errors handling composed characters, and the samba file- and printer-sharing software (which replaces decomposed letters with composed ones when copying file names), has led to confusing and data-destroying interoperability problems.\n\nApplications may avoid such errors by preserving input code points, and only normalizing them to the application's preferred normal form for internal use.\n\nSuch errors may also be avoided with algorithms normalizing both strings before any binary comparison.\n\nHowever errors due to file name encoding incompatibilities have always existed, due to a lack of minimum set of common specification between software hoped to be inter-operable between various file system drivers, operating systems, network protocols, and thousands of software packages.\n\nA formal specification is a mathematical description of software or hardware that may be used to develop an implementation. It describes \"what\" the system should do, not (necessarily) \"how\" the system should do it. Given such a specification, it is possible to use formal verification techniques to demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to that specification. This has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing the design. An alternative approach is to use provably correct refinement steps to transform a specification into a design, and ultimately into an actual implementation, that is correct by construction.\n\nIn (hardware, software, or enterprise) systems development, an architectural specification is the set of documentation that describes the structure, behavior, and more views of that system.\n\nA program specification is the definition of what a computer program is expected to do. It can be \"informal\", in which case it can be considered as a user manual from a developer point of view, or \"formal\", in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms. In practice, many successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed, although safety-critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development. Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable.\n\nIn software development, a functional specification (also, functional spec or specs or functional specifications document (FSD)) is the set of documentation that describes the behavior of a computer program or larger software system. The documentation typically describes various inputs that can be provided to the software system and how the system responds to those inputs.\n\nWeb services specifications are often under the umbrella of a quality management system.\n\nThese types of documents define how a specific document should be written, which may include, but is not limited to, the systems of a document naming, version, layout, referencing, structuring, appearance, language, copyright, hierarchy or format, etc. Very often, this kind of specifications is complemented by a designated template.\n\n"}

The straw used may be that of wheat, rye, oats, spelt or peastraw; twigs and modern artificial materials have also been used. The bears may be relatively realistic in appearance, with detailed masks, or fully rounded headpieces, or they may be more abstract, with narrow heads like a long, tapering sheaf.\n\nStraw bears may be derived from the medieval carnival figure of the Wild Man. They were also interpreted by early folklorists as personifications of Winter, and their appearance in late winter or early spring was seen as a ritual expulsion of winter from the community. Others think they were merely intended to represent the real \"dancing\" bears that used to be taken from place to place for entertainment.\n\nThe bears were originally accompanied by groups of costumed attendants and musicians and visited houses, begging from door to door. One of the earliest known references is from Wurmlingen in 1852. In most cases they were rewarded with gifts of eggs, lard and flour (it may have been significant that these three items were white in colour), or \"Fasnetsküchle\" (carnival fritters), or money. At the end of the day the group would share or consume their gifts in a tavern. This \"quête\" (begging) style of custom is no longer practiced; most bears now appear as part of carnival processions, although there are some which still remain independent of the carnival itself.\n\nStraw bears appeared particularly in agricultural communities. Although the tradition is no longer as widespread as it once was, straw bears can still be found in Baden-Württemberg, Hessen (particularly the Vogelsberg), Lower Saxony, Bavaria, the Hunsrück and Eifel areas of Rhineland-Palatinate, and Thuringia.\n\nToday they are particularly associated with the \"Swabian-Alemannic Carnival\" or \"Fastnacht\" of southwestern Germany in the area between the upper Neckar River and Lake Constance of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Formerly there were also straw bears in Pomerania, Rheinland and West Germany. In some places the straw-swathed characters are not intended to represent bears, and are simply known as straw men.\n\nThe decline in popularity of straw characters in carnival today is thought to be largely due to the difficulty of obtaining straw of suitable length and quality. Modern farmers generally prefer cultivars with shorter straw, or use chemical sprays to make the straw grow shorter so that their crops are less prone to damage by storms. Artificial materials have replaced straw in a few places. In other places, such as Hirschauer, where the \"Äschadreppler\" is traditionally clad in peastraw, crops are being specially planted to ensure the supply of the appropriate straw for the costumes.\n\nModern straw bear costumes may be kept from year to year; formerly they were often burned at the end of the day on which they were used. This still happens in some places.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The society concerns itself with the historic county, which includes, in addition to the current administrative county, the areas now forming the London boroughs of Lambeth, Wandsworth, Southwark, Croydon, Kingston, Merton, Sutton, and Richmond. The Society has also published two editions of registers of medieval bishops of Winchester, Surrey having historically formed part of the Diocese of Winchester.\n\nThe Society was established in 1912, largely on the initiative of Hilary Jenkinson (1882–1961), then an archivist at the Public Record Office and also honorary secretary of the Surrey Archaeological Society. It had become clear that the Archaeological Society was unable or unwilling to commit itself to a sustained programme of publication of archival sources for the county's history, and Jenkinson believed that an entirely new body was necessary. He became its secretary, and his Record Office colleague M. S. Giuseppi its general editor. Giuseppi stood down in 1924 to be succeeded by Jenkinson, who held the positions of secretary and general editor jointly until 1950. In that year he was elected president of the Society. In these roles, Jenkinson established many of the principles of record editing and publication which were subsequently adhered to not only by the Surrey Record Society itself, but also more widely.\n\nThe Society's first publication, which appeared in two volumes issued in parts between 1913 and 1924, was \"Registrum Johannis de Pontissara\", the register of John of Pontoise (d. 1304), Bishop of Winchester 1282–1304.\n\nRecent volumes, which illustrate the range of subject-matter addressed, have included:\n\nIn the interest of speedy publication, it was the Society's practice in its early decades to issue its texts in serial form, as editing work progressed, in \"parts\" (or fascicles), with card covers. The intention was that, once all the parts comprising a volume had appeared, members could bind them together. Some volumes were issued in parts irregularly over several years, interspersed with parts of other volumes. Publications were generally issued with two separate numerical identifiers, a volume number and a \"number\" (i.e. a part number), but the details supplied on the covers and title-pages were not always complete or consistent. The practice led to bibliographical confusion for librarians and readers, and was abandoned after the Second World War.

The mine was supposedly discovered in 1760 by an Englishman named Jonathan Swift. The uncertainty of its location is part of the folklore of its existence, with locations ascribed to eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia or eastern Tennessee.\n\nThe legend of Swift's silver mine is based on accounts given in the journal of an Englishman named Jonathan Swift. Swift claimed to have preceded Daniel Boone into Kentucky, coming to the region in 1760 on a series of mining expeditions. The journal recounts how a wounded bear led Swift to a vein of silver ore in a cave, and how that for the next nine years, he made annual treks back to the site of the mine, carrying out \"silver bars and minted coins.\" An article in an 1886 edition of \"Harper's Magazine\" tells how Swift supposedly buried a good deal of the treasure at various locations:\n\nLater, amid numerous obstacles that included Indian attacks, and a mutiny by his crew, Swift walled up the cave and discontinued his mining operation. He left his journal in the possession of a Mrs. Renfro, the widow of one Joseph Renfro of Bean's Station, Tennessee, in whom he was purported to have a romantic interest. Before Swift could return to the mine, he was stricken blind and was unable to locate it again.\n\nSettlers in Wise County, Virginia believed that the mine was located on or around Stone Mountain, and that local Indians knew the location of the mine. According to the settlers, an Indian chief named Benge once said that \"if the pale face knew what he knew they could shoe their horses cheaper with silver than with iron.\" They maintain that a captured settler named Hans G. Frenchman was taken to the mine by the Indians. He marked its location, and later escaped his captors and revealed the location of the mine to Swift. In this version of the story, Swift and Frenchman took only enough silver to buy two horses, and on a return trip, were unable to locate the mine.\n\nAnother variation along these lines holds that Swift was taken to the mine by a Frenchman named \"Monday\" or \"Monde\". In this version, Swift and Monde are driven from the mine by an Indian attack, and Swift kills Monde for fear that he will reveal the location of the mine to others. Later, when Swift attempts to return to the mine, Monde's hand covers the compass so he cannot tell which direction to proceed.\n\nSolomon Mullins, or \"Money-making Sol\" (born 1782, died 1858) was rumored to have discovered Swift's mines near Pine Mountain in Southwest Virginia. Solomon lived in what was then known as Holly Creek, but is now Clintwood, Virginia. Solomon melted the silver down and used one of his slaves to \"strike\" for him (striking: the head of a hammer is heated until it is a plastic state and struck over a good coin. The coin, being harder than the softened head of the hammer is, therefore, imprinted. The hammer is then allowed to cool thus producing the die). To finish the process, or to imprint the counterfeit coins with official markings, Sol and his slave would relocate to the privacy afforded by caves located on cliffs adjacent Sol's farm. To this day, the cliffs are known as \"Sol's Cliffs.\"\n\nAccording to local legend, Solomon's \"counterfeit\" money used more silver, and was worth more, than the official currency at the time. Apparently, Sol mixed the pure silver with other lesser metals to make his money. Solomon never disclosed where he obtained the pure silver, but many people speculated that he found the silver in one of the many caves on Pine Mountain close to his farm.\n\nOnce, Solomon was caught by a U.S. detective while at work in the cliffs. Reportedly, realizing his predicament, he ordered the man to help with his work, saying \"Grab a hammer and strike this.\" He hoped the action, if taken, would make the detective complicit; regardless of the story's veracity, it didn't do Sol any good. In early 1837, Solomon and two of his 10 children, Peter and Spencer, were brought to trial and were charged with making counterfeit coins. Solomon was found guilty, but fled Virginia before being sentenced. He reportedly died in 1858 and never revealed the location of his source of silver.\n\nEach year in Wolfe County, Kentucky there is a Swift Silver mine festival in the county seat of Campton, Kentucky where locals believe the mine may be located near Swift Creek.\n\nJohn Filson is the first person known to have referenced the mine following Swift's death. In 1788, Filson claimed a tract of land supposed to have included a silver mine worked by \"a certain man named Swift.\" Filson disappeared, taking with him any knowledge he may have had as to the mine's location.\n\nKentucky pioneer James Harrod may also have believed in Swift's silver mine. According to Harrod's wife, a man named Bridges claimed to have found the mine, and asked Harrod for his help in developing it. Despite the fact that Harrod and Bridges had a dispute over land some years previous, these two and another man entered the wilderness of Kentucky in 1792, purportedly in search of the mine. Harrod did not return from the trip, and although his body was never found, his wife maintained that Bridges had used the story of the mine to lure him into the woods to murder him.\n\nWhen Judge John Haywood was working on a history of the area around Clear Creek in Kentucky, he observed two \"ancient\" furnaces that he believed may have been used by Swift.\n\nIn 1854, Professor David Dale Owen was dispatched to Bell County, Kentucky as part of a geological survey of the state. As part of the survey, Owen examined a location reputed by the locals to be the site of Swift's silver mine. Guided by an explorer named Benjamin Herndon, Owen examined the area and found that it contained \"some accidental minerals sparingly disseminated, such as sulphuret of Zinc and lead – which proved on examination to be hydrated silicate of alumina.\" Owen's survey did not find any significant deposits of silver ore in the area.\n\nGeological evidence casts doubt on the existence of Swift's silver mine. In two centuries, subsequent mining and excavation of the area claimed to have contained the mine have not yielded a single vein of silver ore.\n\nSkeptical writer Joe Nickell pointed out that there are numerous versions of the journal upon which the legend of Swift's Silver Mine is based. The best known and most complete of these contains portions plagiarized from a history of Kentucky dating later than the supposed time frame of the journal itself. Because this version is filled with references to Freemasonry and moral allusions, some historians dismiss the entire tale as an allegory.\n\nThere is the question of Swift himself. No proof exists that there ever was a John or Jonathan Swift who mined silver in Kentucky. (James Dougherty gives alternate first names of \"George\", \"William\", and \"Tom\".) The man many considered to be the Jonathan Swift of legend is known to have been alive many years after the purported death of the fabled miner. Nothing is known of this man's ancestry, and what little is known about him personally has been handed down through tradition. If the birth date given in Swift's journal is to be believed, the known Swift would have been an incredible 112 years old at the time of his death.\n\nIf there was an actual Jonathan Swift, there is some disagreement as to his character. Tradition holds that he was an established Indian trader, but some historians came to believe he was a pirate who preyed on Spanish merchants and made his frequent trips into the wilderness not to retrieve his treasure, but to hide and coin it. A resident of Laurel County, Kentucky named William Reams held that following Swift's visit to the mine in 1769 – the last trip recorded in the journal – he and his accomplices agreed not to claim any of the treasure they had hidden in the area until 1790. When they did return, Swift was overcome by the sight of the wealth and killed the other members of the party while they slept. Following this action, he was struck blind and unable to recover the treasure.\n\nNickell contends that the pirate theory raises more questions than it answers. He contends that a journey into Kentucky was a dangerous undertaking, and that Swift could just as easily set up a clandestine coining operation in the backwoods of Virginia or aboard his ship. He also questions why Swift would take the time to produce such a detailed journal to cover his story.\n\n\n\n"}

It is housed in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Bonn and was established with funding from the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts. The project has a projected run-time of fifteen years and is directed by Nikolai Grube from the Department of Anthropology of the Americas at the University of Bonn. The goal of the project is to conduct computer-based studies of all extant Maya hieroglyphic texts from an epigraphic and cultural-historical standpoint, and to produce and publish a database and a comprehensive dictionary of the Classic Mayan language.\n\nThe text database, as well as the dictionary that will be compiled by the conclusion of the project, will be assembled based on all known texts from the pre-Hispanic Maya culture. These texts were produced and used between approximately the third century B.C. through A.D. 1500, in a region that today includes parts of the countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. The thousands of hieroglyphic inscriptions on monuments, ceramics, or daily objects that have survived into the present offer insight into the language’s vocabulary and structure. The project’s database and dictionary will digitally represent original spellings using the logo-syllabic Maya hieroglyphs, as well as their transcription and transliteration in the Roman alphabet. The data will be additionally annotated with various epigraphic analyses, translations, and further object-specific information.\n\nTWKM will employ digital technologies in order to compile and make available the data and metadata, as well as to publish the project’s research results. The project thereby methodologically positions itself in the field of the digital humanities. The project will be conducted in cooperation with the project partners (below), the research association for the eHumanities TextGrid, as well as the University and Regional Library of Bonn (ULB). The working environment that is currently under construction, in which the data and metadata will be compiled and annotated, will be realized in theTextGrid Laboratory, a software of the virtual research environment. A further component of this software, the TextGrid Repository, will make the data that are authorized for publication freely available online and ensure their long-term storage. \nThe tools for data compilation and annotation attained from the modularly constructed and extended TextGrid lab thereby provide all the necessary materials for facilitating the research team’s the typical epigraphic workflow. The workflow usually begins by documenting the texts and the objects on which they are preserved, and by compiling descriptive data. It then continues with the various levels of epigraphic and linguistic analysis, and concludes in the best case scenario with a translation of the analyzed inscription and a corresponding publication. In cooperation with the ULB, selected data will additionally be made available. The project’s Virtual Inscription Archive will present online, in the Digital Collections of the ULB, hieroglyphic inscriptions selected from the published data in the repository, including an image of and brief information about the texts and the objects on which they are written, epigraphic analysis, and translation.\n\nOne of the project’s goals is to produce a dictionary of Classic Mayan, in both digital and print form, towards the end of the project run-time. Additionally, a database with a corpus of inscriptions, including their translations and epigraphic analyses, will be made freely available online. The database furthermore will provide an ontology-like link of the contextual object data with the inscriptions and with each other, thereby allowing a cultural-historical arrangement of all contents within the periods of pre-Hispanic Maya culture. The contents of the database are additionally linked to citations of relevant literature. As a result, the database will also make freely available to both the scientific community and other interested parties a bibliography representing the research history and a base of knowledge concerning ancient Maya culture and script.\nIn addition, the Classic Maya script, in its temporally defined stages of language development, will be gathered into and documented in a comprehensive language corpus with the aid of the information gathered by the project. In collaboration with all project participants, the corpus data can be used, together with the aid of various comparable analyses and also computational linguistic methods, such as inference-based methods, to confirm readings of some hieroglyphs that are currently only partially confirmed, and to eventually completely decipher the Classic Maya script.\n\n\n"}

Efforts to improve the quality of vital statistics will therefore be closely related to the development of civil registration systems in countries.\n\nA vital statistics system is defined by the United Nations \"as the total process of (a) collecting information by civil registration or enumeration on the frequency or occurrence of specified and defined vital events, as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and the person or persons concerned, and (b) compiling, processing, analyzing, evaluating, presenting, and disseminating these data in statistical form\" (UN, 2001). Civil registration, as defined by the United Nations, is the\" continuous, permanent, compulsory, and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events (livebirths, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages, and divorces) and other civil status events pertaining to the population as provided by decree, law or regulation, in accordance with the legal requirements in each country.\"\n\nThe origin of vital statistics begins as early as 1854 with James Stark in Register House in Edinburgh in reaction to the Scottish Registration Act and death by social class was recorded in England beginning in 1921.\n\nWhile the number of births and deaths can be obtained by enumeration at certain points in time (e.g. censuses and surveys), civil registration collects this information on a continuous basis and is the only source that provides individuals with a legal document. For instance, the importance of birth registration as the first legal recognition of the child is emphasized in Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that \"the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents\". United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a number of non-governmental organizations (Plan International, Save the Children Fund, World Vision, etc.) have particularly promoted the human rights aspects of registration, while the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) have focused more on the statistical aspects of civil registration.\n\nCountries which are signatories to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are therefore expected to set up systems to register the births of all children. Non-registration of a child can have negative consequences on the wider enjoyment of a child’s fundamental rights to benefits such as identity, inheritance, education, health and other social services. Birth registration is also part of a broader strategy to ensure that children are less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, especially if separated from their parents. In the absence of a functioning birth registration system, it is difficult to see how a country can enforce age-related legal concerns such as schooling, child labour, juvenile justice, early marriage, sexual exploitation and military recruitment. Recent natural disasters and calamities have also demonstrated the utility of a birth certificate for reuniting lost children with their families.\n\nMany civil registration systems also collect information on causes of death. Statistics based on these death records are of particular importance in public health for identifying the magnitude and distribution of major disease problems, and are essential for the design, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of health programmes and policies.\n\nToronto scientist, professor Prabhat Jha argues that inexpensive recording of vital statistics in developing countries is the most effective means to improve global health and has outlined 5 options for expanding Cause of Death reporting.\n\n\"Despite the importance of tracking causes of death and the tradition since 1893 of standardisation of definitions and coding for causes of death in the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD), global assessments of causes of death are a major analytical challenge. Vital registration systems that include medical certification of the cause of death captured about 18.8 million deaths of an estimated annual total of 51.7 million deaths in 2005, which is the latest year for which the largest number of countries reported deaths from a vital registration system. Even for these deaths, the comparability of findings on the leading causes of death is affected by variation in certification skills among physicians, the diagnostic and pathological data available at the time of completing a death certificate, variations in medical culture in choosing the underlying cause, and legal and institutional frameworks for governing mortality reporting. For the remaining deaths that are not medically certified, many different data sources and diagnostic approaches must be used from surveillance systems, demographic research sites, surveys, censuses, disease registries, and police records to construct a consolidated picture of causes of death in various populations. Because of the variety of data sources and their associated biases, causes of death assessments are inherently uncertain and subject to vigorous debate.\"\n\nThe agency responsible for overseeing this system in the United States is the National Center for Health Statistics, a division of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vital statistics for the US can be found here.\n\nThe agency responsible for overseeing this system in the United Kingdom is the Office for National Statistics. Vital statistics for the UK can be found here.\n\n\n"}

It contains rules which allow players to field massive armies the likes of which are unwieldy using the basic Warhammer 40,000 ruleset. It also allows players to field units that are not available in normal Warhammer 40,000 games, such as large super-heavy tanks and robot-like titans, some of which can stand up to 400 feet in height.\n\nThe first print of the Apocalypse sourcebook was released in October 2007, during the latter days of Warhammer 40,000's fourth edition. The release of the fifth edition of Warhammer 40,000 in 2008 prompted Games Workshop to start working on an update to the Apocalypse ruleset in order to streamline its compatibility with the new edition. This update culminated in the announcement of \"Warhammer 40,000: Apocalypse Reload\", an all-new 88-page edition of the Apocalypse rulebook. The newest edition was released in July 2013, along with new models, templates and scenery pieces. It has 296 pages of full color as well as updated rules for the game.\n\nAlong with the official sourcebooks themselves, Games Workshop and its subsidiary Forge World has released supplementary material and model kits that can only be used with the Apocalypse ruleset. Most notable of which was the plastic Baneblade super-heavy tank boxed set released by Games Workshop at the same time as the Apocalypse rulebook. At the time, the Baneblade was the largest plastic kit that the company produced; Prior to that time, all large Warhammer 40,000 tanks were produced only in resin by Forge World. The Baneblade was also the first Warhammer 40,000 model kit created by Games Workshop that could only be used with an optional expansion and not within the base Warhammer 40,000 game. The Stompa was released along with the first edition, an Ork model of a ramshackle metal giant with multiple weapons around its belly and arms. In the newest edition, the Necron Tesseract and the Khorne Lord of Skulls were released as the super heavy models during Apocalypse games. Along with the Baneblade and the Stompa, they are the only models built around Apocalypse that are not produced by Forge World. The Necron Tesseract is a prison containing a god-like being, releasing massive amounts of lethal energy around the battlefield. The Khorne Lord of Skulls is a Chaos tank fused with cannons and a chainsaw of a metal knight-like body.\n\nLike many other miniature wargames, Warhammer 40,000 relies on a point-based system to ensure a balanced game between players. Players set a maximum amount of pointage that they will construct their armies with. No matter what faction a player uses, each unit has a corresponding point cost, with generally powerful units costing much more than standard soldiers. A typical game of Warhammer 40,000 ranges from 500 to a little over 2,000 points. The introduction of the Apocalypse sourcebook offered players a streamlined ruleset for playing games of well over 3,000 points. Apocalypse also allows for the use of allies, in order to help players to reach an Apocalypse size army.\n\nGames Workshop released Apocalypse formations, which are essentially dozens of miniature to play an Apocalypse game, in July 2013. They are often the quickest way to build an Apocalyptic army.\n\n"}

The third edition of the dictionary includes 5,500 notes appended to various word and character entries that point out common mistakes and non-standard usages among Mandarin Chinese users. These notes were created in part through a review of common errors in Gaokao examination papers.\n\nIn 2004, two million copies of the first edition of \"Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian\" were printed. In March 2004, Jiang Lansheng and other twelve members of the 1st Plenary Session of the 10th CPPCC National Committee submitted a proposal titled 《辞书应慎用“规范”冠名》 (Literally: Dictionaries Ought to Use the Word \"Standard\" (\"Guifan\") in their Titles More Prudently). The document stated that \"Xiandai Hanyu Cidian\" was in full compliance with the nation's linguistic standards and questioned the naming of and the overall editorial quality of \"Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian\". Some of the argumentation was derived from the book 《拯救辞书——规范辨正、质量管窥及学术道德考量》.\n\nThe second edition of the dictionary, published in 2010, includes 70,000 entries and 80,000 example usages. Among the new words and 2,600 new definitions added in the second edition included (Weibo), (Low-carbon economy), and (reduce discharge of pollution).\n\nThe third edition of \"Xiandai Hanyu Guifan Cidian\" was the first dictionary to be written according to the standard of the \"Table of General Standard Chinese Characters\". New entries included in the (Additions Part 2: Multi-syllable Entries) section of the third edition include (WeChat), (whine), (lose contact), (criticize), (positivity) (down-to-earth), (particulate matter 2.5) and others. The third edition added new definitions for some words. For example, \" was newly defined as 'new rich'. In the (Additions Part 1: Single Character Entries) section of the dictionary, new entries for four hundred characters from the \"Table of General Standard Chinese Characters\" were added, including entries for (codfish) and (a literary term for monkeys). The third edition has entries for 12,000 characters and 72,000 words, with over 80,000 example usages.\n"}
