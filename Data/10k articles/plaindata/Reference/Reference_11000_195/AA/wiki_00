In fact, amazingly it is the only bird book covering this vast nation as one entity, a country with more than 250 million people and more endemic and globally threatened bird species than any other in the world. \n\nThe book was first published in 2001 by Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd. Production and editorial work was done by Berkeley Books Pte Ltd in Singapore. Publisher was Eric Oey; Julia Walkden and Rod Ritchie were the editors. Dr. Bas van Balen provided advice as scientific editor. The binding in the first edition was a normal paperback cover with a collage of six different birds. \n\nThe first edition was 190 mm high and 125 mm wide, weighing 575 grams. In this edition Morten Strange was credited with both text and photos. It covered 686 species; most were illustrated by the author; some 30 other bird photographers provided additional images. In both the first and the second edition of the book there are two bird species featured per page, each with one or more photographs as well as a distribution map. The taxonomy and nomenclature in the first edition followed \"The Birds of Indonesia: a Checklist\" by Peter Andrew from 1992; this was the most used checklist at the time, using the so-called ‘crows-last’ sequence. The book was a companion to \"A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Southeast Asia\" which was published the previous year, in 2000. However, this volume used a different checklist as a reference with a ‘buntings last’ sequence. \n\n\"A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Indonesia\" was reprinted several times during the following years, but without corrections or updates. In 2003, it was co-published in a deal with Princeton University Press for the US market and Christopher Helm (an imprint of A&C Black Publishers Ltd) for the UK market; some of these imprints might still appear as used copies on internet book sites. Periplus distributed the book in Asia and in Indonesia, where it sold well. \nBy 2012 a lot of new information and photographic material on the birds of Indonesia had emerged, and work on a second edition was started. The editorial work was again done in Singapore under supervision of Nancy Goh at Berkeley Books Pte Ltd. The second edition involved a total revamp of the material; a new checklist was used on the basis of \"The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World 6th Edition\" from 2007. This list has 1,605 bird species for Indonesia, while the 1992 list had 1,534. It also uses the ‘buntings last’ sequence which means that the Indonesian book now uses the same sequence as the companion volume \"A Photographic Guide to the Birds of Southeast Asia\". However, while \"Southeast Asia\" came out in 2012 with just a new cover and imprint, \"Indonesia\" came out that year in a second edition and was dramatically changed. \nThe new cover is flexibound vinyl extending out over the content pages. There is a single cover photo; the book is published using the Tuttle Publishing imprint. Periplus Editions (HK) Ltd is now the sole distributor of the book. In this edition, Morten Strange is credited as the author but not with text and photos, as only some 50% of the photographs are now his. In the second edition, new photographers such as James Eaton, Robert Hutchinson, Pete Morris and Bram Demeulemeester are the main contributors of new, rare and endemic species. Filip Verbelen, who also contributed to the first edition, is now next to the author as the main contributor. A total of more than 40 bird photographer participated in the project, including new Indonesian field researchers. The second edition was expanded from 416 to 544 pages and now weighs 780 grams and illustrates 912 species, out of which 213 are endemic (found only in Indonesia). As such, it is the most comprehensive photographic bird guide to any country in the world. In the second edition the opening chapters have been totally re-written and updated; the book now also includes an annotated checklist to all the species in Indonesia, the ones covered in the photographic section are highlighted in the full checklist at the back of the book. \n\nIn 2014, the book was reprinted with corrections and updates. An additional 37 photos were replaced with new and better ones; a misidentified bird (the Flores hawk-eagle) was renamed, and another species (Sumatran laughingthrush) was split out as endemic following the latest taxonomy. Threat status and icons for all globally threatened species were revised, and the annotations in the checklist were updated for each subregion using the latest information available.\n\nIn 2015, the book was reprinted again. In this reprint, two photographs were replaced and all nomenclature, taxonomy, distribution data and global threat status was updated throughout the book. The total number of species in the checklist was revised upwards to 1608 species.\n\n\n"}

It was incorporated in 1995 and launched its websites in 1996, initially including listings for only four bookstores. The company name \"Abebooks\" is derived from their original name, \"Advanced Book Exchange\".\n\nFrom the late 1990s to 2005, AbeBooks had reseller agreements with eBay, Half.com, Barnes & Noble.com, BibliOZ.com and Amazon.com, allowing AbeBooks to market and sell booksellers' books through those channels; these agreements were dissolved in 2005. AbeBooks currently only has a reseller agreement with Amazon.com.\n\nIn 2001, AbeBooks acquired Germany's JustBooks GmbH online book marketplace, which helped the company expand into the German, French and British online bookselling markets.\n\nIn 2002, the founding partners were bought out by German media company Hubert Burda Media.\n\nIn 2004, AbeBooks expanded its model to include new books, and acquired the Spanish company IberLibro, to better serve Spanish language markets.\n\nIn 2004, AbeBooks purchased IberLibro.com in October and its inventory was integrated into the AbeBooks' database in December 2006.\n\nIn 2005, AbeBooks acquired BookFinder.com in November, an American book price comparison \"metasearch\" shopping service site.\n\nIn 2006, AbeBooks acquired Fillz in February, a book-inventory and order-management company, and \"purchased\" a 40% stake in LibraryThing in May, a social networking and book cataloging website for bibliophiles.\n\nIn 2008, AbeBooks acquired Chrislands in April, a company that hosts websites for over 1000 booksellers, which was eventually sold back to one of its original founders, Jaymes Sorbel, in May 2013.\n\nAlso in 2008, AbeBooks was awarded the British Columbia Technology Industry Association Impact Award in June for Leadership in Social Responsibility for its charitable activities, literacy initiatives, and commitment to environmental friendliness in its business practices.\n\nIn December, 2008, AbeBooks was sold to Amazon.\n\nAbeBooks has been named one of BC's Top Employers every year since 2008.\n\nIn 2010, AbeBooks launched the AbeBooks Channel Program in May to provide its booksellers with the opportunity to list their books for sale on Amazon.com. The Channel Program was permanently closed on June 16, 2014.\n\nIn 2011, AbeBooks acquired - a worldwide marketplace for German rare books with professional booksellers in 27 countries offering customers millions of used, antiquarian and out-of-print books.\n\nAs of October 2016, AbeBooks is headquartered in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, with its European office in Düsseldorf, Germany. The company manages regional websites for North America, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain. Millions of items are listed for sale. Most books listed are used, many are rare, signed, 1st editions or out of print, and a growing number are new.\n\nAlso in 2016, Arkady Vitrouk was appointed CEO. He was previously the Director of Kindle Content in Amazon's European headquarters in Luxembourg. Prior to joining Amazon, he was the CEO of the Azbooka-Atticus Publishing Group in Russia.\n\nIn November 2018, without advance notice, AbeBooks announced it would no longer support sellers from a number of countries, including South Korea, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Russia, claiming that “it is no longer viable for us to operate in these countries due to increasing costs and complexities.”. Several hundred other sellers pulled their inventories from the AbeBooks site in protest.\n\nAbeBooks maintains a blog and also has a presence on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and launched a podcast in 2018.\n\nAbeBooks is also known as an online marketplace where rare and collectible items changed hands. In February 2015, AbeBooks recorded the most expensive sales ever at the time: a rare ornithology book was sold online in AbeBooks for $191,000. The website periodically reports their recent high value sales.\n\nAbeBooks' users can search across the listings of many independent bookstores, thereby allowing small, independent players to compete with bookselling superstores. Some of the member bookstores offer their books online only, while others also maintain a regular storefront.\n\nBooksellers upload their inventory data to the AbeBooks database, specifying information about each book including condition and price. Prices are fixed (with US$1 being the minimum) and there are no auctions. Items available range from the extremely common, where there might be hundreds of copies listed, to truly unique manuscript material worth thousands of dollars. In addition to books, magazines, audio books, journals, illustration art, vintage photographs and paper ephemera are offered.\n\nSellers pay a monthly subscription to list their books on the site, ranging from $25 to $500, depending on how many books they list. This subscription fee has been in place since at least April 2008. In addition, sellers pay a percentage fee for each book sold via the websites.\n\nAbeBooks initially offered its services for a flat listings fee, based on the number of titles listed for sale. The model was changed in the early 2000s to include a commission on sales. In April 2006, AbeBooks started mandatory processing of MasterCard and Visa credit card transactions on behalf of its sellers and added a 5.5% charge for the provision of this service: previously this service had been optional. In 2008, AbeBooks started charging a commission of 13.5% on the cost of postage as well as the book price. Currently (2013) the commission charge is set at 8% of postage and book price.\n\nSellers can, within limits, set their own standard postage rates to various countries or by different carriers. Booksellers can upload their inventory using their own spreadsheet software or via the site's interface. Items that sell are mailed directly from the individual bookseller's location. Some booksellers have new books directly mailed from wholesalers or publishers. While AbeBooks is arguably the largest such site, most booksellers who list on AbeBooks also list their books on multiple similar marketplaces such as Amazon.com, Biblio.com, Half.com, etc.\n\nAbeBooks's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\n\nSimilar websites include BookFinder.com and LibraryThing.\n\n"}

Many attempt to cover the major personalities of a country (with limitations, such as living persons only, in \"Who's Who\", or deceased people only, in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\"). Others are specialized, in that they cover important names in a subject field, such as architecture or engineering.\n\nThe genre of biographical dictionaries is a \"unique product of Arab Muslim culture\". The earliest extant example of the biographical dictionary dates from 9th-century Iraq, and by the 16th-century it was a firmly established and well-respected form of historical writing. They contain more social data for a large segment of the population than that found in any other pre-industrial society. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the prophets of Islam and their companions, with one of the earliest examples being \"The Book of The Major Classes\" by Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi, and then began documenting the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24444324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24444324", "title": "Carousel (advertisement)", "text": "Carousel (advertisement)\n\nCarousel is an online advertisement launched in April 2009 by Philips to promote LCD televisions. The 139-second (2m19s) piece is a continuous tracking shot of a frozen moment after an armoured van heist gone wrong, with robbers dressed in clown masks holding a pitched battle with police officers inside a hospital. The campaign surrounding \"Carousel\" was led by the central Philips team at DDB in London and produced by advertising agency Tribal DDB in Amsterdam. It was directed by Adam Berg, with production contracted to London-based production company Stinkdigital. The ad went on to become a huge critical success, winning the advertising industry's most prestigious award: the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. It is only the second online advertisement to win in the Film category, after Dove's \"Evolution\" in 2007. Scenes from \"Carousel\" were used in the music video for hip hop artist 50 Cent's single \"Ok, You're Right\".\n\nAfter a credit sequence, \"Carousel\" opens on a police officer kneeling on a parked police car. The camera pans across and travels past an armoured van in mid-explosion. It continues to the entrance of a hospital, where two officers are engaged in a firefight with a criminal in a clown mask, while a further two are dragging a clown out of a station wagon. The camera passes into the hospital to a reception desk, where a clown is kicking an officer through a glass window while others come up behind him. The camera rotates upwards to reveal another clown/officer pair in midair after falling from a balcony above. The camera travels up to the second floor, through an explosion into a corridor filled with clowns and officers, with several civilians cowering against the floor. Passing a ward where more figures are shooting at each other, the camera reaches a clown carrying a sack of cash who has just been shot in the back, before panning right to reveal a team of officers around a man stripped to his underwear. The camera exits the window and returns to ground level, to the pointing officer on the car (revealed to be ) at the start. It scrolls past the officer, who hides a clown mask and a sack of cash, revealing that he is in fact one of the criminals. The piece then begins a fresh loop from the beginning.\n\nIn January 2009, Philips announced its new line of LCD televisions, promoting them as being the first production television whose proportions matched that of a cinema screen. To inform consumers about the product's features, Philips collaborated with their central agency team at DDB in London and advertising agency Tribal DDB in Amsterdam with a request to create an advertising campaign based around an educational website The team assigned to the campaign knew that many, many variations on \"real cinema experience\" advertisements had been tried in the past, and quickly came up with the idea of a piece composed of a single tracking shot. The team proposed the idea to several production companies, eventually settling on London-based production house Stinkdigital. After consultation with Stinkdigital about the possibility of having the tracking shot move through a frozen moment in time, the team brought on director Adam Berg, who had produced a similar advertisement for JC Jeans in 2006.\n\nWorking together with Stinkdigital executive producer Mark Pytlik, Berg began brainstorming ideas for the piece in February, including car chases and bank robberies. Eventually, they settled on the concept of a robbery gone wrong, with the clown-masked robbers escaping through a crowded hospital. The brief created, the team began scouting for locations to shoot the ad. Several hospitals in Prague were looked at, but with a recent outbreak of influenza in the Czech capital, most were unavailable. To speed up the location scouting, director of photography Fredrik Backar and post supervisor Richard Lyons accompanied the recce teams. Eventually, the team discovered an old Communist university which had been converted into a sports college, and gained permission to dress the location as a hospital.\n\nAn animatic was assembled exactly matching the proportions of the chosen location, though the action itself was made up by Berg as he went along. Tribal DDB had a schedule of seven weeks from the pitching to the end of post-production, and assigned two days for shooting the film itself. A crew of more than a hundred people was assembled for \"Carousel\". The 60-strong cast of extras mostly comprised Czech dancers and stuntmen, who had the muscle control necessary to stay sufficiently still for the extended filming sessions.\n\nThe path taken through the location was 100 m long, and was broken into seven shots. These were taken on Kodak Vision3 500T 35 mm film stock in an Arriflex 435 camera. Three cranes (a Fisher, a SuperTechnoCrane 50, and a Scorpio) and a motion-controlled rig were needed to produce the range of movement the camera takes through the scenery. Two versions of each of the shots were taken, one at 50 fps (instead of the usual 25 fps) to minimise any motion from the extras, and a second \"clean\" shot with all extras and suspended vehicles removed, to aid in post-production editing.\n\nEven with 90 percent of the final footage and stunts captured in-camera, the post-production work required for \"Carousel\" was extensive. An initial telecine transfer was performed by colourist Jean-Clement Soret at The Moving Picture Company in London. The palette for each room was slightly altered to give the illusion of separate spaces, and the colour grading was deliberately made \"flat\" to make video effects work easier. The footage was then passed to Stockholm-based visual effects company Redrum, where editing and 3D effects work was overseen by Richard Lyons, who had worked with director Adam Berg on his earlier JC Jeans advertisement. The first thing done was to stitch together the seven shots using video editing software Flame and Xpress Pro. 3-D elements such as flying debris, bullets, explosions and muzzle flashes were created by Magoo Studios using 3ds max. Other video effects work included wire removal and set extension. When the work was completed, another telecine transfer was performed to push the contrast and blend the added effects with the live-action footage.\n\n\"Carousel\" had been intended from the start to be primarily web-based, as it was felt that the length and level of violence in the piece were too great for screenings on television to be an option. A microsite was developed for the piece by Stinkdigital for Tribal DDB. Because of the time it would take to buffer a Flash video of \"Carousel\"'s length, a number of tricks were used to disguise the video's loading time. Buffering begins while users select their internet connection type on a page designed to look like an MPAA certification, and continues through a cinematic title sequence. The length of the title sequence varies depending on the connection speed selected.\n\nAt certain points during \"Carousel\", viewers can elect to switch to watching one of three short films blended into the tracking shot. When one of the films is selected, the effects which were added in post-production disappear, and the rigging used in production reappears. An actor portraying a member of the cast comes on to discuss an element of the filming or a feature of the product. In the first, the director of photography discusses the lighting techniques used in \"Carousel\". In the second, the director discusses the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio and interacts with one of the extras. In the third, the VFX supervisor expands on the post-production process, and through a fake video-editing interface alters various aspects of the scene. The scripts for these short commentaries were written by Tribal DDB, with input from Stinkdigital and Redrum.\n\nThe soundtrack to \"Carousel\" was composed by Michael Fakesch. The music was altered for the Philips microsite by Stinkdigital so that, if users chose to move through the film at a different rate or in a different direction, the music would distort to match. Other features of the microsite included an Ambilight feature and the ability to switch at will between 21:9 and 16:9 aspect ratios.\n\nThe release of \"Carousel\" was a huge success. In just over two weeks, it had been viewed over half a million times, with visitors to the minisite spending an average of 5m20s watching the film. Of these, 50 percent used one or more of the interactive features of the site. A number of celebrities commented on the quality of the ad; actor Ashton Kutcher pointed followers of his Twitter account to it, and hip hop artist Kanye West referred to it as \"hands down the best video of the year\", Media publications made comparisons between \"Carousel\" and the opening scenes of the 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\", in which criminals wearing clown masks rob a bank under instructions from The Joker.\n\nIn June 2009, Philips collaborated with hip hop artist 50 Cent on the music video for his single \"Ok You're Right\". the video begins by zooming into a Philips 21:9 LCD television, and contains footage from \"Carousel\", as well as scenes of 50 Cent dressed as one of the robbers. The video was directed by Chris Romero, and featured 150 listeners of radio station Hot 97 as extras.\n\n\"Carousel\" received much critical acclaim from within the advertising industry. Editors of the trade journal \"Boards\" said of the piece: \"Technically, the stillness contrasted with the implied sound and fury is eerily fascinating, while the muffled sound design gives subtle, grim contextual cues. Masterful stuff.\" Early indications at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the industry's most prestigious awards ceremony, were that, with few stand-out televised candidates, the winner of the Film Grand Prix was likely to be an internet or viral film. As such, \"Carousel\" was pipped as a contender in both the Film and Cyber categories. Other potential winners in the Film category included \"Fate\" for Nike-brand sportswear, \"House of Cards\" for the homelessness charitable organisation Shelter, and \"Secrets and Lies\" for Levi's-brand jeans. In the Cyber category, \"Carousel\"'s prime competition was believed to be the \"Whopper Sacrifice\" campaign for Burger King. The 22 members of the awarding jury unanimously voted \"Carousel\" the winner for the Grand Prix in the Film category, and the winner of a Silver award in the Cyber category.\n\nA member of the awarding jury later said of the piece: \"Philips' \"Carousel\" is a prime example of forward thinking. Not only is it a remarkable, highly watchable film in its own right, but viewers could scroll across the piece online to discover films hidden within the film. One winds up spending ten or 11 minutes with the brand voluntarily – what is that worth to a client?\" As only the second online advertisement to receive the Film Grand Prix (after Dove's \"Evolution\" in 2007), \"Carousel\"'s win, and the potential effect on the future of the category, was widely remarked upon within the advertising industry. Rae Ann Fera of \"Boards\" commented: \"The Grand Prix winner was thrilling for [several] reasons. First, that an online-only film with well-integrated interactivity won the top Film award further signals the future direction of the industry.\" \"Campaign\" declared that \"It took the prize at Cannes not because it was made for online, but because it succeeds where many ordinary ads fail – it draws viewers in voluntarily\"\n\nThe first episode of the starts with a cold open that uses a similar time-frozen tracking shot.\nThe Other Guys features a similar scene, except it shows the antics of the protagonists at a bar.\n\nThe 2013 launch trailer for the video-game Payday 2 is almost definitely based on \"Carousel\".\n\nThe opening credits scene of the 2016 movie Deadpool is based on this ad according to the blu-ray audio commentary.\n\n"}
{"id": "1478745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1478745", "title": "Clarence Barnhart", "text": "Clarence Barnhart\n\nClarence Lewis Barnhart (1900–1993) was an American lexicographer best known for editing the \"Thorndike-Barnhart\" series of graded dictionaries, published by Scott Foresman & Co. which were based on word lists and concepts of definition developed by psychological theorist Edward Thorndike. Barnhart subsequently revised and expanded the series and with the assistance of his sons, maintaining them through the 1980s.\n\nBarnhart attended the University of Chicago and studied under noted linguist and primary founder of the Linguistic Society of America, Leonard Bloomberg. Barnhart was influenced by Bloomfield's approach to learning which included developing word lists based on frequency of use and citation files based on real-world examples. In 1929 Barnhart joined book publisher Scott, Foresman & Co. eventually becoming an editor. Scott, Foresman paid for portions of his education in exchange for a promise of employment when his studies were complete. Barnhart graduated in 1930 and further undertook graduate studies from 1934-1937. Noted child psychologist Edward Thorndike approached Scott Foresman with his ideas for a children's dictionary based on his \"Teacher’s Word Book\" (1921) and upcoming \"Teacher’s Word Book of the Twenty Thousand Words Found Most Frequently and Widely in General Reading for Children and Young People\" (1932.) The Scott Foresman editors brought Barnhart in to explain Thorndike's proposal after which the project was approved. Together Thorndike and Barnhart co-created the \"Thorndike-Century Junior Dictionary\" in 1935 followed by the \"Thorndike-Century Senior Dictionary\" in 1941. A revised edition of the Junior Dictionary came out in 1942, followed by the \"Thorndike-Century Beginning Dictionary\" in 1945.\n\nDuring World War II the United States Army approached the Linguistic Society of America seeking assistance to write a dictionary of military terms. Barnhart and Jess Stein (who would later go on to become the editor for the Random House Dictionary) were sent to New York and undertook the editing of the \"Dictionary of U.S. Army Terms\" (TM-20-205) for the War Department in 1944.\n\nFollowing \"The American College Dictionary\" published in 1947, Barnhart contracted with Scott, Foresman to produce the Thorndike-Barnhart dictionary series. Barnhart's other projects included \"The New Century Cyclopedia of Names\", \"Century Handbook of English Literature\", and three dictionaries of new words. He spent the last twenty years of his life working on \"The Barnhart Dictionary Companion\"—a quarterly devoted to new words.\n\nWhile in New York, Barnhart found out that Random House had plans to produce an “Americanized” version of the \"Oxford Concise Dictionary\". Random House had acquired the rights to the \"Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia\" in the late 1930s and the Dictionary of American English in the early 1940s. Barnhart approached Random House and convinced them to let him take complete control of the project, from concept to design to implementation. This resulted in the American College Dictionary\", published in 1947. This work was later used as the basis of the \"Random House Dictionary\".\n\nWhile at Random House he produced the \"New Century Cyclopedia of Names\" in 1954, a three volume expansion of the original 1894 volume of the Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia. From the New Century Cyclopedia of Names he further produced the \"New Century Handbook of English Literature\".\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s he developed the linguistic approach to reading instruction begun by Leonard Bloomfield, entitled \"Let's Read\" which was published in 1961.\n\nFollowing the death of Thorndike in 1949, Barnhart, aided by his sons, further updated and revised the Thorndike-Barnhart school dictionaries throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These became the most popular school dictionaries in the United States. All dictionaries for schools were published by Scott Foresman and in the trade market by Doubleday. During the 1980s the dictionaries were published under two alternative titles. The advanced dictionary was published as either \"Thorndike-Barnhart Advanced Dictionary\" or \"Thorndike-Barnhart Student's Dictionary\". The middle dictionary was published as either \"Thorndike-Barnhart Intermediate Dictionary\" or \"Thorndike-Barnhart Advanced Junior Dictionary\". The junior dictionary was published as either \"Thorndike-Barnhart Beginning Dictionary\" or \"Thorndike-Barnhart Junior Dictionary\". In 1997 Scott Foresman was acquired by Pearson Education who retired the work in favour of their Longman brand dictionaries.\n\nHis largest general dictionary was the \"World Book Dictionary\", a two-volume work created as a supplement to the \"World Book Encyclopedia\". It is essentially an expanded and more advanced version of the Thorndike-Barnhart school dictionaries. It was first published in 1963 and was updated annually until 1976, whereupon it had a major revision, totaling approximately 225,000 individual entries. Consistent with the encyclopedia's use by young people, Barnhart wrote definitions which were both simple and accurate, and most entries include sample sentences or phrases. Many definitions are the same, or almost the same, as those of the Thorndike-Barnhart school dictionaries. Like \"Webster's Third New International\", it included few proper names, leaving them to be covered by the companion volumes of the encyclopedia. Throughout the 1980s up until the 1990s the work was periodically revised and updated with the last revision done by his son Robert and his wife Cynthia Barnhart in 1996.\n\nHe also co-edited of \"The Barnhart Dictionary of New English Since 1963\" (copyright 1973), \"The Second Barnhart Dictionary of New English\" (copyright 1980), and \"The Third Barnhart Dictionary of New English\" (copyright 1990). These works were designed to cover new words, meanings, and changes in usage. In 1982, with his son David, he began editing a quarterly publication devoted to thorough dictionary treatment of new words, new meanings and changes in usage entitled \"The Barnhart Dictionary Companion\".\n\nNearly all of his dictionaries were based heavily upon the collection of evidence, the value of which he learned from work he did for Sir William Craigie on the \"Dictionary of American English\" at the University of Chicago. Over his career of 64 years he and his staff accumulated a file of over 7 million quotations exhibiting contemporary usage of English words. He was active in interlinguistics, serving as a consultant to the research body that presented Interlingua in 1951. In the late 20th century he and his son helped to pioneer the use of electronically retrievable evidence from computerized files of news publications.\n\nHis sons, David Barnhart and Robert Barnhart, worked with him on many of his later projects.\n\n"}

It effectively incorporates the English case of Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827 into New Zealand case law.\n\nRichmond arranged for DHL to courier some shipping documents relating to the sale of leather worth US$57,460 to a company called Bini in Italy, for which they were charged the modest courier fee of $22.50. Richmond declined DHL’s offer to purchase insurance for direct loss, nor purchase similar insurance from elsewhere insurance consequential loss.\n\nRichmond also accepted DHL’s standard terms of limiting its liability for direct losses to $100, and a total exclusion of liability for consequential loss.\n\nIn order to ensure that Richmond got paid for the leather, they arranged for the documents to couriered to a bank in Italy and not to Bini directly.\n\nUnfortunately, for reasons unknown, these shipping documents were couriered directly to Bini. It was never ascertained just why this happened, but the judge suggested that as the delivery address was handwritten and hard to read, it was possible that the courier opened it and got Bini's address in error.\n\nThis unfortunately allowed Bini to uplift the leather shipment from the port without first paying. Bini subsequently went into liquidation without making payment.\n\nRichmond sued DHL for the substantial consequential loss that resulted. DHL claimed they were not liable for damages due to their exclusion of liability clause.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that as Richmond had taken the business risk for such a loss by electing not to purchase insurance for consequential loss, and that the exemption clause here was perfectly valid.\n"}

It is a shared information infrastructure for locating, managing, administering and organizing everyday items and network resources, which can include volumes, folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers and other objects. A directory service is a critical component of a network operating system. A directory server or name server is a server which provides such a service. Each resource on the network is considered an object by the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as a collection of attributes associated with that resource or object. \n\nA directory service defines a namespace for the network. The namespace is used to assign a \"name\" (unique identifier) to each of the objects. Directories typically have a set of rules determining how network resources are named and identified, which usually includes a requirement that the identifiers be unique and unambiguous. When using a directory service, a user does not have to remember the physical address of a network resource; providing a name locates the resource. Some directory services include access control provisions, limiting the availability of directory information to authorized users.\n\nSeveral things distinguish a directory service from a relational database. Data can be redundant if it aids performance.\n\nDirectory schemas are object classes, attributes, name bindings and knowledge (namespaces) where an object class has:\n\nAttributes are sometimes multi-valued, allowing multiple naming attributes at one level (such as machine type and serial number concatenation, or multiple phone numbers for \"work phone\"). Attributes and object classes are standardized throughout the industry, and formally registered with the IANA for their object ID. Therefore, directory applications try to reuse standard classes and attributes to maximize the benefit of existing directory-server software.\n\nObject instances are slotted into namespaces; each object class inherits from its parent object class (and ultimately from the root of the hierarchy), adding attributes to the must-may list. Directory services are often central to the security design of an IT system and have a correspondingly-fine granularity of access control.\n\nReplication and distribution have distinct meanings in the design and management of a directory service. Replication is used to indicate that the same directory namespace (the same objects) are copied to another directory server for redundancy and throughput reasons; the replicated namespace is governed by the same authority. Distribution is used to indicate that multiple directory servers in different namespaces are interconnected to form a distributed directory service; each namespace can be governed by a different authority.\n\nDirectory services were part of an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) initiative for common network standards and multi-vendor interoperability. During the 1980s, the ITU and ISO created a set of standards for directory services, initially to support the requirements of inter-carrier electronic messaging and network-name lookup. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is based on the X.500 directory-information services, using the TCP/IP stack and an X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) string-encoding scheme on the Internet.\n\nSystems developed before the X.500 include:\n\nLDAP/X.500-based implementations include:\n\nOpen-source tools to create directory services include OpenLDAP, the Kerberos protocol and Samba software, which can function as a Windows domain controller with Kerberos and LDAP back ends. Administration is by GOsa or Samba SWAT.\n\nName services on Unix systems are typically configured through nsswitch.conf. Information from name services can be retrieved with getent.\n\n"}

In 2011, Forbes Travel Guide published its last set of guidebooks and on November 15, 2011, launched its new online home, ForbesTravelGuide.com, which covers numerous international destinations, including Hong Kong, Macau, Beijing, Singapore, Shanghai, Mexico, the Caribbean, Latin America, Japan, Thailand and London. ForbesTravelGuide.com combines Forbes Travel Guide’s Five-Star travel ratings system with insights and perspectives from Forbes Travel Guide’s own inspectors.\n\nFounded by Mobil in 1958, Forbes Travel Guide is the oldest travel guide in the United States. Ratings are given by anonymous, paid staff members in stars (with no half-stars or zero stars), based on objective criteria. A Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star rating is a considerable honor, with only 115 hotels and 55 restaurants receiving the top honor. The ratings serve as a Certification mark, in that Mobil had registered trademarks for the phrases and designs indicating each star rating level, and allowed only rated establishments to display them.\n\nInitially guides were regional and limited to the United States and Canada. The first, issued in 1958, covered five states in the Southwest and South Central United States. In 1960, this guide was revised and volumes covering the Northeastern States, the Great Lakes, and California and the West were introduced. Guides covering the Middle Atlantic States and the Northwestern states were introduced in 1962. In 1965, a guide for the Southeastern States was introduced, although only one state covered by this volume, Tennessee, had any Mobil service stations.\n\nLater, the number of volumes was expanded, as regions covered by the guide shrank. For instance, California was covered by two volumes, one for the north and one for the south. City guides also followed. In 2008, Forbes Travel Guide launched the international star ratings program for hotels and spas with the release of the inaugural Forbes Travel Guide Beijing and Forbes Travel Guide Hong Kong and Macau. Published in print by ExxonMobil Travel Publications, until 2011, the guide was published online by HowStuffWorks.com.\n\nIn October 2009, ExxonMobil licensed the brand to the Five Star Ratings Corporation, which is owned by internet entrepreneur and WebMD founder Jeff Arnold. Five Star Travel Corporation entered into a licensing agreement with Forbes Media, and renamed the Star Awards and guidebook series, Forbes Travel Guide. Forbes Travel Guide's new online home, ForbesTravelGuide.com, was launched in 2011, which marked the last year of publication of the traditional printed guidebook series.\n\nThe Mobil Travel Guide Star Ratings provided ratings and reviews of hotels, restaurants and spas on a scale of one star (average to good) to five stars (one of the best in the country) starting in 1958. Forbes Travel Guide has continued the Five-Star ratings with ratings categories of Five-Star, Four-Star and Recommended, and has a team of inspectors who anonymously evaluate properties against proprietary standards.\n"}

On 18 August 1942, along with Rolf Günther and Wilhelm Pfannenstiel, Gerstein witnessed the gassing of some 3,000 Jews in the extermination camp of Belzec in occupied Poland. The report features his eyewitness testimony. It was used as evidence in the Nuremberg Trials.\nWhen Gerstein surrendered to the French Commandant in the occupied town of Reutlingen on 22 April 1945 he was sent to the town of Rottweil where he was placed under \"honorable captivity\" and given accommodation in the Hotel Mohren. There he composed his report, first in French and then in German.\n\nGerstein was born on 11 August 1905 in Münster where he lived until 1910, moving to Saarbrücken, Halberstadt, and Neuruppin near Berlin where he received his secondary school diploma in 1925. He attended universities in Marburg, Aachen and Berlin, receiving an engineering degree in 1931. During his studies he was active in the Protestant youth movements.\n\nHe joined the Nazi Party in May 1933. As a committed Christian, Gerstein resisted attempts by the Nazi state to control the Christian youth movement, and ran afoul of state authorities. He was expelled from the party in October 1936 after his arrest in September 1936 for circulating anti-Nazi pamphlets. Released, he was arrested a second time in July 1938, spending two months in a concentration camp. Reportedly outraged by the euthanasia or Aktion T4 programme, he decided to join the Waffen SS: \"to look into the matter of these ovens and chambers in order to learn what happened there.\" Because of his technical education, Gerstein was placed in the Waffen-SS technical disinfection services where he rose quickly to become its head. It was in that capacity that he traveled to the extermination camps of Belzec and Treblinka offering the supply of hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B).\n\nGerstein stated that on 18 August 1942, he traveled to the extermination camp at Belzec where he witnessed the arrival of \"45 wagons with 6,700 people of whom 1,450 were already dead on arrival.\" He described the gassing operation as it happened directly in front of him:\n\nThe final part of the report describes Gerstein's attempts to circulate his eyewitness testimony. He reports on his chance encounter with the secretary of the Swedish legation in Berlin, Baron Göran von Otter, on the Warsaw-Berlin train \"Still under the immediate impression of the terrible events, I told him everything with the entreaty to inform his government and the Allies of all of this immediately because each day's delay must cost the lives of further thousands and tens of thousands.\" Von Otter did talk with high-ranking officials at the Swedish Foreign Ministry. However, the information was not passed on to the Allies or to any other party. He also reports on his unsuccessful attempts to see the Papal Nuncio Cesare Orsenigo in Berlin. Gerstein wished to notify the Vatican. Informed of the purpose of Gerstein's visit, Orenigo refused to meet with him. Gerstein's message was eventually sent to the Vatican, by the auxiliary bishop of Berlin, not the nuncio's office, where the information reached a \"dead end\". In addition to these attempts, Gerstein also stated he reported these eye witness accounts to \"hundreds of personages.\" Although not explicitly mentioned in the 1945 report, one of these attempts was via a Dutch industrialist, J.H. Ubbink. In February 1943, Ubbink visited Gerstein in Berlin, wherein Gerstein \n\nUbbink passed this information on to a member of the Dutch Resistance, Cornelius Van der Hooft who, a few days later on March 23, 1943 wrote \"Tötunsanstalten in Polen\" (English translation: Killing Institutions in Poland), a four-page report in Dutch which apparently remained hidden in the chicken coop of another member of the Dutch Resistance and this version only came to light in 1996. The March report however, does seem to have been sent to the Dutch government-in-exile as on April 24, 1943, one month after the meeting between Van der Hooft and Ubbink, another version of the report inspired by Gerstein was written. Typed on paper without an official heading, and with the simplified title of \"Tötungsanstalten\", this version circulated within the Dutch government-in-exile, via the British government and eventually to the attention of the United States Inter-Allied Information Committee.\n\nGerstein's report has been used as evidence in a number of high-profile cases. It was used at the Nuremberg Trials against major Nazi war criminals such as Hermann Göring and Hans Frank. It was also later used in the prosecution of Adolf Eichmann by an Israeli court. More recently in 2000 it was used by Christopher Browning in the Holocaust libel trial between David Irving and Deborah Lipstadt.\n\nN.B. \nSome aspects of Gerstein's report includes false statements attributed to Odilo Globocnik, as well as inaccurate claims regarding the total number of Jews gassed at Holocaust locations where he was not an eyewitness. Gerstein's claim that gassing of Jews occurred at Belzec was not refuted by SS-Standartenführer Wilhelm Pfannenstiel's testimony at the post-war Belzec trials, though Pfannenstiel refuted the account in the Gerstein report in later life in a letter to Paul Rassinier. .\nHolocaust historian Christopher Browning has written: \n\nMany aspects of Gerstein's testimony are unquestionably problematic. [In making] statements, such as the height of the piles of shoes and clothing at Belzec and Treblinka, Gerstein himself is clearly the source of exaggeration. Gerstein also added grossly exaggerated claims about matters to which he was not an eyewitness, such as that a total of 25 million Jews and others were gassed. But in the essential issue, namely that he was in Belzec and witnessed the gassing of a transport of Jews from Lwow, his testimony is fully corroborated ... It is also corroborated by other categories of witnesses from Belzec.\n\nHistorian Robin O'Neil noted that Gerstein's data presented at face value about the enormous capacity of the gas chambers i.e. \"four times 750 persons\" has no grounds in reality.<ref name=\"Reder/O'Neil237\"></ref>\n\n"}
{"id": "4625024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4625024", "title": "Godman (India)", "text": "Godman (India)\n\nGodman is a colloquial term used in India for a type of charismatic guru. They usually have a high-profile presence, and are capable of attracting attention and support from large sections of the society. Godmen also sometimes claim to possess paranormal powers, such as the ability to heal, the ability to see or influence future events, and the ability to read minds.\n\nThe origin of godmen and their popularity today can be traced back to the guru–shishya tradition of Hinduism. Godmen are revered as special human beings and often worshipped by their followers. Some godmen come from established schools of spirituality, but often they don't belong to any religious order. In Hinduism, there is no centrally established religious authority, so people tend to follow such charismatic personalities. These gurus tend to live in their own \"ashrams\". Many of these godmen acknowledge having had a guru themselves, as per the guru-shishya tradition. In recent years, many godmen have gained followers outside of India, which has increased their fame and wealth.\n\nSathya Sai Baba (1926–2011) was a notable godman with a very large following. He was known for alleged miracles like materialising sacred ash (\"vibhuti\"), and other objects like watches and jewels. He was also involved in charitable works, which include a hospital and a university.\n\nThere are also female gurus who are considered divine and are revered by their followers. Some of them are spouses and collaborators of notable male gurus. Female gurus who are considered to be divine or saintly by their followers include Mirra Alfassa (1878–1973), Anandamayi Ma (1896–1982), Mata Amritanandamayi (1953–), and Mother Meera (1960–).\n\nAlthough few godmen have allowed their powers to be examined scientifically, Swami Rama became famous by participating in the biofeedback research conducted by Elmer Green at the Menninger Foundation around 1970.\n\nSeveral godmen have found patronage among politicians and other high-ranking officials. Sathya Sai Baba had several devotees in the political field. They include BJP leader L. K. Advani . In 2001, an official letter was issued that defended Sai Baba against accusations, the signatories included then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Chief Justices P. N. Bhagwati and Ranganath Misra, and former Union Minister Shivraj Patil.\n\nIn 2006, Ravi Shankar was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by US Congressman Joseph Crowley. In June 2007, former President of India Pratibha Patil claimed to have had a visitation from Dada Lekhraj (1876–1969) giving her the premonition of her nomination as the President.\n\nIn September 2013, Shobhan Sarkar claimed to have dreamt of gold buried under the palace of Rao Ram Baksh Singh, a 19th-century chieftain. One of his disciples contacted Charan Das Mahant, then the Union Minister of State in the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, who in turn convinced various other officials. Later, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) conducted surveys of the site on 12 October and announced an excavation on 15 October. On 18 November 2013, after finding no signs of gold ASI stopped the excavation and began filling up the trenches.\n\nThe Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations has organised seminars showing how the so-called miracles are actually performed by sleight of hand. Members of the Indian Rationalist Association travel to villages across India and perform shows to debunk the miracles, educating villagers to prevent them from giving money to godmen. Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti and Mumbai Rationalist Association are also actively engaged in exposing false claims of spiritual gurus. \n\nThe Indian spiritual leader Ravi Shankar has objected to the use of the word godman, preferring instead guru in reference to his activities.\n\nFrançois Gautier has opposed the usage of the term godman to describe Shankar and Sathya Sai Baba. He has pointed out that Shankar's organisation, the Art of Living, has done much social work.\n\n\n"}

The short-lived revolt was planned by Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis. It began on September 23, 1868, in the town of Lares, for which it is named, and spread rapidly to various revolutionary cells throughout the island.\n\nIn the 1860s, the government of Spain was involved in several conflicts across Latin America. It became involved in a war with Peru and Chile, and had to address slave revolts in Cuba. At the time, Puerto Rico and Cuba also suffered a severe economic crisis, due to increasing tariffs and taxes imposed by the Spanish central government on most import and export goods—the Spanish crown needed these funds badly, to subsidize its troops in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn mid-19th century Puerto Rico, many supporters of independence from Spain, as well as others who did not support independence from Spain, but who simply called for liberal reforms, were jailed or exiled. However, in 1865, the central government in Madrid, finally attempted to appease the growing discontent in all its overseas provinces by setting up a \"board of review\" to receive complaints from provincial representatives. This board, the \"Junta Informativa de Reformas de Ultramar\" (Informative Board on Overseas Reforms) would be formed by representatives of each overseas province, in proportion to their collective population. The board would meet in Madrid, then report to the Minister of State (Ministro de Estado), Emilio Castelar.\n\nThe Puerto Rican delegation was freely elected by those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), in what was one of the first exercises of political openness in Spain. Separatist Segundo Ruiz Belvis was elected to the Junta representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the governor of Puerto Rico as well as most of residents of the island, since the majority of Puerto Ricans did not support independence from the rest of Spain. \n\nTo the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including their leader José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of mainland Spain-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested, including the measure on the abolition of slavery. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Emilio Castelar y Ripoll, once he became minister for foreign affairs in 1870, finally approved an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rican members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.\n\nBeyond abolition however, proposals for autonomy were voted down, as were other petitions to limit the governor general's power over virtually every aspect of life in Puerto Rico. Once the Junta members returned to Puerto Rico, they met with local community leaders in a famed meeting at the Hacienda El Cacao in Carolina, in early 1865.\nRamón Emeterio Betances, who supported independence from Spain and had been exiled by the Spanish government twice by that time, was invited by Ruiz and did attend. After listening to the Junta members' list of voted-down measures, Betances stood up and retorted: \"Nadie puede dar lo que no tiene\" (You can't give away what you don't own), a phrase he used throughout his entire life, when referring to Spain's unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms.\n\nBetances then suggested an outright, island-wide rebellion, with a proclamation of independence as soon as possible. To Acosta's horror, many of the meeting's attendees sided with Betances.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of political and economic freedom, by the continuing repression on the island — all of this caused by the extreme centralism of the Spanish central government in Madrid — an armed rebellion was staged by the pro-independence movement soon after.\n\nThe Lares uprising, commonly known as the \"Grito de Lares,\" occurred on September 23, 1868, but was planned well before that date. A group led by Dr. Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis founded the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico () on January 6, 1868 from their exile in the Dominican Republic.\n\nBetances authored several \"Proclamas,\" or statements attacking the exploitation of the Puerto Ricans by the Spanish centralist system and called for immediate insurrection. These statements soon circulated throughout the island as local dissident groups began to organize. Among them, \"Los Diez Mandamientos de los hombres libres\" (\"The Ten Commandments of Free Men\") written in exile in Saint Thomas in November 1867. It is directly based on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted by France's National Assembly in 1789, which contained the principles that inspired the French Revolution.\nThat same year, poet Lola Rodríguez de Tió, inspired by Ramón Emeterio Betances's quest for Puerto Rico's independence, wrote the patriotic lyrics to the existing tune of La Borinqueña, Puerto Rico's national anthem.\n\nEduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the revolution by Betances, provided Mariana Bracetti with the materials for the Revolutionary Flag of Lares. The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners were red and the two upper corners were blue. A white star was placed in the upper left blue corner. According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross stands for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom.\n\nSecret cells of the Revolutionary Committee were established in Puerto Rico by Mathias Brugman, Mariana Bracetti and Manuel Rojas bringing together members from all sectors of society including landowners, merchants, professionals, peasants, and slaves. Most were \"criollos\" (Caucasians born on the island).\nThe Revolutionary Committee named twelve of their members as \"generales\" (generals). They were:\n\nThe critical state of the economy, slavery, and the increasing political repression from the Spanish central government, served as catalysts for the rebellion. \nThe stronghold of the movement were towns located in the mountains, on the western part of the island.\n\nOn September 20, Francisco Ramírez Medina held a meeting at his house in which the insurrection was planned and set to begin in Camuy on September 29. The meeting was attended by Marcelino Vega, Carlos Martínez, Bonifacio Agüero, José Antonio Hernández, Ramón Estrella, Bartolomé González, Cesilio López, Antonio Santiago, Manuel Ramírez, Ulises Cancela. Cancela instructed Manuel María González to deliver all of the acts and important papers in regard to the meeting to Manuel Rojas.\n\nJuan Castañón, a captain stationed in Quebradillas, overheard two cell members commenting that on September 29 the troops at Camuy would be neutralized by poisoning the bread rations. Given the fact that September 29 would be a holiday for most laborers, simultaneous uprisings would occur, beginning with the cell in Camuy, and following with the ones in various other points; reinforcements would arrive on a ship, \"El Telégrafo\", and the cells would be reinforced by more than 3,000 mercenaries. Castañón and his men then entered González's residence and confiscated the documents of Medina's meeting and alerted his commanding officer in Arecibo. The cell leaders at the \"Lanzador del Norte\" cell in Camuy were soon arrested.\n\nOn another front, the Dominican government had supported Ramón Emeterio Betances. They allowed him to recruit a small army, and gave him a ship containing weapons. However, when the ship was about to sail, the Spanish government made its move. It prohibited the ship's departure from Dominican territory. The authorities in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, where the ship was anchored, boarded the vessel and confiscated its cargo.\n\nSeeing their plans disrupted, the other leaders feared arrest. They decided to change the date of the revolution for an earlier one without consulting Betances.\n\nThe leaders decided to start their revolution in the town of Lares on September 23. Some 400–600 rebels gathered on that day in the hacienda of Manuel Rojas, located in the vicinity of Pezuela, on the outskirts of Lares. Led by Rojas and Juan de Mata Terraforte, the poorly trained and sparsely armed rebels reached the town by horse and foot around midnight. They looted local stores and offices owned by \"peninsulares\" (Spanish mainland-born men) and took over the city hall. Spanish mainland-born merchants and Puerto Rican government authorities, considered by the rebels as enemies of the fatherland, were taken as prisoners.\n\nThe rebels then entered the town's church and placed the revolutionary flag of Lares on the High Altar. This was the sign that the revolution had begun. The Republic of Puerto Rico was proclaimed at (2:00 am local time) under the presidency of Francisco Ramírez Medina at the church and the revolutionaries offered freedom to the slaves who joined them. President Ramírez Medina appointed Government officials as follows:\n\n\nThe next day, on September 24, the rebel forces departed to take over the next town, San Sebastián del Pepino. The Puerto Rican militia surprised them with strong resistance, by moving troops from San Juan, Mayagüez, Ponce, and several other towns. This caused confusion amongst the rebels, who were greatly disadvantaged without the weapons provided by Betances.\n\nThe insurgents retreated back to Lares. Upon an order from the governor, Julián Pavía, the militia soon rounded them up, and the insurrection was over.\n\nSome 475 rebels, among them Dr. José Gualberto Padilla (leader of the Arecibo cell), Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti were imprisoned in Arecibo, where they were tortured and humiliated. On November 17, a military court imposed the death penalty, for treason and sedition, on all the prisoners.\n\nMeanwhile, in Madrid, Eugenio María de Hostos and other prominent Puerto Ricans were successful in interceding with President Francisco Serrano, who had himself just led a revolution against the monarchy in Spain. In an effort to appease the already tense atmosphere on the island, the incoming governor, José Laureano Sanz, dictated a general amnesty early in 1869 and all prisoners were released. However Betances, Rojas, Lacroix, Aurelio Méndez, and many others were sent into exile.\n\nAs a young man, Juan Ríus Rivera met and befriended Betances, and joined the pro-independence movement in the island. He became a member of the Mayagüez revolutionary cell \"Capá Prieto\" under the command of Brugman. Although he was studying law in Spain, and therefore had not participated in the Lares uprising, Ríus Rivera was an avid follower of Caribbean politics. When he learned about the failed revolt, he interrupted his law studies and traveled to the United States, where he immediately went to the Cuba Revolutionary \"Junta\" and offered his services. Juan Ríus Rivera went to Cuba and became the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the west after General Antonio Maceo's death.\n\nMariana Bracetti moved to the town of Añasco, where she died in 1903.\n\nAlthough the revolt failed to achieve its main objective, the Spanish government granted more political autonomy to the island.\n\nDuring the years immediately following the Grito, there were minor pro-independence protests and skirmishes with the Spanish authorities in Las Marías, Adjuntas, Utuado, Vieques, Bayamón, Ciales and Toa Baja (Palo Seco).\n\nJuan de Mata Terreforte, who fought alongside Manuel Rojas, was exiled to New York City. He joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee and was named its Vice-President. Terreforte and the members of the Revolutionary committee adopted the Flag of Lares as the flag of Puerto Rico until 1892, when the current design, modeled after the Cuban flag, was unveiled and adopted by the committee.\n\nCommemorating the Grito de Lares as a holiday was outlawed in Puerto Rico by both the Puerto Rican/Spanish and American administrations, during different time periods.\n\nIn the late 1920s members of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged minor celebrations in the town of Lares as both historical and fund-raising efforts. When Pedro Albizu Campos gained control over the party, \"frivolous\" activities related to the Grito (such as the yearly fundraising dance) were terminated, and a series of rituals to commemorate the event in a dignified manner were instituted. One of Albizu's better known quotes is: \"Lares es Tierra Santa, y como tal, debe entrarse a ella de rodillas\" (\"Lares is Sacred Ground, and as such, it must be entered on your knees\").\n\nKey to the rituals associated with the Grito is the gift, given by Chilean writer Gabriela Mistral to Albizu's family, of a tamarind tree obtained from Simón Bolívar's estate in Venezuela. The tree was planted at the Plaza de la Revolución with soil taken from the eighteen other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. Albizu meant to give the Plaza a living symbol of solidarity with the struggle for freedom and independence initiated by Bolivar (who, while visiting Vieques, promised to assist the Puerto Rico independence movement, but whose promise never materialized due to the simple fact that most Puerto Ricans did not want the island's independence from Spain), as well as a symbol of the bittersweet (as the trees' fruit) hardships needed to reach Puerto Rico's independence. As such, the \"Tamarindo de Don Pedro\" was meant to resemble the Gernikako Arbola in the Basque Country between Spain and France.\n\nIn 1969, under the administration of Governor Luis A. Ferré (not an independence supporter, he was a US statehood supporter), Lares was declared a Historic Site by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture, and is known as the birthplace of Puerto Rican nationalism.\n"}

His interest in cartooning, he once explained, was because:\n\nBorn in Toledo, Ohio, Kennedy grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey, working in a picture frame store while he was in high school. After studying sculpting and conceptual art at New York's School of Visual Arts, Kennedy graduated with a sociology degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. At the University he was an active member of the Pail & Shovel Party, a student group dedicated to bringing humor to student government via absurdist and playful pranks. Kennedy drew posters and flyers for the group and took part in many activities, including the famous Pink Flamingo planting.\n\nKennedy was the author of \"The Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide\" (Boatner Norton Press, 1982), the first price guide to the underground comix of the 1960s and 1970s. Much of the information in that book was based on Kennedy's personal collection of more than 9,500 comix.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1988, he served as cartoon editor of \"Esquire\" where he edited and co-wrote Lynda Barry's \"Modern Romance\". At the same time, Kennedy was a humor book agent as well as a cartoon consultant and editor for magazines and publishers, including \"People\" and Whittle Communications. In 1985, he was a guest editor for the “European Humor” issue released by the \"National Lampoon\".\n\nHe joined King Features Syndicate in 1988 as deputy comics editor and became comics editor one year later. He began as King Features' editor-in-chief in 1997. He made a point of championing strips created by female cartoonists, including Hilary B. Price's \"Rhymes with Orange\", Sandra Bell-Lundy's \"Between Friends\", and Rina Piccolo's \"Tina's Groove\"; as well as Six Chex, a rotating series of female-made strips. In 2006, Kennedy introduced King Features' DailyINK, an online service that costs $19.99 annually and makes available, on a web page and via email, more than 90 vintage and current comic strips, puzzles and editorial cartoons. The vintage strips have included \"Bringing Up Father\", \"Buz Sawyer\", \"Flash Gordon\", \"Krazy Kat\", \"The Little King\", \"The Phantom\" and \"Rip Kirby\".\n\nKennedy, who lived in New York City and Orient Point, Long Island, died March 15, 2007, while vacationing in Costa Rica. He drowned after having been caught in a riptide. His wife, Sarah Jewler, the managing editor of \"New York\" magazine, had died in 2005. King Features appointed associate editor Brendan Burford to the position of comics editor on April 23, 2007.\n\nKennedy's memorial service, held in Manhattan in mid-April 2007, was attended by notables from the world of cartooning and comics, including Bunny Hoest, John Reiner, Sam Gross, Jules Feiffer, Mort Gerberg, Isabella Bannerman, Rina Piccolo, Irwin Hasen, Jim Salicrup, Maggie Thompson Chris Browne, Arnie Roth, Dan Piraro, Jim Borgman, Mike Lynch, Mort Walker, Patrick McDonnell, and Matt Groening.\n\nIn memory of Kennedy, King Features established the Jay Kennedy Memorial Scholarship Fund, which is \"designed to acknowledge excellence among college-aged aspiring cartoonists\". Through the National Cartoonists Society Foundation, the Jay Kennedy Memorial Scholarship is awarded yearly to a deserving college student for their junior or senior year based on the judging of submitted work to the Foundation’s panel of professional cartoonists. The award is presented at the annual NCS Reuben Awards dinner.\n\nKennedy's underground comix collection was later donated to the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum.\n\n"}

Rilke, the son of an Austrian army officer, had studied at the academy's lower school at Sankt Pölten in the 1890s. Kappus corresponded with the popular poet and author from 1902 to 1908 seeking his advice as to the quality of his poetry, and in deciding between a literary career or a career as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Kappus compiled and published the letters in 1929—three years after Rilke's death from leukemia.\n\nIn the first letter, Rilke respectfully declines to review or criticize Kappus' poetry, advising the younger Kappus that \"Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody. There is only one way. Go into yourself.\" Rilke, over the course of the ten letters proceeds to advise Kappus on how a poet should feel, love, and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art. These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process. Further, these letters were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of \"Das Stunden-Buch\" (\"The Book of Hours\") and \"Das Buch der Bilder\" (\"The Book of Images\").\n\nIn 1929, Franz Xaver Kappus compiled ten letters that he received from Rainer Maria Rilke that were written from 1902 to 1908 and published them under the title \"Briefe an einen jungen Dichter\" (\"Letters to a Young Poet\") through Insel Verlag in Leipzig. Rilke and Kappus never met in person.\n\nIn an introduction to the collection, Kappus recounts how he came to write to Rainer Maria Rilke. According to Kappus, in late 1902 while a student at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria, he was reading Rilke's poetry. He was approached by the academy's chaplain, Horacek, who noted that Rilke had been a pupil years earlier at the academy's lower school at Sankt Pölten. Horacek expressed surprise that the former pupil had \"become a poet\" and described to Kappus the young Rilke as a \"thin, pale boy\" whose quiet demeanor proved unable to bear the strain of a military education and life. Rilke did not continue his military education. At the time that Kappus learned this he was inclined toward writing and was not very keen on the notion of dedicating his life to the military. Kappus then decided to write to Rilke for advice.\n\nWhen Kappus wrote his first letter to Rilke he asked for Rilke to provide a critique of his poetry. Rilke provided the young Kappus very little in criticism or in suggestions for his improvement as a poet. Instead, Rilke discouraged Kappus from reading criticism and advised him to trust his inner judgment, commenting that \"Nobody can advise you and help you. Nobody. There is only one way—Go into yourself.\" Rilke provided advice that inspired Kappus to search broader issues of intimacy and the nature of beauty and art, as well as probing philosophical and existential questions. The letters address personal issues that Kappus had apparently revealed to Rilke; ranging from atheism, loneliness, and career choices.\n\nThe collection does not include Kappus' letters to Rilke, though the original German collection does include one sonnet of Kappus' own that Rilke sent back to him in Rilke's handwriting with the instruction to \"Read the lines as if they were unknown to you, and you will feel in your inmost self how very much they are yours.\"\n\nAside from his role in writing to Rilke and later publishing these letters, Franz Xaver Kappus (1883–1966) is largely forgotten by history. Kappus was descended from a Banat Swabian (ethnic German) family born in Timișoara, in the Banat region, now divided between Hungary, Serbia and Romania. Despite the hesitancy he expressed in his letters to Rilke about pursuing a military career, he continued his military studies and served for 15 years as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. During the course of his life, he worked as a newspaper editor and journalist, writing poems, humorous sketches, short-stories, novels, and adapted several works (including his own) into screenplays for films in the 1930s. However, Kappus did not achieve lasting fame.\n\nWritten in Paris, France on 17 February 1903 - Theme of letter: Criticism fails to \"touch a work of art.\" Rilke urges his reader to eschew others' opinions of his poetry. Instead, the young poet should look inward and examine what truly motivates him to continue writing. Rilke expands on the theme of developing a rich inner life and offers an inspiring perspective on the process of creating art..\n\n"}

Each code usually identifies a National Olympic Committee (NOC), but there are several codes that have been used for other instances in past Games, such as teams composed of athletes from multiple nations, or groups of athletes not formally representing any nation.\n\nSeveral of the IOC codes are different from the standard ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes. Other sporting organisations, such as FIFA, use similar country codes to refer to their respective teams, but with some differences. Still others, such as the Commonwealth Games Federation or Association of Tennis Professionals, use the IOC list verbatim.\n\nThe 1956 Winter Olympics and 1960 Summer Olympics were the first Games to feature \"Initials of Nations\" to refer to each NOC in the published official reports. However, the codes used at the next few Games were often based on the host nation's language (e.g., GIA for Japan at the 1956 Winter Olympics and 1960 Summer Olympics, both held in Italy, from Italian \"Giappone\") or based on the French name for the nation (e.g., COR for Korea, from \"Corée\"). By the 1972 Winter Olympics, most codes were standardized on the current usage, but several have changed in recent years. Additionally, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, division and unification of Germany, breakup of Yugoslavia, dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and several other instances of geographical renaming have all resulted in code changes.\n\nIn addition to this list of over 200 NOCs, the participation of National Paralympic Committees (NPCs) at the Paralympic Games requires standardised IOC codes, such as Macau (or as \"Macau, China\" since 1999) and the Faroe Islands, coded MAC and FRO respectively.\n\nThere are 206 current NOCs (National Olympic Committees) within the Olympic Movement. The following tables show the currently used code for each NOC and any different codes used in past Games, per the official reports from those Games. Some of the past code usage is further explained in the following sections. Codes used specifically for a Summer Games only or a Winter Games only, within the same year, are indicated by \"S\" and \"W\" respectively.\n\nMost National Paralympic Committees (NPC) cover a territory with an active NOC. In these cases the NPC codes matches the IOC codes shown above. The two current NPCs without a corresponding NOC use the following NPC codes. \nFourteen historical NOCs or teams have codes that are still used in the IOC results database to refer to past medal winners from these teams.\n\nTwo other significant code changes have occurred, both because of a change in the nation's designation as used by the IOC:\n\n\n"}

In 1994, the cartoon was ranked in 23rd place of The 50 Greatest Cartoons. It is essentially a retelling of the Aesop fable, \"The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\".\n\nThe film opens with a stereotypical hillbilly version of Little Red Riding Hood (voiced by Colleen Collins), telling the audience that she's taking \"nourishment\" (as she holds up a cliché moonshine bottle) to her grandma, who lives on a country farm. At the farmhouse, a wolf (voiced by Pinto Colvig) reveals himself to the audience, but confesses that he doesn't want to eat Red. He's actually in love with her and wishes to kiss her.\n\nAfter a comical chase around the farmhouse, the wolf catches Red, and both prepare to kiss each other when a telegram arrives for the wolf from his city cousin (voiced by Daws Butler), inviting him to meet the city's equivalent of his Red (the same version seen in \"Red Hot Riding Hood\"). Upon seeing her photograph, the country wolf immediately falls in love with her and departs for the city.\n\nUnlike his cousin, the city wolf is rich \"and\" more suave and sophisticated. The city wolf takes his cousin to the club where the city's Red performs her dance routine (this scene was borrowed from \"Swing Shift Cinderella\"). The country wolf whistles and leers throughout the performance, becoming completely aroused by Red.

Upon seeing country-Red, the city wolf, surprisingly, becomes wildly attracted to her, and runs to her, but is stopped his country cousin the same way the city cousin had stopped him earlier. Seeing an opportunity to see the city's Red again, the country wolf promptly decides to take his city cousin back home, claiming that he feels the country life is too much for him, and drives off back to the city.\n\n\n\n"}

The name comes from combining the \"MX\" from \"Mail eXchange\" and the \"lo\" abbreviation for a loopback networking interface, and is an anti-spam technique that is growing in popularity with network administrators who manage a large number of unused legacy domain names.\n\nMX records provide a resource for internet hosts to discover the designated SMTP service for a given domain. By pointing MX records for unused domains to localhost/127.0.0.1, any SMTP traffic to these domains is sent back to the originating host. Under normal circumstances, this is undesirable behavior. In the case of unused domains, particularly those that have been actively used and receive large amounts of spam, this practice places the system load on the originating server. This is desirable from multiple perspectives, as it decreases load on the target systems and networks, and motivates internet service providers to minimize the sending of spam through their systems.\n\nMXlo was conceived by a lone network administrator for a large engineering corporation. As the company acquired and subsequently retired domain names, the MX records for these domains were pointed to localhost to minimize system load from unwanted traffic. As admins and other technical people described this practice to each other, it picked up the nickname \"MXlo\".\n\nFor systems and providers that transmit a large volume of spam, sufficient use of the MXlo practice can cause a self-inflicted DoS (denial of service) attack, motivating the affected provider to prevent the sending of spam through their systems.\n\nDJBDNS (tinydns)\n@\"yourdomain.tld\"::localhost:10\n\nBIND\n\"yourdomain.tld.\" IN MX 10 localhost.\n\nOthers\n\"Refer to your software documentation/manual\"\n\nA practice that has grown with the MXlo concept is \"seeding\". Once MXlo has been implemented for a given domain, and if there is no intention to use the domain anymore, some administrators seed spam lists by publishing fake e-mail addresses associated with the target domain in public forums—blogs, wiki sites, etc.—and entering them in web forms that spammers are known to harvest e-mail addresses from. This technique intentionally creates unnecessary traffic for high volume spam hosts and increases their operating costs—and, in some cases, assists the aforementioned self-inflicted DoS attacks.\n\n"}

It also published the \"Martindale Hubbell Law Digest\", a summary of laws around the world. Martindale-Hubbell is currently owned by consumer website company Internet Brands.\n\"Martindale's Directory\" was first published in 1868 by James B. Martindale, a lawyer and businessman. He wrote in the Preface:\n\nIn 1870, the first edition of \"Hubbell's Legal Directory\" appeared. As stated in the Introduction:\n\nBy 1896, \"Martindale's Directory\" included basic information that still appears in the modern \"Practice Profile\" listings, ratings and a section on foreign lawyers and firms. The Law Digests of all the States and Provinces constituted a new and valuable feature, being the substance of the law adapted to the comprehension of business men, and not mere copies of statutes, as had been the case with most similar publications. The same year, the twenty sixth volume of the \"Hubbell's Legal Directory\" appeared, containing 1,600 pages of finely printed information.\n\nIn 1916, \"Martindale's American Law Directory\" contained the following: In Part I - tabulated laws, collection rates, lawyers of the U.S., of Canada, of Newfoundland, lawyers of fourteen largest cities, Canons of Professional Ethics. In Part II - foreign attorneys, diplomatic service of the U.S., Tariff of American Consular Fees, U.S. Consular Service. Part III - Law Digests of the U.S. and Canada, Law Digest of Newfoundland, Cuba Law Digest, English Law Digest, French Law Digest, German Law Digest, Mexico Law Digest, the Netherlands Law Digest, U.S. Bankruptcy Law Digest, U.S. Patent Law Digest, U.S. Trademark Law Digest, U.S. Court Calendar and Court Calendar of States.\n\nIn 1930, the Martindale Company purchased the publishing rights to \"Hubbell's Legal Directory\", which consisted of a digest of the collected laws of each state; court calendars; and a selective list of lawyers and firms.\n\nThrough the combination of the \"Martindale's Directory\" and \"Hubbell's Legal Directory\", the first edition of the \"Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory\" was produced in 1931 as a two-volume set. Volume I consisted of, other than lawyers listings, lawyers in America (complete list of the Bar of the USA), lawyers of the Dominion of Canada and the Colony of Newfoundland (complete list of the Bar), selected list of foreign lawyers, list of patent attorneys and a biographical section. Volume II contained the \"Law Digests\", which included a topical index, Digests of the Laws of the States, Territories and Possessions of the USA, Digests of the Laws of Canada, Digests of the Laws of 40 Foreign Countries, United States Patent, Tax and Trademark Law Digests, Court Calendars and Uniform Acts, approved and recommended for adoption by the National Conference on Uniform State Laws and Proceedings. The Preface to the \"Law Digest\" commenced with the words:\n\nIn 1951, a digest was added for the new country of Israel. Meanwhile, internal conditions as well as difficulties of communication with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Rumania had made it necessary to withdraw publication of law digests for these countries. These law digests were revised and again published in the 1990s. Throughout the years \"Martindale Hubbell Law Digest\", which was revised and published annually, has been considered as an incomplete encyclopaedia of comparative law in English.\n\nIn 1963, \"Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory\" was published in four volumes. Volumes I, II and III contained in the geographical section a roster as complete as possible of the Bar of the U.S. and Canada with ratings and other information, listings of the U.S. Government lawyers located at Washington, D.C., grouped by Departments, Agencies etc. A special section contained names of lawyers registered before the United States Patent Office. A similar section for Canada was included. In another part of the Directory was presented a selected list of lawyers in other countries. Volume IV contained digests of the laws and court calendars for the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and digests of the U.S. Copyright, Patent and Trademark laws. Some of the Uniform and Model Acts were also included as well as were digests of the laws of the Dominion of Canada, of the Canadian Provinces and of 53 countries or jurisdictions, including Germany, the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, the Republic of China, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1990, \"Martindale-Hubbell\" was purchased by Reed International P.L.C. Reed Elsevier came into being in 1992, following the merger of Reed International, a British trade book and magazine publisher, and Elsevier, the Netherlands-based scientific publisher.\n\nThe 2006 printed edition of the \"Martindale-Hubbell International Law Directory\" presented in-depth profiles on more than 8,000 law firms and 100,000 lawyers from 165 countries, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. The 2006 edition of the \"Martindale Hubbell Law Digest\" appeared in a two-volume set. The first volume contained digests of the laws of each of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, digests of the U.S. Federal, Copyright, Patent and Trademark laws of the United States, the Model Rules for Professional Conduct of the American Bar Association, the Code of Judicial Conduct and the composition, jurisdiction and rules of procedure of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. The second volume contained digests of the laws of 82 major trading countries as well as brief descriptions of their government and legal systems. In case of Australia and Canada, digests of the states and provinces of these countries were included along with the digest of their federal laws, and a separate digest of the European Union law, because of its significance for a number of European countries. The digests were compiled and revised by distinguished lawyers and legal scholars of the respective states and countries. The second volume contained also the texts of ten international conventions, to which the United States of America was a party, the complete texts of many Uniform Acts including the Uniform Commercial Code and the Uniform Probate Code and four Model Acts including the Revised Model Business Corporation Act.\n\nIn 2007, \"Martindale Hubbell Law Digest\" ceased to be printed in the standard bound two volumes and became available via CD-ROM and via subscription On-line. Individual digests became available for purchase via amazon.com. In 2009, all the 150 Law Digests could be consulted free of charge on martindale.com.\n\nIn October 2013, Reed Elsevier entered into a joint venture with Internet Brands, LLC. In March 2014, the joint venture was completed resulting in the combination of Martindale-Hubbell, Lawyers.com and Internet Brand's Nolo legal division. The joint venture operates under the name of Martindale-Hubbell.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The character encoding appears to be MacRoman, and hyphenation is indicated by a bullet (character value 165 decimal, or A5 hexadecimal). Some entries, however, have a combination of actual hyphens and character 165, such as \"bar•ber-sur•geon\".\n\nThere is little to no documentation of the hyphenation choices made; the following examples might give some flavour of the style of hyphenation used: at•mos•phere; at•tend•ant; ca•pac•i•ty; un•col•or•a•ble.\n\nMoby Language II contains wordlists of five languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish:\n\nHowever, some of the lists are contaminated, for example the Japanese list contains English words such as \"abnormal\" and non-words such as \"abcdefgh\" and \"m./\". There are also unusual peculiarities in the sorting of these lists, as the French list contains a straight alphabetical listing, while the German list contains the alphabetical listing of traditionally capitalized words and then the alphabetical listing of traditionally lower-cased words. The list of Italian words, however, contains no capitalized words whatsoever.\n\nThe foreign languages list does not use accented characters, so \"e^tre\" is how a user would look up the French word \"être\" (\"To Be\").\n\nMoby Part-of-Speech contains 233,356 words fully described by part(s) of speech, listed in priority order.

Non-English words are generally rendered, as stated in the documentation, without accents or other diacritical marks. However, in 36 entries (e.g. \"São_Miguel\"), some non-ASCII accented characters remain, represented using Mac OS Roman encoding.\n\nThe part-of-speech field is used to disambiguate 770 of the words which have differing pronunciations depending on their part-of-speech. For example, for the words spelled \"close,\" the verb has the pronunciation , whereas the adjective is . The parts-of-speech have been assigned the following codes:\n\nFollowing this is the pronunciation.

NeighborCity analyzes agents’ performance based on closing rate, number of closings, number of active listings, geographic specialization, number of days on market, rate of dual agency, sales price per square foot, and the difference between ask and sale price, for the homes they sell. NeighborCity provides an evaluation of the quality of service delivered by agents, with respect to their clients’ interests and relative to competing real-estate agents.\n\nThe company also maintains a national database of real-estate listings. The site recommends corresponding independent buy-side real estate agents next to each for-sale listing along with a performance score and a link to a detailed professional profile for each recommended agent.\n\nJonathan Cardella founded NeighborCity in 2007, and he served as the company’s Chief Executive Officer. Ali Vahabzadeh was the President and Chief Operating Officer. The company is owned and operated by American Home Realty Network, Inc. (AHRN), a licensed California real estate brokerage.\n\nNeighborCity uses real-estate transaction and listing database information from national sources to construct its rankings. The company developed and uses AgentMatch, a system for matching private home buyers and sellers with agents based on the characteristics of the property for sale, including its location, price, and property type, and how they relate to the past experience and performance of the licensed real estate agents in that area. NeighborCity receives a portion of the commission earned by brokers on closed transactions that result from referrals.\n\nIn March 2012, shortly after NeighborCity provided the public performance rankings of National Association of Realtors members, Metropolitan Regional Information Systems filed a civil lawsuit against AHRN/NeighborCity claiming copyright violations by using MLS real estate listing information to craft its realtor-rating database. Northstar MLS of St. Paul, Minnesota, followed suit with similar litigation in April 2012.\n\nNeighborCity alleged that the suit was brought to prevent buyers and sellers from getting accurate information about the performance of individual brokers., and asserted that the lawsuits had no merit, stating that because the plaintiffs had failed to comply with requirements of the Copyright Act for copyright registration and that information for which the plaintiffs claimed ownership was not subject to copyright.\n\nInitial judicial opinions in both cases addressed the issue of what is subject to copyright protection. The court upheld NeighborCity’s claim in determining that the MLS listing data does not qualify for copyright protection because facts, including property features such as “main floor full bath” and “whirlpool,” are not protectable works to which the MRIS and Northstar MLS can claim ownership; however, the court found that photographs and property descriptive texts are likely to be copyrightable.\n\nIn November 2013, a Maryland Federal District court found that NeighborCity “adequately alleged” a conspiracy among multiple MLSs and the National Association of Realtors.\n\nIn May 2013, Berkshire Hathaway filed a similar lawsuit against NeighborCity.com for reuse of photos from its (subsidiaries') listings without express permission. NeighborCity filed a countersuit claiming anti-competitive practices.\n\nIn November 2013, NeighborCity sent to realtor.com, operator of Move, Inc., a cease-and-desist letter alleging that Move’s AgentMatch tool infringed on NeighborCity’s trademark of the term “Agent Match” and that the tool potentially infringes on a 2010 patent application filed by NeighborCity.\n\n"}
{"id": "6491626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6491626", "title": "Opposition to immigration", "text": "Opposition to immigration\n\nOpposition to immigration exists in most states with immigration, and has become a significant political issue in many countries. Immigration in the modern sense refers to movement of people from one state or territory to another state or territory where they are not citizens. Illegal immigration is immigration in contravention of a state's immigration laws.\n\nIn the United States, opponents of immigration typically focus on perceived adverse effects, such as economic costs (job competition and burdens on education and social services); negative environmental impact from accelerated population growth; increased crime rates, and in the long run, changes in traditional identities and values. In Spain, surveys show \"in descending order, jobs, crime and housing\" as the primary concerns for citizens opposed to immigration.\n\nOpposition to immigration ranges from calls for various immigration reforms to proposals to completely restrict immigration to one's nation; these often also include measures to combat immigration of existing citizens.\n\nSome critics of immigration argue that the presence of immigrants may distort the national identity of the native population. That means that the native population opposes immigration because they fear they may lose their sense of belonging to their own nation, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, language and politics.\n\nNational identity can be an important factor for social peace in cases where there are intra-national divides. For example, a 2015 study showed that the educational content of Suharto's Indonesia emphasizing the national unity of Indonesia was an important cause of improved inter-ethnic and inter-religious relationships.\n\nImmigrants may isolate themselves in their own communities, forming self-organized communities, ghettos or parallel societies where they live according to their own culture, rather than assimilating to the native culture with a reduced or minimal spatial, social and cultural contact with the majority society into which they have immigrated. Such ethnic enclaves can be the result of humans naturally liking to be around people like themselves. They might not learn the local language and might eventually undermine the national unity, as well as the cultural and religious unity of the native country. Research by Jennifer Neal of Michigan State University suggests that ethnic enclaves promote social cohesion at the cost of decreasing tolerance between groups and that their size, autonomy and proximity are factors. Some also suggest to devolve more power to local communities.\n\nImmigration may adversely affect social and political stability.\n\nEconomic arguments concentrate on competition for employment, and the higher burdens that some groups of immigrants may impose on social welfare systems, health systems, housing and public schools of the native state. For example, Denmark's strict immigration law reform has saved the country 6.7 billion euros compared to previous more permissive approach, according to a 2011 report from the Danish Integration Ministry.\n\nThe following are more an argument against overpopulation than against immigration, but sometimes overpopulation is caused by immigration. Some people think there is a certain size of land needed to provide for a population (\"environmental space\"), e.g., to provide for the population's consumption, including absorption of waste products. Immigrants, in this logic, such as a new born child, reduce the per capita size of land of the native country. This idea dates back to Robert Malthus who claimed this in a similar way in the early 19th century.\n\nSome are concerned about urban sprawl and congestion, alterations in the wildlife and natural environment of the state, and an expansive carbon footprint due to immigration. Furthermore, some are concerned over a state's scarce resources, dwindling water reserves, energy, pauperized soils and solid waste.\n\nImmigrants (and cross-border movements in general) can bring infectious diseases uncommon to the native population from their home countries which some perceive as a threat of significance in opposition to immigration.\n\nSome point out that this threat is often overstated by opponents.\n\nOpponents of immigration often claim that immigrants contribute to higher crime rates, but research suggests that people tend to overestimate the relationship between immigration and criminality. The academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate.\n\nSome concerns regarding immigration can be found in perceived military loyalty, especially if the country of emigration becomes involved in a war with the country of immigration. Particularly if a country finds itself in the need of drafting.\n\nMany people make dangerous migration journeys on which many have died. Harshly restricting immigration and making these restrictions known to potential emigrants may prevent them from taking such dangerous journeys.\n\nImmigrants bring their culture with them. The immigrants' thinking, their norms, practices, customs and values shape, extend and influence the native country's culture (Leitkultur). Some such extensions and influences might not be desired by parts of the native population, for reasons that may include practises considered less civilized, restrictions as well as collisions with the native country's norms, laws and values in general.\n\nOpponents of immigration often state that immigrants have a net negative effect on public coffers mainly due to the provisioning of medical care and welfare.\n\nVarious factors influence the impact of immigrants to a nation's public coffers and their use of welfare. While immigrants can improve a state's welfare system by for example counteracting trends of aging populations their net economic impact might also be negative. George Borjas, economics professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, states that \"the more unskilled the immigrant, the more likely the immigrant will be a fiscal burden\". High-skilled immigrants have better labor market prospects than those admitted based on kinship ties or for humanitarian reasons. It also depends on the tenures, wages and ages of the immigrants and the country's integration system.\n\nSome opponents of immigration argue that emigration of highly skilled or well-educated individuals may hurt their home countries – which could otherwise benefit from them and build up their economy and improve their social and political system (i.e. brain drain). However, the notion of a \"brain drain\" remains largely unsupported in the academic literature. According to economist Michael Clemens, it has not been shown that restrictions on high-skill emigration reduce shortages in the countries of origin. According to development economist Justin Sandefur, \"there is no study out there... showing any empirical evidence that migration restrictions have contributed to development.\" Hein de Haas, Professor of Sociology at the University of Amsterdam, describes the brain drain as a \"myth\". Research suggests that emigration (both low-and high-skilled) is beneficial both to the sending countries in terms of economy, education, and liberal democracy.\n\nImmigration may be the outcome of problems in the migrants' countries of origin. Open immigration policies and efforts do not address these problems. However, just keeping borders closed does not address them either.\n\nJeanne Park of the Council on Foreign Relations recommends European leaders to address the root causes of migration such as helping to broker an end to Syria's civil war, restoring stability to Libya, and upping aid to sub-Saharan Africa. According to her barring a political solution to these regional crises, Europe will continue to struggle with migrant inflows. Concerning the migratory and refugee movements in and from the Horn of Africa Günther Schröder notes that greater efforts are needed to deal with its causes. A report by the German Caritasverband states that only a long-term strategy that differentiates between combating the causes for migration in the countries of origin and the development of an EU migration policy will be able to find solutions. Responding to the root causes of illegal migration flows involves cooperation with third countries, including migrants' countries of origin and transit and might manifest itself in conflict prevention / peacekeeping and state building. It has been suggested that safe havens be created within the country of origin. It can be argued that immigration means that people \"flee\" of their country's problems instead of organizing, building up pressure, being involved in constructive foreign aid programs or otherwise addressing them.\n\nA 2017 study drawn from 18,000 interviews across eleven countries found that \"higher-skilled immigrants are preferred to their lower-skilled counterparts at all levels of native socio-economic status (SES). There is little support for the Labor Market Competition hypothesis, since respondents are not more opposed to immigrants in their own SES stratum. While skin tone itself has little effect in any country, immigrants from Muslim-majority countries do elicit significantly lower levels of support, and racial animus remains a powerful force.\" A 2018 paper found that an influx of high-skilled immigration was associated with declines in nationalist voting, but that an influx in low-skilled immigration was associated with increases in nationalist voting.\n\nOlder people tend to hold more negative views of immigration.\n\nA study of Europe found that immigrants themselves tend to hold more favorable views of immigration. The same study found no evidence that the native-born children of immigrants hold more favorable views of immigration. A 2017 study found that immigrants who stay in the country longer hold more negative views of immigration than those who have only been their for a brief period, possibly due to assimilating into native society and adopting its views.\n\nA 2014 review study in the \"Annual Review of Political Science\" found that \"there is little accumulated evidence that citizens primarily form attitudes about immigration based on its effects on their personal economic situation. This pattern has held in both North America and Western Europe, in both observational and experimental studies.\" A study of Europe found the unemployed hold less favorable views towards immigration than the employed.\n\nLevels of education are one of the best predictors of support for anti-immigration policies and parties. A 2016 study published in the \"European Economic Review\" found, on the basis of European survey data in the period 2002-2012, that \"higher levels of education lead to a more positive reported attitude toward immigrants\". The authors suggest that this is explained by weaker economic competition between immigrants and educated natives, a higher aversion to discrimination among the educated, and a greater belief in the positive effects of immigration among the educated. A 2013 study in the \"American Journal of Political Science\" lends some support to the economic competition theory, as highly educated Americans who exhibit lower levels of xenophobia tend to support reductions in the number of highly skilled immigrants. A 2007 study in \"International Organization\" found that \"people with higher levels of education and occupational skills are more likely to favor immigration regardless of the skill attributes of the immigrants in question. Across Europe, higher education and higher skills mean more support for all types of immigrants. These relationships are almost identical among individuals in the labor force, that is, those competing for jobs! and those not in the labor force.\" A 2018 study in the \"American Political Science Review\" found \"an additional year of secondary schooling substantially reduces the probability of opposing immigration, believing that immigration erodes a country’s quality of life, and feeling close to far-right anti-immigration parties.\"\n\nOne study of Japan found that exposure to information about the benefits of immigration substantially increased support for a more open immigration policy.\n\nA study by Alexander Janus investigated whether social desirability pressures may partially explain reduced opposition to immigration amongst the highly educated. Using an unobtrusive questioning technique, Janus found that anti-immigration sentiments amongst American college graduates were far higher than subjects were willing to state. This indicates that support for immigration amongst the better educated may reflect expression of socially desirable views rather than actual beliefs. Further evidence for this was found in a study by Creighton et al., where amongst the college educated, it was found the stated support for immigration was higher than the actual pro-immigrant sentiment. This was true for other education levels. The study also found that the 2008 economic crisis did not significantly increase anti-immigration attitudes but rather there was a greater expression of opposition to immigration, with underlying attitudes changing little before and after the crisis.\n\nSome research suggests that geographic proximity to immigrants drives anti-immigration views, while other research shows the reverse. Other research suggests that it is the \"perception\" of proximity, not actual proximity, that drives these views.\n\nA 2017 study finds that \"more rapid ethnic changes increase opposition to immigration and support for UKIP\" in the United Kingdom. A 2018 study found that increases in local ethnic diversity in Denmark caused \"rightward shifts in election outcomes by shifting electoral support away from traditional “big government” left‐wing parties and towards anti‐immigrant nationalist parties.\"\n\nSome research suggests that anti-immigration views are transmitted from older generations to younger generations. A 2017 study of Germany found \"high association between fathers’ and sons’ right-wing extremist attitudes\". A 2015 study found that British communities that were more acceptant of Jews in medieval times show much more tolerance towards 20th century immigrants (chiefly Caribbean and South Asian immigrants) and 21st century immigrants (chiefly Eastern European), and less support for the far right.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"American Political Science Review\" found that prejudice towards marginalized groups, such as refugees, could be explained by a failure to take the perspective of the marginalized group. The study found that young Hungarian adults who played a perspective-taking game (a game intended to reduce prejudice towards marginalized groups by having players assume the role of a member of a marginalized group) showed reduced prejudice towards Romani people and refugees, as well as reduced their vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far right party by 10%.\n\nA 2017 study found that by emphasizing shared religion can produce more supportive attitudes toward refugees.\n\nA 2014 review study in the \"Annual Review of Political Science\" found that there is substantial evidence in support of sociopsychological explanations for anti-immigration views. A 2007 study in \"International Organization\" found that \"the link between education and attitudes toward immigrants is driven by differences among individuals in cultural values and beliefs. More educated respondents are significantly less racist and place greater value on cultural diversity than do their counterparts; they are also more likely to believe that immigration generates benefits for the host economy as a whole.\"\n\nA 2017 study in the \"American Political Science Review\" argued that hostility towards immigrants is driven by disgust and can be explained as a psychological mechanism designed to protect humans from disease.\n\nResearch suggests that the perception that there is a positive causal link between immigration and crime leads to greater support for anti-immigration policies or parties. Research also suggests that bigotry and immigrant alienation could exacerbate immigrant criminality and bigotry. For instance, University of California, San Diego political scientist Claire Adida, Stanford University political scientist David Laitin and Sorbonne University economist Marie-Anne Valfort argue \"fear-based policies that target groups of people according to their religion or region of origin are counter-productive. Our own research, which explains the failed integration of Muslim immigrants in France, suggests that such policies can feed into a vicious cycle that damages national security. French Islamophobia—a response to cultural difference—has encouraged Muslim immigrants to withdraw from French society, which then feeds back into French Islamophobia, thus further exacerbating Muslims’ alienation, and so on. Indeed, the failure of French security in 2015 was likely due to police tactics that intimidated rather than welcomed the children of immigrants—an approach that makes it hard to obtain crucial information from community members about potential threats.\"\n\nA study of the long-run effects of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States found that the post-9/11 increase in hate crimes against Muslims decreased assimilation by Muslim immigrants.<ref name=\"Gould n/a-n/a\"></ref> Controlling for relevant factors, the authors found that \"Muslim immigrants living in states with the sharpest increase in hate crimes also exhibit: greater chances of marrying within their own ethnic group; higher fertility; lower female labour force participation; and lower English proficiency.\" A study of Germans found that the 9/11 terror attacks contributed to greater anti-immigrant sentiments. States that experience terrorist acts on their own soil or against their own citizens are more likely to adopt stricter restrictions on asylum recognition.\n\nThe impact of Europeans was profoundly disruptive to Aboriginal life and, though the extent of violence is debated, there was considerable conflict on the frontier. At the same time, some settlers were quite aware they were usurping the Aborigines place in Australia. In 1845, settler Charles Griffiths sought to justify this, writing; \"The question comes to this; which has the better right – the savage, born in a country, which he runs over but can scarcely be said to occupy ... or the civilized man, who comes to introduce into this ... unproductive country, the industry which supports life.\"\nMany events illustrate violence and resistance as Aborigines sought to protect their lands from invasion and as settlers and pastoralists attempted to establish their presence. In May 1804, at Risdon Cove, Van Diemen's Land, perhaps 60 Aborigines were killed when they approached the town.\n\nA sparsely-populated continental nation with a predominantly European population, Australia has long feared being overwhelmed by the heavily populated Asian countries to its north. The standard policy after 1900 was \"White Australia\" which encouraged immigration from Britain, was suspicious of immigrants from Germany and elsewhere in Europe, and which was quite hostile to immigrants from Asia or the Pacific islands. After World War II, most Australians agreed that the country must \"populate or perish\". Immigration brought people from traditional sources such as the British Isles along with, for the first time, large numbers of Southern and Central Europeans. The abolition of the so-called 'White Australia policy' during the early 1970s led to a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries.\n\nPrime Minister John Curtin supported White Australia policy, saying \"This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.\"\n\nPrime Minister Stanley Bruce was a supporter of the White Australia Policy, and made it an issue in his campaign for the 1925 Australian Federal election.It is necessary that we should determine what are the ideals towards which every Australian would desire to strive. I think those ideals might well be stated as being to secure our national safety, and to ensure the maintenance of our White Australia Policy to continue as an integral portion of the British Empire. We intend to keep this country white and not allow its people to be faced with the problems that at present are practically insoluble in many parts of the world.\n\nlabor leader (1951-1960) H. V. Evatt was a defender of the White Australia Policy. There was a strong view in Australia that any softening of the White Australia stance might result in cheaper labour being imported from overseas. Another prevailing sentiment was that multiculturalism resulted in instability. Evatt, opposing resolutions which could have led to more Asian immigration to Australia, told the Chinese delegation at San Francisco: \nYou have always insisted on the right to determine the composition of your own people. Australia wants that right now. What you are attempting to do now, Japan attempted after the last war [the First World War] and was prevented by Australia. Had we opened New Guinea and Australia to Japanese immigration then the Pacific War by now might have ended disastrously and we might have had another shambles like that experienced in Malaya.\n\nAn other (ALP) Leader of the Labor Party from 1960-1967 Arthur Calwell supported the White European Australia policy. This is reflected by Calwell's comments in his 1972 memoirs, \"Be Just and Fear Not\", in which he made it clear that he maintained his view that non-European people should not be allowed to settle in Australia. He wrote:\n\nI am proud of my white skin, just as a Chinese is proud of his yellow skin, a Japanese of his brown skin, and the Indians of their various hues from black to coffee-coloured. Anybody who is not proud of his race is not a man at all. And any man who tries to stigmatize the Australian community as racist because they want to preserve this country for the white race is doing our nation great harm... I reject, in conscience, the idea that Australia should or ever can become a multi-racial society and survive.\n\nIt was the high-profile historian Geoffrey Blainey, however, who first achieved mainstream recognition for the anti-multiculturalist cause when he wrote that multiculturalism threatened to transform Australia into a \"cluster of tribes\". In his 1984 book \"All for Australia\", Blainey criticised multiculturalism for tending to \"emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians\" and also for tending to be \"anti-British\", even though \"people from the United Kingdom and Ireland form the dominant class of pre-war immigrants and the largest single group of post-war immigrants.\"\n\nAccording to Blainey, such a policy, with its \"emphasis on what is different and on the rights of the new minority rather than the old majority,\" was unnecessarily creating division and threatened national cohesion. He argued that \"the evidence is clear that many multicultural societies have failed and that the human cost of the failure has been high\" and warned that \"we should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world.\"\n\nIn one of his numerous criticisms of multiculturalism, Blainey wrote:\n\nFor the millions of Australians who have no other nation to fall back upon, multiculturalism is almost an insult. It is divisive. It threatens social cohesion. It could, in the long-term, also endanger Australia's military security because it sets up enclaves which in a crisis could appeal to their own homelands for help.\n\nBlainey remained a persistent critic of multiculturalism into the 1990s, denouncing multiculturalism as \"morally, intellectually and economically ... a sham\".\n\nIn the 1996 election Pauline Hanson was elected to the federal seat of Oxley. In her controversial maiden speech to the House of Representatives, she expressed her belief that Australia \"was in danger of being swamped by Asians\". Hanson went on to form the One Nation Party, which initially won nearly one quarter of the vote in Queensland state elections before entering a period of decline due to internal disputes. The name \"One Nation\" was meant to signify national unity, in contrast to what Hanson claimed to see as an increasing division in Australian society caused by government policies favouring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians.\n\nSome Australians reacted angrily to One Nation, as Hanson was subjected to water balloons filled with urine at public speeches, ridiculed in the media, and received so many death threats she filmed a \"good-bye video\" in the case of her assassination. She was imprisoned by the government on political corruption charges, which were dropped after her imprisonment. In recent years the rise of other anti-immigrant parties such as the Australian Liberty Alliance and groups such as the United Patriot Front indicates that anti-immigration sentiment may be becoming mainstream.\n\nOpposition to high levels of legal immigration has been associated with certain right-wing parties in the EU. The issue flared up with the European migrant crisis in 2015 with large numbers of refugees from the Middle East and Africa making dangerous trips to Europe and many deaths en route. With high levels of unemployment and partly unassimilated non-European immigrant populations already within the EU, parties opposed to immigration have improved their position in polls and elections. Right-wing parties critical to immigration have entered the government in Austria, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Slovakia, and have become major factors in English, Swedish, German and French politics.\n\nImmigration is one of the central political issues in many European countries, and increasingly also at European Union level. The anti-immigration perspective is predominantly nationalist, cultural and economic. A new index measuring the level of perceived threat from immigrants has been recently proposed and applied to a data set covering 47 European countries and regions. The results show that Malta and Cyprus have the strongest perception of socio-economic threat from immigrants, followed by Austria, Great Britain (in particular England), Northern Ireland and Hungary, and that the countries/regions with the weakest perception of threat are Armenia, Sweden, Romania and Northern Cyprus. European nationalists see unassimilated immigrants as threatening their historic cultures and a violation of their rights of a land for their own peoples. The fears are compounded the fact that many immigrants in western Europe are poor, working class Muslims from the Middle East and Northern Africa. Prominent European opponents of immigration include Jean-Marie Le Pen, Thilo Sarrazin, Fjordman, the late Jörg Haider and the assassinated Pim Fortuyn. In France, the National Front opposes immigration. In the 1988 elections, 75% of supporters of its leader Jean-Marie Le Pen believed France has too many immigrants (as opposed to 35% of all voters.)\n\nAckording to a Yougov poll in 2018, majorities in all seven polled countries were opposed to accepting more migrants: Germany (72%), Denmark (65%), Finland (64%), Sweden (60%), United Kingdom (58%), France (58%) and Norway (52%).\n\nA January 2004 survey by Spanish newspaper \"El País\" showed that the \"majority\" of Spaniards believe immigration was too high. Small Neo-fascist parties, such as Movimiento Social Español, openly campaign using nationalist or anti-immigrant rhetoric as do other small far-right parties such as National Democracy (Spain) and España 2000. These parties have never won national or regional parliamentary seats.\n\nPortugal had little immigration until a sudden influx in the 1970s, as ex-colonists returned. Today there are Lisbon-born Africans. Rural areas have just recently begun to see many new arrivals. The country has one far-right party that supports curbs in immigration. Any resident of a Portuguese-speaking country is free to live and work in Portugal, and vice versa. In recent years, the growth of the Portuguese far-right \"National Renewal Party\", known as PNR, has targeted the immigration and ethnic minorities issues after years of growing support—0.09% 4,712 2002, 0.16% 9,374 2005, 0.20% 11,503 2009, 0.31% 17,548 2011—managed 0.50% 27,269 of the electorate in the 2015\n\nIn the UK the British National Party made opposition to immigration one of their central policies in the 2010 general election. The anti-mass-immigration party, UKIP, have proposed setting up a Migration Control Commission, tasked with bringing down net migration. The Conservative Party pledged to bring immigration from the EU and rest of the world down to the \"tens of thousands\", with a range of welfare restrictions and housing restrictions.\n\nThe vote for the UK to leave the EU was successful in Britain, with a number of commentators suggesting that populist concern over immigration from the EU was a major feature of the public debate. British Prime Minister David Cameron resigned over the vote. In 2006, Cameron dismissed UKIP supporters as \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly\" though later conceded to hold a vote on leaving the EU, due in part to the Conservative party losing votes to UKIP.\n\nThe current Prime Minister Theresa May introduced an Immigration Skills Charge in April 2017, on companies who employ skilled non-EU immigrants, of £1000 per immigrant employee; small or charitable organizations pay a reduced amount of £364. The money is to be used to help fund apprenticeships and skills training for people from the UK and EU. In her 2017 UK General Election manifesto, the Prime Minister promised to double the Immigration Skills Charge to £2000 per employee, if re-elected. EU law prevents the charge being applied in relation to immigrants from the EU (or limiting the apprenticeships to people from the UK); the prime minister has promised that after Brexit there will also be restrictions on migration from the EU.\n\nIndia has anti-immigrant parties at the state level. The most common anti-immigrant parties are there in the state of Maharashtra, where the two main anti-immigrant parties are Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Both parties share the idea of migrants from North India stealing jobs from the native Marathi people in Maharashtra. They even have a history of attacking immigrants, who they accuse of being involved in crimes around Mumbai. Shiv Sena also has a history of threatening the Pakistani cricket team from coming to Mumbai and also threatening Australian cricket players in the Indian Premier League cricket competition following the racist attacks on India students in Australia in 2009.\n\nEven in the last few decades, there has been a rise in the anti-Immigrant attitudes in the North East Indian states like Assam, which has received illegal immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh. Riots have occurred between the native tribes of Assam who are Hindus and the illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, who are predominantly Muslims.\n\nThe movement for Japanese cultural isolation, , arose in Edo period Japan, in response to the strong influence of Western culture, especially Slavery in Portugal. The study of (ancient) Japanese literature and culture was called .\n\nBrazil is a country of immigrants and developed a reputation for \"warm welcome\" of people all over the world. Nevertheless, different analysts often dispute how truthful this image is and, although openly xenophobic manifestation were uncommon, some scholars denounce it existence in more subtle ways.\n\nDespite the fact that Brazil was considered a safe haven for neighboring refugees and immigrants, xenophobic violence has erupted. Brazil received up to 3000 Syrian refugees becoming the largest receiver of such in Latin America. However xenophobic and islamophobic attacks were reported against Syrian refugees and Muslims in general. After the alleged beating of a shop owner during a robbery by alleged Venezuelan migrants, riots occurred in the Brazilian-Venezuelan border which included attacks on Venezuelans nationals, destruction of refugee tends and fires. 1200 Venezuelans went back to their homeland as a result and President Michel Temer's government increased military personal in the border. The burning of the refugee camps was reported in national and international news outlet and the authorities announce they will investigate and prosecute the authors. However anti-migration far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro won the recent Brazilian general election, 2018.\n\nIn \"L'Express\", the French news magazine, Canadian academic, and environmental activist David Suzuki called Canada's immigration policy \"disgusting\" (We \"plunder southern countries to deprive them of their future leaders, and wish to increase our population to support economic growth\") and insisted that \"Canada is full\" (\"Our useful area is reduced\"), even though Canada has one of the smallest population densities in the world. In a 2017 poll, the majority of Canadians indicated that they agree that Canada should accept fewer immigrants and refugees.\n\nAnti-immigrant feelings date back to late 19th century and early 20th century with the country's first waves of migrations from places like China, Lebanon and Poland. Non-Polish European migration dates back to practically the independence from Spain but was generally well received. Polish migration was mostly Jewish thus the backlash was due to anti-Semitism. Records of the time show Chinese migrants as the most affected by prejudice especially from government official and the first anti-Chinese laws were enacted as far back as the 1910s. In 1903 President Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra enacted one of the first decrees forbidding non-White immigration and explicitly stating that migration from Asians, Blacks, Gypsies, Arabs and Turks was not allowed. Although this laws were common in Latin America at the time, and Costa Rica's government eventually became the lead force in its abolishment.\n\nPolish, Chinese and Lebanese migrants would integrate fully into Costa Rican society with time to the point that many prominent Costa Ricans from industry, politics, arts, academy, etc. are of those descents. Latin American migrants became the next source of mistrust and opposition, especially Nicaraguan and Colombian migrants. During the second half of the 20th century and to this date Costa Rica receives numerous waves of Latin American migrants from all the region, but Nicaraguans are by far the higher group among immigrant population encompassing 74.6% of the immigrant population, followed by Colombians and Americans (immigrants in general are 9% of the population) making ethnic Nicaraguans and binational Nicaraguan-Costa Rican citizens one of the most notorious ethnic minorities in Costa Rica outnumbering other groups like African-Costa Ricans. This caused debate in the country with some voices claiming for harder regulations and border control. The issue was one of the main topics of the 2002's political campaign, and was again important for the 2018's campaign with right-wing politicians like Otto Guevara quoting Donald Trump as an inspiration and calling for harsher migratory laws and eliminating the citizenship by birth in the Constitution. The Migration Law was reform globally in 2005 hardening some of the requirements for entering, staying and working on the country which was criticized as excessive, but further reforms, the last one in 2009, reduce some of the impact of the more controversial parts of the law. Far-right ultra-convervative National Restoration Party that held an important role in the most recent presidential election also holds anti-migration positions.\n\nAfter a series of fake news spread by several far-right Facebook pages inciting hatred against Nicaraguan migrants, an anti-migration manifestation was organized on 18 August 2018 known as the \"Taken of La Merced\" after Nicaraguan refugees were falsely accused of having “taking” La Merced Park in San Jose, a common gathering of the Nicaraguan community. Although some of the protesters were peaceful, participation of openly neo-Nazi groups and violent hooligans with criminal records caused riots and attacks on Nicaraguans or people suspected of being. The national police Public Force intervened with up to 44 people arrested, 36 of such were Costa Rican and the rest Nicaraguans. Several violent article including Molotov bombs were confiscated and some of the protesters identify themselves with Swastikas and yelled \"¡Fuera nicas!\" (Nicas out!). A pro-immigrant manifestation was scheduled a week later with a high attendance. Further anti-migration protests (this time with the explicit exclusion of hooligans and neo-nazi) were organized in later days but with lesser participation.\n\nIn Mexico, during the first eight months of 2005, more than 120,000 people from Central America were deported to their countries of origin. This is a much higher number than the people deported in the same period in 2002, when only 1 person was deported in the entire year. Many women from countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (most of former USSR), Asia and Central and South America are offered jobs at table dance establishments in large cities throughout the country, causing the National Institute of Migration (INM) in Mexico to raid strip clubs and deport foreigners who work without the proper documentation.\n\nMexico has very strict laws pertaining to both illegal and legal immigrants. The Mexican constitution restricts non-citizens or foreign-born persons from participating in politics, holding office, acting as a member of the clergy, or serving on the crews of Mexican-flagged ships or airplanes. Certain legal rights are waived, such as the right to a deportation hearing or other legal motions. In cases of flagrante delicto, any person may make a citizen's arrest on the offender and his accomplices, turning them over without delay to the nearest authorities.\n\nMany immigration restrictionists in the United States have accused the Mexican government of hypocrisy in its immigration policy, noting that while the Government of Mexico and Mexican Americans are demanding looser immigration laws in the United States and oppose the 2010 Arizona Immigration Bill, at the same time Mexico is imposing even tighter restrictions on immigration into Mexico from Central America and other places than the Arizona law. However Mexico started enforcing those laws which they previously ignored at the direct request of the United State's which saw a surge of Central American immigration during the Bush years; the newly elected president of Mexico has stated he's desire to be more open, and would not deport Central Americas on their way to the United States or those who wish to remain in Mexico. \n\nThe recent exodus of Venezuelan migrants in Panama encouraged the xenophobic and anti-migration public speach from Panamanian nationalist groups.\n\nIn countries where the majority of the population is of immigrant descent, such as the United States, opposition to immigration sometimes takes the form of nativism.\n\nIn the United States, opposition to immigration has a long history, starting in the late 1790s, in reaction to an influx of political refugees from France and Ireland. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 severely restricted the rights of immigrants. Nativism first gained a name and affected politics in the mid-19th century United States because of the large inflows of immigrants from cultures that were markedly different from the existing Protestant culture. Nativists objected primarily to Roman Catholics, especially Irish Americans. Nativist movements included the American Party of the mid-19th Century (formed by members of the Know-Nothing movement), the Immigration Restriction League of the early 20th Century, and the anti-Asian movements in the West, resulting in the Chinese Exclusion Act and the so-called \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" which was aimed at the Japanese. Major restrictions became law in the 1920s and sharply cut the inflow until 1965, when they ended. The federal government took charge of finding and deporting illegal aliens, which it still does.\n\nImmigration again became a major issue from the 1990s onward, with burgeoning undocumented immigration, particularly by Mexicans crossing the Southern border, and others who overstayed their visitor visas. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 provided an amnesty which was described as the amnesty to end all amnesties but it had no lasting impact on the flow of illegal immigrants.\n\nBy 2014, the Tea Party movement narrowed its focus away from economic issues, spending and Obamacare to attacking President Barack Obama's immigration policies. They see his immigration policies as threatening to transform American society. They tried but failed to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator John McCain. A typical slogan appeared in the \"Tea Party Tribune\": “Amnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All.” The \"New York Times\" reported:\n\nAs of 2014, there were over 42.4 million immigrants living in the United States. This was about 13.3% of the entire United States population at that time.\n\n\nThe American Federation of Labor (AFL), a coalition of labor unions formed in the 1880s, vigorously opposed unrestricted immigration from Europe for moral, cultural, and racial reasons. The issue unified the workers who feared that an influx of new workers would flood the labor market and lower wages. Nativism was not a factor because upwards of half the union members were themselves immigrants or the sons of immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Britain. However, nativism was a factor when the AFL even more strenuously opposed all immigration from Asia because it represented (to its Euro-American members) an alien culture that could not be assimilated into American society. The AFL intensified its opposition after 1906 and was instrumental in passing immigration restriction bills from the 1890s to the 1920s, such as the 1921 Emergency Quota Act and the Immigration Act of 1924, and seeing that they were strictly enforced.\n\nMink (1986) concludes that the link between the AFL and the Democratic Party rested in part on immigration issues, noting the large corporations, which supported the Republicans, wanted more immigration to augment their labor force.\n\nUnited Farm Workers during Cesar Chavez tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Chavez and Dolores Huerta, cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the Bracero Program that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.\n\nOn a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1969, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the Imperial and Coachella Valleys to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend Ralph Abernathy and U.S. Senator Walter Mondale. In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\nIn 1973, the United Farm Workers set up a \"wet line\" along the United States-Mexico border to prevent Mexican immigrants from entering the United States illegally and potentially undermining the UFW's unionization efforts. During one such event, in which Chavez was not involved, some UFW members, under the guidance of Chavez's cousin Manuel, physically attacked the strikebreakers after peaceful attempts to persuade them not to cross the border failed.\n\nBernie Sanders opposes guest worker programs and is also skeptical about skilled immigrant (H-1B) visas, saying, \"Last year, the top 10 employers of H-1B guest workers were all offshore outsourcing companies. These firms are responsible for shipping large numbers of American information technology jobs to India and other countries.\" In an interview with \"Vox\" he stated his opposition to an open borders immigration policy, describing it as:...a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States...you're doing away with the concept of a nation-state. What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy. Bring in all kinds of people, work for $2 or $3 an hour, that would be great for them. I don’t believe in that. I think we have to raise wages in this country, I think we have to do everything we can to create millions of jobs.\n\nSeveral periods of violent riots against migrants have occurred in South Africa in the past decade, some resulting in fatalities. Countries from which the migrants targeted originated include Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Initially, the group's name was Grivas Military Organization (Greek: Στρατιωτική Οργάνωσις Γρίβα) and in March 1943 it was renamed, adopting George's II royal monogram of two crossed gammas which resembled the Greek alphabet chi (X). \"X\" was heavily involved in battles against EAM and its secret police, OPLA, after the Axis occupation and during the civil war, considered communism to be its principal enemy.\n\nFounder and leader of \"X\" was Colonel Georgios Grivas, a Greek Cypriot by birth, who later acquired fame as leader of the underground EOKA movement in Cyprus. Grivas concentrated his efforts in the wealthy districts of Athens and expanded \"X\" to between 2,000 and 3,000 men in 1944. He recruited his men and arms from officers who were retained on the active list by the quisling government.\n\n\"X\" was pure anti-communist and its resistance action included spying for the Allies, minor anti-German actions and transport to the Middle East. But its relations to the occupying power were ambivalent. The organization was tolerated and possibly armed by the Germans, and even before the German departure fortified a base near the ancient temple of Thiseion. Towards the end of the Occupation, \"X\" received arms from British sources with which its members fought in the \"Dekemvriana\" clashes of December 1944.\n\nIn the weeks between the departure of the Germans and the events of December 1944 (the \"Dekemvriana\"), \"X\" played an active part in the campaign of provocation of Athenians orchestrated by the British, according to ELAS' members. This commenced in Athens on 12 October, the day that Athens was celebrating liberation, when a mixed gang of EDES and Chites killed the ELAS member Theodoros Tsilikas. In late October the \"X\" of Thiseio, reinforced by Security Battalionists, made an incursion into Petralona and killed 20 locals, including a number of Petralona gypsies.\n\nOn 3 December 1944 a 250,000-strong (but unarmed) demonstration was shot at by Greek police under the police chief Angelos Evert, with between 22 and 28 people killed and hundreds wounded. In the early morning hours of 4 December, ELAS reservists began operations in the Athens–Piraeus area, attacking Grivas' X forces. In the evening, a peaceful demonstration by EAM members cum funeral procession took place. This time government forces took no action but the procession was attacked by Chites led by Colonel Grivas, with over 100 dead. There followed the December insurrection, in which \"X\" supported the British and Greek government forces.\n\nIn accordance with the Treaty of Varkiza of February 1945, ELAS disarmed, leaving its supporters vulnerable to attacks from right-wing forces, during a period known as the White Terror. The White Terror was conducted by an informal alliance of army officers, National Guards, policemen, armed gangs, political organizations and people from families who had victims during the occupation and Dekemvriana seeking revenge. The majority were determined to prepare the way for a rigged plebiscite and the return of the king. Anyone deemed to be left-wing, or who had supported the communist-led resistance (EAM or ELAS) in any way was subjected to random beatings, repeated arrests, torture, murder or rape. Many people left their villages for safety either in the big towns or in the mountains. Civil war now appeared to be inevitable.\n\n\"X\" played an active role in the White Terror, and even in the weeks before Varkiza British officials were complaining of police using elements of \"X\" and EDES to make political arrests under warrants issued by a police magistrate who was a member of \"X\". One of the significant events involving \"X\" occurred in January 1946 when 1000 Chites under the bandit Manganas took over the town of Kalamata in the Peloponnese. They released 32 right-wing prisoners and terrorized the town during the night killing 6 people. In 1948 Manganas resumed a career of banditry in the Olympia region.\n\nDuring 1945 attempts were made to coordinate persecution of the Left. Much of the liaison was conducted by \"X\", which from May 1945 sent agents into the provinces to recruit members, and accepted affiliation from numerous other organizations. The local right-wing organizations rigged the electoral process and compiled lists of people to be arrested in the event of a coup.\n\nAs the general election approached early in 1946 the role of \"X\" diminished. Themistoklis Sophoulis’s government closed \"X\"’s national offices in January, and its successor did not allow them to reopen. Members of the organization formed the \"Party of X\" and took part in the elections of 1946, without electing any MP. By 1946 \"X\" was regarded as an embarrassment as it discredited the Greek government in international eyes.\n\n\"X\" was officially recognized as a \"National Organization of Internal Resistance\" by a royal decree of March 10, 1950. (The biggest resistance organisation EAM-ELAS was not recognised until 1982.)\n"}

The facility, also nicknamed \"Silver Hill\", is where the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum restores aircraft, spacecraft, and other artifacts.\n\nIt is named in honor of Paul E. Garber, a Smithsonian curator who devoted most of his career to maintaining a collection of historic aircraft. It was created in the early 1950s by Garber to store, protect the museum's growing collection of World War II aircraft and provide space to restore them. The facility consists of 32 unassuming metal buildings. 19 of those buildings are devoted to storage of airplanes, spacecraft, engines, and various parts awaiting restoration. One building is devoted to a large restoration shop, and three buildings are for exhibition creation.\n\nThe restorers sometimes call on other Smithsonian professionals such as fine art painting restoration experts to consult on aircraft restoration projects. To date, the largest restoration project undertaken by the Garber Facility was the B-29 Superfortress, \"Enola Gay\". Work began in 1984. The fuselage alone took 10 years of work. The aircraft was finally delivered to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in 11 tractor trailer loads over the space of three months in 2003.\n\nPreviously it acted as a storage facility for items which could not be put on public display, but with the completion of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, and restoration at its own, on-site Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar facility, all items in storage are being moved out of the Garber Facility. With the opening of Udvar-Hazy, the Garber facility was closed to public tours.\n\nApproximately 65 space suits from the Mercury, Apollo, and other US space programs had been stored at the facility in an environmentally-controlled room.\n\nThe roof collapsed on the facility's Warehouse #21 just before dawn on February 10, 2010 during a blizzard and the region's second 15 to 30 inch snowstorm during a five-day period. The warehouse, scheduled for eventual demolition after transfer of the artifacts to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, contained historic aircraft and spacecraft that were exposed to sub-freezing temperatures and blowing snow. They were not thought to be damaged, as all were in protective boxes or crates on shelving units that were still supporting parts of the warehouse.\n\n"}
{"id": "17405110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17405110", "title": "Photozincography of Domesday Book", "text": "Photozincography of Domesday Book\n\nIn the 1860s the first facsimile of Domesday Book was created by the process of photozincography (later termed \"zinco\"), and was executed under the directorship of Henry James at the Southampton offices of the Ordnance Survey.\n\nHaving developed the photozincographic process, in a meeting arranged between James and William Ewart Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Henry expressed his ability to produce photozincographic copies of ancient documents at \"a very trifling cost\". James outlined for his superiors the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book (an estimate of £1575 for 500 copies or £3.3s per copy) using his process. In addition to this James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimated the cost of 500 copies to be £11. 2s. 4d. In doing so he selected the first extract of Domesday Book that he would photozincograph.\n\nOn 24 January 1861, Sir Henry was granted permission to photozincograph the Cornwall fragment of Domesday as a Treasury funded experiment to determine the success of the process. Joseph Burtt, one of the Assistant Keepers of the Records was directed to assist the Record Office binder, Hood, to unbind the relevant pages from Domesday and on Monday 4 February 1861 Burtt transported Domesday to Southampton by train.\n\nOn arrival at the Ordnance Survey offices in Southampton, Burtt expressed his satisfaction with the buildings' \"fireproof principles, and…military guard\", and was given use of the best room in the building in which Domesday was placed in a fireproof safe, and the key entrusted to Burtt. Burtt’s description of the preparations extends to the actual photozincographic process, including James’s insistence that all plates should be developed and printed before the folios were returned. Nevertheless, the photozincography of Cornwall was completed in 11 days and Burtt returned to London. The process was carried out in the Ordnance Survey photography building nicknamed the glasshouse.\n\nHaving completed Cornwall, James requested permission to photozincograph the rest of Domesday. Despite his claim that the public sale of the bound and engraved copies could cover the entire cost of the photozincography of the counties, the Lords of the Treasury wished to consult the Master of the Rolls regarding the comparison of James’s photozincographic reproductions with a rival process employed by Rev. Lambert Larking of Kent. Larking (a local antiquarian) had employed an artist to assist the reproduction of the county of Kent using the lithographic process - a much more expensive means of reproduction than photozincography. However, in order to secure this permission over Larking's process James had to provide the Treasury with evidence of public interest and a guarantee of low-cost production. Thomas Letts of Letts Son & Co. Limited, London distributed a circular nationally bearing a foreword from James encouraging subscription, and by late October more than fifty subscribers to each county had been amassed. On 28 November 1861 Burtt returned to Southampton once more with Domesday for the aforementioned counties’ photozincographing, and by December James had secured permission from the Treasury to copy the remainder of Great Domesday – but he was explicitly forbidden from reproducing Kent, in defence of Larking’s lithograph. By 1864 the facsimile of the entirety of Great Domesday had been completed, and had been published in 32 county volumes including Kent following Larking's death, who granted James permission to complete the reproduction of the county due to his infirmity in the final stages of his life. \n\nThe volumes were published in two colours (red and black), replicating the colours used in the original manuscript.\n\n\"The books which were printed by James's method are still sought after even if they are not up to the standard of later facsimiles. His edition of \"Domesday Book\" is still the only facsimile of it available and can be found reasonably cheaply, whereas the letterpress is extremely rare and very expensive.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "638632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=638632", "title": "Political Soldier", "text": "Political Soldier\n\nPolitical Soldier is a political concept associated with the Third Position. It played a leading role in Britain's National Front from the late 1970s onwards under young radicals Nick Griffin, Patrick Harrington and Derek Holland of the Official National Front. The term was used to indicate an almost fanatical devotion to the cause of nationalism, which its supporters felt was needed to bring about a revolutionary change in society.\n\nA faction within the National Front called for the building of a fresh ethos within society and for the emergence of a new man, to be known as the Political Soldier, who would reject materialism and devote himself to the nationalist struggle with religious zeal. Basing their ideas on those of Julius Evola, an Italian philosopher who sought the creation of a new elite to combat the decadence of modern bourgeois society, Political Soldiers rejected traditional British nationalism in favour of a European outlook and a racialist equality of separate races.\n\nThe idea of the Political Soldier, someone who devotes all his time and energy to the nationalist struggle, was one that had long existed on the far right in Europe. Jean-François Thiriart was amongst those to argue for this need for complete devotion from activists and had set up camps to train Political Soldiers in the 1960s.\n\nOne issue of \"National Front News\" featured a front cover depicting the 'new alliance' of the NF with Libya’s Muammar al-Gaddafi, Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini and Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Black Nationalist Nation of Islam, effectively endorsing an ethnopluralist form of racial separatism (although critics were quick to point out the anti-Semitism linking the chosen allies). A magazine by the name of \"Rising\" was published sporadically in the early 1980s to support the ideal, attracting a Europe-wide audience in far-right circles.\n\nHolland published \"The Political Soldier - A Statement\" in 1984. The pamphlet called on supporters to become consumed by their nationalism and to make it the driving force behind everything in their lives. The book offered four historical examples of a Political Soldier, i.e., the Spartans, the Roman Centurion, the Crusaders and the Iron Guard of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a Romanian movement of fascism and religion. The book also made the Celtic Cross the emblem of the Political Soldiers.\n\nThe concept of the Political Soldier caused divisions within the British far right as many of its ideas were new and alien concepts. The Official National Front was eventually removed from the NF and the calls for a 'new man' were continued by the International Third Position. Within the UK, the magazine \"Final Conflict\" is still devoted to this idea. Holland's book has been translated into a number of European languages (notably into Polish for the National Revival of Poland) whilst the term is still used by the National Democratic Party of Germany to describe its followers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8594699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8594699", "title": "Return to Horror High", "text": "Return to Horror High\n\nReturn to Horror High is a 1987 American comedy slasher film written and directed by Bill Froehlich and starring Vince Edwards, Brendan Hughes, Scott Jacoby, Lori Lethin, Philip McKeon, and Alex Rocco. Told in a nonlinear format, the plot follows a film production crew who begin to disappear while shooting a movie based on an unsolved killing spree that occurred in a high school. The film features supporting performances from Al Fann, Panchito Gómez, Richard Brestoff, Maureen McCormick, and George Clooney. \n\nIn 1982, the town of Crippen was rocked by a series of murders at Crippen High School. The killer was never caught. Several years later, Cosmic Pictures, headed by sleazy producer Harry Sleerek, arrives in Crippen to make a biographical movie about the crimes titled \"Horror High\". To maximize the production's low budget, the cast and crew temporarily move into the real Crippen High School, where they are to film on location; the lead actress, Callie Cassidy, is hired to play multiple roles. In the midst of the film shoot, multiple disappearances and murders occur, which are subsequently investigated by police Chief Deyner and Officer Tyler. While the bodies are recovered from the school, Chief Deyner and Officer Tyler interview the film's screenwriter, Arthur Lyman, outside, and he recounts the events on-set:\n\nSome days prior, lead actor Oliver informs director Josh Forbes that he is dropping out of the production. Before leaving, he is murdered in an empty wing of the school. Harry immediately replaces Oliver with Steven Blake, a real-life police officer and former Crippen High student. Tensions on set rise when Harry insists Callie show on-screen nudity, while Arthur is forced to repeatedly make script changes to accommodate Harry's requests for more gore. One day, an extra is murdered, followed by Choo Choo, a special effects assistant. Shortly after, cast member Richard Farley is caught in a booby trap that drags his body into a steel-blade industrial fan.\n\nWhile wandering the high school in-between scenes, Steve recounts to Callie his relationship with his high school girlfriend, Kathy; her father, Crippen's Principal Kastleman, is on-set serving as a technical advisor, but Steve has not seen Kathy in years. Meanwhile, Callie begins noticing that cast and crew are disappearing. Fearing the killer has returned, she and Steve begin their own private investigation. Callie's discomfort is compounded one day while watching the filming of a brutal scene in which the school biology teacher, Richard Birnbaum, is dissected. \n\nLater, Steve notices a photo of Kathy on the set; when he inquires to Principal Kastleman about Kathy's whereabouts, he claims she is in graduate school. That night, Steve and Callie find a trail of blood in the hallway, and discover Harry and Josh's corpses, as well as a trapdoor leading to a basement. In the basement, they find a classroom full of the decomposed victims of the 1982 massacre, all posed in desks. They are confronted by Amos, the school janitor, who attacks Steve. During their fight, Steve inadvertently removes a latex mask from Amos's face, revealing him to actually be Principal Kastleman in disguise. Kastleman explains how years ago, Kathy discovered she was pregnant with Steve's child, after which Kastleman murdered her in a rage and hid her body in the school basement before killing multiple students. Callie and Steve manage to overpower Kastleman, impaling him with a javelin.\n\nIn the present, after Arthur finishes recounting the events to Chief Deney and Officer Tyler, the police enter the school to investigate. While they do so, Arthur calls out \"all clear\" outside, upon which all of the victimswho have been laid in the grass and covered in sheetsrise; they have in fact been alive all along. In reality, Callie and Steve uncovered in their research that Kastleman was in fact the true killer in the 1982 massacre, and killed him in the basement. Harry decided to capitalize on this by devising a mock massacre centered around the revelation as a publicity stunt to help promote the film. In the basement, police find Kastleman, still impaled by the javelin, but alive; he lunges at them, leading them to shoot him multiple times. When they return outside and find the bodies of the film crew inexplicably gone, they assume there is still a killer on the loose.\n\nLater, Arthur sits at a typewriter to compose a new screenplay he has called \"The Return to Horror High\", which he intends as a sequel. A framed photo of Principal Kastleman sits on his desk. An unseen figure enters the room and stops at Arthur's typewriter, dripping blood on the pages being typed. Arthur looks up at the unseen figure and says, \"Dad?\"\n\nFilming for \"Return to Horror High\" took place in Los Angeles, California at John Hughes Junior High School in Woodland Hills, and Clark Junior High School in Glendale. The production budget was $1 million. In order to avoid an X-rating, the scene-within-a-scene sequence in which the biology teacher's heart is dissected had to be pared down in post-production.\n\nThe film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures on January 9, 1987. The release expanded in April, with its widest release being 227 theaters. It grossed $1,189,709 at the U.S. box office. \n\nMichael Wilmington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the film is \"laudably offbeat\" with \"a rich premise,\" but added: \"True life or nightmare, recollection or schlock—each level of \"reality\" has the same camera angles, the same fake gore, and the same \"Saturday Night Live\"-in-the-Charnelhouse style acting. And the triple-twist climax is so wildly unlikely, and depends on such cretinous inattention from some of the cast, that you could only accept it in a drunken stupor.\" Lou Cedrone of \"The Baltimore Sun\" wrote: \"As horror films go, this one is not all that gory, but it does well enough to displease the people who don't go for this sort of thing. Are there many of us left?\"\n\nTwo years after the film's release, an article in \"Cinefantastique\" noted: \"[\"Return to Horror High\" is] a slasher pastiche that garnered significant critical acclaim even as it came close to succumbing at the boxoffice because of what Sims called New World Pictures' inept distribution and promotion.\" The \"Blockbuster Video Guide\" characterizes the film as an \"Ambitious low-budget affair, with a film crew making a movie about gory high school murders caught up in a bunch of real slayings. [It] never really takes off due to slack direction.\"\n\nIn his book \"150 Movies You Should Die Before You See\" (2010), film critic Steve Miller writes: \"The narrative threads of this low-budget spoof of slasher films are more tangled than the cocaine-fueled fever dreams of Quentin Tarantino. As the end credits start to roll, we start to wonder if this was a movie about real killings or a movie within a movie based on real-life killers. Or... well, you get the idea.\" \n\nThe film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2002.\n\nIt was released on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom by 88 Films in 2017 as part of their Slasher Classic Collection.\n\n"}

Since 2000, he has hosted \"Rick Steves' Europe\", a travel series on PBS. Steves also has a public radio travel show called \"Travel with Rick Steves\" (2005−present) and has authored numerous travel guides.\n\nSteves started his career by teaching travel classes through The Experimental College, a student-run program of non-credit classes at his alma mater, the University of Washington, and working as a tour guide in the summer. At the time, he also worked as a piano teacher (his father had owned a piano store). In 1979, based on his travel classes, he wrote the first edition of \"Europe Through the Back Door\" (ETBD), a general guide on how to travel in Europe. Steves self-published the first edition of his travel skills book ETBD in 1980. Unlike most guidebook entrepreneurs, he opened a storefront business. Initially, this was both a travel center and a piano teaching studio. He held travel classes and slide show presentations, did travel consulting, organized a few group tours per year, and updated his books. He did not provide ticket booking or other standard travel agency services. He incorporated his business as \"Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back Door.\" The store was in Steves' hometown of Edmonds, Washington, north of Seattle. The company's headquarters are still in Edmonds. Steves' first television show, \"Travels in Europe with Rick Steves,\" debuted on public television in April 1991 and ended production in 1998. His second show, \"Rick Steves' Europe,\" debuted in September 2000, and has produced episodes through 2016, though because he does not produce a season every year, this accounts for nine seasons.\n\nSteves advocates independent travel. His books and media deal with travel mainly in Europe and are directed at an American audience. As host, writer, and producer of the popular and long-running Oregon Public Broadcasting television series \"Rick Steves' Europe\", and through his travel books, he encourages Americans to become what he calls \"temporary locals.\" He encourages his readers and viewers to visit not just major cities but also cozy villages away from popular tourist routes. Steves's television series, guidebooks, radio shows, mobile applications, and his company's European escorted bus tours attract fans known as \"Rickniks\".\n\nSteves's relationship with public television began in 1991 with his first series, \"Travels in Europe with Rick Steves\". Since then he has become one of public television's top pledge drive hosts, raising millions of dollars annually for stations across the U.S. He writes and co-produces his television programs through his own production company, Back Door Productions.\nSince self-publishing his first book in 1980, Steves has written country guidebooks, city and regional guides, phrase books, and co-authored \"Europe 101: History and Art for Travelers\". His guidebook to Italy is the bestselling international guidebook in the U.S. In 1999, he started writing in a new genre of travel writing with his anecdotal \"Postcards from Europe\", recounting his favorite moments from his many years of travel. Steves's books are published by Avalon Travel Publishing, a member of the Perseus Books Group. In 2009, Steves published the book \"Travel as a Political Act,\" a guide on traveling more thoughtfully.\n\nIn addition to his guidebooks and television shows, Steves has expanded into radio, newspaper and mobile applications. In 2005, Steves launched a weekly public radio program, \"Travel with Rick Steves\". Focusing on world travel, although with a heavy emphasis on Europe and North America, each program has a guest travel expert for interviews, followed by call-ins with questions and comments. In 2006, Steves became a syndicated newspaper columnist with his Tribune Content Agency column. In 2010, he launched the mobile application \"Rick Steves' Audio Europe\", a library of audio content (including self-guided walking tours) organized into geographic-specific playlists for the iPhone and Android.\n\nPolitically, Steves has identified himself as a member of the Democratic Party, and publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSteves is a vocal proponent of legalizing cannabis and an active supporter of efforts to reform cannabis policy in the U.S. According to Steves: \"Like most of Europe, I believe marijuana is a soft drug, like alcohol and tobacco. Like alcohol and tobacco, there is no reason why it shouldn't be taxed and regulated. Crime should only enter the equation if it is abused to the point where innocent people are harmed.\"\n\nSteves serves on the Advisory Board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. He was also a major supporter of Initiative 502 to legalize, tax, and regulate cannabis in the state of Washington. Steves hosted an ACLU-sponsored educational program called \"Marijuana: It's Time for a Conversation\", which was nominated for an Emmy.\n\nSteves also supports solutions to homelessness. In 2005, he constructed a 24-unit apartment complex in Lynnwood, Washington, called Trinity Way and administrated by the local YWCA, to provide transitional housing for homeless mothers and their children. In 2017, Steves donated that $4 million apartment complex for homeless women and kids to the YWCA. Members of the Edmonds Noontime Rotary Club help maintain the buildings and grounds, providing everything from furniture to flowers. The club also raised $30,000 to build a play structure for the children there. Steves also raises funds for the hunger advocacy group Bread for the World.\n\nA supporter of the arts, Steves gave US$1 million in 2011 to the Edmonds Center for the Arts and Cascade Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAs a lifelong traveler, Steves avows that terrorism is something Americans should get used to, a natural outgrowth of the United States' position in the global community and how it is militarily advanced. In an interview with the \"Seattle Times\", Steves said:\n\nI think we're 300 million people and if we lose a few hundred people a year to terrorists, that doesn't change who we are and it shouldn't change the fabric of our society. Frankly I think we should get used to losing—as long as we're taking the stance in the world of being the military superpower, you're going to have people nipping at you. And if it's hundreds or thousands—we lose 15,000 people a year to have the right to bear arms and most people think that's a good deal, year after year. We spend 15,000 people for the right to bear arms. What do we spend to be as aggressive and heavy weight on this planet? We're always going to have terrorism.\"\n\nIn \"Travel as a Political Act\", Steves wrote that displaying the American flag on car antennas \"creates a fearful, schizophrenic dynamic that may stoke today's terrorism and tomorrow's international conflicts.\"\n\nIn 2017, Steves posted on his blog, stating that he would donate $1 for every $1 spent on his website on Inauguration Day to the ACLU. According to Steves, the website had higher traffic than usual and that customers purchased $42,962 in merchandise. As a response, Steves wrote a check for $50,000 to the ACLU and stated: \"Those of us with passports and who are wealthy enough to travel a lot — especially white, straight, Christian males like me — don’t often think a lot about civil liberties…at least, not in an immediate or personal way. Civil liberties just aren’t an issue for most of us. If a wealthy person is in trouble with the law, he can hire a good lawyer. It’s the poor who are filling our prisons. If I want to smoke pot, no one’s going to arrest me. It’s poor and black people who get arrested, and then disenfranchised. I have a voice because I fit societal norms and I have money.\"\n\nSteves is an active Lutheran and has written and hosted educational videos on subjects such as Martin Luther and the European Reformation. Steves supports liberation theology. He has been a speaker for the Lutheran Peace Fellowship.\n\nSteves is of Norwegian ancestry. His sister Jan Steves is an Iditarod racer. He was married to Anne Steves until 2010, when they divorced. They are the parents of two grown children. Their son Andy Steves followed his father's footsteps and founded his own travel company, Weekend Student Adventures Europe, and wrote \"Andy Steves' Europe: City-Hopping on a Budget\".\n\nSteves spends about a third of every year in Europe researching guidebooks and filming TV shows. His home and his Back Door Production headquarters are in Edmonds, Washington.\n\n"}

Therefore Smart could not be charged with assaulting Wilkie or any injuries arising from the fight.\n\nSmart was originally trialed at Paisley Sheriff Court in 1974 by Sheriff Mclean and a jury. Smart put forward two lines of argument. Firstly, that he should not be charged with assault because the victim had consented to fight him and thus knew of the risks and consequences. Secondly, he argued that he had acted in self-defence, a plea that was ruled out because of the lack of evidence to support this defence. The only question to decide was whether or not the consent ruled out assault. \n\nThe sheriff ruled that:\n\n\"Now something has been said about consent. I direct you in law that consent—if you in fact were to find that Wilkie had consented in some way to this assault—then that would not be a defence … if the act is criminal it cannot lose its criminal character because the victim consented, and the reason is not far to seek. \"\n\nSmart was found guilty of assault by the jury and sentenced to detention for a period of three months. Smart chose to appeal this decision claiming consent was a defence to a charge of assault on the grounds that both men had chosen to fight without weapons in similar conditions to a boxing match. Smart relied on a passage from Gordon, Criminal Law at page 773, which stated:\n\"If A and B decide to fight each other they cannot be guilty of assaulting each other, so long as neither exceeds the degree of violence consented to or permitted by law.\"\n\nThe appeal was heard on 24 January 1975 in the High court of justiciary, who on appeal held that it was not a defence to a criminal charge of assault that the injuries had been caused in the course of a consensual fight. The court held that:\n\n\"it is in the public interest that it should be decided and made known that consent to a 'square go' is not a defence to a charge of assault based on that agreed combat.\"\n\nThe situation was different from indecent acts or injuries caused in the course of organised sports, such as boxing.\n\n"}

For instance, they are tasked to carry water with a sieve. \n\nThe kind girl, however, obeys requests from grateful animals and learns from the birds' song that she must line the sieve with clay to complete her task.

{"id": "2865873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2865873", "title": "The Thin Red Line (novel)", "text": "The Thin Red Line (novel)\n\nThe Thin Red Line is American author James Jones's fourth novel. It draws heavily on Jones's experiences at the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse during World War II's Guadalcanal campaign. The author served in the United States Army's 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division.\n\n\"The Thin Red Line\", originally published in September 1962, shares its central characters with Jones's other two World War II novels, though with their names necessarily altered, and examines their different reactions to combat. Jones had originally intended the central male characters of his previous war novel \"From Here to Eternity\" to appear in this work. But Jones remarked that \"the dramatic structure—I might even say the spiritual content—of the first book demanded that Prewitt be killed at the end of it\". Jones tackled the problem by changing the names of the three characters of the first novel, enabling them to appear in \"The Thin Red Line\". The character of Prewitt became Witt, Warden became Welsh and Stark became Storm. (Jones' later novel \"Whistle\" (1978), features a similar set of characters, now named Sergeant Mart Winch, Bobby Prell, and Johnny \"Mother\" Strange; Corporal Fife in \"The Thin Red Line\" also reappears as company clerk Marion Landers in \"Whistle\".)\n\nThe novel portrays battle realistically, including several particularly gruesome acts depicted as natural responses to the soldiers' environment, such as the disinterring of a Japanese corpse for fun, the summary execution of Japanese prisoners, and the extraction of their corpses' gold teeth. The novel explores the idea that modern war is an extremely personal and lonely experience in which each soldier suffers the emotional horrors of war by himself.\n\nJames Jones wrote his novel based on his personal experiences during the battle of the Galloping Horse, the Sea Horse, and Kokumbona which he renamed \"The Dancing Elephant\", \"The Sea Slug\", and \"Bunabala\". Of particular significance, Jones recounts his own experience killing a Japanese soldier with his bare hands.\n\nThe title comes from Rudyard Kipling's poem \"Tommy\", from the collection \"Barrack-Room Ballads\", in which Kipling describes foot soldiers as \"the thin red line of 'eroes\". Kipling's poem is based on the 1854 action of British soldiers during the Crimean War called The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava).\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" praised the novel in 1962, commenting that the novel's \"well-drawn battle narrative provides take-off points for dozens of character studies, and the author describes emotional responses to battle, fear, death, homosexuality, along with detached, ironic comments on army organization and the workings of fate, luck and circumstance\". Paul Christle, speaking at a 20th-century literature conference in 2002, said of the novel, \"\"The Thin Red Line\" is the only novel of Jones's war quartet that actually deals with combat, and it pulls no punches in its treatment. Reviewers, critics and scholars have lauded it for its realism. Some, myself included, would place the novel in the domain of literary naturalism because the destinies of Jones's soldiers are determined by chance and by social, economic, psychological, and political forces beyond their control and, sometimes, even beyond their recognition\".\n\nBritish historian and military writer John Keegan nominated \"The Thin Red Line\" as, in his opinion, one of only two novels portraying Second World War combat that could be favorably compared to the best of the literature to arise from the First World War (the other was \"Flesh Wounds\" (1966) by British writer David Holbrook). Paul Fussell said that it was \"perhaps the best\" American WWII novel, better than \"A Walk in the Sun\" and \"The Naked and the Dead\".\n\nThe novel has been adapted for cinema twice, first by Andrew Marton in 1964, then by Terrence Malick in 1998.\n"}

He also won the 1989 King of the Ring tournament, and wrestled at all of the first nine WrestleMania events, as well as helping bridge the gap between the 1980s \"Rock 'n Wrestling Connection\" era to the 1990s \"New Generation\" era.\n\nSantana was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004. During his time in the WWF, Santana, despite being born and raised in Texas, was billed from \"Tocula, Mexico\", which may be a misspelled reference to the city of Toluca. Santana still appears on the independent circuit.\n\nSolis attended West Texas State University, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Solis played tight end for the West Texas State Buffaloes. The team was quarterbacked by future professional wrestler Tully Blanchard, who would introduce Solis to the world of professional wrestling.\n\nAfter graduating, Solis was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs but cut during training camp. He played a single season for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League, appearing in 13 regular season games.\n\nSolis was trained to wrestle by Yasuhiro Kojima (Hiro Matsuda) and Bob Orton. He debuted in 1977, working for Championship Wrestling from Florida. Later that year, he joined Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), where he wrestled until 1978.\n\nSantana joined the World Wrestling Federation defeating Mike Hall in his debut match on Championship Wrestling in 1979. He teamed with Ivan Putski to defeat Johnny Valiant and Jerry Valiant for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Madison Square Garden in October 1979. The duo held the titles for close to six months before losing to the Wild Samoans in April 1980. Santana left the promotion later that year.\n\nSantana wrestled in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) from 1980 to 1982. Matches he had in the AWA include two matches he had against Nick Bockwinkel in St Paul, Minnesota, on March 1, 1981, and in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on May 13, 1982 (Bockwinkel won both matches by cheating). Santana also wrestled Blackie Guzman, and teamed with future tag team partner Rick Martel against the High Flyers on Aug 29, 1982, in St Paul Minnesota. Santana and Martel lost the match.\n\nSantana returned to the WWF in 1982. He made his televised return on the May 14, 1983 episode of \"Championship Wrestling\" by defeating José Estrada.\n\nIn 1983, he engaged in a lengthy feud with then WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, The Magnificent Muraco. Santana finally won the title on February 11, 1984, becoming the first Mexican-American wrestler to win the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. Shortly before winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, Santana fought The Iron Sheik to a double-disqualification for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at the Philadelphia Spectrum. After successfully defending the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship against Muraco, Santana would be targeted by Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, and in September 1984 in London, Ontario, Canada, Valentine defeated Santana to win the title. Soon after, the storyline had Valentine injuring Santana's knee and putting Santana out of action for several months.\n\nSantana returned in December 1984 and set his sights on getting the Intercontinental title back from Valentine. During this time, he started using The Hammer's finishing hold, the figure-four leglock and also wrestled in tag-team competition with Blackjack Mulligan. Santana wrestled at the first WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden in March 1985, and in the opening match defeated a masked wrestler known as The Executioner (\"Playboy\" Buddy Rose), making him submit to the figure four in 4:05. Santana made an appearance in the ring later in the card during the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship match between Valentine and Santana's friend the Junkyard Dog. Wearing street clothes, Santana rushed to the ring to inform referee Dick Kroll that Valentine had used his feet on the ropes to help pin the JYD. Despite having already called for the bell, Kroll restarted the match and an incensed Valentine was counted out as he didn't get back into the ring to continue.\n\nSantana and Valentine went on to wrestle a memorable series of singles and tag team matches with neither gaining the upper hand. They wrestled in a variety of different types of matches such as regular title matches, no disqualification matches, and Lumberjack matches. The pair also faced off in tag team competition with Santana teaming with the Junkyard Dog and Valentine teaming with Brutus Beefcake in a team that would become known as The Dream Team.\n\nSantana recaptured the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship from Valentine in a brutal steel cage match in Baltimore on July 6, 1985. After the match, Valentine, incensed over losing the belt, destroyed it by repeatedly bashing it against the steel cage, forcing the WWF to get a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt. In reality however, the WWF had made a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt to go along with the new image they were trying to promote and smashing the old championship belt was seen as a way of moving forward with Santana having the honor of being the first to wear the new title belt. Santana would hold on to the title until February 8, 1986 when he lost it to \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage at the Boston Garden, after Savage knocked him out with a foreign object he had hidden in his tights that went unnoticed by referee Danny Davis.\n\nOn Right After Wrestling, hosted by Arda Ocal and Jimmy Korderas, Tito stated that he was somewhat disappointed with being in the first match at the original WrestleMania in 1985. He also said that Vince McMahon later told Santana that his reason for putting him in the opening match was to kick the show off with a quality match, something he knew Tito, as a solid fan-favourite and former Intercontinental Champion, would produce.\n\nAlthough Santana lost the Intercontinental title before the WWF's storyline that Danny Davis was a corrupt official who clearly favoured the heels, the WWF used Santana losing the belt because of Davis' bias to include him in a six-man tag team match at WrestleMania III on March 29, 1987 where he teamed with The British Bulldogs (Dynamite Kid and Davey Boy Smith) against the WWF Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation (Bret \"Hitman\" Hart and Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart) and their 'new' partner, former referee \"Dangerous\" Danny Davis (who had previously wrestled for the WWF as a masked jobber named \"Mr. X\"). Davis had also been the assigned referee when the Harts 'stole' the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Bulldogs in January 1987, allowing the Harts to double team Davey Boy throughout the entire match after their manager \"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart had knocked Dynamite out with his megaphone. The story for WrestleMania III being that the Bulldogs and Santana wanted revenge on Davis as the one responsible for losing their respective titles. The Harts and Davis won the match when Davis used Jimmy Hart's megaphone to 'knock out' and pin Davey Boy Smith.\n\nSantana would make a second appearance during Wrestlemania III when he later came to the ring and attacked manager Slick after his man \"The Natural\" Butch Reed had defeated Koko B. Ware. Santana, in response to previous attacks by Slick, tore the clothing from Slick who managed to scamper back to the locker room with his 'threads' in tatters. Following this, Reed entered the ring to fight off Santana but was sent from the ring by a Double dropkick from Santana and Koko.\n\nSantana formed the popular tag team Strike Force with Canadian Rick Martel in August 1987. They defeated The Hart Foundation for the WWF Tag Team championship on a televised edition of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\" when Martel made Jim Neidhart submit to a Boston crab. Strike Force held them for five months before losing to Demolition at Wrestlemania IV. Due to a neck injury inflicted on Martel (kayfabe) shortly after the loss, the team was inactive for several months (in reality, Martel was granted leave to tend to his wife who was seriously ill). Immediately after the injury, Santana introduced a new tag team to the WWF, The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord), two big, muscled up power wrestlers whom he briefly managed. The Powers were introduced as mercenaries to help Martel and Santana gain revenge on Demolition for both the title loss and the injury to Martel. The Powers would later find more permanent management with The Baron before finally turning heel at the 1988 Survivor Series by stealing away Demolition's manager Mr. Fuji, leaving the champions as babyfaces.\n\nMartel returned at the Royal Rumble in 1989 and reunited with Santana. However, in their WrestleMania V match against The Brain Busters (Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson), Martel turned on Santana during the match after accidentally being hit by Santana's Flying forearm smash. Martel refused to tag in and walked back to the dressing room leaving Santana to face both opponents alone (the Busters then easily defeated Tito with a Spike piledriver). In an interview with \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund immediately following the match, Martel called Santana a loser and said he was sick and tired of carrying him. His feud with the newly heel Martel would last throughout 1989, with both men on opposing teams at both SummerSlam and Survivor Series and Santana defeating Martel in the finals of the 1989 King of the Ring tournament. Tito even allied with his former archenemies Demolition against Martel, defeating him and The Fabulous Rougeaus in a six-man tag match on June 22, 1989 in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nAfter Ultimate Warrior won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania VI and vacated the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, Santana took part in an eight-man tournament to name a new Intercontinental Champion. Santana made it to the finals, where he lost to Mr. Perfect. Following that loss, Santana occasionally teamed with Koko B. Ware.\n\nAt the 1990 Survivor Series, he teamed with Nikolai Volkoff and The Bushwhackers (Luke and Butch). He was the winner and sole survivor in the elimination-style match against Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express (Sato and Tanaka). As a result, Santana advanced to the final elimination match, teaming with Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior against Martel, \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, The Warlord, and Power and Glory (Hercules and Paul Roma). Santana would eliminate The Warlord with his Flying forearm before being pinned by DiBiase. Santana would then wrestle at WrestleMania VII, losing to The Mountie in a little over a minute after being hit in the stomach by The Mountie's electrified cattle prod.\n\nWhile taking a short hiatus from the World Wrestling Federation, he wrestled in International World Class Championship Wrestling (IWCCW) briefly where he held a feud with Tony Atlas. On an IWCCW card in Brooklyn, New York, Atlas defeated Dusty Wolfe. After the bout, he openly challenged any of his fellow wrestlers to try to beat him. Tito Santana immediately responded, charging out and dropkicking Atlas out of the ring. Following the event, Santana and Atlas scheduled a match for June 15 in Nassau in The Bahamas for the IWCCW title, where Santana sought to avenge his former tag team partner \"Polish Power\" Ivan Putski, whom Atlas had hung over the ropes previously. Santana had the upper hand in the bout until Atlas' manager Tony Rumble interfered by distracting and enraging Santana by repeatedly putting Atlas' foot on the rope. Santana then went after Rumble, pulled him onto the ring apron, and knocked him onto the floor. Tony Atlas took the opportunity to blindside Santana with a pair of brass knuckles from behind. The referee saw this illegal attack, and disqualified Atlas.\n\nLater in 1991, Santana adopted a Spanish bullfighter gimmick and the nickname \"El Matador\". His first WrestleMania match under this gimmick is when he faced and lost to Shawn Michaels in the opening bout of WrestleMania VIII at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. Santana claims that at the time he was being considered for a run with the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, but says that the spot was given to Bret Hart; the WWF was considering expanding into Central America and South America and felt that having Santana, its most high-profile Latino wrestler, as champion would aid its cause. The plan was eventually scrapped and the decision was made to expand into Canada and Europe, thus making the Canadian-born Hart a more viable option as champion. In any case, Santana wrestled under the \"El Matador\" gimmick through 1993, mostly as a jobber to the stars. This included a dark match loss to Papa Shango at SummerSlam which was held at the Wembley Stadium in London, England. In his final appearance on WWF TV, Santana defeated friend and frequent tag team partner Virgil on a 1993 episode of \"Wrestling Challenge\". As a sign of mutual respect between the two, both men embraced after the match.\n\nSantana then was never mentioned or seen again on WWF TV again, but he continued working on the WWF Summer tour in Europe and the international house show circuit through the course of August–September. Santana, along with only Hulk Hogan, holds the unique distinction of appearing in the first nine WrestleMania's, accumulating a 2-7 record during that time. Officially he is recognized only for the first eight WrestleManias matches. In his final in-ring WrestleMania appearance, he defeated Papa Shango at WrestleMania IX in the untelevised opening match called another dark match. Because of this he is later recognized as having a 1–7 record. On Right After Wrestling, hosted by Arda Ocal and Jimmy Korderas, Tito stated that he was somewhat disappointed with being in the first match at the original WrestleMania in 1985. He also said that WWF owner Vince McMahon later told Santana that his reason for putting him in the opening match was to kick the show off with a quality match, something he knew Tito, as a solid fan-favorite and former Intercontinental Champion, would produce. Unfortunately for Santana, despite regaining the IC title from Greg Valentine later in 1985, and two years later winning the Tag Team title with Rick Martel as part of Strike Force, he would never again win a televised match at a WrestleMania event. Santana continued to wrestle through the first half of 1993 following WrestleMania IX, facing Razor Ramon, Adam Bomb, and Papa Shango. His final match was on August 13, 1993 in Wildwood, New Jersey, when he defeated Damian Demento.\n\nSantana played a role in the formative years of ECW. Then known as Eastern Championship Wrestling, he won the ECW Heavyweight Championship on August 8, 1993 by defeating former WWF rival Don Muraco but forfeited the championship later that year to Shane Douglas.\n\nAfter leaving ECW, Santana returned to IWCCW where he wrestled some of his old WWF rivals such as Hercules Hernandez, Rick Martel, and Greg Valentine. During his second stint, he won the vacant IWCCW Heavyweight Championship (a title which had been vacated by Tony Atlas a man Santana first feuded with during his first stint in IWCCW back in 1991, Tony Atlas had left IWCCW for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) back in 1992) with a tournament victory over Greg Valentine who later claimed the title in a rematch. In IWCCW Santana resumed his feuds from the WWF with Rick Martel and Greg Valentine, and again wrestled Tony Atlas, who defeated him in a match in Yardville, New Jersey. Santana also feuded with Manny Fernandez, as Fernandez had attacked Santana after Santana had defeated L.A. Gore. Santana also agreed to an interfederation title vs title match with Valentine when Valentine was IWCCW champion and Santana was AWF champion.\n\nDuring 1994 and 1996 Santana wrestled in the short-lived American Wrestling Federation (AWF). He was both the first and last AWF Heavyweight Champion, defeating Bob Orton, Jr. in a tournament final for the inaugural belt in November 1994, and losing and regaining the title from Orton on the same night in October 1996. Santana was slightly considered the top babyface of the company, and its major champion along with Orton (who was the top heel)\n\nSantana returned to the WWF as a commentator in the Spanish Broadcast table, He called on \"Monday Night Raw\", as well as PPV events, he was last doing Spanish commentary at WrestleMania XIV. In November 1997 he made on-air appearances as El Matador in the Karate Fighters Holiday Tournament, facing Carlos Cabrera and Jerry Lawler.\n\nOn July 19, 1997, Santana lost by disqualification to \"Playboy\" Jonathon Luvstruk w/Bodacious Pretty Boy in the finals of the United States title tournament at RCW's Battleground event.\n\nOn Aug. 8, 2009, Santana defeated Jerome Hendrix at RCW's Rumblemania 6 event.\n\nOn May 6, 2012, Santana defeated Tokyo Dragon w/Rich Rogers in tournament final to become RCW champion at RCW's Rumblemania 8 event.\n\nOn May 10, 2013, Santana and Tokyo Dragon defeated Mad Russian, Jack Molson and Rich Rogers in a title vs. hair match. Santana cut Rogers's hair at RCW's Megabrawl 6 event.\n\nOn January 10, 2000, Santana made a one-time appearance in WCW. He defeated Jeff Jarrett in a Dungeon match on \"Nitro\".\n\nTito Santana continues to make appearances on the independent circuit. On March 13, 2004, he was inducted to the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004, with an induction speech by his WrestleMania VIII opponent Shawn Michaels. In September 2008, he was inducted into the Spanish Hall of Fame of Pro Wrestling (Salón del Catch).\n\nOn the November 15, 2010 \"Old School\" episode of \"Raw\", he ring-announced Alberto Del Rio. Santana later appeared in the \"Legends Roll-On\"\n\nOn April 14, 2012, he made an appearance wrestling a match for Pro Wrestling Superstars against Shawn Spears defeating him with an inside cradle.\n\nIn July 2012, Santana wrestled in Winnipeg MB for Canadian Westling Elite against Matt Fairlane but was disqualified due to outside interferance. He also embarked on a three-day tour of Saskatchewan, Canada with High Impact Wrestling Canada. He wrestled and defeated Jumpin' Joe by pinfall in Yorkton, SK on July 16, lost by disqualification to Rex Roberts at Pile O' Bones Rumble XVII on July 17, and then on July 18 defeated King Kash by pinfall.\n\nOn September 14, 2012, Santana made an unadvertised appearance for Chikara, when he entered the 2012 King of Trios tournament, teaming with Mihara and The Mysterious and Handsome Stranger, with the three losing to the Spectral Envoy (Frightmare, Hallowicked and UltraMantis Black) in their first round match.\n\nOn December 4, 2012, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum announced Santana would be inducted into their Modern Category. The PWHF Induction took place on May 18, 2013.\n\nOn April 19, 2014, Santana competed in a match with \"The German Menace\" Kraig Stagg on ECPW's iPPV \"Super Showcase Saturday\".\n\nWhile attending West Texas A&M University, Solis was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. He is now a Spanish teacher and basketball coach at Eisenhower Middle School in Roxbury Township, New Jersey, where he lives with his wife Leah and their three sons Matthew, Michael, and Mark. His wife operates Santana's Hair Salon in Succasunna, New Jersey. He also teaches wrestling classes at the New Jersey-based Independent Wrestling Federation. He still wrestles at least a dozen matches per year. He was also a physical education teacher for Smalley Elementary School in Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n\nHis autobiography, \"Tito Santana's Tales From the Ring\", was released in 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "67084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67084", "title": "Transphobia", "text": "Transphobia\n\nTransphobia is a range of negative attitudes, feelings or actions toward transgender or transsexual people, or toward transsexuality. Transphobia can be emotional disgust, fear, violence, anger, or discomfort felt or expressed towards people who do not conform to society's gender expectation. It is often expressed alongside homophobic views and hence is often considered an aspect of homophobia. Transphobia is a type of prejudice and discrimination similar to racism and sexism, and transgender people of color are often subjected to all three forms of discrimination at once.\n\nChild victims of transphobia experience harassment, school bullying, and violence in school, foster care, and social programs. Adult victims experience public ridicule, harassment including misgendering, taunts, threats of violence, robbery, and false arrest; many feel unsafe in public. A high percentage report being victims of sexual violence. Some are refused healthcare or suffer workplace discrimination, including being fired for being transgender, or feel under siege by conservative political or religious groups who oppose laws to protect them. There is even discrimination from some people within the movement for the rights of gender and sexual minorities.\n\nBesides the increased risk of violence and other threats, the stress created by transphobia can cause negative emotional consequences which may lead to substance abuse, running away from home (in minors), and a higher rate of suicide.\n\nIn the Western world, there have been gradual changes towards the establishment of policies of non-discrimination and equal opportunity. The trend is also taking shape in developing nations. In addition, campaigns regarding the LGBT community are being spread around the world to improve acceptance; the \"Stop the Stigma\" campaign by the UN is one such development.\n\nThe word \"transphobia\" is a classical compound patterned on the term \"homophobia\", sharing its second component \"-phobia\" from the , \"phóbos\", \"fear\". The first component is the neo-classical prefix \"trans-\" from \"transgender\" (originally meaning \"across, on the far side, beyond\"). Along with \"lesbophobia\", \"biphobia\", \"homophobia\" and \"transphobia\" are members of the family of terms used when intolerance and discrimination is directed toward LGBT people.\n\n\"Transphobia\" need not be a phobia as defined in clinical psychology (i.e., an anxiety disorder). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of \"xenophobia\".\n\nThe adjectival form \"transphobic\" describes things or qualities related to transphobia, and the noun \"transphobe\" denotes someone who harbors transphobia.\n\nThe words \"transphobia\" and \"transphobic\" were added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013, together with \"transperson\", \"transman\", \"transwoman\".\n\nTransfeminist theorist and author Julia Serano argues in her book \"Whipping Girl\" that transphobia is rooted in sexism, and locates the origins of both transphobia and homophobia in what she calls \"oppositional sexism\", the belief that male and female are \"rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires\". Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with \"traditional sexism\", the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females and femininity. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.\n\nOther transgender rights authors argue that a significant part of the oppositional sexist origin of transphobia, and especially of the forms that incite violence towards transsexual people, is linked to psychological claims of difference between male sexuality and female sexuality in the brain's protection mechanisms from committing sex crimes. These authors argue that the assumption that men's acceptable sexuality is based on category-specific sexual arousal while women's acceptable sexual behavior is said to be due to lower sex drive and especially higher sexual inhibitions causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are sex criminals, and recommend information about flaws in studies that claim to show such sex differences (including the possibility that fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused may deter more men than women from taking part in sexual arousal studies) as a remedy.\n\nThe transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and misogyny. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining gender norms and the gender binary. Norton writes that the \"male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends\".\n\nThe related concept of cissexism (also termed cisgenderism, cisnormativity or cissexual assumption, occasionally used synonymously with transphobia) is the appeal to norms that enforce the gender binary and gender essentialism, resulting in the oppression of gender variant, non-binary, and transgender identities. Cisgenderism refers to the assumption that, due to human sexual differentiation, one's gender is determined solely by a biological sex of male or female (based on the assumption that all people must have either an XX or XY sex-chromosome pair, or, in the case of cisgenderism, a bivalent male or female expression), and that trans people are inferior to cisgender people due to being in \"defiance of nature\".\n\nHarassment and violence directed against transgender people is often called trans bashing, and can be physical, sexual or verbal. Whereas gay bashing is directed against a target's real or perceived sexual orientation, trans bashing is directed against the target's real or perceived expressed gender identity. The term has also been applied to hate speech directed at transgender people and to depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them. Notable victims of violent crimes motivated by transphobia include Brandon Teena, Gwen Araujo, Angie Zapata, Nizah Morris, and Lauren Harries.\n\"Transprejudice\" is a term similar to transphobia, and refers to the negative valuing, stereotyping, and discriminatory treatment of individuals whose appearance and/or identity does not conform to current social expectations or conventional conceptions of gender.\n\nAs homophobia and transphobia are correlated, many trans people experience homophobia and heterosexism; this is due to people who associate trans people's gender identity with homosexuality, or because trans people may also have a sexual orientation that is non-heterosexual. Author Thomas Spijkerboe stated, \"Transgender people subjected to violence, in a range of cultural contexts, frequently report that transphobic violence is expressed in homophobic terms.\" Attacking someone on the basis of a perception of their gender identity rather than a perception of their sexual orientation is known as \"trans bashing\", analogous to \"gay bashing\".\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, transgender children are more likely than other children to experience harassment and violence in school, foster care, residential treatment centers, homeless centers and juvenile justice programs. Researchers say trans youth routinely experience taunting, teasing and bullying at school, and that nearly all trans youth say they were verbally or physically harassed in school, particularly during gym class, at school events, or when using single-sex restrooms. Three-quarters report having felt unsafe.\n\nAs adults, transgender people are frequently subjected to ridicule, stares, taunting and threats of violence, even when just walking down the street or walking into a store. A U.S. survey of 402 older, employed, high-income transgender people found that 60% reported violence or harassment because of their gender identity. 56% had been harassed or verbally abused, 30% had been assaulted, 17% had had objects thrown at them, 14% had been robbed and 8% had experienced what they characterized as an unjustified arrest.\n\nA study of 81 transgender people in Philadelphia found 30% reported feeling unsafe in public because they were transgender, with 19% feeling uncomfortable for the same reason. When asked if they had ever been forced to have sex, experienced violence in their home, or been physically abused, the majority answered yes to each question.\n\nA review of American studies on sexual violence towards transgender people found that it is \"shockingly common\" and while reported rates vary considerably among studies for methodological and other reasons the most common finding is that around 50% of transgender people have been sexually assaulted.\n\nWhen transgender people are murdered, they are often shot, struck or stabbed repeatedly.\n\nIn 2009 researcher Rebecca L. Stotzer published an article in \"Aggression and Violent Behavior\" that compiled information from numerous studies reporting violence against transgender people. In the article Stotzer noted that transgender people have a high risk of experiencing sexual violence throughout their lifetimes.\n\nPerpetrators of physical violence against transgender people are reported to have been influenced by negative attitudes against transgender people, many of whom do not report their assault to the police.\n\nMisgendering is the experience of being labeled by others with a gender that does not match one's gender identity. Misgendering can be deliberate or accidental. It ordinarily takes the form of a person using pronouns to describe someone that are not the ones they use, calling a person \"ma'am\" or \"sir\" in contradiction to the person's gender identity, using a pre-transition name for someone instead of a post-transition one (called \"deadnaming\"), or insisting that a person must adhere to the roles or norms assigned to their sex rather than the ones that align with their gender identity; for example, using a bathroom designated for males even though the person identifies as female.\n\nTransgender people are often excluded from entitlements or privileges reserved for people whose gender identity they share, but whose assigned gender they do not. It is very common, for example, for transgender women to be stopped or questioned when they use public bathrooms designated for women. Homeless shelters, hospitals and prisons have denied trans women admission to women's areas and forced them to sleep and bathe in the presence of men. Transgender people may also be denied service in restaurants; for example members of the Transgender Education Network of Texas and the Transgender Law Center were \"denied service\" at the Elliston Place IHOP in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 21, 2018, leading to staff retraining.\n\nThe experience of being misgendered is common for all transgender people before they transition, and for many afterwards as well. Transgender people are regularly misgendered by doctors, police, media and peers, experiences that they have described as mortifying, hurtful, especially to transgender youth, cruel, and \"only making our lives harder\". Deliberately misgendering a transgender person is considered extremely offensive by transgender individuals.\n\nA study of 81 transgender people in Philadelphia found 14% said they had been refused routine medical care because they were transgender. 18% answered yes when asked if, when they went in for a check-up, \"being transgendered created a problem\" for them.\n\nTransgender people depend largely on the medical profession to receive not only hormone replacement therapy, but also vital care. In one case, Robert Eads died of ovarian cancer after being refused treatment by more than two dozen doctors.\nIn the United States–based National Center For Transgender Equality's 2011 survey, 19% had been refused medical care due to their transgender or gender non-conforming status, showing that refusal of treatment due to transphobia is not uncommon.\nAnother example of this is the case of Tyra Hunter. Hunter was involved in an automobile accident, and when rescue workers discovered she was transgender, they backed away and stopped administering treatment. She later died in a hospital.\n\nIn many European countries, laws require that any transgender person who wishes to change their legal gender must first be sterilized. Sweden repealed its law in December 2012, and the European Court of Human Rights struck down such laws in 2017.\n\nTransphobia also manifests itself in the workplace. Some transgender people lose their jobs when they begin to transition. A study from Willamette University stated that a transgender person fired for following the recommended course of treatment rarely wins it back through federal or state statutes.\n\nNews stories from the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and Associated Press cite a 1999 study by the San Francisco Department of Public Health finding a 70% unemployment rate amongst the city's transgender population. On February 18, 1999, the San Francisco Department of Public Health issued the results of a 1997 survey of 392 trans women and 123 trans men, which found that 40% of those trans women surveyed had earned money from full or part-time employment over the preceding six months. For trans men, the equivalent statistic was 81%. The survey also found that 46% of trans women and 57% of trans men reported employment discrimination.\n\nA 2002 American study found that among educators, trans educators are 10-20% more likely to experience workplace harassment than their gay and lesbian colleagues.\n\nIn the hiring process, discrimination may be either open or covert, with employers finding other ostensible reasons not to hire a candidate or just not informing prospective employees at all as to why they are not being hired. Additionally, when an employer fires or otherwise discriminates against a transgender employee, it may be a \"mixed motive\" case, with the employer openly citing obvious wrongdoing, job performance issues or the like (such as excessive tardiness, for example) while keeping silent in regards to transphobia.\n\nEmployment discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression is illegal in some U.S. cities, towns and states. Such discrimination is outlawed by specific legislation in the State of New Jersey and might be in other states (as it is in the states of California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington) or city ordinances; additionally, it is covered by case law in some other states. (For example, Massachusetts is covered by cases such as \"Lie vs. Sky Publishing Co.\" and \"Jette vs. Honey Farms\".) Several other states and cities prohibit such discrimination in public employment. Sweden and the United Kingdom has also legislated against employment discrimination on the grounds of gender identity. Sometimes, however, employers discriminate against transgender employees in spite of such legal protections.\n\nAs an example of a high-profile employment-related court case unfavorable to transgender people, in 2000 the southern U.S. grocery chain Winn-Dixie fired long-time employee Peter Oiler, despite a history of repeatedly earning raises and promotions, after management learned that the married, heterosexual truck driver occasionally cross-dressed off the job. Management argued that this hurt Winn-Dixie's corporate image. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Winn-Dixie on behalf of Oiler but a judge dismissed it.\n\nSometimes transgender people facing employment discrimination turn to sex work to survive, placing them at additional risk of such things as encountering troubles with the law, including arrest and criminal prosecution; enduring workplace violence; and possibly contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV.\n\nThe transgender community faces huge amount of employment discrimination due to their gender identity, and there are very few laws that protect the employment rights of this community. It results in limited career options for the transgender community leaving them economically vulnerable. A study conducted by Anneliese Singh and Vel McKleroy on transgender people of color revealed that difficulty finding a job or losing a job due to transphobia in workplace resulted in some of the transgender people living in crime-ridden neighborhoods, and getting involved in abusive relationships. Lack of employment has also resulted in the transgender community resorting to illegal activities like selling drugs or sex work for the income support.\n\nTransgender people also face the denial of right of asylum or inhuman treatment in process of asylum-seeking. For example, Fernada Milan, a transgender woman from Guatemala was placed in an asylum center for males in Denmark and while there, was raped by several men. She was in danger of deportation into Guatemala where transgender people have no rights and face possible execution, but has since been granted entry.\n\nTransgender disenfranchisement is the practice of creating or upholding barriers that keep transgender individuals from voting and therefore restrict the principles of universal suffrage.\n\nWithin the school system, many transgender teens are harassed and mistreated with reported negative effects on both victim and the school's population in general. \"Transgender youth frequently report fear and anxiety about using restrooms and locker rooms at school because they had experienced harassment by both peers and adults when using them.\" Over 80% of transgender teens report feeling unsafe in a school environment, more than 40% report having been physically abused, and over 65% report being bullied online or via social media. Through official channels, such discrimination is generally underreported.\n\nA study done on Canadian High School students between December 2007 and June 2009 illustrated how the LGBTQ students feel unsafe at the school, and are exposed to insults and discrimination by their peers and sometimes even by their teachers. Even the heterosexual students and the teachers fear the attack by transphobia on account of supporting or having a transgender friend or family. Most of the administrators and educators are unaware about the extent of damage that has been caused to the transgender students on account of underestimating the gravity of transphobia in their schools.\n\nThe Christian right in North America, including organizations such as the American Family Association, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality believe that transgenderism is unnatural and that transgender people are and remain their birth sex, and they oppose laws and policies intended to accommodate transgender people, such as allowing them to change their legal sex, use the washroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify, or become ordained Christian ministers. They say that God created people's bodies as they are meant to be, that accepting transgender people would violate scripture and natural law, and that the Bible refers to male and female.\n\nAccording to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance website, under Pope John Paul II, the Vatican first stated its opposition to reassignment surgery in 2000, although it was not made public until 2003.\n\nTransgender people face particular challenges in attempting to integrate their faith with their gender identity. One author says \"expectations [based on gender] are usually predicated upon our genitalia and begin from the moment of birth, continuing throughout our lives.\" Many Christian denominations use biblical notions of gender and gender roles to support their views. These include “So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:27) and “The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God” (Deuteronomy 22:5). \n\nViews of gender identity based on the Christian faith do not always coincide with the ideologies of transgender individuals. However, if they do not conform to these expectations, they may face rejection. Many transgender Christians seek out an “individualized relationship with God”, often facing “a period of denial and struggle” as well as depression, disconnection, dissatisfaction, and spiritual difficulty before “discovering a sense of self that feels integral and true” However, after discovering their gender identity, many transgender individuals still face barriers within the church such as, “fear and unfamiliarity on the part of the congregation, language issues, physical layout that separates people by gender, programs that exclude or separate by gender, pathologizing or designating trans issues as sinful, and overt hostility”\n\nThe Islamic faith ordinarily supports a heteronormative binary of gender identification which is reinforced by their cultural norms and traditional readings of sacred texts which prohibit the wide range of identities that are present in today's society. Transgender men and women are acknowledged and accepted in many Islamic cultures around the world. In actuality, the idea of a man or woman identifying as a member of the opposite gender is more likely to be approved than that of a man or woman expressing sexual desire for someone of their own gender. \n\nIn 1988, gender reassignment surgery was declared acceptable under Islamic law by scholars at Egypt's Al-Azhar, the world's oldest Islamic university. In Iran during 1987, Ayatollah Khomeini, the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see transsexuality in Iran). The foundation for this accepting attitude is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual, thus making homosexuality a sin. Nonetheless, transgender individuals within the Muslim community still face particular challenges. \n\nSome communities of worship are more tolerant—Muslims for Progressive Values has founded Unity Mosques in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; and Los Angeles, California. The Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity hosts an annual retreat for LGBTQ+ Muslims in Pennsylvania each May.\n\nSome positions within feminism have been considered transphobic. This may include criticism of transitioning or sex reassignment surgery as a personal choice or medical invention, or the position that trans women are not women in a literal sense and should not be in women-only spaces.\n\nSecond-wave feminist and activist Gloria Steinem expressed concerns in 1977 about transsexuality and sex reassignment surgery (SRS), writing that in many cases, transsexuals \"surgically mutilate their own bodies.\" She concluded that \"feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism.\" For some years, this led to Steinem being characterized as transphobic. In 2013, she repudiated the interpretation of her text as an altogether condemnation of SRS, stating that her position was informed by accounts of gay men choosing to transition as a way of coping with societal homophobia. She added that she sees transgender people as living \"authentic lives\" that should be \"celebrated.\"\n\nRadical feminist Janice Raymond's 1979 book, \"The Transsexual Empire\", was and still is controversial due to its unequivocal condemnation of transsexual surgeries. In the book Raymond says, \"All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves ... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive.\" Raymond authored a paper in the 1980s which the United States Department of Health and Human Services allegedly used to deny trans people access to transgender-specific healthcare. Raymond repudiated this claim, pointing out that her submission was mentioned only in one sentence of a 15-page final report.\n\nAnother site of conflict between feminists and trans women has been the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival. In the early 1990s, the festival ejected a transsexual woman, Nancy Burkholder. In 2014, the festival \"passionately rejected\" accusations that it believed transgender \"womyn are 'less than' other womyn.\" The activist group Camp Trans had protested the \"womyn-born-womyn\" intention and advocated for greater acceptance of trans women within the feminist community. The festival had considered allowing only post-operative trans women to attend, however this was criticized as classist, as many trans women cannot afford sex reassignment surgery.\n\nTrans women such as Sandy Stone challenged the feminist conception of \"biological woman\". Stone worked as a sound engineer for Olivia Records from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased. The debate continued in Raymond's book, which devoted a chapter to criticism of \"the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist.\" Groups like Lesbian Organization of Toronto then voted to exclude trans lesbians. Sheila Jeffreys labeled transgenderism \"deeply problematic from a feminist perspective and [stated] that transsexualism should be seen as a violation of human rights.\"\n\nIn 2017, with regard to the question of whether trans women are women, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie expressed the view that \"trans women are trans women\", meaning that while she acknowledges them to face discrimination on the basis of being transgender and sees this as a serious issue, she thinks that their experiences should not be conflated with those of women who face oppression on the basis of being born female. After sustaining severe criticism for her views, Adichie opined that the American Left is \"creating its own decline\" and is \"very cannibalistic.\" She explained that she sees trans women as women despite her views, but stood behind her position.\n\nOtherwise, cisgender feminist support came from the work of poststructuralist feminist and lesbian Judith Butler, particularly her books \"Gender Trouble\" (1990) and \"Bodies That Matter\" (1993), which argue that the \"violent inscription\" of gender as a social construct on human bodies leads to violence against those that violate such binaristic gender dichotomies.\n\nRadical feminists who hold negative views on transgender politics are commonly called \"TERFs\", short for \"trans-exclusionary radical feminists\". Those whom the term is targeted against, in turn, have perceived their labeling as \"TERF\" to be a slur. Feminist journalist Sarah Ditum, who writes for \"The Guardian\" and the \"New Statesman\", said that the term is used to silence feminists through guilt by association. Meghan Murphy, founder of Canadian feminist website Feminist Current, opined that \"TERF\" should be considered hate speech after a woman was physically assaulted and several people defended or celebrated the assault on the grounds that the woman was a \"TERF\" and as such deserving of violence.\n\nTransphobia is documented in the lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) communities, despite historic cooperation between these communities in campaigns for equality, such as in the Stonewall Riots.\n\nAuthors and observers, such as transgender author Jillian Todd Weiss, have written that \"there are social and political forces that have created a split between gay/lesbian communities and bisexual/transgender communities, and these forces have consequences for civil rights and community inclusion. 'Biphobia' and 'transphobia' are a result of these social and political forces, not psychological forces causing irrational fears in aberrant individuals.\"\n\nHistorian Joanne Meyerowitz documented transphobia within the gay rights movement in the mid 20th century in response to publicity surrounding the transition of Christine Jorgensen. Jorgensen, who made frequent homophobic remarks and insisted she was not connected to or identified with gay men, was a polarizing figure among activists:\n\nIn 1953, for example, \"ONE\" magazine published a debate among its readers as to whether gay men should denounce Jorgensen. In the opening salvo, the author Jeff Winters accused Jorgensen of a \"sweeping disservice\" to gay men. \"As far as the public knows,\" Winters wrote, \"you were merely another unhappy homosexual who decided to get drastic about it.\" For Winters, Jorgensen's story simply confirmed the false belief that all men attracted to other men must be basically feminine,\" which, he said, \"they are not.\" Jorgensen's precedent, he thought, encouraged the \"reasoning\" that led \"to legal limitations upon the homosexual, mandatory injections, psychiatric treatment – and worse.\" In the not-so-distant past, scientists had experimented with castrating gay men.\n\nSeveral prominent figures in second wave feminism have also been accused of transphobic attitudes, culminating in 1979 with the publication of \"The Transsexual Empire\" by radical lesbian feminist Janice Raymond, who popularized the term \"shemale\" as derogatory slur referring to trans women in 1994, and her statements on transsexuality and transsexual people have been criticized by many in the LGBT and feminist communities as extremely transphobic and as constituting hate speech.\n\nIn 1950s America, there was a debate among gay men and women about those who felt they were of the opposite sex. Gay men and women who were trying to melt quietly into the majority society criticized them as \"freaks\" who brought unwanted disreputable attention upon them. Such attitudes were widespread at the time.\n\nSome trans men face rejection from lesbian communities they had been part of prior to transition. Journalist Louise Rafkin writes, \"there are those who are feeling curiously uncomfortable standing by as friends morph into men. Sometimes there is a generational flavor to this discomfort; many in the over-40 crowd feel particular unease\", stating that this was \"shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world\". Trans men were part of the protest at the 2000 Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, the first time the 'womyn-born womyn only' policy has been used against trans males, women supporting the transgender community and young gender-variant women.\n\nIn the early 1970s, conflicts began to emerge due to different syntheses of lesbian, feminist and transgender political movements, particularly in the United States. San Francisco trans activist and entertainer Beth Elliott became the focus of debate over whether to include transgender lesbians in the movement, and she was eventually blacklisted by her own movement.\n\nOne view is that the word \"bisexual\" is transphobic, as \"bi\" means \"two\" (thus implying a belief in the binary view of gender). Some people, such as scholar Shiri Eisner, say that some make the claim that the term \"erases nonbinary genders and sexes out of existence\", as many dictionaries define bisexuality as \"of, relating to, or having a sexual orientation to persons of either sex\", \"sexually attracted to both men and women\" and other similar definitions.\n\nHowever, some bisexual individuals and scholars object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since \"bisexual\" is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses gender as well, it can include attraction to more than one or more than two genders and is occasionally defined as such. Others, such as the American Institute of Bisexuality, say that the term \"is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions\" and that \"the scientific classification \"bisexual\" only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation.\"\n\nIn order to deal with issues related to transphobia and the gender binary, many individuals have taken on terms such as \"pansexual\", \"omnisexual\" (an alternative word for pansexual) or \"polysexual\" in place of the term \"bisexual\". The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that these terms \"describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with these labels are also bisexual\" and that the notion that bisexuality is a reinforcement of a gender binary is a concept that is founded upon \"anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world\". Eisner agrees with this view, stating that \"allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life\" and that the allegations are an attempt to separate the bisexual and transgender communities politically.\n\nWhether intentional or not, transphobia and cissexism have severe consequences for the target of the negative attitude. Transphobia creates significant stresses for transgender people which can lead them to feel shame, low self-esteem, alienation and inadequacy. Transgender youth often try to cope with the stress by running away from home, dropping out of school, using drugs or self-harming. Suicide rates among transgender people are thought to be especially high, because of how they are treated by their families and by society.\n\nThe 2015 United States Transgender Survey, the largest such survey ever carried out (with 27,715 respondents), found that one in ten respondents suffered transphobic violence at the hands of a family member and 8% were kicked out of their homes for being transgender. The majority of those who were openly transgender or perceived as transgender at school were victims of some form of mistreatment on account of this, including verbal abuse (54%), physical attacks (24%), and sexual assault (13%). 17% experienced such severe mistreatment that they had to leave school. Support from one's community or family was correlated with more positive outcomes related to mental health and social functioning.\n\n62% of lawsuits involving transgender people state that defendants face family problems.\n\nNearly one third of U.S. transgender people responding to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey lived in poverty, compared to 14% of the population. During the 12 months prior to the survey, 30% of employed transgender people were either fired or mistreated for being transgender, from verbal abuse to sexual violence. 30% had been homeless at some point in their life, and 12% had been homeless during the previous year. Family and community support were correlated with significantly lower rates of homelessness and poverty.\n\nDuring the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 46% of respondents had been verbally harassed and 9% had been physically attacked for being transgender. 10% had been sexually assaulted during the previous year, and 47% had been sexually assaulted at some point in their life.\n\nDuring the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 12% of respondents reported being verbally harassed in a public restroom. 1% reported being sexually assaulted in a public restroom for being transgender, and 1% reported being otherwise physically assaulted for being transgender. 9% reported being denied the right to use a public restroom consistent with their gender.\n\nDuring the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 59% of respondents reported avoiding using a public restroom out of fear of violence or harassment. 32% limited the amount they ate or drink in order to avoid using a public restroom. 8% reported suffering a urinary tract infection, kidney infection, or other kidney problem as a result of avoiding public restrooms.\n\n33% reported having negative experiences with a healthcare professional related to being transgender, such as verbal harassment or denial of treatment. 23% reported that they did not seek treatment for a condition out of fear of being mistreated, while 33% did not seek treatment because they were unable to afford it.\n\nDuring the month prior to the survey, 39% of American transgender people experienced major psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population of the United States. 40% had attempted suicide at some point in their life, compared to 4.6 percent of the American population. Family and community support were correlated with far lower rates of suicide attempts and of major psychological distress.\n\nA study conducted on transgender women of color in San Francisco has shown a higher correlation between transphobia and risk of transgender women engaging in HIV risk behavior. The study shows that the transgender youth face social discrimination, and they may not have a social role model. The young adults in this group have shown a higher risk of engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse when the exposure to transphobia is high. Therefore, as per the study shows a correlation between transphobia and high risk of HIV.\n\nPeople who are transgender are more likely to experience some type of psychological distress because of the harassment and discrimination that comes with transphobia. Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conducted a nationwide survey on college campuses examining the psychological effects on transgender people, with a sample size of 86. Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).\n\nAccording to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%. In India, 31% to 50% of transgender people have tried to commit suicide before age 20. 50% of transgender people in Australia and 45% of those in England have attempted suicide at least once. In the United States, suicide attempts reported by transgender and gender nonconforming adults exceed the rate of the general population: 41% versus 4.6 percent. In San Francisco alone, the suicide rate among transgender people is 32% overall, and for those under age 25 it is 50%.\n\nAccording to the study \"Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color\" by the University of California San Francisco, transphobia affects the psychological vulnerability of transgender people of color as compared to those of other ethnicities. Acts of transphobia such as undue denial of services, unfair dismissal from work places or stigmatization have far-reaching effects on the subjects such as low self-esteem, under-performance, stress, withdrawal or even depression. When it comes to the minorities, who are already proven to be undergoing various forms of discrimination, the consequences are even more exaggerated. Transgender people of color are more significantly associated with depression than their white counterparts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "89685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89685", "title": "World Almanac", "text": "World Almanac\n\nThe World Almanac and Book of Facts is a US-published reference work and is a bestselling almanac conveying information about such subjects as world changes, tragedies, sports feats, etc.\n\nIt has been published yearly from 1868 to 1875, and again every year since 1886. It was number 1 on the \"Washington Post\" bestseller list on November 27, 2011. The 2017 edition () has 1,008 pages.\n\nThe first edition of \"The World Almanac\" was published by \"The New York World\" newspaper in 1868 (the name of the publication comes from the newspaper itself, which was known as \"The World\"). Published just three years after the end of the US Civil War and the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, its 120 pages of information touched on such events as the process of Reconstruction and the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.\n\nPublication was suspended in 1876, but in 1886 newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer, who had purchased \"The New York World\" and quickly transformed it into one of the most influential newspapers in the country, revived \"The World Almanac\" with the intention of making it \"a compendium of universal knowledge.\" \"The World Almanac\" has been published annually since.\n\nIn 1894, when it claimed more than a half-million \"habitual users,\" \"The World Almanac\" changed its name to \"The World Almanac and Encyclopedia\". This was the title it kept until 1923, when it became \"The World Almanac and Book of Facts\", the name it bears today.\n\nIn 1906, the \"New York Times\", reporting on the publishing of the 20th edition, said that \"the almanac has made for itself a secure position, second only to the forty-year-old Whitaker's Almanac of London, with which alone it can be compared.\"\nFrom 1890 to 1934, the New York World Building was prominently featured on the cover of the almanac. In 1923, the name changed to its current name, \"The World Almanac and Book of Facts\".\n\nCalvin Coolidge's father read from \"The World Almanac\" when he swore his son into office. Since then, photos have shown that Presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton have also used \"The World Almanac\" as a resource.\n\nThe \"New York World\" merged with the Scripps-owned \"Telegram\" to form the \"New York World-Telegram\" in 1931. The \"Almanac\" survived the closure of the \"World-Telegram\" in 1966.\n\nDuring World War II, \"The World Almanac\" could boast that it was read by GIs all over the world: between 1944 and 1946, at the request of the U.S. Government, \"The World Almanac\" had special print runs of 100,000 to 150,000 copies for distribution to the armed forces.\n\nIn late December 1984, the 1985 edition reached first place in the category of paperback Advice, How- To and Miscellaneous books, on the \"New York Times\" best-seller list, with more than 1,760,000 copies sold at the time.\n\nThe first version of the video game \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\", published in 1985, included \"The World Almanac\" in the purchase.\n\nOver the years \"The World Almanac\" has been featured in a number of Hollywood films. For example, Fred MacMurray talks about it with Edward G. Robinson in \"Double Indemnity\"; Bette Davis screams about it in \"All About Eve\"; Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper flirt about it in \"Love in the Afternoon\"; it is featured in \"Miracle on 34th Street\" when a trial is held to see if Santa Claus really exists; Rosie Perez continually reads it in the film \"White Men Can't Jump\"; and Will Smith checks it for the exact time of sunset so he can set his digital watch in \"I Am Legend\".\n\n\"The World Almanac For Kids\" was published annually since 1995 until 2013, when the \"2014\" edition was released.\nIn 1993 Scripps sold the \"Almanac\" to K-III (later Primedia).\"The World Almanac\" was sold to Ripplewood Holdings' WRC Media in 1999. Ripplewood bought Reader's Digest and the book was then produced by the World Almanac Education Group, which was owned by The Reader's Digest Association. \"The World Almanac\" was sold to Infobase Publishing in 2009.\n\nSome lists published are:\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the almanac was being put together by a 10-member staff. At that time, 20 percent of the book was rarely updated (for example, the text of the Constitution of the United States), 50 percent was updated at least briefly each year, and 30 percent of the content was completely new each year.\n\nAs a publication of Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) the \"World Almanac\" would publish the NEA NFL All-Pro teams, which were also released to the media. The NEA All-Pro teams were considered the \"player's\" All-Pro team since creator Murray Olderman, a NEA sports editor, would poll NFL players for the All-Pro team. The NEA All-Pro team ran from 1955 through 1992.\n\n\n"}
