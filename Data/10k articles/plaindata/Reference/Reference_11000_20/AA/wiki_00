{"id": "315445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315445", "title": "Abbots Bromley Horn Dance", "text": "Abbots Bromley Horn Dance\n\nThe Abbots Bromley Horn Dance is an English folk dance dating back to the Middle Ages. The dance takes place each year in Abbots Bromley, a village in Staffordshire, England. The modern version of the dance involves reindeer antlers, a hobby horse, Maid Marian, and a Fool.\n\nThere are no recorded references to the horn dance prior to Robert Plot's \"Natural History of Staffordshire\", written in 1686. However, there is a record of the hobby horse being used in Abbots Bromley as early as 1532, and it is possible that the horn dance component of the custom was also present at that time but not commented upon by the writer. A carbon analysis discovered that the antlers used in the dance date to the 11th century – though these may well have replaced an even older set. According to some, the use of antlers suggests an Anglo-Saxon origin along with other native Anglo-Saxon traditions that have survived into modern times in various forms. It has been speculated, for example, that the dance originated in the pagan period and was connected with the ruling dynasty of Mercia, based some 15 miles away at Tamworth, who owned extensive hunting lands in Needwood Forest and Cannock Chase surrounding Abbots Bromley. On this theory, the royal forester would have organised sympathetic magic rituals to ensure a plentiful catch each year, a tradition that survived into Christian times and gradually came to be seen as affirming the villagers' hunting rights. Even when the lands were granted to Burton Abbey in 1004 a forester would still need to have been employed. By the 16th century, when the abbey was dissolved, this was a hereditary position with the title \"Forester of Bentylee\" (Bentylee being the wooded area of the parish). From then until the 19th century the dance remained the traditional prerogative of the Bentley family, eventually passing to the Fowell family in 1914. The Fowells continue to run it to this day.\n\nSuch an ancient origin for the dance has been doubted by some folklorists, who point out that while the reindeer antlers date to the 11th century, reindeer were long since extinct in England and Wales (and probably Scotland), and there is no evidence that any domestic reindeer herds remained at that time. Therefore, even more confusingly, the antlers must have been imported from Scandinavia at some point between the 11th and 17th centuries. This analysis may lend weight to the theory that the custom originally began with only a hobby horse, and the horn dance component was added later, explaining why only the former was mentioned by 16th century sources.\n\nThe dance was, like similar events throughout the country, temporarily discontinued during the Commonwealth years.\n\nThe Horn Dance attracts a large number of visitors to the village. As well as the dance itself, Wakes Monday sees a fair on the village green; Morris dancing; and numerous other attractions. The right to hold this fair was granted to the village in 1221.\n\nThe Horn Dance takes place on Wakes Monday, the day following Wakes Sunday, which is the first Sunday after 4 September. Violet Alford, a prominent student of folklore and folk dance, wrote in 1940 that the dance had previously taken place on the Twelfth Day, during the first week of January. According to Robert Plot, it has also been performed on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, in addition to the local Wakes Monday, though upon its revival in 1660 it was confined to the latter alone.\n\nThe dance starts at 08:00 with a service of blessing in St Nicholas Church, where the horns are housed. The dance begins on the village green, then passes out of the village – but not out of the parish – to Blithfield Hall, owned by Lady Bagot.\n\nThe dancers return to the village in the early afternoon, and make their way around the pubs and houses. Finally, at about 20:00, the horns are returned to the church, and the day is concluded with a service of Compline.\n\nThere are 12 dancers. Six carry the horns and they are accompanied by a musician playing an accordion (a violin in former times), Maid Marian (a man in a dress), the Hobby-horse, the Fool (or Jester), a youngster with a bow and arrow, and another youngster with a triangle. Traditionally, the dancers are all male, although in recent years girls have been seen carrying the triangle and bow and arrow.\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century the dancers were all members of the Bentley family. The dance passed to the related Fowell family in the early 20th century; this has continued to this day, though due to rising house prices none of them live in the village any longer; many live in nearby towns. They have been known to allow visitors to \"dance in\" if asked politely, and will often invite musicians and others to take part when necessary.\n\nThe \"horns\" are six sets of reindeer antlers, three white and three black. In 1976, a small splinter was radiocarbon dated to around 1065. Since there are not believed to have been any reindeer in England in the 11th century, the horns must have been imported from Scandinavia. However, it is equally mysterious as to why this should have been done and by whom. If the antlers were imported it must have been near the date of their growth-dropping. It is, therefore, just as likely that reindeer did survive somewhere in England at that period.\n\nThe antlers are mounted on small heads carved from wood. Since 1981, the horns are legally the property of Abbots Bromley Parish Council. For 364 days a year, they are on display in St Nicholas Church. They were once kept in the main Village Hall, which is now the Goat's Head Inn, beside the Butter Cross. An alternative set of antlers (red deer) are kept to use when the dancers are asked, as they frequently are, to perform outside the parish boundaries.\n\nThe dance itself is simple, since the antlers themselves have some weight to them and are large and bulky.\n\nAs described by Cecil Sharp, there are six figures in the dance. He describes the dance as being done with the participants in a single line; however, it is currently performed with the dancers in a double column.\n\n"}

Adults range in weight from 30 grams to over 25 kilograms. They possess no pelvic fins, and many species also lack pectoral fins. The dorsal and anal fins are fused with the caudal or tail fin, forming a single ribbon running along much of the length of the animal.\nMost eels live in the shallow waters of the ocean and burrow into sand, mud, or amongst rocks. A majority of eel species are nocturnal and thus are rarely seen. Sometimes, they are seen living together in holes, or \"eel pits\". Some species of eels live in deeper water on the continental shelves and over the slopes deep as . Only members of the Anguillidae family regularly inhabit fresh water, but they too return to the sea to breed.\n\nEel blood is poisonous to humans and other mammals, but both cooking and the digestive process destroy the toxic protein. The toxin derived from eel blood serum was used by Charles Richet in his Nobel winning research which discovered anaphylaxis (by injecting it into dogs and observing the effect).\n\nThe Jewish laws of Kashrut forbid the eating of eels. Similarly, according to the King James version of the Old Testament, it is acceptable to eat fin fish, but fish like eels, which were erroneously believed to lack fins or scales, are an abomination and should not be eaten.\n\nJapan consumes more than 70 percent of the global eel catch.\n\nFreshwater eels (\"unagi\") and marine eels (\"anago\", conger eel) are commonly used in Japanese cuisine; foods such as unadon and unajuu are popular but expensive. Eels are also very popular in Chinese cuisine and are prepared in many different ways. Hong Kong eel prices have often reached 1000 HKD per kilogram and once exceeded 5000 HKD per kilogram. Eel is also popular in Korean cuisine and is seen as a source of stamina for men. The European eel and other freshwater eels are eaten in Europe, the United States, and other places. Traditional east London foods are jellied eels and pie and mash, although their demand has significantly declined since World War II. In Italian cuisine eels from the Valli di Comacchio, a swampy zone along the Adriatic coast, are especially prized along with freshwater eels of Bolsena Lake.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the American eel, European eel, and Japanese eel to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n\nThe US government deems eels population and the commercial industry was worth $12 million in Maine in 2017.\n\nThe eel was a cheap, nutritious and readily available food source for the people of London; European eels were once so common in the Thames that nets were set as far upriver as London itself, and eels became a staple for London's poor. The first \"Eel Pie & Mash Houses\" opened in London in the 18th century, and the oldest surviving shop - M Manze - has been open since 1902.\n\n"}

In the letter, Mithridates requests Parthian aid against the troops of Lucullus, and in a series of arguments, Mithridates asks the Parthians to join an alliance with Mithridates and Tigranes (king of Armenia), against the Romans. The letter, assigned to Sallust, is considered to be an important source on the Pontic–Parthian relations at the time.\n\nAccording to Prof. Dr. Marek Jan Olbrycht, the letter suggests \"a genuine document found by the Romans in the personal archives of Mithridates\".

Adler states that \"A few scholars have asserted that the \"EM\" (\"Epistula Mithridatis\") owes its origin to a document culled from the archives of Mithridates, which Sallust somehow acquired and translated or adapted into Latin. Some claim that Pompey discovered this epistle in a secret archive after the Third Mithridatic War, and then presumably brought to Rome. Others have supposed that the \"EM\" is an expression of authentic Pontic propaganda, and thus based on arguments that are not Sallust's own. (...)

It was translated into Latin c. 750 by an anonymous Merovingian author. \"Excerpta Latina Barbari\" derives its name from the fact that the late Merovingian translator made many mistakes in translating the Greek into Latin. It is also now known that the translator included some alterations to the original chronicle. These alterations include the insertion of a lineage linking the Merovingian kings to the ancient Trojans (see Francus) as popularised in the \"Liber historiae Francorum\".\n\nJoseph Justus Scaliger took the first scholarly interest in the chronicle in his \"Thesaurus temporum\" (1606) and first named the chronicle \"Barbarus Scaligeri\".

Some modern scholars have criticized this name, but it remains in use. \n\nThe 8th-century manuscript of the Latin version of the text is now housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.\n\nThe chronicle contains two main sections: (a) the history of the world from the creation to Cleopatra and (b) a list of kings or rulers from Assyria to the consuls of Rome (including the Ptolemaic dynasty, a list entitled \"high priests and kings of the Jews\" and an entry for Macedonian kings).

The plot of the film involves two young men who hold a family hostage and torture them with sadistic games. The film was entered into the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. In 2007 it was remade in America by Haneke, this time with a different cast and a mostly American crew.\n\nHaneke wanted to make a film set in the United States, but for practical reasons he had to set it in Austria.\n\nAfter the 2007 American remake directed by Haneke used the same house including props and tones, Robert Koehler of \"Cineaste\" wrote that this \"proves for certain that—whether he uses the great cinematographer (for the 1997 version) or the great Darius Khondji (for the new film)—Haneke is fundamentally his own cinematographer exercising considerable control over the entire look of his films.\"\n\nThe film begins with a wealthy Austrian family—Georg, his wife Anna, their son Georgie, and their dog Rolfi—arriving at their holiday home beside a lake in Austria. They spot their next-door neighbor Fred accompanied by two young Viennese men, Peter and Paul, one of whom Fred introduces as the son of a friend.\n\nThe two men begin imposing themselves on the family's courtesy. First Peter asks to borrow eggs which he keeps breaking, supposedly by accident, also destroying the family's phone with his apparent clumsiness. Eventually, a frustrated Anna demands that the men leave, asking Georg to eject them from the premises. Peter breaks Georg's leg with the latter's golf club while Paul reveals he has killed Rolfi, and the two men take the family hostage, forcing the members to participate in games of pain and death.\n\nPaul asks if the family wants to bet whether they will still be alive by 9:00 the next morning, though he doubts that they will win. Between playing their games, the two men keep up a constant patter, and Paul frequently ridicules Peter's weight and lack of intelligence. He relates contradictory stories of Peter's past. No definitive explanation of the men's origins or motives is offered. When some of the family's other neighbors arrive for a visit, Anna passes the men off as friends until the visitors leave—much in the same way Fred did at the beginning of the film. Georgie eventually escapes to the house next door, but finds the family dead. He attempts to shoot Paul with a shotgun, but it is not loaded. Paul returns him to the house, along with the gun. After a few more games, Peter plays a counting-out game between the family members and shoots Georgie while Paul makes sandwiches in the kitchen. After this, both intruders leave.\n\nGeorg and Anna weep for their loss, but eventually resolve to survive. Anna flees the house while Georg, with a broken leg, tries to get help with the malfunctioning phone. Anna struggles to find help, but eventually Peter and Paul reappear, capture her, and return to the house. They kill Georg and take Anna out on the family's boat early the next morning. Around 8:00, Paul casually throws the bound Anna into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock at the house of the neighbors that had previously visited the family, and ask for some eggs, thereby restarting their cycle of murder.\n\n\nThe film frequently blurs the line between fiction and reality, especially highlighting the act of observation. The character Paul breaks the fourth wall throughout the film and addresses the camera in various ways. As he directs Anna to look for her dead dog, he turns, winks, and smirks at the camera. When he asks the family to bet on their survival, he turns to the camera and asks the audience whether they will bet as well. At the end of the film, when requesting eggs from the next family, he looks into the camera and smirks again. Only Paul breaks the fourth wall in the film, while Peter makes references to the formulaic suspense rules of traditional cinema throughout the film.\n\nPaul also frequently states his intentions to follow the standards of movie plot development. When he asks the audience to bet, he guesses that the audience wants the family to win. After the killers vanish in the third act, Paul later explains that he had to give the victims a last chance to escape or else it would not be dramatic. Toward the end of the movie, he postpones killing the rest of the family because the movie has not yet reached feature length. Throughout the film, Paul shows awareness of the audience's expectations.\n\nHowever, Paul also causes the film to go against convention on a number of occasions. In thrillers, one protagonist that the audience can sympathize with usually survives, but here all three family members die. When Anna successfully shoots Peter, as a possible start to a heroic escape for the family, Paul uses a remote control to rewind the film itself and prevent her action. After Peter shoots Georgie, Paul scolds him for killing the child first because it goes against convention and limits the suspense for the rest of the film. At the end of the film, the murderers prevent Anna from using a knife in the boat to cut her bonds. An earlier close-up had pointed out the knife's location as a possible set-up for a final-act escape, but this becomes a red herring. At the end of the film, Paul again smirks triumphantly at the audience. As a self-aware character, he is able to go against the viewers' wishes and make himself the winner of the film.\n\nAfter killing Anna, Peter and Paul argue about the line between reality and fiction. Paul believes that a fiction that is observed is just as real as anything else, but Peter dismisses this idea. Unlike Paul, Peter never shows an awareness that he is in a film.\n\nHaneke states that the entire film was not intended to be a horror film. He says he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie. He had written a short essay revealing how he felt on the issue, called \"Violence + Media.\" The essay is included as a chapter in the book \"A Companion to Michael Haneke.\"\n\nAustrian critics argued that the intention was to undermine the heimat genre and its values, which are bourgeois and based on the home. European and English-language critics, according to Robert Koehler of \"Cineaste\", \"generally set their criticism against the backdrop of the American slasher movie that the film was subverting\" and \"expressed mild forms of outrage along with admiration\". In an interview, the film director and critic Jacques Rivette made his displeasure with the movie clear, calling it \"a disgrace\", \"vile\", and \"a complete piece of shit.\"\n\n\"Funny Games\" received generally positive reviews, garnering a 64%, based an average score of 6.8/10 by 28 critics, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The site's critical consensus states: \"Violent images and blunt audience provocation make up this nihilistic experiment from one of cinema's more difficult filmmakers\".\n\n\nAn American remake of the same name was released in 2007. It stars Tim Roth, Michael Pitt, Brady Corbet, and Naomi Watts, and is also written and directed by Michael Haneke.\n\n\n"}

In this way, FIAF is joined by moving image museums, videotheques, documentation centres, and so on.\n\nMuch of the work of FIAF takes the form of active cooperation between members on projects of mutual benefit or interest - for example, the careful restoration of a particular film, or the compilation of a national or international filmography. The more visible activities include the annual congress, publications and the work of the specialist commissions.\n\nThe Annual Congress\nFIAF meets every year in a different country. The Congress combines a General Assembly at which the formal business of the Federation is transacted with a programme of symposia and workshops on technical or legal aspects of film archive work and on aspects of film history and culture.\n\nThe Specialized Commissions\nThe Commissions are groups of individual experts from affiliated archives who meet regularly to pursue work programmes that promote and assist in the development and maintenance of standards at both the theoretical and the practical level. The three FIAF Commissions are the Cataloguing and Documentation Commission, the Technical Commission, and the Programming and Access to Collections Commission.\n\nFIAF publishes the \"Journal of Film Preservation\" twice a year. A special office compiles and publishes the International Index to Film Periodicals and the FIAF International FilmArchive Database. Publications also include an annual bibliography of members' publications, the proceedings of symposia or workshops, the results of surveys and reports, manuals and discussion papers prepared by the specialist Commissions and the results of other FIAF projects.\n\nFIAF has always had an active international profile. It was closely involved in the preparatory work for the UNESCO Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images, approved in Belgrade in 1980. In pursuit of the goals of the Recommendation, the Federation facilitates contacts between developing archives and older archives to make sure that experience is passed on. The Federation is a member of the Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations (CCAAA).\n\nTraining of archive personnel takes place at FIAF Summer Schools and Technical Symposia that have been held several times in various countries. Their aim is to introduce participants to the necessary skills of preservation, cataloguing, documentation and even administration.\n\nThe FIAF Award celebrates a personality – external to the FIAF archival community – whose experience in the field of cinema underlines the objectives and goals of the Federation.\n\nThe FIAF Award was created in 2001, and has since then been presented to the following personalities:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49596358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49596358", "title": "Jack Reacher (book series)", "text": "Jack Reacher (book series)\n\nJack Reacher is a fictional protagonist of a series of novels, novellas and short stories by British author Jim Grant under the pen name Lee Child. A former major in the United States Army Military Police Corps, Reacher roams the United States taking odd jobs and investigating suspicious and frequently dangerous situations. The Reacher novels are written either in the first-person or third-person. The schedule for the Reacher series, previously one-per-year, was increased in 2010 with the release of both \"61 Hours\" and \"Worth Dying For\". Most of the novels are set in the United States, in locales ranging from major metropolitan areas like New York City and Los Angeles to small towns in the Midwestern and Southern United States. To date, Reacher's travels outside the US have taken him to rural England (\"The Hard Way\"), London (\"Personal\"), Hamburg (\"Night School\") and Paris, France, where Reacher and his brother visit their dead mother's grave.\n\nReacher has also appeared in several short stories by Child. \"Second Son,\" \"Deep Down\" and \"Not a Drill\" were all released originally for the Amazon Kindle although \"Second Son\" was later included in the American & Canadian paperback and Kindle editions of \"The Affair\", and \"Deep Down\" with the American & Canadian paperback and Kindle editions of \"A Wanted Man\". \"High Heat\" with the American paperback and Kindle editions of \"Never Go Back\", \"Everyone Talks\" with the UK edition of \"Never Go Back\", and \"Not a Drill\" with the American paperback of \"Personal\".\n\n\"Second Son\" is a snapshot of the life of Reacher and his family circa 1974, while they are stationed on a military base in Okinawa. Upon arriving they immediately get into deep trouble that is compounded by some bad news. The action is interspersed with contemplative moments, such as when 13-year-old Jack's grandfather, a prosthetic-limb maker and World War I veteran in Paris, recounts that \"… a great war leaves a country with three armies: an army of cripples, an army of mourners, and an army of thieves.\"\n\nIn 1986, summoned by military intelligence to Washington, DC, Reacher is sent undercover. The assignment that awaits him: the army is meeting with its Capitol Hill paymasters for classified talks on a new, state-of-the-art sniper rifle for US forces. But vital details about the weapon are leaking from someone at the top of the federal government and probably into the hands of unidentified foreign arms dealers. The prospect of any and every terrorist, mercenary, or dictator's militia getting their hands on the latest superior firepower is unthinkable. Reacher is tasked with infiltrating the top-secret proceedings and revealing the traitor. He targets a quartet of high-powered Army political liaison officers—all of them fast-track women on their way to the top. According to his bosses, it's a zero-danger mission, but Reacher knows that things are rarely what they seem.\n\nThe story is set in the moments before the beginning of the novel \"Gone Tomorrow\". Reacher, while at a blues music club, observes what he believes to be the beginning of a kidnapping as part of a Russian mafia dispute. This story was published in \"The New York Times\" on 6 June 2009.\n\nThe story features Reacher, still in the Army as a captain, helping James Penney, a Vietnam War veteran who has recently been made redundant at work and had his car stolen. When Penney unknowingly becomes a fugitive (after he accidentally burns down two neighbours' houses in the course of deliberately burning down his own in an act of frustration after being fired), Reacher helps Penney obtain a new identity so he can start a new life. The story has appeared in \"Fresh Blood 3\" (1999), an anthology of mystery short stories edited by Mike Ripley and Maxim Jakubowski, and in \"Thriller\" (2006), a short story anthology of thrillers written by International Thrillers, Inc. members and edited by James Patterson.\n\nThis novella, published in 2013, opens on 13 July 1977 with an almost seventeen year old Reacher stopping by in New York in the middle of a heat wave to visit his brother at West Point when he encounters a woman (Jill Hemingway) being assaulted by a man. He drives off the man after a small scuffle, only to learn that the man is Croselli, one of the mob bosses of New York City. Croselli had slapped Hemingway for wearing a wire tape, and from this he deduced that Hemingway was an FBI agent. Hemingway warns him to leave the city before midnight or else Croselli would have his men kill him. They then part ways.\n\nReacher then meets a brunette, Chrissie at a coffee shop and they agree to go CBGB together using Chrissie's car. Inside the club they find Hemingway along with one of Croselli's henchmen, who promptly calls his boss on seeing Reacher. Meanwhile, Reacher gets to know that Jill Hemingway had been suspended from the FBI, pending review as part of the deal cut by Croselli with the FBI and that she was planning to bring him down. Reacher takes care of the henchman, just before a power outage strikes, before making his escape with Chrissie.\n\nChrissie and Reacher then make out in her car, when they encounter the Son of Sam, a serial killer who killed couples making out in cars. Son of Sam couldn't see Chrissie and leaves, but not before Reacher gets a good look at his posture and mannerisms.\n\nReacher and Chrissie then meet Hemingway outside Croselli's hideout. Hemingway informs Reacher that due to the outage, Croselli's men were out protecting various businesses that paid him money, from looters and plunderers, leaving Croselli alone in his warren. Chrissie and Reacher part ways and then Reacher breaks into the hideout to take care of Croselli but not before he gets him to profess his various crimes on tape. Reacher leaves Croselli tied to a chair with the tape at his feet and Hemingway calls in the FBI.\n\nHemingway also makes a call to the New York Police Department about the Son of Sam based on the description given to her by Reacher. They then go to a motel where Jill dies of a myocardial infarction. Reacher leaves the motel after informing the police of her death.\n\nThe story ends with the Son of Sam being apprehended 28 days after the outage, based on Reacher's description.\n\nThis story was initially released exclusively in the eBook format.\n\nA short story published as part of the UK hardback edition of \"Never Go Back\", the story is told from the perspective of a female detective investigating an alleged shooting. Reacher, while in hospital, relates the events prior to the story beginning. This was also included in the June–July 2012 \"Esquire\" magazine. This story was also included as a small book with the Blu-ray release of the movie \"\", released February 2017 in the US. The book is 5.5x6.75 inches, 10 pages long, with a few illustrations, some color, some black and white.\n\nHitchhiking in Maine near the Canada–US border, Reacher is picked up by a trio of Canadians who claim to be outdoor enthusiasts. At the end of the road trip, Reacher parts ways with his companions and finds himself near a hiking trail sealed off by the US Army under mysterious circumstances. Reacher subsequently investigates the closure of the trail when one of the Canadians returns to seek his help.\n\nThis short story, co written by Lee Child and Joseph Finder, opens with Jack Reacher encountering two men, Nick Heller, a private spy and Jerry DeLong, a forensic accountant. Reacher and Heller soon find out that the chief enforcer for the Albanian mafia in Boston, Alex Dushku (also known as \"Allie Boy\"), will soon arrive to meet DeLong whom he is coercing into giving one of his enterprises a clean chit in a purported audit to be conducted by DeLong. Outside the bar, Reacher and Heller beat Dushku unconscious and steal his bribe money, which they then split between themselves before parting ways. DeLong, not having received the bribe money, is no longer under contractual obligation to carry out the subterfuge.\n\nThis story is set in 1989, when Jack Reacher is serving as an officer in the military police. A young lieutenant colonel in a stylish handmade uniform roars through the damp woods of Georgia in her new silver Porsche, until she meets a very tall soldier with a broken-down car.\n\nThis story takes place in Manhattan's Flatiron District. Jack Reacher has an unusual encounter in a diner reminiscent of the Edward Hopper painting \"Nighthawks\". It was part of the Mystery Writers' Guild anthology \"Manhattan Mayhem\" edited by Mary Higgins Clark.\n\nThis anthology includes a novella, \"Too Much Time\", and the short stories\"Deep Down\", \"Everyone Talks\", \"Guy Walks into a Bar\", \"High Heat\", \"James Penney’s New Identity\" (the original version which is longer), \"Maybe They Have a Tradition\", \"No Room at the Motel\", \"Not a Drill\", \"Second Son\", \"Small Wars\", and \"The Picture of the Lonely Diner\".\n\nJack Reacher, ex-military drifter of no fixed abode, is stalked and tracked down by an FBI agent. She tells him that in a house raid in Sydney, Australian law enforcement found a list. There were four people on it, including him. The other three are dead. Hours later, Reacher is in the air, on his way to Sydney. What was the evil buried 25 years ago that has now resurfaced? Will Reacher be able to find the killers before they find him?\n\n\nThe series has sold over 60 million copies.\n\nParamount Pictures hired Academy Award nominated screenwriter Josh Olson to adapt \"One Shot\", under the title \"Jack Reacher\". Christopher McQuarrie, Oscar-winning screenwriter for \"The Usual Suspects\" was then brought in to re-write Olson's draft. It was announced in July 2011 that Tom Cruise - a 5'7\" tall actor - would play Reacher, who is 6'5\" tall in the books. Lee Child was quoted as saying, \"Reacher's size in the books is a metaphor for an unstoppable force, which Cruise portrays in his own way.\" All Jack Reacher books have been optioned for film.\n\nIt was announced in September 2014 that Tom Cruise reprise the role in the sequel \"\", which would adapt the 18th novel \"Never Go Back\". Christopher McQuarrie did not direct, due to other commitments with another Cruise film, \"\", and was replaced with Edward Zwick. The film was released October 21, 2016.\n\nOn November 6, 2018 Lee Child announced during a Writers On A New England Stage interview at the Portsmouth (New Hampshire) Music Hall’s \"Historic Theater\" that there will not be a third Jack Reacher movie and instead Netflix will be creating a Jack Reacher series, with different casting in the lead role.\n\nAll of the Jack Reacher novels have been released in audio version in MP3 format. The most consistent narrator for these is Dick Hill.\n"}

{"id": "225534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225534", "title": "Languages of East Asia", "text": "Languages of East Asia\n\nThe languages of East Asia belong to several distinct language families, with many common features attributed to interaction. In the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, Chinese varieties and languages of southeast Asia share many areal features, tending to be analytic languages with similar syllable and tone structure. In the 1st millennium AD, Chinese culture came to dominate East Asia. Literary Chinese was adopted by scholars in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. There was a massive influx of Chinese vocabulary into these and other neighboring languages. The Chinese script was also adapted to write Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese, though in the first two the use of Chinese characters is now restricted to university learning, linguistic or historical study, artistic or decorative works and (in Korean's case) newspapers.\n\nThe Austroasiatic languages include Vietnamese and Khmer, as well as many other languages spoken in areas scattered as far afield as Malaya and eastern India, often in isolated pockets surrounded by the ranges of other language groups. Most linguists believe that Austroasiatic languages once ranged continuously across southeast Asia and that their scattered distribution today is the result of the subsequent arrival of other language groups.\n\nOne of these groups were the Tai–Kadai languages such as Thai, Lao and Shan. These languages were originally spoken in southern China, where the greatest diversity within the family is still found, and possibly as far north as the Yangtze valley. As Chinese civilization expanded southward from the North China Plain, many Tai–Kadai speakers became sinicized, while others were displaced to Southeast Asia. With the exception of Zhuang, most of the Tai–Kadai languages still remaining in China are spoken in isolated upland areas.\n\nThe Miao–Yao or Hmong–Mien languages also originated in southern China, where they are now spoken only in isolated hill regions. Many Hmong–Mien speakers were displaced into Southeast Asia during the Qing Dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries, triggered by the suppression of a series of revolts in Guizhou.\n\nThe Austronesian languages are believed to have spread from Taiwan to the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, as well as some areas of mainland southeast Asia.\n\nThe varieties of Chinese are usually included in the Sino-Tibetan family, which also includes Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in Tibet, southwest China, northeast India, Burma and neighbouring countries.\n\nTo the north are the Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic language families, which some linguists had grouped as an Altaic family, sometimes also including the Korean and Japonic languages, but is now seen as a discredited theory and is no longer supported by specialists in these languages. The languages tend to be atonal, polysyllabic and agglutinative, with subject–object–verb word order and some degree of vowel harmony. Critics of the Altaic hypothesis attribute the similarities to intense language contact between the languages that occurred sometime in pre-history.\n\nChinese scholars often group Tai–Kadai and Hmong–Mien with Sino-Tibetan, but Western scholarship since the Second World War has considered them as separate families. Some larger groupings have been proposed, but are not widely supported. The Austric hypothesis, based on morphology and other resemblances, is that Austroasiatic, Austronesian, often Tai–Kadai, and sometimes Hmong–Mien form a genetic family. Other hypothetical groupings include the Sino-Austronesian languages and Austro-Tai languages. Linguists undergoing long-range comparison have hypothesized even larger macrofamilies such as Dené–Caucasian, including Sino-Tibetan and Ket.\n\nThe Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the Sino-Tibetan, Hmong–Mien (or Miao–Yao), Tai-Kadai, Austronesian (represented by Chamic) and Austro–Asiatic families. Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar typological features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion.\n\nCharacteristic of many MSEA languages is a particular syllable structure involving monosyllabic morphemes, lexical tone, a fairly large inventory of consonants, including phonemic aspiration, limited clusters at the beginning of a syllable, plentiful vowel contrasts and relatively few final consonants. Languages in the northern part of the area generally have fewer vowel and final contrasts but more initial contrasts.\n\nA well-known feature is the similar tone systems in Chinese, Hmong–Mien, Tai languages and Vietnamese. Most of these languages passed through an earlier stage with three tones on most syllables (apart from checked syllables ending in a stop consonant), which was followed by a tone split where the distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants disappeared but in compensation the number of tones doubled.\nThese parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages, until Haudricourt showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature, by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the Mon–Khmer family, and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.\n\nMSEA languages tend to have monosyllabic morphemes, though there are exceptions. Most MSEA languages are very analytic, with no inflection and little derivational morphology. Grammatical relations are typically signalled by word order, particles and coverbs or adpositions. Modality is expressed using sentence-final particles. The usual word order in MSEA languages is subject–verb–object. Chinese and Karen are thought to have changed to this order from the subject–object–verb order retained by most other Sino-Tibetan languages.\nThe order of constituents within a noun phrase varies: noun–modifier order is usual in Tai languages, Vietnamese and Miao, while in Chinese varieties and Yao most modifiers are placed before the noun. Topic-comment organization is also common.\n\nLanguages of both eastern and southeast Asia typically have well-developed systems of numeral classifiers. The neighbouring Bengali language has numerical classifiers, even though it is an Indo-European language which do not share the other features discussed in this article. Bengali also lacks gender, unlike most Indo-European languages. Bengali (especially the eastern variety) is more phonologically similar to southeastern and eastern languages than those further away from the region, with alveolar consonants replacing the retroflex consonants characteristic of other Indo-Aryan languages. Some dialects bordering southeast Asia such as Chittagonian have even developed phonemic tone. The other areas of the world where numerical classifier systems are common in indigenous languages are the western parts of North and South America, so that numerical classifiers could even be seen as a pan-Pacific Rim areal feature. However, similar noun class systems are also found among most Sub-Saharan African languages.\n\nFor most of the pre-modern period, Chinese culture dominated East Asia. Scholars in Vietnam, Korea and Japan wrote in Literary Chinese and were thoroughly familiar with the Chinese classics. Their languages absorbed large numbers of Chinese words, known collectively as Sino-Xenic vocabulary, i.e. Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean and Sino-Vietnamese. These words were written with Chinese characters and pronounced in a local approximation of Middle Chinese.\n\nToday, these words of Chinese origin may be written in the traditional Chinese characters (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), simplified Chinese characters (Chinese, Japanese), a locally developed phonetic script (Korean hangul, Japanese kana), or a Latin alphabet (Vietnamese). The Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages are collectively referred to as CJKV, or just CJK, since modern Vietnamese is no longer written with Chinese characters at all.\n\nIn a similar way to the use of Latin and ancient Greek roots in English, the morphemes of Classical Chinese have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts. These coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages. They have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form.\n\nIn topic–comment constructions, sentences are frequently structured with a topic as the first segment and a comment as the second. This way of marking previously mentioned vs. newly introduced information is an alternative to articles, which are not found in East Asian languages. The Topic–comment sentence structure is a legacy of Classical Chinese influence on the grammar of modern East Asian languages. In Classical Chinese, the focus of the phrase (i.e. the topic) was often placed first, which was then followed by a statement about the topic. The most generic sentence form in Classical Chinese is \"A B 也\", where \"B\" is a comment about the topic \"A\".\n\n\"Classical Chinese example\":\n\n\"Mandarin Chinese example\":\n\n\"Cantonese example\":\n\n\"Hokkien example\":\n\n\"Japanese example\":\n\n\"Okinawan Ryukyuan example\":\n\nNote that in Okinawan, the topic marker is indicated by lengthening the short vowels and adding -oo to words ending in -N/-n. For words ending in long vowels, the topic is introduced only by や.\n\n\"The epistolary style of Japanese (Sōrōbun) example\":\n\n\"The Standard Meiji-Era Written Style of Japanese (Meiji Futsūbun) example\":\n\n\"Korean example\":\n\n\"Korean mixed script example\":\n\n\"Vietnamese example\":\n\nLinguistic systems of politeness, including frequent use of honorifics, with varying levels of politeness or respect, are well-developed in Japanese and Korean. Politeness systems in Chinese are relatively weak, having simplified from a more developed system into a much less predominant role in modern Chinese. This is especially true when speaking of the southern Chinese varieties. However, Vietnamese has retained a highly complex system of pronouns, in which the terms mostly derive from Chinese. For example, \"bác\", \"chú\", \"dượng\", and \"cậu\" are all terms ultimately derived from Chinese and all refer to different statuses of \"uncle\".\n\nIn many of the region's languages, including Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Malay/Indonesian, new personal pronouns or forms of reference or address can and often do evolve from nouns as fresh ways of expressing respect or social status. Thus personal pronouns are open class words rather than closed class words: they are not stable over time, not few in number, and not clitics whose use is obligatory in grammatical constructs.\n\nWith modernization and other trends, politeness language is evolving to be simpler. Avoiding the need for complex polite language can also motivate use in some situations of languages like Indonesian or English that have less complex respect systems.\n\n\n"}

They traveled near the headwaters of the Owens River, and found some hardened red igneous rock that may have had a large amount of gold in it. One of the men kept the ore, but was dying of tuberculosis in 1860, so gave the ore to a Doctor Randall in payment, along with a rough location of it. In miner's parlance of the era, the red igneous rock was known as \"cement\", hence the name of the lost mine.\n\nDoctor Randall and his assistant Gid Whiteman spent years looking for the ore in the pumice hills to the south and west of Deadman Summit. News of the search leaked out to the mining communities near Mono Lake. This news caused a frenzy of furtive searching. Mark Twain was near Mono Lake and joined in the search, which was documented in his book \"Roughing It\".\n\nJames Wright wrote a series of newspaper articles about the search in 1879.

The high regional diversity results from the mutual isolation of Alpine communities. In the Alps, the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and paganism has been an ambivalent one. While some customs survived only in the remote valleys inaccessible to the church's influence, other customs were actively assimilated over the centuries. In light of the dwindling rural population of the Alps, many customs have evolved into more modern interpretations.\n\nAround September 8, the feast of the Nativity of Mary, it is customary to bring the cattle down from the upland pastures for the winter. In Bavaria, women weave fir wreaths decorated with paper roses and small mirrors to ward off demons during the downhill journey. It has been suggested that this derives from end-of-summer festivals in honor of the Germanic goddess Iðunn.\n\nThe word \"Krampus\" originates from the Old High German word for claw (\"Krampen\"). In the Alpine regions, the Krampus is a mythical horned figure represented as accompanying Saint Nicholas. Krampus acts as an anti–Saint Nicholas, who, instead of giving gifts to good children, gives warnings and punishments to the bad children. Traditionally, young men dress up as the Krampus in the first two weeks of December, particularly in the evening of December 5, and roam the streets frightening children and women with rusty chains and whips and bells. This figure is believed to originate from stories of house spirits such as kobolds or elves.\n\nOriginally, the word \"Perchten\" (plural of \"Perchta\") referred to the female masks representing the entourage of an ancient goddess, \"Frau Perchta\", or \"Pehta Baba\" as it is known in Slovenia. Some claim a connection to the Nordic goddess Freyja, though this is uncertain. Traditionally, the masks were displayed in processions (\"Perchtenlauf\") during the last week of December and first week of January, and particularly on January 6. The costume consists of a brown wooden mask and brown or white sheep's skin. In recent times Krampus and Perchten have increasingly been displayed in a single event, leading to a loss of distinction of the two. Perchten are associated with midwinter and the embodiment of fate and the souls of the dead. The name originates from the Old High German word \"peraht\" (\"brilliant\" or \"bright\").\n\nSometimes, \"der Teufel\" is viewed to be the most \"schiach\" (\"ugly\") Percht (masculine singular of \"Perchten\") and \"Frau Perchta\" to be the most \"schön\" (\"beautiful\") Perchtin (female singular of \"Perchten\").\n\nChalandamarz is an ancient festival celebrated by the Romansh speaking part of the Swiss Canton Graubünden. It is celebrated on the first of March and marks the end of winter and the arrival of spring. Its object is to scare away the evil spirits of winter and wake up the good spirits of spring.\n\nThe Badalisc is a \"good\" mythological animal who lives in the woods of Andrista, in Val Camonica, Italy. During an annual town festival someone dresses up as the creature and is \"captured\" and brought to the town. The animal is made to tell the people of the town gossip. At the end of the festival the creature is released until the next year's ceremony.\n\n\n"}

A mixed commercial, residential, and leisure project is currently under construction on the island, expected to be completed in 2020. Saadiyat Island is expected to become Abu Dhabi's cultural centre, mostly for the Island’s Cultural District that is expected to include eight museums.\n\nThe island is five-minute drive away from downtown Abu Dhabi, 20 minutes from Abu Dhabi International Airport, and one hour from Dubai.\n\nThe project is being developed by the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority-held Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC). The company plans is to dispose of development to private investors that will work on their sites in accordance with the master plan as well as other ground rules. The plan for Saadiyat island was done by EDAW and continued under AECOM.\n\nThe Island is located 500 meters off the coast of Abu Dhabi. An entire district on the island is devoted to culture and the arts, with exhibitions, permanent collections, productions and performances.\n\nIn developing the island project, the close cooperation model is being followed by TDIC and the government agencies. The government-related entity has been working in cooperation with government agencies such as the Department of Transport to create an integrated project, complete with public amenities, in a relatively short period of time. Such close cooperation reassures smaller, private developers, who follow the GRE by providing smaller-scale works like shops, entertainment venues or real estate developments, which in turn attract a full-time resident community.\n\nThe island has several cultural institutions in Saadiyat Cultural District.\n\nThe Saadiyat Accommodation Village, opened in 2009, is a modern housing community that offers social, recreational and educational facilities for residents.\n\nThe European Union has sent several delegations to Saadiyat Accommodation Village to meet with representatives from the TDIC.\n\nIn May 2009, Gulf Ultra Luxury Faction issued a report accusing the contractors working on Saadiyat Island of violating the rights of workers on the site by charging them fees to obtain their work contracts, paying them less than they were promised, and holding their passports to prevent their resignation or departure. The report also called on western partners (including Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, the French Museum Agency, and New York University) to seek contractual assurances that these violations would not continue once construction on facilities for those institutions was underway. The alleged violations of the workers' rights would also constitute violations of United Arab Emirates law. The activist group Gulf Labor, which has staged protests at the Solomon R.

The Zayed National Museum, designed by architect Norman Foster of Foster and Partners, was set to open in 2016. The Guggenheim, by Frank Gehry, is slated to open in 2017.\n\nEach of these institutions will represent a significant attraction in its own right. However, the Louvre and the Guggenheim will be the major draws.\n\nManarat Al Saadiyat (), the building designed to host temporary taster exhibitions for the planned museums, hosts the Saadiyat Experience, a permanent exhibition that introduces the plans for the development Of Saadiyat Island.\n\nZayed National Museum will center on a narrative linking the development of Abu Dhabi to the reign of its ruler (1966-2004) Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and to structures having themes of education, conservation, environmental sustainability, cultural heritage, humanitarianism and faith.\n\nLouvre Abu Dhabi will host the collection of the museum, designed by architect Jean Nouvel. ln the case of the former, the Saadiyat development will mark the first time the French government has entered into an international partnership to extend the Louvre overseas.\n\nThe local Louvre will mark the first time the French government has entered into an international partnership to extend the Louvre overseas. The 30-year agreement, signed in 2007, will see the loan of some 200–300 artworks over the period of the deal.\n\nGuggenheim Abu Dhabi, designed by Frank Gehry, will display contemporary art and culture items that represent the most important modern artistic achievements. At 30,000 sq metres, it is planned to be the largest of the Guggenheim museums. The museum will join Bilbao, Venice and New York in hosting the prestigious foundation.\n\nA maritime museum will be devoted to explaining the maritime ecosystem and heritage of Abu Dhabi and sea-related Emirati professions. The architecture of the museum reflects Emirati construction and decoration. The ceiling of the museum will picture the sky and the sea merging into one another. Wind, as one of the natural factors that shape the history of the UAE in general, will also be pictured. The main part of the project will be an underground basin, a traditional sailboat and the boat \"Zayed Memorial\", which crossed the Atlantic in 2007 for humanitarian purposes.\n\nThe arts center consists of five theaters, an opera house and several arenas for musical concerts. The center also has an experimental theater, the Abu Dhabi Performing Arts Academy with 3,557 square metres of space for educational activities about art, design, music and drama. The center also has shops and restaurants on a surface of 28,692 square metres.\n\nSchools under development include the Redwood Saadiyat Nursery by the first Kids Group, Cranleigh Abu Dhabi, and New York University Abu Dhabi by Mubadala Investment Company, providing education from pre-school to university level. The nursery school was set to open in 2013 to accommodate up to 140 children, offering educational and recreational facilities for pre-school education and using the Montessori method.\n\nCranleigh Abu Dhabi opened in 2014, and subsequently won the 'British International School of the Year' award in 2017.\n\nThe Marina, the Island's main commercial area, has a total area of , berthing for over 1,000 boats, hotels, apartments, leisure and entertainment facilities including the Maritime Museum by Japan's Tadao Ando, commercial and retail space, and the New York University Abu Dhabi campus was planned to move to Saadiyat Marina in 2014 from its provisional campus in downtown Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe primary contractors for the island are Al Jaber for Villa and HILALCO for Road and Infrastructures.\n\n\n"}

Gans, in the journal \"Ethnic and Racial Studies\".\n\nThe development of symbolic ethnicity, as a sociological phenomenon, is attributed to mainly to ethnic European immigrants of second and subsequent generations, because \"Black, Hispanic, Asian and Indian Americans do not have the option of a symbolic ethnicity, at present, in the United States\"; a socio-economic circumstance \"in which ethnicity does not matter for white Americans, [yet] it does matter for non-whites\".\nIn the U.S., symbolic ethnicity is an important component of American cultural identity, assumed as \"a voluntary, personally chosen identity marker, rather than the totally ascribed characteristic\" determined by physical appearance. As a sociological phenomenon, symbolic ethnicity is attributed to Americans of European ancestry, most of whom either are influenced by or assimilated to the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) community.\n\nAs such, symbolic ethnicity is the process of social identity whereby the person's \"ethnic identity is solely associated with iconic elements of the culture\" from which he or she originated. Gans's investigations concentrated on the latter generations of Roman Catholic and Jewish Americans who had \"begun to re-associate themselves with their ethnic culture\", noting that \"the ethnic associations were mainly symbolic, and that the traditional community interactions were lost\". Those Catholic and Jewish Americans identified \"their ethnic race in a personal perspective, as opposed to a communal\" perspective, which actions produced an \"outward ethnic identity that uses superficial symbols and icons to label and categorize a certain race\". That is to say, people identify their ethnicity by way of images from the mass communications media, as accepted through past associations derived from social and historical judgements.\n\nIn \"(E)race: Symbolic Ethnicity and the Asian Image\" (1993), Stephen Lee describes symbolic ethnicity:\nIn the book \"Identity and Belonging: Rethinking Race and Ethnicity in Canadian Society\" (2006), by B. Singh Bolaria and Sean P. Hier, symbolic ethnicity is defined by, with, and in the actions of \"individuals who identify as Irish, for example, on occasions such as Saint Patrick's Day, on family holidays, or for vacations. They do not usually belong to Irish-American organizations, live in Irish neighborhoods, work in Irish jobs, or marry other Irish people.\" Therefore, the symbolic identity of \"being Irish\" is:\nIn terms of the derogatory term Plastic Paddy used to describe symbolic ethnicity in the Irish diaspora, Hickman (2002) states that the use of this term was \"a part of the process by which the second-generation Irish are positioned as inauthentic within the two identities, of Englishness and Irishness... The message from each is that second-generation Irish are 'really English' and many of the second-generation resist this.\" This perspective suggests that symbolic ethnicity is a result of assimilation and some assimilated individuals may prefer to explore a culture that they may not have been raised with to a significant extent.\n\nMany displays of what could be argued to be symbolic ethnicity, such as the study of Scottish Gaelic by the Scottish diaspora in North America, do not necessarily conform to the stereotype of individuals feeling entitled to a cultural ethnicity due to ancestry. Most Gaelic learners in one study, even those with Scottish ancestry, stated that Gaelic ethnic identity was not related to ancestry.\n\n\n"}

Barnaart was an amateur scientist who had a great interest in astronomy and wanted to build a state-of-the-art astronomical observatory on the roof of the Oval Room. This proved to be a bad idea, because the roof was made of wood, which transfers too many vibrations to make reliable and precise observations. Hence a belvedère was built instead, a square tower with two doors in each wall. \n\nThough the observatory couldn't be used for precision measurements, it was still used for manual observations. The collection of the Teylers physical cabinet contains several telescopes and other devices that were used. Until 1817 the observatory also had a camera obscura, which was used for drawings of the view from the little tower. Though they have not survived, the Teylers archives have evidence that Vincent Jansz van der Vinne was paid 86 guilders for painting the \"walls and ceilings of the cupula\". That was not the only artwork that early stargazers met with when they climbed the stairs. On the rooftop of the first staircase a vase was installed that was delivered by Jan Woortman in 1781. Though lost since, the vase can be seen in the painting of the courtyard of the Foundation house by Wybrand Hendriks. The vase was the trademark of Teyler, and is visible on the top of Van Marum's electrostatic generator as well.\n\nThe observatory can be reached via a staircase from the Grote Herenkamer (large board room), which is located next to the Oval Room. That staircase leads the visitor to the lower roof, where a steep open air wooden staircase leads to the small room on top of the dome. For precision measurements, a new observatorium was built in the garden, that was later used as a studio by the later curator Jan van Borssum Buisman.\n"}

When he objects, another letter informs him that the time has been moved to midnight.\n\nTrue to form, on the final stroke of midnight a mysterious killer in a heavy black cloak and hood shoots him dead with a rather large pistol (\"how\" dead he is, though, is a matter of question), and a police officer (voiced by Billy Bletcher, modeled on characters portrayed in film by Fred Kelsey) immediately begins to investigate. After investigating the premises and the staff, the officer gives a lengthy chase to the real killer, finding the mansion to be filled with many surreal pitfalls, strange characters—including a red skeleton, a parody of Red Skelton—and booby traps that slow and obstruct him. He eventually traps the killer and unmasks him, revealing him to be the opening-sequence host, who confesses \"I dood it\"—one of Skelton's catchphrases—before bursting into tears.\n"}

In 1820 the family were living at 54 Bristo Street in the city. In 1823 he entered the Edinburgh High School, and, after working for a short time in a lawyer's office, matriculated in November 1829, when just turned 14, at the University of Edinburgh. He took no degree as a student.\n\nInitially, Hodgson employed himself in lecturing on literature, education, and phrenology at towns in Fife. On 1 June 1839 he was appointed secretary to the Mechanics' Institute of Liverpool. He was offered the editorship of a Liverpool newspaper in 1841, and that of a Manchester newspaper somewhat later, but declined both. In 1844, on Hodgson's advice, a girls' school was added to the Liverpool Institute, and in the same year he was appointed Principal. On 11 March 1846, he received an honorary LL.D. from the University of Glasgow.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1851, Hodgson was principal of the Chorlton High School, Manchester. In 1848, he argued for the education of women at the Royal Institution of Manchester. In 1851, he travelled abroad, remaining in Paris from October 1851 to July 1852. In 1853 he returned to Edinburgh, giving lectures on physiology, having qualified himself by attending the classes at the College of Surgeons. Because of his work in the field of education, he served in 1849 and again in 1864 as vice-president of the College of Preceptors (College of Teachers).\n\nIn 1854 he lectured at the Royal Institution, London, on economic science and, in 1858, he was appointed an assistant commissioner to the inquiry into primary education, moving to London. He was examiner in political economy to London University from 1863 to 1868, and was appointed to the council of University College. As a member of council, Hodgson seconded the confirmation of James Martineau to the vacant chair of mental philosophy; he resigned his seat on the council on 19 January 1867, when George Grote successfully argued for George Croom Robertson over the Unitarian Martineau.\n\nIn 1870 Hodgson retired to Bournemouth, but in the following year (17 July 1871) he was appointed to the new Chair of political economy and mercantile law at the University of Edinburgh. He frequently attended the social science congresses, acting at Norwich in 1873 as president of the educational section. In 1875, he was made president of the Educational Institute of Scotland. In his political outlook, Hodgson was strongly Liberal, but he took little active part in politics. He settled at Bonaly Tower, Colinton, a Scottish baronial house built by Lord Cockburn.\n\nHodgson died of heart disease in Brussels while attending the educational congress there on 24 August 1880. He was buried at the Grange cemetery, Edinburgh. The grave lies above the central vaults, towards the west, and is the closest to the path.\n\nHe married, first (in 1841), Jane Cox of Liverpool, who died without issue on 1 July 1860; and secondly (on 14 January 1863), Emily Walmsley (1829-1919), second daughter of Sir Joshua Walmsley of Liverpool, who survived him, with two sons and two daughters.\n\nHis son, Alexander Ireland Hodgson (1874-1958) is buried with William.\n\nHe published: \n\nPosthumous was \"Errors in the Use of English\", Edinburgh, 1881, edited by his widow. He contributed a preface and notes to Horace Mann's \"Report of an Educational Tour in Germany, &c.\", 1846; edited, with Henry James Slack, the memorial edition (1865, &c.) of the \"Works\" of William Johnson Fox; and translated \"Count Cavour's Thoughts on Ireland\", &c., 1868.\n\n"}
