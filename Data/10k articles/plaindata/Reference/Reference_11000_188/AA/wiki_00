During the Italian Middle Ages it was the name given to a military captain in charge of keeping peace and justice (hence \"Captain of justice\") during riots and uproars. In Florence he was usually hired from a foreign city to prevent any appearance of favoritism on the part of the Captain. The position could be compared with that of a current Chief of police. The name Bargello was extended to the building which was the office of the captain.\n\nConstruction began in 1255. The palace was built to house first the Capitano del Popolo and later, in 1261, the 'podestà', the highest magistrate of the Florence City Council. This Palazzo del Podestà, as it was originally called, is the oldest public building in Florence. This austere crenellated building served as model for the construction of the Palazzo Vecchio. In 1574, the Medici dispensed with the function of the \"Podestà\" and housed the \"bargello\", the police chief of Florence, in this building, hence its name. It was employed as a prison; executions took place in the Bargello's yard until they were abolished by Grand Duke Peter Leopold in 1786, but it remained the headquarters of the Florentine police until 1859. When Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor Peter Leopold was exiled, the makeshift Governor of Tuscany decided that the Bargello should no longer be a jail, and it then became a national museum.\n\nThe original two-storey structure was built alongside the Volognana Tower in 1256. The third storey, which can be identified by the smaller blocks used to construct it, was added after the fire of 1323. The building is designed around an open courtyard with an external staircase leading to the second floor. An open well is found in the centre of the courtyard.\n\nThe Bargello opened as a national museum (\"Museo Nazionale del Bargello\") in 1865, displaying the largest Italian collection of gothic and Renaissance sculptures (14–17th century).\n\nThe museum houses masterpieces by Michelangelo, such as his \"Bacchus\", \"Pitti Tondo\" (or \"Madonna and Child\"), \"Brutus\" and \"David-Apollo\". Its collection includes Donatello's \"David\" and \"St. George Tabernacle\"\n, Vincenzo Gemito's \"Pescatore\" (\"fisherboy\"), Jacopo Sansovino's \"Bacchus\", Giambologna's \"Architecture\" and his \"Mercury\" and many works from the Della Robbia family. Benvenuto Cellini is represented with his bronze bust of Cosimo I. There are a few works from the Baroque period, notably Gianlorenzo Bernini's 1636-7 \"Bust of Costanza Bonarelli\".\n\nThe museum also has a fine collection of ceramics (maiolica), textile, tapestries, ivory, silver, armour and coins. The formerly lost right-hand panel of the Franks Casket is held by the museum. It also features the competing designs for \"The Sacrifice of Isaac\" (\"Sacrificio di Isacco\") that were made by Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi to win the contest for the second set of doors of the Florence Baptistery (1401).\n\nHonolulu Hale's interior courtyard, staircase, and open ceiling were modeled after the Bargello. \n\nThe Islamic Hall at the Bargello was set up in 1982 by Marco Spallanzani and Giovanni Curatola at the direction of Paola Barocchi and Giovanna Gaeta Bertelà, then the director.\n"}

The initial goal was to facilitate the creation of 'interoperable network management products'. The first approved standard was the 'OSI/NM Forum Protocol Specification,' an extension of OSI protocols developed since the late 1970s.\n\nThe direct development towards the Business Process Framework (eTOM), as Brenner (2007) explained, was \"the Telecom Operation Map (TOM) was first published in 2001. The goal of TOM was the creation of an industry-owned framework of business processes, including the definition of a common enterprise-independent terminology for service management. It was also supposed to serve as a basis for discussing the scope of information management necessary for the execution of the processes. The result of this latter effort has meanwhile spawned its own TMF document family, the Shared Information and Data Model (SID). \n\nThe Telecom Operation Map (TOM) was extended in 2001 to eTOM, an acronym for Enhanced Telecom Operations Map. The process model eTOm was renamed \"Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM),\" and in 2013 to \"Business Process Framework (eTOM).\" \n\nThere have been many versions of eTOM. Version 14 was published in May 2014. It also has been developed into a component of NGOSS, which has been renamed Frameworx.\n\nThe Business Process Framework model consists of processes at 5 levels:\nThese levels form a hierarchy, with each level encapsulating a group of processes at the next level of detail.\n\nThe graphic representation of a Business Process Framework (eTOM) model consists of rows and columns, the intersections of which denote specific business processes. \nIn this manner the Business Process Framework map covers the whole value chain. The map also indicates the interaction between processes.\n\nBusiness Process Framework (eTOM) processes fall into three major process areas, as shown in the diagram: \n\n\n\n"}

It replaces and expands upon an earlier rulebook entitled \"Sword and Fist\".\n\n\"Complete Warrior\" presents additional rules and advice for the creation and use of character classes which specialize in melee and ranged combat. It also provides a catchall for anything that doesn't fit into \"Complete Adventurer\", \"Complete Divine\", \"Complete Arcane\", or \"Complete Psionic\".\n\nThe Hexblade mixes martial prowess with a unique curse ability, the ability to cast arcane spells and good resistance against spells and spell effects. Similar in concept to the sorcerer, the Hexblade is an individual who possesses unnatural jinxes or an evil eye, and uses it towards combat. With a d10 for hit points, a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement, and a very slow spell advancement, the hexblade is more like an arcane ranger or paladin than a bard.\n\nThe Samurai is a brave and noble warrior, possessing martial prowess and unique abilities to intimidate and terrify his opponents. Like the other classes, the Samurai has a d10 for hit points and a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement. The main drawback to playing a Samurai is the restrictions placed on the class. A Samurai cannot multiclass, then resume being a Samurai, some of his class abilities require him to use specific weaponry, and he is bound by the code of Bushido, which operates in a similar manner to the Paladin's code.\n\nThe Swashbuckler is a fighter that emphasizes finesse, style and flair, combining martial prowess with amazing acrobatics to outmaneuver opponents. With a d10 for hit points and a 1/1 base attack bonus advancement, the swashbuckler is an effective frontline fighter, and while the inability to wear medium or heavy armours makes the character vulnerable to counterattacks, some of the class features compensate. The ability to deal strength (weakness critical class feature) and constitution damage (wounding critical class feature), as well as the ability to charge in difficult terrains (acrobatic charge class feature) makes the swashbuckler a formidable opponent in any battle.\n\n\"Complete Warrior\" was written by Andy Collins, David Noonan, and Ed Stark, and was published in November 2003. Cover art is by Wayne Reynolds, with interior art by Brent Chumley, Ed Cox, Wayne England, Rebecca Guay-Mitchell, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, Ginger Kubic, John and Laura Lakey, David Martin, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Matt Mitchell, Steve Prescott, Wayne Reynolds, David Roach, Mark Smylie, Brian Snoddy, Ron Spencer, and Joel Thomas.\n\nAs this book is not intended only for fighters, David Noonan clarified that \"Complete Warrior\" would be useful for: \"In short, anybody who makes attack rolls. That's often the fighter, of course, but there's something in \"Complete Warrior\" for the polymorphed wizard, the wild-shaped druid, and any number of archetypes who don't trundle around in heavy armor heaving a big battleaxe.\"\n\n"}

The books typically contain photos of all the people who were aboard during the cruise, usually grouped by their division or department. There are often candid photos as well, showing the people at work aboard the ship. Often there is a map or a description of the ship's travels during the cruise, and there are almost always pictures taken at the various ports of call.\n\nOn large ships, the books are produced on board by the ship's Morale, Welfare and Recreation department and Public Affairs staff, and are then printed ashore by printing companies that specialize in such services. The cruise book of a \"Nimitz\"-class aircraft carrier typically reaches over 600 pages in length, as it includes portraits of the more than 5,000 sailors and U.S. Marines assigned to the ship's company and embarked carrier air wing.\n\nCruise books of smaller ships are typically much smaller, often 50–100 pages, and are produced informally by volunteers. They are printed ashore by the same companies that specialize in cruise book publication firms that also handle the larger ships.\n\nUSMC units also have a long-standing tradition of doing cruise books for deployments. Many units do so remotely from their deployed location, allowing them to proof the books prior to final printing. This is usually done by allowing the publisher to maintain a website where the pages are displayed to be viewed by anyone in the unit and then giving feedback. \n\nThe Navy Department Library has a collection of over 8,000 cruise books and similar Navy yearbooks, dating from the Spanish–American War to the present. Cruise books from many Seabee units are included in the collection. The Navy Department Library accepts donations of cruise books from all time periods.\n\nPrivate collectors exist throughout the world, with an example being a site run by Retired Command Master Chief Dillard. He has been collecting these books since the 1970s and is attempting to document every USN/USCG ship cruise book ever published. So far, he has determined that there have been at least 7,844 ship cruise books published. He has managed to have documented 3,965 of them and collected scans of the front covers of 5,797 of these cruise books. In addition to having 1,970 ship cruise books in his personal collection, he also has over 4,000 individual ship files—roughly seven file cabinets full—containing photos and other historical data.\n\n"}

The department houses the U.S. National Insect Collection, one of the largest entomological collections in the world, with over 35 million specimens housed in 132,354 drawers, 33,000 jars or vials, and 23,000 slides in more than 5,200 cabinets. The department also includes research scientists and technical staff from the Smithsonian Institution, the United States Department of Agriculture Systematic Entomology Lab (SEL) and United States Department of Defense Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (WRBU). \n\nPrior to 1862, the U. S. government’s entomological work for agriculture was handled by the United States Patent Office. With the establishment of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1862, the responsibility was transferred to the newly appointed USDA Chief Entomologist, Townend Glover. When he retired in 1877, he was succeeded by Charles Valentine Riley, who resigned in 1879 after a personal disagreement and was replaced with John Henry Comstock. Riley was reinstated as USDA Chief Entomologist in 1881, and was then also appointed Honorary Curator of the newly created Division of Insects at the United States National Museum (USNM). Although the USNM had been established in 1842. 4 years before the founding of the Smithsonian Institution, insufficient funding at the time led to the Smithsonian’s insect collection being distributed to collaborating scientists, with the understanding that the material could be reclaimed.\n\nIn the 1870s, the USDA became the repository for the Smithsonian insect collection, which was added to the USDA collection. Upon Riley’s appointment as Honorary Curator, the USDA insect collection was officially transferred to the USNM. The first salaried Smithsonian entomologist was the lepidopterist John B. Smith, who served as assistant curator from 1885 to April 1889. With the donation of Riley’s personal collection (by Riley's account, 115,000 pinned specimens, 2,850 vials of alcohol material, and 3,000 slides of minute insects, for an estimated total of 150,000 specimens and 20,000 species) in 1886, the USNM insect collection achieved status as a major entomological depository. Riley was succeeded as USDA Chief Entomologist and Honorary Curator by Leland Ossian Howard, who served until 1927. In 1925, taxonomic work was established as a separate Bureau of Entomology within USDA, and underwent a series of names and reorganizations before becoming the Systematic Entomology Laboratory in 1967. The Department of Defense joined in 1961 because of the impact of mosquito-borne disease on national defense and public health.\n\nThe U. S. National Insect Collection is the second largest insect collection in the world, with approximately 35 million specimens representing over 300,000 species. The collection includes over 100,000 holotypes and many additional paratypes and secondary types. The size and quality of the Nearctic and Neotropical collections are unparalleled, but there are specimens from all over the world, with especially strong representation from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The specimens represent approximately 60% of the known insect families, with especially strong collections of butterflies and moths, flies, mosquitoes, beetles, and wasps. The majority of the collection is pinned or point-mounted and stored dry in drawers, but there are also many specimens housed in alcohol, on slides, and in envelopes.\n\nThe entomological collections are primarily housed at the National Museum of Natural History in downtown Washington, DC (70%), the NMNH Museum Support Center (MSC) in Suitland, MD (20%), and the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Beltsville, MD (10%). The collections are loaned to qualified scientists and students around the world, and the department hosts visiting scientists who come to study the collections on-site. The department also houses the Entomology Illustration Archives, approximately 6000 illustrations originally created to support the department's research and publications but now housed and conserved separately as historically significant art objects. Recently, the Department of Entomology has also established a non-illustration archive for physical objects, field and laboratory research notebooks and materials, and for correspondence of entomology researchers and staff based at the NMNH from all three agencies, as well as similar items accompanying donated collections.\n\nAs of 2013, the combined Department of Entomology (including SI, USDA, and DOD ) employs about 80 permanent full-time staff and a variable number of research associates, postdoctoral and predoctoral fellows, students, and volunteers. The Smithsonian entomology staff includes 32 staff members, located at both the NMNH and the MSC in Suitland, MD. The USDA SEL entomology staff includes 36 staff, located at both the NMNH and the BARC in Beltsville, MD, and the WRBU entomology staff includes 6 staff members, located at the MSC in Suitland, MD.\n\nThe department supports and collaborates in the \"Butterflies + Plants: Partners in Evolution\" exhibit, indoor butterfly pavilion and outdoor butterfly habitat garden, the O. Orkin Insect Zoo, and the new Q?rius learning center, all located in or around the National Museum of Natural History.

{"id": "69123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69123", "title": "Forbidden City", "text": "Forbidden City\n\nThe Forbidden City is a palace complex in central Beijing, China. The former Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty (the years 1420 to 1912), it now houses the Palace Museum. The Forbidden City served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years.\n\nConstructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 hectares (over 180 acres). The palace exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.\n\nSince 1925, the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artifacts were built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Part of the museum's former collection is now in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Both museums descend from the same institution, but were split after the Chinese Civil War. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 15 million visitors annually, and received more than 16 million visitors in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe common English name \"Forbidden City\" is a translation of the Chinese name \"Zijin Cheng\" (). The name \"Zijin Cheng\" first formally appeared in 1576. Another English name of similar origin is \"Forbidden Palace\".\n\nThe name \"Zijin Cheng\" is a name with significance on many levels. \"Zi\", or \"Purple\", refers to the North Star, which in ancient China was called the \"Ziwei\" Star, and in traditional Chinese astrology was the heavenly abode of the Celestial Emperor. The surrounding celestial region, the Ziwei Enclosure (), was the realm of the Celestial Emperor and his family. The Forbidden City, as the residence of the terrestrial emperor, was its earthly counterpart. \"Jin\", or \"Forbidden\", referred to the fact that no one could enter or leave the palace without the emperor's permission. \"Cheng\" means a city.\n\nToday, the site is most commonly known in Chinese as \"Gùgōng\" (), which means the \"Former Palace\". The museum which is based in these buildings is known as the \"Palace Museum\" ().\n\nWhen Hongwu Emperor's son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor, he moved the capital from Nanjing to Beijing, and construction began in 1406 on what would become the Forbidden City.\n\nConstruction lasted 14 years and required more than a million workers. Material used include whole logs of precious \"Phoebe zhennan\" wood () found in the jungles of south-western China, and large blocks of marble from quarries near Beijing. The floors of major halls were paved with \"golden bricks\" (), specially baked paving bricks from Suzhou.\n\nFrom 1420 to 1644, the Forbidden City was the seat of the Ming dynasty. In April 1644, it was captured by rebel forces led by Li Zicheng, who proclaimed himself emperor of the Shun dynasty. He soon fled before the combined armies of former Ming general Wu Sangui and Manchu forces, setting fire to parts of the Forbidden City in the process.\n\nBy October, the Manchus had achieved supremacy in northern China, and a ceremony was held at the Forbidden City to proclaim the young Shunzhi Emperor as ruler of all China under the Qing dynasty.\nThe Qing rulers changed the names on some of the principal buildings, to emphasise \"Harmony\" rather than \"Supremacy\", made the name plates bilingual (Chinese and Manchu), and introduced Shamanist elements to the palace.\n\nIn 1860, during the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces took control of the Forbidden City and occupied it until the end of the war. In 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi fled from the Forbidden City during the Boxer Rebellion, leaving it to be occupied by forces of the treaty powers until the following year.\n\nAfter being the home of 24 emperors – 14 of the Ming dynasty and 10 of the Qing dynasty – the Forbidden City ceased being the political centre of China in 1912 with the abdication of Puyi, the last Emperor of China. Under an agreement with the new Republic of China government, Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use, until he was evicted after a coup in 1924.\nThe Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City in 1925.\nIn 1933, the Japanese invasion of China forced the evacuation of the national treasures in the Forbidden City.\nPart of the collection was returned at the end of World War II, but the other part was evacuated to Taiwan in 1948 under orders by Chiang Kai-shek, whose Kuomintang was losing the Chinese Civil War. This relatively small but high quality collection was kept in storage until 1965, when it again became public, as the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei.\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, some damage was done to the Forbidden City as the country was swept up in revolutionary zeal. During the Cultural Revolution, however, further destruction was prevented when Premier Zhou Enlai sent an army battalion to guard the city.\n\nThe Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO as the \"Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties\",\ndue to its significant place in the development of Chinese architecture and culture. It is currently administered by the Palace Museum, which is carrying out a sixteen-year restoration project to repair and restore all buildings in the Forbidden City to their pre-1912 state.\n\nIn recent years, the presence of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial. A Starbucks store that opened in 2000 sparked objections and eventually closed on 13 July 2007. Chinese media also took notice of a pair of souvenir shops that refused to admit Chinese citizens in order to price-gouge foreign customers in 2006.\n\nOn November 8, 2017, President of the United States Donald Trump was the first US President to be granted a state dinner in the Forbidden City since the founding of the People's Republic of China.\n\nThe Forbidden City is a rectangle, with from north to south and from east to west. It consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,886 bays of rooms. A common myth states that there are 9,999 rooms including antechambers, based on oral tradition, and it is not supported by survey evidence. The Forbidden City was designed to be the centre of the ancient, walled city of Beijing. It is enclosed in a larger, walled area called the Imperial City. The Imperial City is, in turn, enclosed by the Inner City; to its south lies the Outer City.\n\nThe Forbidden City remains important in the civic scheme of Beijing. The central north–south axis remains the central axis of Beijing. This axis extends to the south through Tiananmen gate to Tiananmen Square, the ceremonial centre of the People's Republic of China, and on to Yongdingmen. To the north, it extends through Jingshan Hill to the Bell and Drum Towers. This axis is not exactly aligned north–south, but is tilted by slightly more than two degrees. Researchers now believe that the axis was designed in the Yuan dynasty to be aligned with Xanadu, the other capital of their empire.\n\nThe Forbidden City is surrounded by a high city wall and a deep by wide moat. The walls are wide at the base, tapering to at the top. These walls served as both defensive walls and retaining walls for the palace. They were constructed with a rammed earth core, and surfaced with three layers of specially baked bricks on both sides, with the interstices filled with mortar.\n\nAt the four corners of the wall sit towers (E) with intricate roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion as they appeared in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.\n\nThe wall is pierced by a gate on each side. At the southern end is the main Meridian Gate (A). To the north is the Gate of Divine Might (B), which faces Jingshan Park. The east and west gates are called the \"East Glorious Gate\" (D) and \"West Glorious Gate\" (C). All gates in the Forbidden City are decorated with a nine-by-nine array of golden door nails, except for the East Glorious Gate, which has only eight rows.\n\nThe Meridian Gate has two protruding wings forming three sides of a square (Wumen, or Meridian Gate, Square) before it. The gate has five gateways. The central gateway is part of the Imperial Way, a stone flagged path that forms the central axis of the Forbidden City and the ancient city of Beijing itself, and leads all the way from the Gate of China in the south to Jingshan in the north. Only the Emperor may walk or ride on the Imperial Way, except for the Empress on the occasion of her wedding, and successful students after the Imperial Examination.\n\nTraditionally, the Forbidden City is divided into two parts. The Outer Court () or Front Court () includes the southern sections, and was used for ceremonial purposes. The Inner Court () or Back Palace () includes the northern sections, and was the residence of the Emperor and his family, and was used for day-to-day affairs of state. (The approximate dividing line shown as red dash in the plan above.) Generally, the Forbidden City has three vertical axes. The most important buildings are situated on the central north–south axis.\n\nEntering from the Meridian Gate, one encounters a large square, pierced by the meandering Inner Golden Water River, which is crossed by five bridges. Beyond the square stands the Gate of Supreme Harmony (F). Behind that is the Hall of Supreme Harmony Square. A three-tiered white marble terrace rises from this square. Three halls stand on top of this terrace, the focus of the palace complex. From the south, these are the Hall of Supreme Harmony (), the Hall of Central Harmony (), and the Hall of Preserving Harmony ().\n\nThe Hall of Supreme Harmony (G) is the largest, and rises some above the level of the surrounding square. It is the ceremonial centre of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is nine bays wide and five bays deep, the numbers 9 and 5 being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor. Set into the ceiling at the centre of the hall is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the \"Xuanyuan Mirror\". In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, as Emperors held court far more frequently, a less ceremonious location was used instead, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as coronations, investitures, and imperial weddings.\n\nThe Hall of Central Harmony is a smaller, square hall, used by the Emperor to prepare and rest before and during ceremonies. Behind it, the Hall of Preserving Harmony, was used for rehearsing ceremonies, and was also the site of the final stage of the Imperial examination. All three halls feature imperial thrones, the largest and most elaborate one being that in the Hall of Supreme Harmony.\n\nAt the centre of the ramps leading up to the terraces from the northern and southern sides are ceremonial ramps, part of the Imperial Way, featuring elaborate and symbolic bas-relief carvings. The northern ramp, behind the Hall of Preserving Harmony, is carved from a single piece of stone long, wide, and thick. It weighs some 200 tonnes and is the largest such carving in China. The southern ramp, in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, is even longer, but is made from two stone slabs joined together – the joint was ingeniously hidden using overlapping bas-relief carvings, and was only discovered when weathering widened the gap in the 20th century.\n\nIn the south west and south east of the Outer Court are the halls of Military Eminence (H) and Literary Glory (J). The former was used at various times for the Emperor to receive ministers and hold court, and later housed the Palace's own printing house. The latter was used for ceremonial lectures by highly regarded Confucian scholars, and later became the office of the Grand Secretariat. A copy of the \"Siku Quanshu\" was stored there. To the north-east are the Southern Three Places () (K), which was the residence of the Crown Prince.\n\nThe Inner Court is separated from the Outer Court by an oblong courtyard lying orthogonal to the City's main axis. It was the home of the Emperor and his family. In the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived and worked almost exclusively in the Inner Court, with the Outer Court used only for ceremonial purposes.\n\nAt the centre of the Inner Court is another set of three halls (L). From the south, these are:\nSmaller than the Outer Court halls, the three halls of the Inner Court were the official residences of the Emperor and the Empress. The Emperor, representing Yang and the Heavens, would occupy the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The Empress, representing Yin and the Earth, would occupy the Palace of Earthly Tranquility. In between them was the Hall of Union, where the Yin and Yang mixed to produce harmony.\n\nThe Palace of Heavenly Purity is a double-eaved building, and set on a single-level white marble platform. It is connected to the Gate of Heavenly Purity to its south by a raised walkway. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Emperor. However, beginning from the Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived instead at the smaller Hall of Mental Cultivation (N) to the west, out of respect to the memory of the Kangxi Emperor. The Palace of Heavenly Purity then became the Emperor's audience hall. A caisson is set into the roof, featuring a coiled dragon. Above the throne hangs a tablet reading \"Justice and Honour\" ().\n\nThe Palace of Earthly Tranquility () is a double-eaved building, 9 bays wide and 3 bays deep. In the Ming dynasty, it was the residence of the Empress. In the Qing dynasty, large portions of the Palace were converted for Shamanist worship by the new Manchu rulers. From the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, the Empress moved out of the Palace. However, two rooms in the Palace of Earthly Harmony were retained for use on the Emperor's wedding night.\n\nBetween these two palaces is the Hall of Union, which is square in shape with a pyramidal roof. Stored here are the 25 Imperial Seals of the Qing dynasty, as well as other ceremonial items.\n\nBehind these three halls lies the Imperial Garden (M). Relatively small, and compact in design, the garden nevertheless contains several elaborate landscaping features. To the north of the garden is the Gate of Divine Might.\n\nDirectly to the west is the Hall of Mental Cultivation (N). Originally a minor palace, this became the \"de facto\" residence and office of the Emperor starting from Yongzheng. In the last decades of the Qing dynasty, empresses dowager, including Cixi, held court from the eastern partition of the hall. Located around the Hall of Mental Cultivation are the offices of the Grand Council and other key government bodies.\n\nThe north-eastern section of the Inner Court is taken up by the Palace of Tranquil Longevity () (O), a complex built by the Qianlong Emperor in anticipation of his retirement. It mirrors the set-up of the Forbidden City proper and features an \"outer court\", an \"inner court\", and gardens and temples. The entrance to the Palace of Tranquil Longevity is marked by a glazed-tile Nine Dragons Screen. This section of the Forbidden City is being restored in a partnership between the Palace Museum and the World Monuments Fund, a long-term project expected to finish in 2017.\n\n\n\nReligion was an important part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.\n\nAnother prevalent form of religion in the Qing dynasty palace was Buddhism. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings. Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and mandalas, placed in ritualistic arrangements.\n\nThe Forbidden City is surrounded on three sides by imperial gardens. To the north is Jingshan Park, also known as Prospect Hill, an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build the moat and from nearby lakes.\n\nTo the west lies Zhongnanhai, a former royal garden centred on two connected lakes, which now serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China. To the north-west lies Beihai Park, also centred on a lake connected to the southern two, and a popular royal park.\n\nTo the south of the Forbidden City were two important shrines – the Imperial Shrine of Family or the Imperial Ancestral Temple () and the Imperial Shrine of State or Beijing Shejitan (), where the Emperor would venerate the spirits of his ancestors and the spirit of the nation, respectively. Today, these are the Beijing Labouring People's Cultural Hall and Zhongshan Park (commemorating Sun Yat-sen) respectively.\n\nTo the south, two nearly identical gatehouses stand along the main axis. They are the Upright Gate () and the more famous Tiananmen Gate, which is decorated with a portrait of Mao Zedong in the centre and two placards to the left and right: \"Long Live the People's Republic of China\" and \"Long live the Great Unity of the World's Peoples\". The Tiananmen Gate connects the Forbidden City precinct with the modern, symbolic centre of the Chinese state, Tiananmen Square.\n\nWhile development is now tightly controlled in the vicinity of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City. In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item to the Summer Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.\n\nThe design of the Forbidden City, from its overall layout to the smallest detail, was meticulously planned to reflect philosophical and religious principles, and above all to symbolise the majesty of Imperial power. Some noted examples of symbolic designs include:\n\nThe collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17 million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City. In addition, the imperial libraries housed a large collection of rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the Ming and Qing dynasties.\n\nFrom 1933, the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum's collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Communists' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artefacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum.\n\nAfter 1949, the Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.\n\nToday, there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum, including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. A new inventory of the Museum's collections was conducted between 2004 and 2010. Subsequently, the Palace Museum was shown to hold a total of 1,807,558 artefacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected \"valuable cultural relics.\" At the end of 2016, the Palace Museum held a press conference, announcing that 55,132 previously unlisted items had been discovered in an inventory check carried out from 2014 to 2016. The total number of items in the Palace Museum collection is presently at 1,862,690 objects.\n\n\nThe Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of ceramics and porcelain. These include imperial collections from the Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty, as well as pieces commissioned by the Palace, and, sometimes, by the Emperor personally. The Palace Museum holds about 320,000 pieces of porcelain from the imperial collection. The rest are almost all held in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Nanjing Museum.\n\nThe Palace Museum holds close to 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date from before the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). This is the largest such collection in China. The collection is based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that the palace held one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost over the years. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, many of the works were moved to Taiwan. The collection has subsequently been replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.\n\nThe Palace Museum's bronze collection dates from the early Shang dynasty. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1,600 are inscribed items from the pre-Qin period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court.\n\nThe Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace's own workshops, Guangzhou (Canton) and Suzhou (Suchow). Foreign pieces came from countries including Britain, France, Switzerland, the United States and Japan. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain.\n\nJade has a unique place in Chinese culture. The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the imperial collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artefacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the Neolithic period. Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty pieces, on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.\n\nIn addition to works of art, a large proportion of the Museum's collection consists of the artefacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.\n\nThe Forbidden City, the culmination of the two-thousand-year development of classical Chinese and East Asian architecture, has been influential in the subsequent development of Chinese architecture, as well as providing inspiration for many artistic works. Some specific examples include:\n\nThe Forbidden City has served as the scene to many works of fiction. In recent years, it has been depicted in films and television series. Some notable examples include:\n\nThe Forbidden City has also served as a performance venue. However, its use for this purpose is strictly limited, due to the heavy impact of equipment and performance on the ancient structures. Almost all performances said to be \"in the Forbidden City\" are held outside the palace walls.\n\n\n\n"}

Paul Getty Trust, GRI maintains a research library, organizes exhibitions and other events, sponsors a residential scholars program, publishes books, and produces electronic databases (Getty Publications).\n\nThe GRI was originally called the \"Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities\", and was first discussed in 1983. Located in Santa Monica, its first director (beginning in 1985) was Kurt W. Forster. GRI's library had 30,000 volumes in 1983, but grew to 450,000 volumes by 1986.\n\nIn a statement upon his departure in 1992, Forster summarized his tenure as \"Beginning with the rudiments of a small museum library... the center grew... to become one of the nation's preeminent research centers for arts and culture...\". In 1994, Salvatore Settis, a professor of the history of classical art and archeology in Italy, became the director of the Center. By 1996, the Center's name had been changed to \"Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities\", and by 1999 it was known simply as \"Getty Research Institute\".\n\nAmong GRI's special projects was \"L.A. as Subject: The Transformative Culture of Los Angeles Communities\" conducted between 1995 and 1999, whose purposes included \"enhanc[ing] existing resources and develop new resources that support new research scholarship on LA and also encourag[ing] the preservation, conservation, and display of local material culture\". \n\nIn collaboration with local organizations, GRI published \"Cultural Inheritance/L.A.: A Resource Directory of Less Visible Archives and Collections in the Los Angeles Region\" in 1999. In 2000, the L.A. as Subject project was transferred to the University of Southern California, which continues to update and expand an online version of the resource directory.\n\nWhen the Getty Information Institute (formerly the Art History Information Program, established in 1983) was dissolved in 1999 as a \"result of a change of leadership at the Getty Trust\", GRI absorbed \"many of its functions\".\n\nIn 2000, Thomas E. Crow was selected as GRI director to replace Settis who had resigned in 1999. Crow announced in October 2006 that he would be leaving for New York University. Since November 2007 Thomas W. Gaehtgens has been GRI's director; he was previously (1985–86) a visiting scholar with the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities.\n\nAmong other holdings, GRI's research library contains over 1 million volumes of books, periodicals, and auction catalogs; special collections; and two million photographs of art and architecture.\n\nAlready by 1985, the Getty had acquired the complete archive of the American sculptor Malvina Hoffman. In 2011, it acquired Harald Szeemann’s substantial archive, consisting of more than 1,000 boxes of correspondence, research files, drawings, and ephemera, as well as some 28,000 books and 36,000 photographs. It also owns several art dealers' archives, including records for the Goupil & Cie and Boussod Valadon galleries, Knoedler Gallery, and the Duveen Brothers.\n\nThe library is located at the Getty Center, and does not circulate its collections, but does extend library privileges to any visitor.\n\nGRI holds two public exhibitions per year in its two galleries which \"focus primarily on the special collections of the Research Library or on work produced by artists in residence\". For example, in 2005–2006 GRI held an exhibition entitled \"Julius Shulman, Modernity and the Metropolis\". The exhibition traveled to the National Building Museum and to the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn addition to exhibitions, GRI organizes lectures (open to the public), colloquia (most open to the public), workshops (by invitation only), and screenings of films and videos (open to the public).\n\nThe residential scholars program seeks to \"integrate the often isolated territory of art history into the wider sphere of the humanities\". The first class of scholars arrived in 1985–1986; they had their salaries paid for and their housing provided but were under \"absolutely no obligation to produce\". Among the notable scholars was German writer Christa Wolf in 1993–1994, who wrote the novel \"Medea: a modern retelling\" during her year at GRI.\n\nEach year the scholars are invited to work on projects related to an annual theme. In 2008–2009, the theme for the Getty Center was \"Networks and Boundaries\" and for the Getty Villa \"The Power and Function of Ancient Images\". The lengths of stay vary: Getty scholars are in residence for three, six or nine months, visiting scholars for one to three months, and predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows for a nine-month academic year. In 2011–12, the theme was \"Artistic Practice\".\n\nGRI publishes \"Series Imprints\" books in the categories of \"Issues and Debates\", \"Texts & Documents\", \"Introduction To\" (on \"cultural heritage information in electronic form\"), and \"ReSources\" (on the library's special collections). In addition, GRI publishes exhibition catalogs and other materials in hardcopy form.\n\nHere are selected books published by GRI, by the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities, by the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, by the Getty Information Institute, or by the Art History Information Program.\n\nAmong the electronic databases from the former Getty Information Institute that GRI continues to produce are:\nIn 2006, GRI and the OCLC Online Computer Library Center announced that the Getty Vocabularies (Art & Architecture Thesaurus, Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, and Union List of Artist Names) will be available as a Web service.\n\nUntil July 1, 2009, the Getty Information Institute and later GRI co-produced the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals with the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library.

{"id": "50231936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50231936", "title": "Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps", "text": "Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps\n\nThe Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps (titled \"The History of an Art\") was an exhibit of early electric light bulbs and was collected by William Joseph Hammer. The collection of lamp bulbs is the most comprehensive known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime. Hammer's collection was displayed for years in five glass cases at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. It is now housed at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. \n\nWilliam Joseph Hammer started to collect incandescent light bulbs from 1879 while they were being developed in the Edison laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He was an associate of Thomas Edison and in his engineering career he was able to collect early filament electric light bulbs from Edison and others because of his association in the field. The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of incandescent electric light bulbs known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime.\n\nHammer's incandescent light bulb collection from around the world was titled \"The History of an Art\" and he exhibited it at various times in electrical expositions and shows. He first exhibited it in 1882 at the International Electrical Exposition at the Crystal Palace in London and was awarded a silver medal for the presentation. When he presented his collection at the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904 he was awarded the Grand Prize.\n\nHammer was awarded the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal from the Franklin Institute for his collection in 1906. The General Electric Company bought the collection from Hammer in 1912 for $10,000. It then was donated to the Edison Association of Illuminating Companies. The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. The display information for each Case is how it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years. In 1931 the light bulb collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.\n\nBelow are example close-ups of the electric lamps in the 1904-06 collection.\n\nThe incandescent lamp collection of over a thousand antique electric light bulbs was displayed formally\nfor over ten years starting in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. It was arranged in five glass cases at the end of a room in a large horseshoe shape. Two of the cases were on the back wall with one case each on the adjacent side walls. These cases each were ten feet in length. The cases were made of French plate clear glass and had glass shelves. They had mirrors at the back to show the back side of the bulbs. In addition to these there was a fifth case in the center, which was four feet square. The cases were numbered 1 to 5 and displayed each a period of the evolution of the incandescent electric light bulb development. They showed on a label the country of origin, date, and inventor of each.\n\nHammer pointed out that Edison was not the first to make an electric light bulb. He claims instead that Edison made the first \"commercial\" electric light bulb that was successful. The other electric lamps made by others had inherent defects and burned out quickly, making them not practical for use to the general public. Edison first used various experimental vegetable fibers for the lamp filaments. One was a processed bamboo fiber used for a filament inside a glass bulb containing a vacuum. This was a filament of high resistance. Edison's electric lamp internal wire was unique in that the element had a resistance of around 140 ohms. There were several advantages to this, one being that several could be connected at the same time to a circuit. Others used filaments of low resistance ranging from 1 ohm to 5 ohms. This low resistance not only overloaded the electrical power system, but the wire filaments burned out quickly from extreme heat. They were impractical and expensive – not conducive to a commercial market.\n\nCase No. 1 contained a selection of lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved in the early stages of the electric light bulb development. The case displayed actual physical light bulbs made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric light bulbs for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.\n\nCase No. 2 contained lamps that showed the various stages of the development of the carbon filament lamp from 1878 to 1913. It supplemented Case #1 and showed date order of the technology. In this case were \"stopper lamps\" which Mr. Edison made as early as 1880. These lamps were originally numbered 110 to 357. The \"stopper lamps\" were made by others like Westinghouse, Packard, and Greene. This type of electric light bulb had the filament stem built into the neck of the glass bulb. This was purposefully designed this way to circumvent the Edison patents. Many of these lamps were used by the Westinghouse Electric Company for lights at the World's Fair of Chicago in 1893. They represented the state of the art in incandescent electric lights from others that worked closely with Edison to advance this technology.\n\nThere were over 300 bulbs grouped in date sections in this case by such innovators as Alexander Bernstein, Charles de Changy, William Crookes, Alessandro Cruto, Hiram Stevens Maxim, St. George Lane Fox-Pitt, Alexander Lodygin, William E. Sawyer, Müller, William H. Akester, Henry E. Nothomb, L. H. Rogers, Joseph Swan, James Swinburne, Werner von Siemens, Ludwig K. Boehm, Greinert-Friederich, and Lewis Howard Latimer. \n\nThis Case further represented the development of the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound on the outside of the glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.\n\nCase No. 4 further represented the development of the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case No. 1 and Case No. 3. These lamps showed a time period of from 1893 to 1903 and included special regulating lamps, styles for advertising signs, and novelty lamps like those made for Christmas trees.\n\nThis case had a lamp and socket used by Hammer for the first electric sign ever made. It lit up the name EDISON letter by letter in sequence when a set of switches were turned on by hand – one at a time in order. It was constructed in December 1881 and hung up in 1882 at the Crystal Palace in London. The lamp bulbs in this case display were numbered 782 to 1031. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this case.\n\nCase No. 5 were light bulbs that represented the state of the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. He said one day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.\n\nLamps in this case also show how some of these experimental bulbs progressed into vacuum tubes that were used in radios and TVs. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this display case. These were numbered 530 to 871.\n\nThe Edison Association of Illuminating Companies gave the entire Hammer collection to Henry Ford in 1929 for his new museum in Dearborn, Michigan. As of June 2000 they were still in the museum's collection.\n\n\n"}

As of May 2017, iprice hosts a catalogue of over 110 million products from over 1000 merchants across the region, including big e-commerce sites like Lazada and Zalora.\n\nFounded in October 2014 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, iprice expanded in the same year it was founded and became an active player in the e-commerce industry of six other countries: Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The site first started out as a coupon site that offers deals and discounts for other online stores, but later changed into a shopping aggregator that helps shoppers compare prices from various e-commerce sites.\n\niprice provides the service of hosting products from several Southeast Asian e-commerce sites on one platform. With claims that it is more than just a price-comparison site as it focuses more on the discovery of products rather than the price of the products, how the site works is that it narrows down the vast volume of products (via a search and filter interface) to find products that would suit the consumer’s preferences.\n\nTraffic volume for e-commerce sites are increased via exposure on the site. The way it works is through clicking of the products on the site which redirects consumers (traffic) to the websites that the products are located to complete the purchase. Sites like Hermo and Zalora have reportedly seen an increase in traffic volume since signing on with iprice and have seen growth in their revenue. Apart from being a platform for several e-commerce sites, iprice is also considered as a comparison shopping website.\n\niprice raised its first round of seed funding in May 2015. It received approximately US$550,000 from Asia Venture Group (AVG). The second round of seed funding came in December 2015 when the aggregator announced that it had raised US$1.2 million. This round was led by existing investor, AVG, followed by 500 Startups, IMJ Investment Partners, Venturra Capital, F2 Capital, and Starstrike Ventures. By the end of 2016, iprice closed a $4 million Series A funding round led by Asia Venture Group (AVG) and Venturra.\n\niprice is a partner of several online sites to provide potential customers with the chance of accessing its money-saving deals and bargains (or more commonly known as coupons). Its coupons cover a wide range of discounts and offers available for various e-commerce sites, such as Zalora, Lazada, Uber, and Foodpanda. Among the partners currently signed up under this coupon program are Rappler (for Philippines) as well as two of REV Asia’s Malaysia-based news sites; SAYS\n"}
{"id": "7093231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7093231", "title": "Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft", "text": "Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft\n\nThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft was a weekly magazine by Aerospace Publishing/Orbis Publishing that was published in the UK (and sold in other countries too) in the early 1980s. The magazine was intended to eventually make up a multi-volume encyclopedia dedicated to aviation. Starting in 1982 the magazine lasted for 216 issues, each of 20 pages (plus the cover), making up 18 volumes (4280 pages). The first two issues were sold together for the price of one, subsequent issues were sold on their own.\n\nEmpty binders for each volume (set of 12 issues) were also sold. These binders were dark blue in colour and contained the imprint of a Panavia Tornado on the front. They held the issues using a metal strip that was threaded through the staples of each issue to hold them in place. Each issue consisted of four separate sections.\n\nThe final two issues (215 and 216) gave the index for the encyclopedia. A contents was also given with these final issues that was intended to be put into the start of volume 1. The magazine ceased publication in 1985.\n\nThe first few pages of each issue (usually 4 or 5) were dedicated to the history of aviation which also covered commercial aviation and current (as in early 1980s) air power (\"Air Power Today\").\n\nThe \"History of Aviation\" began in issue 1 with a 7 part series on the Vietnam War. Most of the \"History of Aviation\" was taken up with warfare especially World War II starting with the Blitzkrieg in issue 8 and ending with defeat of Japan in issue 156. The coverage of World War 2 also included surveys of different combat roles and aircraft types.\n\nWorld War I was also covered as was the Korean War, Spanish Civil War, post-World War II colonial conflicts and the Arab-Israeli Wars. In later issues the Cold War was covered in depth.\n\n\"Air Power Today\" covered the then current (1980s) military situation with surveys of different types of military aircraft and combat roles and regional surveys of airpower around the world.\n\nThe history of \"Commercial Aviation\" was also covered in a multi-part series starting with the earliest commercial air flights and ending with general aviation and microlights near the very end of the Encyclopedia's run.\n\nThe second section of the issue was \"The World's Greatest Aircraft\" and was an in depth look at a major aircraft type, including a cutaway drawing, a list of variants and a three-way view in colour on the centre pages. The North American Mustang was featured in issue one, with the North American XB-70 the final aircraft featured in issue 214.\n\nThe third section was the \"A-Z of Aircraft\" which started off in great depth though in later issues stopped featuring more obscure types and collected minor aircraft manufacturer's aircraft into one entry. This can be illustrated by the first and last entries in the A-Z. The first aircraft featured was the AAMSA A9B-M Quail (on page 14) but the last (on page 3120) was a collected entry on the aircraft of Zmaj (Fabrika Aeroplaná I Hidoplaná Zmaj). However based on the Zmaj entry then the last aircraft in the A-Z is the Zmaj Nebojsa.\n\nWhen the A-Z was completed this section was replaced by the \"Chronology of Aviation\" from 1903 to 1984 and finally a history of RAF squadrons.\n\nThe final section (though it was part of the cover which was to be removed when the issue was placed in a binder) was a feature on an air force or airline. The back cover either featured an advert for the binders or a full page photo of an aircraft. Sometimes the airforce/airline feature was omitted in favour of an order form for binders or back issues or even sometimes an advert.\n\n"}
{"id": "47525166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47525166", "title": "Information Coding Classification", "text": "Information Coding Classification\n\nThe Information Coding Classification (ICC) is a classification system covering almost all extant 6500 knowledge fields (knowledge domains). Its conceptualization goes beyond the scope of the well known library classification systems, such as Dewey Decimal Classification (DCC), Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), and Library of Congress Classification (LCC), by extending also to knowledge systems that so far have not afforded to classify literature. ICC actually presents a flexible universal ordering system for both literature and other kinds of information, set out as knowledge fields. From a methodological point of view, ICC differs from the above-mentioned systems along the following three lines:\nRespective knowledge fields permit to step down by the same principle to a third and forth level, and even further to a fifth and sixth level. Finally, knowledge field subdivisions will have to conform to said digital position scheme.\nHence, for a given knowledge field identical codes will mark identical categories under respective numbers of the coding system. This mnemotechnical aspect of the system helps memorizing and straightaway retrieving the whereabouts of respective interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary fields.\n\nThe first two hierarchical levels may be regarded as a top- or upper ontology for ontologies and other applications.\n\nThe terms of the first three hierarchical levels were set out in German and English in \"Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft\", on pp. 82 to 100. It was published in 2014 and available so far only in German. In the meantime, also the French terms of the knowlwdge fields have been collected.\nCompetence for maintenance and further development rests with the German Chapter of the \nInternational Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO) e.V.\n\nAt the end of 1970, Prof. Alwin Diemer, Univ.of Düsseldorf proposed to Ingetraut Dahlberg to undertake a philosophical dissertation on \"The universal classification system of knowledge, its ontological, epistemological, and information theoretical foundations\". Diemer had in mind an innovating ontological approach for such a system based on the whole spectrum of kinds of being and complying with epistemological requirements. The third requirement had already been taken up somehow in the Indian Colon Classification, yet it still called for explanations and additions. In 1974, the dissertation was published in German entitled \"Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung\". It started with conceptual clarifications, and why and how the term „universal“ was linked to knowledge, including knowledge fields, such as commodity science, artefacts, statistics, patents, standardization, communication, utility services et al. In chapter 3, six universal classification systems (DDC, UDC, LCC, BC, CC and BBK) were presented, analyzed and compared.\n\nWhile preparing the dissertation, Dahlberg started with elaborating the new universal system by first gleaning a lot of extant designations of knowledge fields from whatever available reference works. This was funded by the German Documentation Society (DGD) (1971-2) under the title of \"Order system of knowledge fields\". In addition, the syllabuses of German universities and polytechniques were explored for relevant terms and documented (1975). Thereafter, it seemed necessary to add definitions from special dictionaries and encyclopediae; it soon appeared that the 12.500 terms included numerous synonyms, so that the whole collection boiled down to about 6.500 concept designations (Project Logstruktur, supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) 1976-78).\n\nThe outcome of this work was the formulation of 30 theses which ended up in 12 principles for the new system, published 40 years later under. These principles refer not only to theoretical foundations but also to structure and other organizational aspects of the whole array of knowledge fields. In 1974, the digital position scheme for field subdivision had already been developed to allow for classifying classification literature in the bibliographical section of the first issue of the Journal International Classification. In 1977, the entire ICC was ready for presentation at a seminar in Bangalore, India. A publication of the first three hierarchical levels appeared however only in 1982. It was applied to the bibliography of classification systems and thesauri in vol.1 of the International Classification and Indexing Bibliography; it has been updated.\n\nThese were published in full length in the book \"Wissensorganisation. Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft\" and the article \"Information Coding Classification. Geschichtliches, Prinzipien, Inhaltliches\", hence it suffices to just mention their topics with some necessary additions.\n\n\n\nAn example of its application is the structure of the classification system for knowledge organization literature Gliederung der Klassifikationsliteratur. (A simplified version with an additional introduction is given in, p. 71)\n\n\nThe first two levels of ICC can be represented by following matrix.\n\nThe first hierarchical level of the 9 subject categories results from the first vertical array under codes 1-9. The second hierarchical level of subject categories is structured by the 9 functionally ordered form categories, listed in the first horizontal line under codes 01-09. Some exceptions are mentioned in principle 7.\n\nFor classifying web documents as conceived by Jens Hartmann, University of Karlsruhe, Prof.Walter Koch, University of Graz, has explored in his Institute for Applied Information Technology Research Society (AIT) the application of ICC to automatically classifying metadata of some 350.000 documents. This was facilitated by data generated within the framework of an EU-supported project \"EuropeanaLocal\" . For this exploration, three ICC hierarchical levels have been used for some 5000 terms. The result is described in the report of Christoph Mak. Prof.Koch regarded a classification degree of almost 50% as a good result, considering that only a shortened version of ICC had been used. In order to reach a better result one would have needed 1–2 years. Also an index of all terms with their codes could be achieved under these explorations.\n\nMotivated by the work of an Italian research Group in Trento on \"Revising the Wordnet Domains Hierarchy: semantics, coverage and balancing\", by which the DDC codes were used, Prof. Ernesto DeLuca et al. showed in a study that for such case the use of ICC could lead to essentially better results. This was shown in two contributions: \"Including knowledge domains from the ICC into the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud (LLD)\" and \"Die Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud: Eine mögliche Zugangsoptimierung?\", in which the LLD was used in a meta-model which contains all resources with the possibility of retrieval and navigation of data from different aspects. By this, the existing work about many thousand knowledge fields (of ICC) can be combined with the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud, based on RDF/OWL representation of EuroWordNet and similar integrated lexical resources (MultiWordNet, MEMODATA and the Hamburg Metapher BD).\n\nIn October 2013, the computer scientist Hermann Bense, Dortmund, explored the possibilities for structuring the Semanic Web with ICC codes. He developed two approaches for a pictorial presentation of knowledge fields with their possible subdivisions. A graphic representation of those knowledge fields pertaining to the first two levels can be found under Ontology4. The inclusion of the third hierarchical level has been envisaged as the next step.\n"}

It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe house was built around 1610, and extended over a period. Inside can be seen an example of a box-bed or \"cupboard bed\" and a sleeping platform over the fireplace, typical of houses in the Gower peninsula at this period. Its exterior walls are painted a bright red; the original pigment included ox blood and lime and may have been intended as a kind of charm against witches. Another theory is that it simply showed that the family were rich enough to be able to afford this type of pigment.\n\nThe main living room or \"kitchen\" is an addition, dating from around 1680, as is the wooden staircase and sleeping area above it. The walls of the dining room (originally the only ground-floor room) are painted with a stencilled decoration of a type which pre-dates the general use of wallpaper. This room was used as the interior of Captain Blamey's cottage in the filming of the BBC's 2015 drama series, \"Poldark\".\n\nThe farmhouse was donated to the museum (then called the Welsh Folk Museum) in 1951 by its then owner, Mr J B Rogers. It was one of the first properties to be rebuilt at the museum, which opened in 1948, and finance for carrying out the work was provided by the profits from the 1951 Festival of Britain. The farm buildings (barn and calves \"cotts\") that originally stood by the house were donated to the museum in the early 2000s and were also relocated to St Fagans.\n"}
{"id": "21304582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21304582", "title": "Killer Kowalski", "text": "Killer Kowalski\n\nWalter Kowalski (born Edward Władysław Spulnik; October 13, 1926 – August 30, 2008) was a Polish-Canadian professional wrestler.\n\nKowalski wrestled for numerous promotions during his career, including the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE), and was a known villain professional wrestler. He held numerous championships including the WWWF World Tag Team Championship with Big John Studd billed as The Executioners and managed by Lou Albano.\n\nAfter retiring in 1977, Kowalski started a professional wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts and trained many professional wrestlers, including Triple H, Chyna, Eddie Edwards, Kofi Kingston, Damien Sandow, Fandango, Brittany Brown, April Hunter, John Kronus, Perry Saturn, and Tommaso Ciampa.\n\nThe man later known as \"Killer Kowalski\" (he legally changed his name in 1963) was the son of Polish immigrants Antoni Spulnik and Maria Borowska; he, his older sister Wanda, and his younger brother Stanley were raised in Windsor, Ontario. Years later, he told interviewers that he never expected to be a wrestler – by the age of 14, he was already , and because he was thin for his height, he began working out at the local YMCA, but he had no plan to go into athletics at that time. When he entered college, his major was electrical engineering. He worked part-time at the Ford plant in Detroit to help pay his wage.\n\nThere are several stories of how he became a wrestler. The most common one is that while attending the University of Detroit (some sources say Assumption College in Windsor), he heard that there was an opportunity to make good pay by wrestling. He was only being paid $50 a week at the plant and was told he could make more as a wrestler. Since he already had an athletic build, he decided to give wrestling a try and began attending a wrestling school. When he first wrestled professionally, he was known as Tarzan Kowalski, but was also called Hercules Kowalski, Killer Kowalski (this nickname is used as early as 1950) and even The Polish Apollo, according to newspaper reports from 1950–51. During the Cold War his name was changed to Wladek Kowalski, which was supposed to sound more menacing. Kowalski wrestled from 1947 to 1977 in a number of organizations, including the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and American Wrestling Association (AWA) as a heel.\n\nKowalski's rise in the business came quickly. His first recorded match occurred on May 6, 1948, and by November 29 of the same year, Kowalski was facing NWA champion Orville Brown in a heavyweight championship match. Kowalski stood out in his era for his larger-than-normal size, and for a faster-paced style in the ring. He wrestled as a demonstrative \"heel,\" or villain, except when facing the even-more-hated Buddy Rogers. In his matches with Rogers, Kowalski would adopt a more serious \"babyface\" approach. Out of the ring, however, Kowalski was considered so friendly and polite that some wrestling promoters complained about the way he would \"drop character\" in public.\n\nOn October 15, 1952, in a match in Montreal versus Yukon Eric, Kowalski ripped off a part of Yukon Eric's ear while performing a knee drop. In reality, Eric's ears were already badly cauliflowered due to years of abuse and the injury was an accident, but it fortified Kowalski as being a ruthless villain who gleefully maims his opponents. Kowalski attempted to visit his opponent in the hospital and began laughing along with Eric at how silly the bandages looked, with Kowalski recalling years later, \"I swear, the first thing I thought of was Humpty Dumpty on the wall. Yukon Eric looked at me, shook his head, and smiled. I started laughing and he laughed, too.\" When the incident was reported in the paper the next day, it stated that Kowalski showed up at the hospital and laughed \"at\" his victim rather than \"with\" him, furthering Kowalski's image as a heel. The incident sparked a long-running series of grudge matches between the two wrestlers which took place throughout North America. By the time the feud had run out of steam several years later, Yukon Eric joked to Kowalski about the small size of an audience, \"God, that's a lousy house. I might have to sacrifice another ear.\"\n\nKowalski also gained some notoriety in Boston for an incident in late June 1958 when he was wrestling Pat O'Connor. The guest referee was former boxing great Jack Dempsey, who suffered a kick to the diaphragm and had to be hospitalized. Dempsey did not blame Kowalski, and both said it was an accident, but this further cemented the Killer's reputation as a villain. In 1967, the top-rated Australian television talk show host Don Lane irritated Kowalski during an apparently friendly interview and was attacked with the Kowalski claw hold.\n\nAlso in the late 1950s, Kowalski fought what was supposed to be a best two out of three match in Fall River, Massachusetts against Mr. Moto. Just before the bell starting the first fall, Kowalski had his back turned to Moto while doing some stretches in his corner. Moto raced across the ring and hit Kowalski over the head with one of the clogs with which he had walked into the ring. Of course, the referee did not see this happen. The bell rang and a seemingly dazed Kowalski staggered around the ring and was quickly pinned by Moto. Kowalski was billed as the heavyweight champion at that time (at least in eastern Massachusetts) and, as such, was not supposed to lose the match. Just after the second fall started, Kowalski was hit in the right eye with a pea or bean shot by someone in the audience using a pea shooter. Semi-blinded and genuinely stunned, Kowalski staggered around the ring covering his eye with his right hand. Moto did not know what to do. Finally, he approached Kowalski, bumped into him and fell to the mat. Kowalski reached down, applied the claw hold and Moto was not only counted out, but deemed by the referee too hurt to continue. The two raced out of the ring to a chorus of boos from the audience and dodged various objects being thrown at them. As a side note, the two had arrived 45 minutes late for the match. \"The Fall River Herald News\" reported in its next day morning edition that these two \"mortal enemies\" were late because the car in which they had ridden together to the match had broken down on the way.\n\nIn December 1972, Kowalski became the first wrestler to pin André the Giant in North America, in what was billed as a \"Battle of the Giants.\" Photographs from the Quebec City match helped to establish André's reputation in American wrestling magazines, since they showed him towering over the better-known Kowalski. Kowalski had done much the same to boost Giant Baba's fame in Japan, with a televised 1963 match.\n\nKowalski became the main antagonist of Bruno Sammartino in the World Wide Wrestling Federation in the 1960s and 1970s. Kowalski formed a tag team with fellow heel Gorilla Monsoon and took Red Berry as his manager; Monsoon and Kowalski held the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship, winning the belts in two straight falls from Skull Murphy and Brute Bernard on Washington, D.C. television, and later losing to The Tolos Brothers in two straight falls in Teaneck, New Jersey in December 1963. On May 11, 1976, Kowalski won the WWF World Tag Team Championship with Big John Studd. Both men wore black masks and tights and called themselves \"The Executioners\". However, they were stripped of the championship, following the interference of a third Executioner during a title defense against Chief Jay Strongbow and Billy White Wolf. The Executioners lost a match for the vacant title on December 6 to Strongbow and White Wolf and never regained the championship.\n\nAfter his WWF retirement in 1977, Kowalski started a professional wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts. Due to his health, he ceased to be involved with it in 2003, and the school subsequently moved to North Andover, Massachusetts. Among the alumni of this school are Triple H, Chyna, Perry Saturn, John Kronus, Brittany Brown, Big John Studd, Damien Kane, Killer Kowalski Jr., Ron Zombie, Christopher Nowinski, Tensai, April Hunter, Ace Andrews, RJ Brewer, Kazarian, Nicole Raczynski, Cadillac Joe D, Kenny Dykstra, Damien Sandow and Fandango. Kowalski continued to wrestle on independent shows into the early 1980s, and worked only sparingly after that. His last match took place in 1993, when Kowalski was 66 years old. Kowalski would remain a fixture on the Northeast independent wrestling scene taking autograph and personal appearances. His last appearance was in Jan 2008 for Top Rope Promotions at an event in North Adams, Ma where he came to the ring and put the claw on local wrestler \"Gorgeous\" Gino Giovanni and was declared the winner of the segment.\n\nHe also made numerous post-retirement television appearances, including \"Late Night with David Letterman\" in 1982, and was featured in a comic role in Michael Burlingame's surrealist film \"To a Random\" in 1986. \"Lost in the B-Zone\", a music video for Birdsongs of the Mesozoic which was derived from this film, also prominently featured Kowalski.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, Kowalski was inducted into The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nKowalski married for the first time to Theresa Ferrioli on June 19, 2006. Kowalski, who was 79 years old at the time, joked that he only married 78-year-old Ferrioli after \"she told me she was pregnant\". He had known her since 1998, and she was surprised when he proposed, since he had been known as a lifelong bachelor.\n\nHe became a vegetarian in the late 1960s and claimed to be the only one in professional wrestling. He would not drink milk or alcohol, and he did not smoke. He would not even drive with wrestlers who smoked, which limited his traveling options. Reportedly, he also was an all-raw-food vegan for a while. He was a popular speaker in the local Boston Vegetarian Society and Boston-area vegetarian restaurants, including the now-closed Country Life Vegetarian Restaurant, where he discussed both wrestling and his vegetarian values, and appeared on Malden's cable TV station, MATV, where he also shared anecdotes about vegetarian values and his more humorous wrestling experiences and observations.\n\nKowalski began experiencing escalating health problems in the time leading up to his death. \"The Sun\" received the report on Kowalski from his friend, wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino, that Kowalski had to go to a rehabilitation center in Everett, Massachusetts, where he was recovering from a knee injury. It seemed he was getting better, until he suffered a heart attack on August 8, 2008. According to Slam! Sports, the \"Quincy Patriot Ledger\", and other sources, Kowalski's family was apprised that he would not recover. When Kowalski was taken off life support on August 18, subsequent news reports erroneously stated that he had died. Kowalski died on August 30, 2008. He was survived by his wife and family.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2009 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany \"(Bundesverdienstkreuz)\" for his efforts to further exchange and co-operation between the legal systems of Thailand and Germany. Alongside his Thammasat Law Faculty colleague Worachet Pakeerut, he serves in the supervisory board of the German-Southeast Asian Center of Excellence for Public Policy and Good Governance (CPG).\n\nHe has published works about LGBT, the reformation of Thai law under European influence (2003), personality rights (2003), and background and fundamental legal methodology of civil law and common law (2004), as well as a textbook on general principles of natural persons and legal persons (2007).\n\nKittisak supports section 112 of the Thai Criminal Code (known as lèse majesté law) and the categorisation of the section as an offence against national security. However, he agreed that the current fifteen year imprisonment is immoderate and the current enforcement of section 112 is problematical.\n\nDuring the 2013–14 Thai political crisis, Kittisak became known as a supporter of the oppositional \"People's Democratic Reform Committee\" (PDRC). Kittisak delivered several speeches against the Pheu Thai Party on the PDRC stage. He also supports many ideas and operations of the PDRC, including the creation of an unelected people's council to oversee political reform and the seizure of public offices, which he described as a peaceful revolution.\n\nHis assets and bank accounts have been frozen by the Department of Special Investigation since 20 December 2013 on grounds of financing the PDRC. On 14 May 2014, the Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him on the charge of insurrection. He also faces seven other serious charges. He surrendered himself to the court on 19 May 2014 and successfully requested a provisional release, using his assistant professor position as security for bail. A public prosecutor is scheduled to institute a case against him on 27 June 2014.\n\nOn 8 May 2014, Wuttipong Pongsuwan, Minister of Defence Advisor, accused Kittisak of plagiarising the article \"Uniform Sales Law – The Experience with Uniform Sales Laws in the Federal Republic of Germany\" by Peter Schlechtriem and presenting it as his own article under the title of \"The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 1980\". The matter went viral on the internet. On 9 May 2014, Kittisak admitted that he did produce the latter work and he failed to mention Schlechtriem as the original producer. However, he said the work he produced was merely the lecture notes, not generally published.\n\nOn 10 May 2014, Associate Professor Prasit Piwawattanapanit from the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University, who is also a member of the salary promotion board of the faculty, stated that Kittisak submitted the work to the board for consideration in salary promotion and also introduced it to an international conference. When the board suspected the originality of the work, Kittisak explained that the name of Schlechtriem was omitted because of his haste in writing the article, technical errors and the mistake of his teaching assistant. Prasit, however, found the explanation unreasonable, as it appeared that many parts of the original article were modified in the manner that a person in haste or a mere teaching assistant would be unable to do. In addition, Kittisak explained that he used this work because he wanted to publish the work of Schlechtriem who was his teacher when he studied in Germany.

{"id": "32176156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32176156", "title": "Rededjet", "text": "Rededjet\n\nRededjet (also readed as Ruddedet) is the name of a fictitious ancient Egyptian female hero appearing in the fifth chapter of a story told in the legendary \"Westcar Papyrus.\" She is said to have fulfilled a prophecy by giving birth to three future kings during the reign of king (pharaoh) Khufu (4th Dynasty), who received the prophecy from a magician named Dedi.\n\nRededjet appears only in the fifth story of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" - there is no archeological or historical evidence that she existed. Nevertheless, she is object of great interest for historians and Egyptologists, since her story gives information about the line of succession at the very beginning of the fifth dynasty.\n\nAccording to the \"Westcar Papyrus,\" Rededjet has a strong labor, and birth is difficult because she has to expect triplets. The god Ra, Lord of Sachebu, says to the gods Isis, Nephthys, Meskhenet, Heqet and Khnum: “May you all go to Rededjet and release her from her trinity of children which are still in her womb and which will exercise their splendid office in the whole realm one day. So they can build temples for you, take care of your offering tables, let your drink plates thrive and multiply your god's sacrifices.” And so the goddesses turn to Rededjet's house after they had transformed themselves into music-making dancers. The god Khnum himself turns into a porter. When they reach Rededjet's house they meet her husband Ra-User outside at the threshold, wearing his skirt upside-down and whining. The goddesses show him their menits and sistrums. Thereupon Ra-User says: “See, there is a woman here who is suffering badly, for her birth is problematic.” The goddesses say: “May thou cause that we can see her. See, we know how to relieve.” Ra-User replies: “Feeds!” The gods step in and go immediately to Rededjet, who is lying upstairs. They seal the room and then Isis stands before Rededjet, to catch the babies, Nephthys takes position behind, whilst Heqet accelerates the birth. Now Isis says: “May you, the one who is User-Re-ef, be not too strong in her womb.” And the baby comes out quickly, a healthy child of one cubit in size. His bones are solid, his equipment of limbs being like gold. His headdress is made of real lapis lazuli. After cutting the umbilical cord, purifying the baby and placing it in a brick-made bed, covered with soft sheets, Khnum makes the body strong. Meskhenet steps by and says: “This is a king who will exercise the rulership over the whole country!” After this, Isis stands again before Rededjet and says: “May you, whose name is Sahure, stop kicking in her womb.” And this baby, too, comes out quickly. It has the same extraordinary appearance like the baby before. And again Meskhenet blesses the child with the words: “This is a king who will exercise the rulership over the whole country!” A third and last time Isis stands before Rededjet and says: “May you, whose name is Keku, stop being blind in her womb.” And the third baby is blessed by Meskhenet, too. Now the gods leave the room, meet Ra-User and say: “Oh joy! Three children were born to you!” Ra-User replies: “My ladies! What could I do for you? Give this barley to your porter, may you accept it as a gratuity, for making some beer.” Khnum shoulders himself with the jars of barley and the gods start turning home. On their way, Isis admonishes her companions with the words: “Haven't we come here for a good reason? What would that reason be, if we perform no miracle to these children! There were nothing we could tell to their father who made us come.″ The gods create three lordly crowns for the children and hide them in the jars of barley. Then they conjure a downpour, as a reason to turn back to Ra-User's house. They say to Ra-User: “Please store the barley in a sealed storeroom for us until we come back from making music in the north.” And the jars with barley are locked in a storeroom.\n\nSome weeks later, Rededjet asks her maidservant: “Is our house prepared with all good things?” The maidservant answers: “It is prepared with every good thing, except some jars of beer. They were not brought yet.” Rededjet inquires: “Why is this not so, that the jars with beer were brought?” And the maidservant says: “There is nothing you could produce it with, except the barley of those musicians, the barley that is stored and sealed away.” Rededjet orders: “Go and take some, Ra-User will replace it when he comes home.” And the maidservant opens the storeroom and all of a sudden she hears music, celebrations and cheering from afar - its festive mood typical for a royal enthroning feast. The maid is baffled and tells everything to Rededjet. Rededjet enters the room too and also hears the festive noises. Now nosy she puts her ears on every box and jar, until she finds out, that the noises are coming from the jars of the musicians. Recognising the situation, Rededjet tells everything to Ra-User and they both spend the rest of the day celebrating.\n\nOne day Rededjet is bickering with the maidservant and the latter one is punished with beating. Infuriated, the maidservant says: “Is it because of that? Is it really because of the three kings you gave birth to? I will go to file charges with the king of Lower- and Upper Egypt, Khufu, justified!” The maidservant leaves the house and goes to her elder brother. He is sitting beside his mother, binding flax and yarn. When he sees his sister, he says: “Where do ye go to, lil' sister?” And the maidservant tells him what she is up to. The brother says: “Shall it truly be done to come to me just to make me sup with betrayal?” He becomes angry and beats her, too. The maidservant now goes away to get some water and a crocodile snatches her. The brother goes to Rededjet to tell her what happened. Rededjet sits on the threshold, crying. The brother says: “What are you crying about, mistress?” Rededjet answers: “It's about this little girl that grew up in this house. Look, she went to go to file charges [...] to the king.” And the brother replies: “See, she came to me to tell [...] that I would go with her, but I beat her and sent her away. When she went off for some water a crocodile snatched her.”\n\nHistorians and Egyptologists such as Adolf Erman and Kurt Heinrich Sethe once thought the tales of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" were mere folklore, despite their knowledge of the historical correctness about the beginning of the fifth dynasty by describing the succession of the kings Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare. They also thought the novel of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" to be unfinished.\n\nModern Egyptologists such as Verena Lepper and Miriam Lichtheim deny this view and they argue that Sethe and Erman may have just failed to see the profundity of the novel. They both evaluate the story as some kind of narrated moral which deals with the theme of justice and what happens to traitors. Lepper points out, that the story of Rededjet might have been inspired by the historical figure of queen Khentkaus I, who lived and maybe ruled at the end of the Fourth dynasty. Khentkaus I is demonstrably entitled as “mother of two kings” and for a long time it has been thought that she may have borne Userkaf and Sahure. But new evidence shows that at least Sahure had a different mother (Queen Neferhetepes), the implication of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" that the first three kings of the fifth dynasty had been siblings, is therefore incorrect. Since in the \"Westcar Papyrus\" Rededjet was concerned with the role of a future king's mother, the parallels between the biographies of the two ladies aroused special attention. The role of the maidservant is evaluated as being a key figure for a modern phrasing of indoctrinations about morality and betrayal. The maidservant wants to betray her mistress and is punished by destiny. The destiny is depicted here as a crocodile which snatches the traitor. The destination of the whole happening is to ensure the beginning of a new dynasty and by making the only danger disappear, the author of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" artfully creates some kind of happy ending. Lepper sees a strong clue in the way the story is finalized that the novel of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" actually ends here. The episode in which the crocodile snatches a traitor, is repeated several times, just like a refrain, which is a typical writing element used in ancient Egyptian documents to close a chapter or text.\n\nIn 2009 archaeological discoveries in Abusir, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have established that Neferirkare was in fact Sahure's son, who was himself Userkaf's son. Egyptologists now believe that the story of Rededjet is based on a conflation of two historical queens named Khentkaus. The first one lived during the 4th Dynasty and may have given birth to two kings, while the second one was the mother of two 5th Dynasty pharaohs, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. When Nyuserre was on the throne, he revived the cult of the first Khentkaus, as the similarities between both Khentkaus provided him with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. Th Egyptologist John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of the two Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefre's death.\n\n"}

By the war's end in Europe in May 1945, the Testery had grown to nine cryptographers, a team of 24 ATS, a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.\n\nThe logical structure of the Tunny system was worked out by mathematician Bill Tutte (William Thomas Tutte) in the Spring of 1942. Tunny had 12 wheels, and was more advanced, complex, faster and far more secure than the well-known 3-4 wheeled Enigma machine. The Germans were convinced that the Tunny cipher system was unbreakable. Tunny was the cipher system which carried only the highest grade of intelligence: messages from the German Army Headquarters in Berlin and the top generals and field marshals on all fronts. Some were signed by Hitler himself. Tens of thousands of Tunny messages were intercepted by the British and broken at Bletchley Park by Captain Roberts and his fellow codebreakers in the Testery. These messages contained much vital insight into top-level German thinking and planning.\n\nAfter the Testery had been breaking Tunny for a year by hand, the Newmanry became active from July 1943 under Max Newman. Mathematicians in the Newmanry used machine methods to speed up breaking Tunny. Early on, a machine called Heath Robinson was produced, to help speed up one stage — breaking of the chi wheels, but the Robinson was slow and not reliable. In February 1944 a new machine called \"Colossus\" became operational; it was the world's first electronic computer. Colossus was designed and built in only ten months by Tommy Flowers of the G.P.O. (Post Office). This had far greater capacity and speed than the Robinson and so the whole breaking process became much faster. The Colossus was essential for making the very fast counts needed to work out the \"de-chis\", but the psi-wheels and motor-wheels were still broken by hand in the Testery.\n\nThe Testery was hand code-breaking Tunny for 12 months before the Robinson machine was produced and for 19 months before Colossus operated. With the help of the Newmanry, the Testery broke up to 90% of the traffic given to them to work on in the Colossus period.\n\nThe information provided by Tunny enabled the Allies to ascertain German movements, saving thousands of lives at critical junctures such as D-Day and the Battle of Kursk in the Soviet Union. General Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the best summary after World War II. He said that \"Bletchley decrypts shortened the War by at least two years\". Tunny played a very important role in all of this, a war which was costing at least 10 million lives a year. A great deal of this was down to Bill Tutte.\n\nThe story of Enigma (declassified in the 1970s) is well known, but the story of Tunny, Germany's top-secret cipher machine, was only declassified a few years ago. Most of the cryptographers in the Testery died before they could tell their stories. For the first time, on 25 October 2011, a BBC Timewatch programme titled \"Code-breakers: Bletchley Park’s Lost Heroes\", about the Testery, Tunny, Bill Tutte and Tommy Flowers, was produced, featuring testimony from Jerry Roberts.\n\nBy the war's end in Europe in May 1945, the Testery had grown to nine cryptographers, a team of 24 ATS, a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.\n\n\n"}

It was the recipient of the International Consumer Magazine of the Year award in both 2010 and 2011 and the renamed International Consumer Media Brand of the Year in 2013 and 2014.\n\n\"Time Out\" was first published in 1968 as a London listings magazine by Tony Elliott, who used birthday money to produce a one-sheet pamphlet., with Bob Harris as co-editor. The first product was titled \"Where It's At\", before being inspired by Dave Brubeck's album \"Time Out\". Time Out began as an alternative magazine alongside other members of the underground press in the UK, but by 1980 it had abandoned its original collective decision-making structure and its commitment to equal pay for all its workers, leading to a strike and the foundation of a competing magazine, \"City Limits\", by former staffers. By now its former radicalism has all but vanished. As one example of its early editorial stance, in 1976 London's \"Time Out\" published the names of 60 purported CIA agents stationed in England. Early issues had a print run of around 5,000 and would evolve to a weekly circulation of 110,000 as it shed its radical roots.\n\nThe flavour of the magazine was almost wholly the responsibility of its designer, Pearce Marchbank. Marchbank was invited by Tony Elliott to join the embryonic Time Out in 1971. Turning it into a weekly, he produced its classic logo, [and] established its strong identity and its editorial structure—all still used world-wide to this day. He also conceived and designed the first of the Time Out guide books. ... He continued to design for Time Out for many years. Each week, his powerful, witty Time Out covers became an essential part of London life. \n\nElliott launched \"Time Out New York\" (\"TONY\"), his North American magazine debut, in 1995. The magazine procured young and upcoming talent to provide cultural reviews for young New Yorkers at the time. The success of \"TONY\" led to the introduction of \"Time Out New York Kids\", a quarterly magazine aimed at families. The expansion continued with Elliott licensing the Time Out brand worldwide spreading the magazine to 39 cities including Istanbul, Dubai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Lisbon.\n\nAdditional Time Out products included travel magazines, city guides, and books. In 2010, Time Out became the official publisher of travel guides and tourist books for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\"Time Out\"s need to expand to digital platforms led to Elliott, sole owner of the group until November 2010, to sell half of \"Time Out\" London and 66 percent of \"TONY\" to private equity group Oakley Capital, valuing the company at £20million. The group, founded by Peter Dubens, was owned by Tony Elliott and Oakley Capital until 2016, the agreement provided capital for investment to expand the brand. \"Time Out\" has subsequently launched websites for an additional 33 cities including Delhi, Washington D.C., Boston, Manchester and Bristol.when it was listed on London's AIM stock exchange. In June 2016, Time Out Group underwent an IPO and is listed on London's AIM stock exchange.\n\nThe London edition of \"Time Out\" became a free magazine in September 2012. \"Time Out\"s London magazine was hand distributed at central London stations, and received its first official ABC Certificate for October 2012 showing distribution of over 305,000 copies per week which was the largest distribution in the history of the brand. This strategy increased revenue by 80 percent with continued upsurge. \"Time Out\" has also invited a number of guest columnists to write for the magazine. The columnist as of 2014 was Giles Coren.\n\nIn April 2015, \"Time Out\" switched its New York magazine to the free distribution model to increase the reader base and grow brand awareness. This transition doubled circulation by increasing its Web audience, estimated around 3.5 million unique visitors a month. \"Time Out\" increased its weekly magazine circulation to over 305,000 copies complementing millions of digital users of \"Time Out\" New York. Free magazines are distributed at bars, restaurants, gyms, subway stations, and theaters and the web content separate from the magazine is free. In addition, a subscription service is offered to those that prefer the magazine to be physically delivered and paid subscribers have access to a digital edition of the magazine.\n\nIn 1996, following the launch of \"TONY\" magazine, \"Time Out New York Kids\" was launched as a paid-for quarterly title available via subscription and news stand with a circulation of 55,000.\n\n\"Time Out Tel Aviv\" (in Hebrew) is sold once a week, covering the Tel Aviv, Israel, area.\n\nIn addition to magazines and travel books and websites, Time Out started opening branded food halls in 2014, starting with the Time Out Market Lisboa in Lisbon, Portugal.\n"}

The book has been republished as pirated translations in dozens of languages in numerous countries abroad, and notably found use by left-wing terror groups in the 1960s and 70s.\n\n\"Der totale Widerstand\" was first published in 1957 in seven volumes by the Swiss Non-Commissioned Officers' Association (\"Schweizer Unteroffiziersverband\", SUOV) with an intent of broad dissemination to the Swiss population. The book was a commercial success, being reprinted five times and selling in the tens of thousands, notably in West Germany and Austria. It became by far the most well-known of von Dach's more than a hundred works on military tactics.<ref name=\"MPR 1/2012\"></ref>\n\nThe book is a manual for irregular warfare against an occupying force, intended to be used by civilians rather than by soldiers. It presumes a form of irregular resistance involving no arms heavier than light infantry arms: rifles, hand grenades and mines.\n\nThe topics covered in the first volume include:\n\nThe other volumes describe the manufacture and use of basic weapons: chemical weapons (vol. 2), the \"Partisan\" 9mm submachine gun (vol. 3), the \"TARN\" pistol (vol. 4), improvised explosive devices (vol. 5), the \"TELL\" noise suppressor (vol. 6) and hand grenades (vol. 7).\n\nWhile popular in the militia officer corps, the book was not well received by senior Army leaders, who favored a defence policy based on conventional combined-arms and mechanized warfare rather than irregular warfare. In 1974, the Chief of the General Staff vetoed the publication of \"Total Resistance\" as an army manual, partly because of concerns that it advocated conduct that violated the laws of war. When the Swiss Army did establish a secret stay-behind organization, P-26, in the 1970s, it was conceived as a top-down, cadre-led structure rather than the broad, decentralized civilian resistance movement envisioned by von Dach.\n\nNonetheless, the book remains part of the curriculum of the Swiss Army Military Academy at the ETH Zurich as one of the \"classics of the history of strategy and the theory of war.\"\n\nThe book soon found unexpected success abroad. In 1965, U.S. special forces published an unauthorized translation entitled \"Total Resistance – Swiss Army Guide to Guerilla Warfare and Underground Operations\". Other pirated translations continued to be published in dozens of languages in countries ranging from Angola to Vietnam. In the Soviet Union, the book was derided as \"nonsense\" in a 1984 newspaper article.\n\n\"Total Resistance\" became notably popular as an instruction manual for several left-wing terror groups active in the 1960s and 70s. According to Swiss and European police reports of the time, it was widely disseminated in left-wing extremist circles, and its tactics were used in bomb attacks in Southern Tyrol, New York and Frankfurt, as well as in unrests in Paris.\n\nIn Germany, the book was often found in police searches, including with Red Army Faction members. Since 1988, \"Der totale Widerstand\" has been the only Swiss book whose distribution is restricted in Germany because it is indexed by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons as \"conducive to confusing the social ethics of children and young people, and to promote their inclination to violence\".\n"}

The hoard is now in National Museum Wales. The treasure consisted of 33 gold coins, 467 silver coins and a gold ring. This was the first English Civil War hoard found in Pembrokeshire.\n\nThis mansion had been the scene where the invasion of the French was first reported to Colonel Thomas Knox who was at a dance there on 23 February 1797. Knox, who had been appointed by his father William Knox went into a strategic withdrawal to Haverfordwest which is in land. The retreat of the \"Fishguard Fencibles\" was halted by Lord Cawdor who persuaded Knox to advance. The \"Fencibles\" who were local volunteers saw off the force of 1200 French convicts. It was reported the local population assisted in seeing off the \"last invasion of British soil\". The BBC reported that there was a local story that the guests at the dance hid their valuables and that when a hoard was discovered it was thought initially to have confirmed the tale.\n\nThe hoard can be dated from the date of the last coin that was included in the hoard and this came from 1647 or 1648. This date is at the end of English Civil War and these troubles are the probable reason for the hoard being deposited. There are over 200 hoards that date from the time of the civil war. This was the first civil war hoard found in Pembrokeshire. These goods were hidden by an outbuilding of the Tregwynt Mansion. They were discovered in 1996 as a result of building work resulting from the construction of a tennis court. Because a few coins had been found, the ground was searched by a metal detector and Roy Lewis discovered many more coins. By the end, a JCB digger was involved and in addition to the coins they also found lead sheeting which is thought to have covered the hoard and a ring with a motto inside it. The inscription reads \"Better death than false of faith\" (spelling updated).\n\nThe hoard was probably hidden at the time that Oliver Cromwell came to Pembrokeshire to settle the local Royalists who were in rebellion. The value at the time was over 50 pounds and this would have been over four years wages for an average soldier. The money may have been saved by Llewellin Harries who lived at the mansion at the time with his twelve children.\n\nThe treasure consisted of 33 gold coins, 467 silver coins and a gold Posie ring.
