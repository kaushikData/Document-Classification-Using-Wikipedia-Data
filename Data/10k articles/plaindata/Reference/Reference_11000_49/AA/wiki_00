{"id": "38306357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38306357", "title": "A History of British Birds (1843)", "text": "A History of British Birds (1843)\n\nWilliam Yarrell's A History of British Birds was first published as a whole in three volumes in 1843, having been serialized, three sheets every two months, over the previous six years. It is not a history of ornithology but a natural history, a handbook or field guide systematically describing every species of bird known to occur in Britain. A separate article of about six pages, containing an image, a description, and an account of worldwide distribution, together with reports of behaviour, is provided for each species.\n\nIt quickly became the standard reference work for a generation of British ornithologists, replacing Thomas Bewick's book of the same name through its increased scientific accuracy, but following Bewick in its mixture of scientific data, accurate illustrations, detailed descriptions and varied anecdotes, as well as in the use of small 'tail-piece' engravings at the ends of articles. This made the book attractive to the public as well as to specialists. Yarrell, a newsagent without university education, corresponded widely with eminent naturalists including Carl Linnaeus, Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Thomas Pennant to collect accurate information on the hundreds of species illustrated in the work.\n\nThe book is illustrated with over 500 drawings directly onto wood blocks, mostly by Alexander Fussell. These were then engraved by John Thompson. Publication was initially in 37 parts of three large folded sheets each; these were then collected and bound into volumes. Most of the copies were on octavo paper; some \"large paper\" format copies were printed in the larger royal octavo with just 50 copies in the very large imperial octavo format. Four editions were produced between 1843 and 1885.\n\nYarrell was aware of earlier bird handbooks, especially Bewick's. \"A History of British Birds\" used the same title as Bewick's popular book (1797–1804). Its approach, however, was significantly different in the extensiveness of Yarrell's correspondence and in the increased emphasis on scientific accuracy made possible by the rapid advance in ornithological knowledge in the nineteenth century.\n\nYarrell corresponded widely, consulted existing handbooks of birds, and made use of his membership of the Zoological Society of London and the Linnean Society to find out about recent discoveries. He referenced the work of, amongst others, the ornithologists William Macgillivray, John James Audubon, George Montagu, Prideaux John Selby, Leonard Jenyns, John Gould, Temminck, Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Heinrich von Kittlitz. During the six years of writing, with the regular publication of three-sheet instalments of his \"Birds\", many people across Britain and Europe sent him descriptions, observations and specimens for him to include, and the book is full of references to such contributions. Yarrell explicitly states in his Preface that\n\nIn some cases, Yarrell's correspondents and reference books enable him to add an account of a bird's distribution around the world. For the ringed plover, for example, Sven Nilsson speaks for Sweden and the Baltic coast; Mr Hewitson for Norway; Carl Linnaeus for Lapland; a Mr Scoresby for Iceland and Greenland; the zoologist Thomas Pennant for Russia and Siberia; the archaeologist Charles Fellows for Asia Minor [Turkey], and Coenraad Jacob Temminck for Japan. In the case of the wood sandpiper, Dr. Calvert sent a specimen from Malta; Selby and Dr. Andrew Smith, specimens from South Africa; others from India; Gould \"mentions having seen skins\" from \"Chili and the Islands of the Pacific\". Yarrell also describes his own observations, in this case with the words \"It [the wood sandpiper] is far from being numerous in the localities where I met with it... Although I met with the young in a downy state, and partially feathered, I only obtained one nest with eggs.\"\n\nYarrell broadly follows the lead of Bewick in describing each species in a separate section, with essentially no introduction. The first bird, the Egyptian vulture, is preceded by nothing more than the Index (there is no table of contents) and the heading \"British Birds\", though there is an introductory paragraph on page 2, inside the Egyptian vulture article. Like Bewick, Yarrell's sections begin with a large wood engraving, depicting the species against a more or less realistic background: that of the Egyptian vulture shows a pyramid and a pair of laden camels. An immediate difference from Bewick is the list of Latin names that follows, with \"Vultur percnopterus\" (Bewick), \"Neophron percnopterus\" (Selby, Jenyns, Eyton, and Gould), and \"Cathartes percnopterus\" (Temminck). This care reflects both the rapidly advancing state of ornithology in the early nineteenth century, and Yarrell's more scientific approach.\n\nThe account of the first species of each genus, such as the vulture genus \"Neophron\", includes a paragraph on \"Generic Characters\", describing the beak, legs, wings and any distinguishing features useful for identification. These features are often small, requiring examination or measurement of specimens in the hand, reflecting the fact, repeated many times in the book, that those interested in birds shot them to collect unusual specimens. The Egyptian vulture was recorded from a specimen in Somerset, England, \"now in the possession of the Rev. A. Mathew, of Kilve in Somersetshire, [which] was shot near that place in October 1825.\" The bird was one of a pair, but the other was too wary to be captured. Yarrell then proceeds to describe where the bird can be found, its behaviour and diet, and its detailed appearance. The Egyptian vulture takes up six pages, which is typical; the golden eagle gets eight pages, the hobby only four.\n\nAlso like Bewick, many articles end with a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.\n\nAs well as straightforward details of each bird, Yarrell adds many stories, chosen from his own experience, from his correspondents, or from often recently published accounts, to enliven the description of each species according to his taste.\n\nFor example, the \"Fulmar Petrel\" quotes John Macgillivray's article \"in a recent number of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal\", describing a visit to St Kilda in June 1840, for a page and a half. It begins:\n\nMacgillivray is similarly relied upon for accounts of the pink-footed goose and the goosander as far as the Hebrides are concerned.\n\nAs with Bewick, Yarrell is unsentimental about hunting. Landrails or corncrakes \"are considered most delicate as articles of food, and in such high estimation, that two Landrails are said to be a present for a queen.\" But he constantly provides accurate stories that inform and entertain the reader:\n\nIn addition to the work of collating descriptions and commissioning drawings and engravings, Yarrell also made his own scientific observations of certain topics, including the description of the trachea of several species, and a detailed account, occupying seven pages, of the skull, jaw, musculature, and feeding behaviour of the common crossbill, \"Loxia curvirostra\". The article for the crossbill is one of the longest in the book, at 20 pages. Yarrell introduces his special interest in this bird's head as follows:\n\nYarrell at once goes on to explain that the crossbills are unique in making use of \"any lateral motion of the mandibles, and it is my object here to describe the bony structure and muscles by which this peculiar and powerful action is obtained.\" He explains the anatomy and how the jaws are closed, and then how their unique side-to-side motion is achieved:\n\nHe then quotes a Mr. Townson's account of how crossbills feed on pine cones, inserting their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways, opening the cone. Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy, describing in detail (nearly a page) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales. Only then does he return to Mr. Townson, quoting him as saying \"The degree of the lateral power is surprising, and they are fond of exercising it for amusement; they are, therefore, not a little mischievous. My pets would often come to my table whilst I was writing, and carry off my pencils ... and tear them to pieces in a minute.\" Yarrell then adds an observation of his own, and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist: \"Notwithstanding Buffon's assertion to the contrary, they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds ... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument.\" He goes on to criticise Buffon's description of the crossbill's beak as \"an error and defect of Nature, and a useless deformity\" as \"an erroneous and hasty conclusion\". Yarrell concludes by writing \"I have never met with a more interesting, or more beautiful example, of the adaptation of means to an end, than is to be found in the beak, the tongue, and their muscles, in the Crossbill\".\n\nAlexander Fussell created most of the drawings for the book. Yarrell thanks Fussell in his Preface for \"nearly five hundred of the drawings on wood here employed\", and John Thompson (1785–1866) and his sons for the \"very long series of engravings\" of the drawings. He also thanks his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley for their care and skill. The pen for the remaining drawings, if any (the title page asserts there are 520 in the book), is not stated. As well as the figures of birds, there are 59 tail-pieces (following Bewick, small woodcuts to fill in the spaces at ends of articles), of which some are whimsical, like Bewick's, but many illustrate anatomical details, especially breastbones and windpipes, and others, although decorative, realistically depict aspects of bird behaviour or human interaction with birds. For example, the tail-piece for the \"Jack Snipe\" shows a bittern among reeds, swallowing a frog, while that for the \"Common Bittern\" shows \"a mode of shooting an Eagle from a pit\".\n\nFussell's work began in 1837 and continued for six years. Many of the drawings were from skins or stuffed specimens, though every bird species is illustrated with a lifelike drawing of the bird standing (or rarely, flying or swimming) in a natural setting. Additional drawings depict nests, feathers, and details of bird anatomy including feet, breastbones, and windpipes. Simon Holloway suggests that Fussell and the engravers Charles Thompson and sons probably made all the illustrations for the first three editions of Yarrell's \"Birds\". Only in the fourth, rewritten edition of 1871–85 were illustrations by other artists (Charles Whymper, J. G. Keulemans, Edward Neale) added. Some of the bird figures, such as \"The Snowy Owl\" and \"Richard's Pipit\" in Volume 1, are signed \"A. FUSSEL DEL.\" (A. Fussel drew this), but most are entirely unsigned. Some few, such as \"The Black Redstart\" and \"The Common Cuckoo\", are signed \"THOMPSON DEL ET SC.\" (Thompson drew and cut this), so in these cases Fussell was not involved.\n\nThe first edition was organized as follows into four \"Orders\" of birds. These do not correspond exactly with later taxonomy of the class.\n\n\n\n\nContemporaries enjoyed Yarrell's \"Birds\", which sold well through various editions. In \"The Birds of Shakespeare\" (1871), James Edmund Harting notes that \"an excellent dissertation on the organ of voice in the raven will be found in the second volume of Yarrell's 'British Birds'\", and Harting refers to Yarrell when he needs ornithological facts.\n\nThomas R Forbes, in his biographical paper on Yarrell, writes that \"All [editions of \"Birds\"] are outstanding because of the author's clear, narrative style, accuracy, careful scholarship, and unassuming charm.\"\n\nSimon Holloway, in his \"Historical Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland 1875–1900\", writes that Yarrell's \"Birds\" was \"far more thoroughly dealt with than in Bewick's work and, once again, was liberally illustrated with wood-engravings\". He adds that the book was \"also hugely influential in its day\", being \"reasonably cheap\", and that it was the book that the future authors of \"the county avifaunas were bought as children and remained their standard textbook\", i.e. that Yarrell influenced a whole generation of ornithological authors in Britain. Holloway used Yarrell's figures to accompany the account of each species of bird in his \"Historical Atlas\".\n\nThe Soffer Ornithology Collection at Amherst College observes that \"Yarrell's History was the standard illustrated British bird book of the 19th century and one of the historically great ornithological works. In well chosen prose, Yarrell provides synonymy, generic characters, a description with measurements, local and general distribution and a life history including nidification and eggs and arrival and departure times for each species. The wood engraved text figures have never been surpassed using this technique in terms of accuracy and artistic merit.\" Soffer suggests that the \"fourth edition is perhaps the best, embellished as it is by contributions from Alfred Newton and Howard Saunders\".\n\nIn \"Ornithology in Scotland\", Yarrell's \"Birds\" is described as \"written by an Englishman and illustrated in a manner calculated to attract the non-scientific ornithologist right at the opening of the era of the great Victorian naturalists\". It eclipsed the unfortunate MacGillivray, whose \"British Birds\" in contrast \"never achieved real popularity\", partly because it was illustrated strictly technically, and partly because it appeared at the same time as the first part of Yarrell's work.\n\nThe bookseller Isabelline Books argues that \"Yarrell’s History [of British Birds] probably contains the richest collection of colour descriptions in any bird book in the English language\", with \"various parts of the Bee-Eater described as verditer blue, saffron-yellow, chestnut, duck-green, verdigris-green, buff, greyish-brown and fawn colour. The Roller as berlin-blue, brownish-yellow, coppery-purple and light cinnamon. The Spotted Eagle as chocolate-brown, pale wood-brown and reddish liver-brown. The Golden Oriole had lead-colour toes, other parts oil-green, brocoli-brown and wine-yellow. The Cuneate-Tailed Gull was smoke-brown and pearl-grey, the Turnstone had ferruginus portions, the Little Auk was livid-brown and sooty-brown, while the American Bittern was leaden-brown. The variations in these terms seems to be inexhaustable. They can now be considered a , somewhat romantic or just pure pedantry on the author’s part. But it was a serious attempt to try to define quite subtle colourings.\"\n\nYarrell's \"Birds\" was mentioned in a well-known letter to \"The Times\" in 1913, when a Fellow of the Royal Society, the naturalist and paleontologist Richard Lydekker, wrote on 6 February that he had heard a cuckoo, explaining that though contrary to Yarrell's statement that records of the bird calling as early as March \"must be treated with suspicion, if not with incredulity\", it was a definite fact. Six days later on 12 February 1913, Lydekker wrote again, confessing that \"the note was uttered by a bricklayer's labourer\". Letters about the first cuckoo became a tradition in the newspaper.\n\n\"Birds\" was first published \"in thirty-seven parts of three sheets each, at intervals of two months; the first Part was issued in July 1837, and the last in May 1843.\" The sheets were then collected into three volumes, with the addition of \"many occurrences of rare birds, and of some that were even new to Britain\". The additional birds were listed and briefly described in the Preface, and \"the new subjects have been engraved on single leaves, so paged, that the bookbinder may insert these separate leaves among the birds of the genus to which each respectively belongs.\"\n\nThe book came out in three different formats. The smallest is \"octavo\"; the two \"large paper\" formats are \"royal octavo\" and \"imperial octavo\". A supplement appeared in 1845; it was bound into the third volume of the rare \"imperial octavo\" edition of 1845, of which only 50 copies were printed.\n\nThe fourth edition was revised and extended by the ornithologists Alfred Newton and Howard Saunders, with some additional illustrations bringing the total number of engravings up to 564.\n\n\nYarrell's tail-pieces, small engravings fitted into spaces at the ends of articles, follow the tradition established by Bewick, but differ in rarely being whimsical. Many are secondary illustrations showing details of bird anatomy or features useful in identification.\n\n"}

Since retiring, he has operated the World Xtreme Wrestling promotion and trained wrestlers at the Wild Samoan Training Center.\n\nAnoa'i was born on the island of Western Samoa, a trust territory that was then administered by New Zealand, and his family relocated to San Francisco, California in the United States when he was young. At the age of 17, Anoa'i enlisted in the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps.\n\nUpon leaving the Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Anoaʻi began training as a wrestler under family friends Rocky Johnson and Peter Maivia. He later received supplementary training from Kurt Von Steiger. He wrestled his first match in 1971, in Phoenix, Arizona. He then trained his brother Sika, and the siblings formed a tag team known best as The Wild Samoans.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, The Wild Samoans wrestled for the Canadian Stampede Wrestling promotion (where they received further training from Stu Hart) and for numerous National Wrestling Alliance affiliates. In 1978, The Wild Samoans traveled to Japan to wrestle for the International Wrestling Alliance, winning the IWA Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn 1979, The Wild Samoans joined the World Wrestling Federation, where they were managed by Lou Albano and referred to as \"Albano's Wildmen\". The \"wild\" nature of the brothers was conveyed through their unorthodox behavior (which included communicating only in unintelligible grunts and consuming unprepared raw fish, during interviews and while approaching the ring). While in the WWF, The Wild Samoans won the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Both members also challenged Bob Backlund for the WWF Heavyweight Championship on several occasions. They left the promotion in 1980.\n\nThe Wild Samoans then wrestled in Mid-South Wrestling and Jim Crockett Promotions, before returning to the WWF (renamed from WWWF in 1979) in 1983 and regaining the WWF World Tag Team Championship. After Sika suffered an injury, the tag team was supplemented by Afa's son Samu (the relationship was not acknowledged on TV). The trio remained in the WWF until 1984. According to Afa, he lost his job because a few days earlier, Afa didn't come to work because he was at the birth of his son. Afa Anoaʻi returned to the WWF for a third time in 1992, as the manager and occasional tag partner of The Headshrinkers (Samu and Anoai's nephew, Fatu). He wrestled his final match on May 22, 1994, teaming with The Headshrinkers to defeat The Quebecers and Johnny Polo at the Rosemont Horizon. Anoaʻi left the WWF in mid-1995.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, he began training wrestlers at his Wild Samoan Training Facility, along with Sika. On March 31, 2007, the Wild Samoans were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Samu and Sika's son, Matt. He was the wrestling trainer for Darren Aronofsky's 2008 film, \"The Wrestler\".\n\nIn 1999, Afa and Lynn Anoaʻi started the Usos Foundation, a non-profit organization aiming to turn youth away from drugs, gangs and poverty by providing scholarships to the Wild Samoans Training Center.\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.wswrestlingschool.com/\n\n"}

He was a highly influential comics historian, particularly of British comics from the 19th century to the 1940s.\n\nGifford was also a committed comic collector of British and US comics, and owned what has been called the \"world's largest collection of British comics.\" \n\nGifford wrote, drew and often created a wide selection of back-up strips that featured in a number of the \"Marvelman\" titles, usually one-page humour strips, as well as the \"Marvelman Family\" strip in its own title. Gifford used a variety of pen-names for the work, including Belteshazzar Oakworm, Clubtwee Gleeb and 'Fred Granule Bepp'., Joe King, Jack Upp and Belle Tupp. These humour strips may have been reprinted across a number of titles in the L.

In 2018, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) began implementing internationalized country code top-level domains, consisting of language-native characters when displayed in an end-user application. Creation and delegation of ccTLDs is described in RFC 1591, corresponding to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.\n\nAs of 2015, IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:\n\n\nIANA is responsible for determining an appropriate trustee for each ccTLD. Administration and control are then delegated to that trustee, which is responsible for the policies and operation of the domain. The current delegation can be determined from IANA's list of ccTLDs. Individual ccTLDs may have varying requirements and fees for registering subdomains. There may be a local-presence requirement (for instance, citizenship or other connection to the ccTLD), as, for example, the Canadian (ca) and German (de) domains, or registration may be open.\n\nThe first registered ccTLDs were .us, .uk, and .il, all registered in 1985.

There may be a significant delay between withdrawal from ISO 3166-1 and deletion from the DNS; for example, ZR ceased to be an ISO 3166-1 code in 1997, but the zr ccTLD was not deleted until 2001. Other ccTLDs corresponding to obsolete ISO 3166-1 codes have not yet been deleted. In some cases they may never be deleted due to the amount of disruption this would cause for a heavily used ccTLD. In particular, the Soviet Union's ccTLD su remains in use more than twenty years after SU was removed from ISO 3166-1.\n\nThe historical country codes dd for the German Democratic Republic and yd for South Yemen were eligible for a ccTLD, but not allocated; see also de and ye.\n\nThe temporary reassignment of country code cs (Serbia and Montenegro) until its split into rs and me (Serbia and Montenegro, respectively) led to some controversies about the stability of ISO 3166-1 country codes, resulting in a second edition of ISO 3166-1 in 2007 with a guarantee that retired codes will not be reassigned for at least 50 years, and the replacement of RFC 3066 by RFC 4646 for country codes used in language tags in 2006.\n\nThe previous ISO 3166-1 code for Yugoslavia, YU, was removed by ISO on 2003-07-23, but the yu ccTLD remained in operation. Finally, after a two-year transition to Serbian rs and Montenegrin me, the .yu domain was phased out in March 2010.\n\nAustralia was originally assigned the oz country code, which was later changed to au with the .oz domains moved to .oz.au.\n\nAn internationalized country code top-level domain (IDN ccTLD) is a top-level domain with a specially encoded domain name that is displayed in an end user application, such as a web browser, in its language-native script or alphabet, such as the Arabic alphabet, or a non-alphabetic writing system, such as Chinese characters. IDN ccTLDs are an application of the internationalized domain name (IDN) system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.\n\nICANN started to accept applications for IDN ccTLDs in November 2009, and installed the first set into the Domain Names System in May 2010. The first set was a group of Arabic names for the countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. By May 2010, 21 countries had submitted applications to ICANN, representing 11 languages.\n\nICANN requires all potential international TLDs to use at least one letter that does not resemble a Latin letter, or have at least three letters, in an effort to avoid IDN homograph attacks. Nor shall the international domain name look like another domain name, even if they have different alphabets. Between Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, for example, this could happen.\n\nLenient registration restrictions on certain ccTLDs have resulted in various domain hacks. Domain names such as I.am, tip.it, start.at and go.to form well-known English phrases, whereas others combine the second-level domain and ccTLD to form one word or one title, creating domains such as blo.gs of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (gs), youtu.be of Belgium (be), del.icio.us of the United States (us), and cr.yp.to of Tonga (to). The .co domain of Colombia has been cited since 2010 as a potential competitor to generic TLDs for commercial use, because it may be an abbreviation for \"company\".\n\nSeveral ccTLDs allow the creation of emoji domains.\n\nSome ccTLDs may also be used for typosquatting. The domain \"cm\" of Cameroon has generated interest due to the possibility that people might miss typing the letter \"o\" for sites in the \"com\".\n\nSome of the world's smallest countries and non-sovereign or colonial entities with their own country codes have opened their TLDs for worldwide commercial use, some of them free like .tk.\n\n\n"}

It is a symmetrical five-bay structure, clapboarded, two stories tall, with three small dormers through the roof, and a central entry door. Compare it with the architecture of the Ropes Mansion and the Peirce-Nichols House, also in Salem, and also owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.

{"id": "339764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339764", "title": "Deed", "text": "Deed\n\nA deed (anciently \"an evidence\") is any legal instrument in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an interest, right, or property and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some jurisdictions, sealed. It is commonly associated with transferring (conveyancing) title to property. The deed has a greater presumption of validity and is less rebuttable than an instrument signed by the party to the deed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include conveyances, commissions, licenses, patents, diplomas, and conditionally powers of attorney if executed as deeds. The deed is the modern descendant of the medieval charter, and delivery is thought to symbolically replace the ancient ceremony of livery of seisin.\n\nThe traditional phrase \"signed, sealed and delivered\" refers to the practice of seals; however, attesting witnesses have replaced seals to some extent. Agreements under seal are also called contracts by deed or \"specialty\"; in the United States, a specialty is enforceable without consideration. In some jurisdictions, specialties have a liability limitation period of double that of a simple contract and allow for a third party beneficiary to enforce an undertaking in the deed, thereby overcoming the doctrine of privity. Specialties, as a form of contract, are bilateral and can therefore be distinguished from covenants, which, being also under seal, are unilateral promises.\n\nAt common law, to be valid and enforceable, a deed must meet several requirements:\n\nConditions attached to the acceptance of a deed are known as covenants. A deed indented or indenture is one executed in two or more parts according to the number of parties, which were formerly separated by cutting in a curved or indented line known as the chirograph. A deed poll is one executed in one part, by one party, having the edge polled or cut even, and includes simple grants and appointments.\n\nIn the transfer of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various warranties. The precise name and nature of these warranties differ by jurisdiction. Often, however, the basic differences between them is the degree to which the grantor warrants the title. The grantor may give a general warranty of title against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. The latter type of deed is usually known as a \"special warranty deed\". While a \"general warranty deed\" was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, special warranty deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions.\n\nA third type of deed, known as a \"bargain and sale deed\", implies that the grantor has the right to convey title but makes no warranties against encumbrances. This type of deed is most commonly used by court officials or fiduciaries that hold the property by force of law rather than title, such as properties seized for unpaid taxes and sold at sheriff's sale, or an executor.\n\nA so-called \"quitclaim deed\" is (in most jurisdictions) actually not a deed at all—it is actually an estoppel disclaiming rights of the person signing it to property.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a deed of trust is used as an alternative to a mortgage. A deed of trust is not used to transfer property directly. It is commonly used in some states — California, for example — to transfer title to land to a “trustee”, usually a trust or title company, which holds the title as security (\"in escrow\") for a loan. When the loan is paid off, title is transferred to the borrower by recording a release of the obligation, and the trustee's contingent ownership is extinguished. Otherwise, upon default, the trustee will liquidate the property with a new deed and offset the lender's loss with the proceeds.\n\n\n\"Sanad\", also spelt as \"sunnud\", was a deed granted to the rulers of native princely states in British India confirming them in their ruling position in return for their allegiance to the British Raj.\nSince the extinction of the royal bloodline would be a ground for annexation of a principality by the British, some rulers were also granted \"sanads\" of adoption. Devised as a reward for loyalty to British rule in India, especially after the Indian rebellion of 1857, such deeds gave a ruler the right to adopt chosen heirs from local noble families in case of lack of direct issue. Among the rulers that were given Sanads of adoption, Takht Singh, Jaswant Singh of Bharatpur, as well as the rulers of Nagod State, Samthar State and the Chaube Jagirs are worth mentioning.\n\nThe main clauses of a deed of conveyance are:\n\nUsually the transfer of ownership of real estate is registered at a cadastre in the United Kingdom. In most parts of the United States, deeds must be submitted to the recorder of deeds, who acts as a cadastre, to be registered. An unrecorded deed may be valid proof of ownership between the parties, but may have no effect upon third-party claims until disclosed or recorded. A local statute may prescribe a period beyond which unrecorded deeds become void as to third parties, at least as to intervening acts.\n\nOwnership transfer may also be crafted within deeds to pass by demise, as where a property is held in concurrent estate such as \"joint tenants with right of survivorship\" (JTWROS) or \"tenants by the entirety\". In each case, the title to the property immediately and automatically vests in the named survivor(s) upon the death of the other tenant(s).\n\nIn most states joint tenancy with the right of survivorship requires all owners to have equal interests in the property, meaning upon sale or partition of the property, all owners would receive an equal distribution of the proceeds.\n\nJoint ownership may also be by tenants in common (TIC). In some states, joint ownership is presumed to be as tenants in common unless the parties are married and the deed so states or the deed sets for joint tenants with right of survivorship. Upon death, the decedent's share passes to his or her estate.\n\nA life estate is the right to use, possess and enjoy the property for a period of time measured by the natural life of a person or persons. When all life tenants are dead, the remainderman holds full title.\n\nWhen deeds are taken as joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) or joint tenants in common (TIC), any co-owner can file a petition for partition to dissolve the tenancy relationship. JTWROS deed holders always take the property in equal shares; therefore, if the partnership is dissolved through partition, the proceeds must be equally distributed between all of the co-owners without regard to how much each co-owner contributed to the purchase price of the property. No credits would be allowed for any excess contributions to the purchase price. For example, if A and B co-own property as JTWROS and A contributed 80% of the purchase price, A and B would still receive equal distributions upon partition. On the other hand, TIC deed holders may be granted at partition a credit for unequal contributions to purchase price. During either partition, credits may be awarded to any co-owner who may have contributed in excess of his share to the property expenses after taking deed to the property. Credits may be allowed for utilities and maintenance; however, credits for improvements may not be allowed unless the improvements actually added substantial value to the property.\n\nIn the United States, a pardon of the President was once considered to be a deed and thus needed to be accepted by the recipient. This made it impossible to grant a pardon posthumously. However, in the case of Henry Ossian Flipper, this view was altered when President Bill Clinton pardoned him in 1999.\n\nThe United Kingdom, England and Wales operate a 'property register'. Title deeds are documents showing ownership, as well as rights, obligations, or mortgages on the property. Since around 2000, compulsory registration has been required for all properties mortgaged or transferred. The details of rights, obligations, and covenants referred to in deeds will be transferred to the register, a contract describing the property ownership.\n\nThe main difference between a deed and an agreement is that the deed is generally signed by only one person / party. Examples of a deed are deeds of hypothecation for creating charge on movable properties in favour of the banks/financial institutions etc.\n\nAn agreement by its name suggests that there should be at least two parties signing/approving the same. Examples of an agreement are agreement to sale, loan agreement etc.\n\nAt common law, ownership was proven via an unbroken chain of title deeds. The Torrens title system is an alternative way of proving ownership. First introduced in South Australia in 1858 by Sir Robert Torrens and adopted later by the other Australian states and other countries, ownership under Torrens title is proven by possession of a certificate of title and the corresponding entry in the property register. This system removes risks associated with unregistered deeds and fraudulent or otherwise incorrect transactions. It is much easier and cheaper to administer, lowering transaction costs. Some Australian properties are still conveyed using a chain of title deeds – usually properties that have been owned by the same family since the nineteenth century – and these are often referred to as 'Old System' deeds.\n\nA deed that is recorded, but is not connected to the chain of title of the property, is called a wild deed. A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. Haupt has stated that\nBecause title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it's possible that a deed won't be discovered even though it was recorded. \"Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his deed. Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her deed. But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's deed is outside the chain of title. In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed.\" A deed that is outside the chain of title is called a wild deed. The general rule is that a subsequent purchaser is not held to have constructive notice of a wild deed. In the example, Cooper's title is unprotected against subsequent good faith purchasers. Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn. A court would rule that Dunn has good title to the property, not Cooper.\n\nA wild deed has been described as a deed \"executed by a stranger to the record title hung out in the air like Mahomet's coffin.\" Mahomet is an archaic spelling of Muhammad. There is a legend that the Prophet Muhammad's coffin was suspended without visible supports, from the ceiling of his tomb, just as a wild deed just hangs there, not touching the chain of title.\n\n"}

It differs from other forms of reproduction by attempting to replicate the source as accurately as possible in scale, color, condition, and other material qualities. For books and manuscripts, this also entails a complete copy of all pages; hence, an incomplete copy is a \"partial facsimile\". Facsimiles are sometimes used by scholars to research a source that they do not have access to otherwise, and by museums and archives for media preservation and conservation. Many are sold commercially, often accompanied by a volume of commentary. They may be produced in limited editions, typically of 500–2,000 copies, and cost the equivalent of a few thousand United States dollars. The term \"fax\" is a shortened form of \"facsimile\" though most faxes are not reproductions of the quality expected in a true facsimile.\n\nAdvances in the art of facsimile are closely related to advances in printmaking. Maps, for instance, were the focus of early explorations in making facsimiles, although these examples often lack the rigidity to the original source that is now expected. An early example is the Abraham Ortelius map (1598). Innovations during the 18th century, especially in the realms of lithography and aquatint, facilitated an explosion in the number of facsimiles of old master drawings that could be studied from afar.\n\nImportant illuminated manuscripts like Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry are not only on display to the public as facsimiles, but available in high quality to scholars. However, unlike normal book reproductions, facsimiles remain truer to the original colors—which is especially important for illuminated manuscripts—and preserve defects.\n\nFacsimiles are best suited to printed or hand-written documents, and not to items such as three-dimensional objects or oil paintings with unique surface texture. Reproductions of those latter objects are often referred to as replicas.\n\n"}

It depicts two figures, one male and one female, seated beside each other on a bench, both facing slightly to the left. It is Moore's only sculpture depicting a single pair of adult figures. Moore's records suggest it was originally known as \"Two Seated Figures\".\n\nTen bronze casts of the high maquette were cast in 1952. Five bronze casts of the high full-size sculpture were made in 1953, with one further cast in 1957 and another in the 1980s, creating an edition of \"5 +2\" (five for sale, and two artist's copies). Examples are held by the Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum, Glenkiln Sculpture Park, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Norton Simon Museum, Tate Gallery, MOA Museum of Art, and the Henry Moore Foundation.\n\nAccording to Moore, speaking years later, the work was inspired by double statues of male and female figures from Ancient Egypt, and by fairy tales read to his daughter Mary. Art critics have suggested links with the accession of Elizabeth II in 1952, and have identified a strikingly similar photograph of Moore and his wife Irina seated beside each other c.1952, in which Moore has one hand clenched in his lap and the other on the arm of the sofa, and Irina sits beside him with her fingers interlaced.\n\nIt was based on preliminary drawings of seated figures from the late 1940s. Inspiration came to Moore from playing with pieces of wax which became an initial maquette in 1952. He first created a bearded head with a crown which became the \"king\" figure, then the female \"queen\" and the bench. The king had a clenched fist, and the feet were little defined. The maquette had a narrow squared frame behind the figures, defining the space, recalling similar frames used by Alberto Giacometti for example in his \"The Nose\" and \"The Cage\", and the frames used repeatedly in the paintings of Francis Bacon, such as his \"Three Studies of the Male Back\". The high maquette was later cast in an edition of ten bronzes (LH 348). Examples were sold at Sotheby's in 2001 for £531,500, at Christie's in 2010 for over US$2.8m, and at Sotheby's in 2016 for £1.1m.\n\nA copy of the maquette was made in plaster, but only fragments survive. It was used to scale up the sculpture to a full-size plaster working model, \"Maquette for King and Queen 1952–3\". Anthony Caro made a three quarter size terracotta model of the queen figure, which was cast in bronze in an edition of five, as \"Seated Figure 1952–3\" (LH 345). In this work, the hands are ill defined, and head does not have the crown-like looping feature.\n\nThe full size sculpture is high. It depicts two figures, one male and one female, seated beside each other on a bench, both facing slightly to the left. \n\nThe male figure to the left is slightly taller and broader, and sits slightly further back. It has two angular jawlines that reach forward towards a prominent chin, where it meets a third line marking the nose, with excavated cheeks and eyehole pierced between the nose ridge. There is a semi-circular loop adornment on top of the head, like a crown. The figure has narrow arms, with one hand one in the figure's lap and the other resting on the bench. The broad, flattened torso has few features and it is probably clothed. The legs are mostly covered by a folded tunic, with ankles and bare feet visible, feet resting on the ground. The hollowed concave back of the figure is incised with vertical lines recalling a backbone.\n\nThe female figure to the right is in a similar seated pose. It has a similar flattened face with pierced eyehole but no prominent jawline. There are incised eyelashes around the hole on the left side of the face. Bumps at the back of the head suggests a piled up arrangement of hair, and a loop over the head suggests a diadem or tiara. The figure has a similar flattened body, but with two domed breasts. Its thin arms lead to hands clasped on the figure's lap. It is also wearing a tunic, with pleats that cover most of the legs except the feet. \n\nMoore paid special attention to hands in the final model, to give it additional interest for the viewer. He used the hands of his wife Irina and his six year old daughter Mary, and others, as models . Moore's assistant Alan Ingham modelled for the feet of the king figure. The head of the queen figure was remodelled three times before Moore was satisfied. In the final work, Moore left out the square frame behind the figures in the maquette: he said it made them look like they were goalkeepers at a soccer game.\n\nMoore completed a full-size model in plaster in 1953,and it was cast at the Art Bronze Foundry in London, using the lost wax technique to create pieces that were then welded together, to create an edition of 4+1 (four for sale, and one artist's copy). A fifth numbered cast and second artist's copy were cast later.\n\nThe first full-size cast of the sculpture was exhibited at the Second Biennial for Sculpture at Middelheim Park in Antwerp in 1953.

{"id": "18508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18508", "title": "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol", "text": "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n\nThe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP ) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network. As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. Similarly, a telephone directory is a list of subscribers with an address and a phone number.\n\nLDAP is specified in a series of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Standard Track publications called Request for Comments (RFCs), using the description language ASN.1. The latest specification is Version 3, published as RFC 4511 (a road map to the technical specifications is provided by RFC4510).\n\nA common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords. This allows many different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.\n\nLDAP is based on a simpler subset of the standards contained within the X.500 standard. Because of this relationship, LDAP is sometimes called X.500-lite.\n\nTelecommunication companies' understanding of directory requirements were well developed after some 70 years of producing and managing telephone directories. These companies introduced the concept of directory services to information technology and computer networking, their input culminating in the comprehensive X.500 specification, a suite of protocols produced by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the 1980s.\n\nX.500 directory services were traditionally accessed via the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which required the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack. LDAP was originally intended to be a lightweight alternative protocol for accessing X.500 directory services through the simpler (and now widespread) TCP/IP protocol stack. This model of directory access was borrowed from the DIXIE and Directory Assistance Service protocols.\n\nThe protocol was originally created by Tim Howes of the University of Michigan, Steve Kille of Isode Limited, Colin Robbins of Nexor and Wengyik Yeong of Performance Systems International, circa 1993, as a successor to DIXIE and DAS. Mark Wahl of Critical Angle Inc., Tim Howes, and Steve Kille started work in 1996 on a new version of LDAP, LDAPv3, under the aegis of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). LDAPv3, first published in 1997, superseded LDAPv2 and added support for extensibility, integrated the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, and better aligned the protocol to the 1993 edition of X.500. Further development of the LDAPv3 specifications themselves and of numerous extensions adding features to LDAPv3 has come through the IETF.\n\nIn the early engineering stages of LDAP, it was known as \"Lightweight Directory Browsing Protocol\", or \"LDBP\". It was renamed with the expansion of the scope of the protocol beyond directory browsing and searching, to include directory update functions. It was given its \"Lightweight\" name because it was not as network intensive as its DAP predecessor and thus was more easily implemented over the Internet due to its relatively modest bandwidth usage.\n\nLDAP has influenced subsequent Internet protocols, including later versions of X.500, XML Enabled Directory (XED), Directory Service Markup Language (DSML), Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML), and the Service Location Protocol (SLP).\n\nA client starts an LDAP session by connecting to an LDAP server, called a Directory System Agent (DSA), by default on TCP and UDP port 389, or on port 636 for LDAPS (LDAP over SSL, see below). The client then sends an operation request to the server, and the server sends responses in return. With some exceptions, the client does not need to wait for a response before sending the next request, and the server may send the responses in any order. All information is transmitted using Basic Encoding Rules (BER).\n\nThe client may request the following operations:\n\nIn addition the server may send \"Unsolicited Notifications\" that are not responses to any request, e.g. before the connection is timed out.\n\nA common alternative method of securing LDAP communication is using an SSL tunnel. The default port for LDAP over SSL is 636. The use of LDAP over SSL was common in LDAP Version 2 (LDAPv2) but it was never standardized in any formal specification. This usage has been deprecated along with LDAPv2, which was officially retired in 2003. Global Catalog is available by default on ports 3268, and 3269 for LDAPS.\n\nThe protocol provides an interface with directories that follow the 1993 edition of the X.500 model:\n\nA DN may change over the lifetime of the entry, for instance, when entries are moved within a tree. To reliably and unambiguously identify entries, a UUID might be provided in the set of the entry's \"operational attributes\".\n\nAn entry can look like this when represented in LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) (LDAP itself is a binary protocol):\n\n\"codice_3\" is the distinguished name of the entry; it is neither an attribute nor a part of the entry. \"codice_4\" is the entry's RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), and \"codice_5\" is the DN of the parent entry, where \"codice_6\" denotes 'Domain Component'. The other lines show the attributes in the entry. Attribute names are typically mnemonic strings, like \"codice_7\" for common name, \"codice_6\" for domain component, \"codice_9\" for e-mail address, and \"codice_10\" for surname.\n\nA server holds a subtree starting from a specific entry, e.g. \"codice_5\" and its children. Servers may also hold references to other servers, so an attempt to access \"codice_12\" could return a \"referral\" or \"continuation reference\" to a server that holds that part of the directory tree. The client can then contact the other server. Some servers also support \"chaining\", which means the server contacts the other server and returns the results to the client.\n\nLDAP rarely defines any ordering: The server may return the values of an attribute, the attributes in an entry, and the entries found by a search operation in any order. This follows from the formal definitions - an entry is defined as a set of attributes, and an attribute is a set of values, and sets need not be ordered.\n\nThe ADD operation inserts a new entry into the directory-server database. If the distinguished name in the add request already exists in the directory, then the server will not add a duplicate entry but will set the result code in the add result to decimal 68, \"entryAlreadyExists\".\nIn the above example, codice_13 must not exist, and codice_14 must exist.\n\nWhen an LDAP session is created, that is, when an LDAP client connects to the server, the authentication state of the session\nis set to anonymous. The BIND operation establishes the authentication state for a session.\n\nSimple BIND and SASL PLAIN can send the user's DN and password in plaintext, so the connections utilizing either Simple or SASL PLAIN\nshould be encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). The server typically checks the password against the codice_15\nattribute in the named entry. Anonymous BIND (with empty DN and password) resets the connection to anonymous state.\n\nSASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) BIND provides authentication services through a\nwide range of mechanisms, e.g. Kerberos or the client certificate sent with\nTLS.\n\nBIND also sets the LDAP protocol version by sending a version number in the form of an integer. If the client requests a version that the server does not support,\nthe server must set the result code in the BIND response to the code for a protocol error. Normally clients should use LDAPv3, which is the\ndefault in the protocol but not always in LDAP libraries.\n\nBIND had to be the first operation in a session in LDAPv2, but is not required as of LDAPv3. In LDAPv3, each\nsuccessful BIND request changes the authentication state of the session and each unsuccessful BIND request resets the authentication state\nof the session.\n\nTo delete an entry, an LDAP client transmits a properly formed delete request to the server.\n\nThe Search operation is used to both search for and read entries. Its parameters are:\n\nThe server returns the matching entries and potentially continuation references. These may be returned in any order. The final result will include the result code.\n\nThe Compare operation takes a DN, an attribute name and an attribute value, and checks if the named entry contains that attribute with that value.\n\nThe MODIFY operation is used by LDAP clients to request that the LDAP server make changes to existing entries. Attempts to modify entries that do not exist will fail. MODIFY requests are subject to access controls as implemented by the server.\n\nThe MODIFY operation requires that the distinguished name (DN) of the entry be specified, and a sequence of changes. Each change in the sequence must be one of:\n\nLDIF example of adding a value to an attribute:\n\nTo replace the value of an existing attribute, Use the replace keyword. If the attribute is multi-valued, the client must specify the value of the attribute to update.\n\nTo delete an attribute from an entry, use the keyword delete and the changetype designator modify. If the attribute is multi-valued, the client must specify the value of the attribute to delete.\n\nThere is also a Modify-Increment extension which allows an incrementable attribute value to be incremented by a specified amount. The following example using LDIF increments employeeNumber by 5:\n\nWhen LDAP servers are in a replicated topology, LDAP clients should consider using the post-read control to verify updates instead of a search after an update. The post-read control is designed so that applications need not issue a search request after an update – it is bad form to retrieve an entry for the sole purpose of checking that an update worked because of the replication eventual consistency model. An LDAP client should not assume that it connects to the same directory server for each request because architects may have placed load-balancers or LDAP proxies or both between LDAP clients and servers.\n\nModify DN (move/rename entry) takes the new RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), optionally the new parent's DN, and a flag that indicates whether to delete the value(s) in the entry that match the old RDN. The server may support renaming of entire directory subtrees.\n\nAn update operation is atomic: Other operations will see either the new entry or the old one. On the other hand, LDAP does not define transactions of multiple operations: If you read an entry and then modify it, another client may have updated the entry in the meantime. Servers may implement extensions that support this, though.\n\nThe Extended Operation is a generic LDAP operation that can define new operations that were not part of the original protocol specification. StartTLS is one of the most significant extensions. Other examples include Cancel and Password Modify.\n\nThe StartTLS operation establishes Transport Layer Security (the descendant of SSL) on the connection. It can provide data confidentiality (to protect data from being observed by third parties) and/or data integrity protection (which protects the data from tampering). During TLS negotiation the server sends its X.509 certificate to prove its identity. The client may also send a certificate to prove its identity. After doing so, the client may then use SASL/EXTERNAL. By using the SASL/EXTERNAL, the client requests the server derive its identity from credentials provided at a lower level (such as TLS). Though technically the server may use any identity information established at any lower level, typically the server will use the identity information established by TLS.\n\nServers also often support the non-standard \"LDAPS\" (\"Secure LDAP\", commonly known as \"LDAP over SSL\") protocol on a separate port, by default 636. LDAPS differs from LDAP in two ways:\n1) upon connect, the client and server establish TLS before any LDAP messages are transferred (without a StartTLS operation) and\n2) the LDAPS connection must be closed upon TLS closure.\n\nSome \"LDAPS\" client libraries only encrypt communication; they do not check the host name against the name in the supplied certificate.\n\nThe Abandon operation requests that the server abort an operation named by a message ID. The server need not honor the request. Neither Abandon nor a successfully abandoned operation send a response. A similar Cancel extended operation does send responses, but not all implementations support this.\n\nThe Unbind operation abandons any outstanding operations and closes the connection. It has no response. The name is of historical origin, and is \"not\" the opposite of the Bind operation.\n\nClients can abort a session by simply closing the connection, but they should use Unbind. Unbind allows the server to gracefully close the connection and free resources that it would otherwise keep for some time until discovering the client had abandoned the connection. It also instructs the server to cancel operations that can be canceled, and to not send responses for operations that cannot be canceled.\n\nAn LDAP uniform resource identifier (URI) scheme exists, which clients support in varying degrees, and servers return in referrals and continuation references (see RFC 4516):\n\nMost of the components described below are optional.\n\nFor example, \"codice_28\" refers to all user attributes in John Doe's entry in codice_29, while \"codice_30\" searches for the entry in the default server (note the triple slash, omitting the host, and the double question mark, omitting the attributes). As in other URLs, special characters must be percent-encoded.\n\nThere is a similar non-standard codice_31 URI scheme for LDAP over SSL. This should not be confused with LDAP with TLS, which is achieved using the StartTLS operation using the standard codice_32 scheme.\n\nThe contents of the entries in a subtree are governed by a directory schema, a set of definitions and constraints concerning the structure of the directory information tree (DIT).\n\nThe schema of a Directory Server defines a set of rules that govern the kinds of information that the server can hold. It has a number of elements, including:\n\nAttributes are the elements responsible for storing information in a directory, and the schema defines the rules for which attributes may be used in an entry, the kinds of values that those attributes may have, and how clients may interact with those values.\n\nClients may learn about the schema elements that the server supports by retrieving an appropriate subschema subentry.\n\nThe schema defines \"object classes\". Each entry must have an objectClass attribute, containing named classes defined in the schema. The schema definition of the classes of an entry defines what kind of object the entry may represent - e.g. a person, organization or domain. The object class definitions also define the list of attributes that must contain values and the list of attributes which may contain values.\n\nFor example, an entry representing a person might belong to the classes \"top\" and \"person\". Membership in the \"person\" class would require the entry to contain the \"sn\" and \"cn\" attributes, and allow the entry also to contain \"userPassword\", \"telephoneNumber\", and other attributes. Since entries may have multiple ObjectClasses values, each entry has a complex of optional and mandatory attribute sets formed from the union of the object classes it represents. ObjectClasses can be inherited, and a single entry can have multiple ObjectClasses values that define the available and required attributes of the entry itself. A parallel to the schema of an objectClass is a class definition and an instance in Object-oriented programming, representing LDAP objectClass and LDAP entry, respectively.\n\nDirectory servers may publish the directory schema controlling an entry at a base DN given by the entry's subschemaSubentry operational attribute. (An \"operational attribute\" describes operation of the directory rather than user information and is only returned from a search when it is explicitly requested.)\n\nServer administrators can add additional schema entries in addition to the provided schema elements. A schema for representing individual people within organizations is termed a white pages schema.\n\nA lot of the server operation is left to the implementor or administrator to decide. Accordingly, servers may be set up to support a wide variety of scenarios.\n\nFor example, data storage in the server is not specified - the server may use flat files, databases, or just be a gateway to some other server. Access control is not standardized, though there has been work on it and there are commonly used models. Users' passwords may be stored in their entries or elsewhere. The server may refuse to perform operations when it wishes, and impose various limits.\n\nMost parts of LDAP are extensible. Examples: One can define new operations. \"Controls\" may modify requests and responses, e.g. to request sorted search results. New search scopes and Bind methods can be defined. Attributes can have \"options\" that may modify their semantics.\n\nAs LDAP has gained momentum, vendors have provided it as an access protocol to other services. The implementation then recasts the data to mimic the LDAP/X.500 model, but how closely this model is followed varies. For example, there is software to access SQL databases through LDAP, even though LDAP does not readily lend itself to this. X.500 servers may support LDAP as well.\n\nSimilarly, data previously held in other types of data stores are sometimes moved to LDAP directories. For example, Unix user and group information can be stored in LDAP and accessed via PAM and NSS modules. LDAP is often used by other services for authentication.\n\nAn example of such data model is the GLUE Schema, which is used in a distributed information system based on LDAP that enable users, applications and services to discover which services exist in a Grid infrastructure and further information about their structure and state.\n\nAn LDAP server may return referrals to other servers for requests that it cannot fulfill itself. This requires a naming structure for LDAP entries so one can find a server holding a given distinguished name (DN), a concept defined in the X.500 Directory and also used in LDAP. Another way of locating LDAP servers for an organization is a DNS server record (SRV).\n\nAn organization with the domain example.org may use the top level LDAP DN codice_33 (where \"dc\" means domain component). If the LDAP server is also named ldap.example.org, the organization's top level LDAP URL becomes codice_34.\n\nPrimarily two common styles of naming are used in both X.500 [2008] and LDAPv3. These are documented in the ITU specifications and IETF RFCs. The original form takes the top level object as the country object, such as codice_35, codice_36. The domain component model uses the model described above. An example of country based naming could be codice_37, or in the US: codice_38.\n\n\n\n"}

Ellering spent most of his wrestling career managing the Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk), working with them from 1983 to 1990 and again on occasion between 1992 and 1997. In addition to being their on screen manager he actually handled the team's affairs outside the ring as well, including contract negotiations and travel arrangements. Ellering and the Road Warriors were inducted into both the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2011. Five years later, in June 2016, he returned to the ring at as the manager of The Authors of Pain, a heel tag team making their debut.\n\nPrior to becoming a manager he was a professional wrestler, but due to injuries retired in 1983 to become a full-time manager, only wrestling on special occasions. In the late 1990s he was involved in a storyline where he actually turned on the Road Warriors and managed Disciples of Apocalypse as they fought the Road Warriors. After retiring from full-time activity in wrestling, he raced in the Iditarod and John Beargrease Dog Sled Race.\n\nBefore entering the wrestling business, Ellering was an accomplished powerlifter, setting a world record in the deadlift at .\n\nEllering was trained in Minneapolis, Minnesota at a camp run by American Wrestling Association (AWA) owner and promoter Verne Gagne and wrestler/trainer Eddie Sharkey in the mid 1970s. According to Ellering's RF Video shoot interview, of the thirty-plus trainees in the camp, only himself and later AWA mid-card wrestler Steve Olsonoski (a.k.a. Steve O) made it through the camp. Ellering would later go on to wrestle in singles and tag teams for Gagne in the AWA, Bill Watts's Mid-South promotion, and for Jerry Jarrett's Memphis promotion, where he was paired with manager Jimmy Hart. Ellering now known as \"Precious\" Paul Ellering His notable feuds were with Jesse Ventura as a face, and as a heel with Jerry Lawler and Jimmy Valiant, from whom he won the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship.\n\nWhile wrestling for the National Wrestling Alliance in Mid-South Wrestling, Ellering in 1982 severely injured his knee in a match with Robert Gibson, started doing workout segments with kids for Mid South re-injuring it after returning to the ring,but the injury ended his full-time wrestling career. Georgia booker Ole Anderson recognized his speaking ability, however, and gave him a job as a manager.\n\nAlthough primarily a manager, Ellering has stepped between the ropes as a competitor, notably at the 1987 NWA Great American Bash in which he joined the Road Warriors, Nikita Koloff, and Dusty Rhodes to face The Four Horsemen and their manager James J. Dillon in the first ever WarGames match. Ellering would also face Teddy Long in a 'Hair vs. Hair' match at the World Championship Wrestling Capital Combat event in 1990, coming away with a victory.\n\nEllering is best known for managing The Road Warriors, also known as the Legion of Doom, from 1981 until 1997 during their stints in the American Wrestling Association, the National Wrestling Alliance, New Japan Pro Wrestling, and the World Wrestling Federation in 1992. Ellering was also the real-life manager for the team; he booked their matches, lined up their flights, set up hotel reservations, and kept track of their expenses.\n\nThroughout 1998 he managed the Disciples of Apocalypse, who were then feuding with the Legion of Doom; according to Ellering and Animal on the Road Warriors DVD, Ellering had a hard time working with another team against Hawk and Animal, and had difficulty ripping on his former team on the microphone. By the end of his second WWF run, though, he was back to managing the LOD, most notably on \"Sunday Night Heat\", during a tag-team battle royal for a shot at the tag titles later in the night at WrestleMania XV, though they were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2011, Ellering was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, along with the Road Warriors, by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes.\n\nEllering made his return to WWE programming at on June 8, 2016, revealing himself as the manager of a debuting Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar), after their attack on American Alpha, turning Ellering heel for the first time in 18 years.\n\nOn January 28, 2017, at , Ellering led Akam and Rezar to their first reign as NXT Tag Team Champions.\n\nOn April 9, 2018, Paul Ellering made his debut on Monday Night Raw with Akam and Rezar as they answered an open challenge from Heath Slater and Rhyno. After they were victorious in their match, Akam and Rezar ended their partnership with Ellering by pushing him away and leaving him ringside as they returned backstage.\n\nAfter retiring from professional wrestling, he traveled to Alaska to become a sled dog racer, participating in the Iditarod. In 2000 he came in 54th place.\n\nIn 2002, Ellering became the owner and operator of the Historic Rock Tavern on Big Birch Lake in Grey Eagle, Minnesota. He has three children: Rebecca, Rachael and Saul. His daughter Rachael won the bronze medal at the 2014 World Powerlifting Championships. She made her professional wrestling debut in December 2015. Though not signed to a contract, she made multiple appearances in WWE since debuting against Alexa Bliss in NXT in 2016, including participating in the Mae Young Classic.\n\nEllering made his video game debut as a non-playable character in \"WWE 2K18\".\n\n\n"}

The interior decoration by Augustin Pajou is constructed almost entirely of wood, painted to resemble marble in a technique known as faux marble. The excellent acoustics of the opera house are at least partly due to its wooden interior.\n\nThe house is located at the northern extremity of the north wing of the palace. General public access to the theater is gained through the two-story vestibule. Some parts of the Opéra, such as the King's Loge and the King's Boudoir represent some of the earliest expressions of what would become known as Louis XVI style.\n\nLully’s \"Persée\" — written in 1682, the year Louis XIV moved into the palace — inaugurated the Opéra on 16 May 1770 in celebration of the marriage of the dauphin — the future Louis XVI — to Marie Antoinette. \n\nThe Opéra Royal can serve either as a theater for opera, stage plays, or orchestral events, when it can accommodate an audience of 712, or as a ballroom, when the floor of the orchestra level of the auditorium can be raised to the level of the stage. On these occasions, the Opéra can accommodate 1,200.\n\nDuring the French Enlightenment, the theatre became a place where political and social ideas were considered myths and superstitions were tested. As more Enlightenment thinkers began to question the tenets of religion, many eighteenth-century citizens began to replace the pulpit with the stage, and looked to the theatre for their moral instruction as well as entertainment. The nobility had a lot to do with the uprising of theatre during this time. Louis XIV, who is known as the \"Sun King\" for playing the allegorical character of the sun in \"The Ballet of the Night\" in 1653, moved his royal court from the capital, Paris, to Versailles, aspiring to get more control of the government. The Opera, which was built for Louis XV, however, was not built until later. His mistress, Madame de Pompadour, patronized artists, actors, and musicians while bankrupting France. Meanwhile, the aristocracy and church paid no taxes, and the bourgeoisie paid for the monarchy's tastes. Yet, it was not until after the death of Louis' mistress that the construction of the Opera began.\n\nLong before the Opera Royal was dreamed of, theatre was becoming an important part of French society. Beginning with the reign of Louis XIII, the frequency and regularity of theatrical performances had increased: the show was considered as much an entertainment as it was an expression of power The idea of it being an expression of power can be traced to one of Louis XIII's regents, Cardinal Richelieu. Richelieu wanted to create an image of the king (and France) that displayed well roundedness in all thing, a society who dabbled not only in politics or court, but music and art and theatre. He envisioned a force to lead the way, culturally. Attending a theatrical performance was quickly becoming a sign of stature, and though few permanent theatre spaces were created at this time, theatre found itself performed anyway. It is pertinent to note that until the final installation of the Versailles court, performances of operas and ballets, comedies and tragedies, were performed mainly in the gardens \n\nSoon, however, spaces that were frequently used for performances would become specific performance spaces. In time the royal residences equipped themselves little by little with fixed theatres, although they often continued to use temporary structures and installations one could disassemble in various places: galleries, staircases, lounges, gardens These staged productions were important for many reasons. Little divertissements for the court, they also were at times used by royalty for their own reasons. Louis XIV's performance during the Ballet de la nuit, for example, was a statement of his power, his coming of age, and the fact that he was ready to take the throne with no regents. Indeed, his performance as Apollo is what earned him the name Sun King. Stage productions such as operas and ballets were important during the reigns of the Bourbon monarchs in France. Louis XIV in particular employed these and similar art forms extensively not only to entertain the noblemen in his court but also to promote his own self-image and the gloire of his country. Although he desired an Opera for his beloved Versailles, during the second half of Louis' reign, most operas, ballets and other staged divertissements for court and the public appeared indoors, in theatres or in other sites arranged as required for individual productions.\n\nDuring the early years of his reign of Louis XIV, theatres were often temporary structures, built for a particular event and destroyed after their use. The first such theater was constructed for the fête of the \"Plaisirs de l’Île enchantée\", which was held in 1664. In the area west of what is now the Bassin d’Apollon, a temporary theater was constructed in which Molière's \"Princesse d’Élide\" débuted on 8 May. During this fête an additional theatre was erected inside the chateau for the presentation of three other plays by Molière: \"Les Fâcheux\", \"Le Mariage Forcé\", and \"Tartuffe\", which premiered in an incomplete, albeit contentious, form. None of these theatres survived this fête.\n\nThe \"Grand Divertissement royal\" of 1668, which celebrated the end of the War of Devolution, witnessed the construction of a luxurious temporary theater built in the gardens on the site of the future Bassin de Bacchus. Constructed of papier-mâché, which was either gilded or painted to resemble marble and lapis lazuli, the theater seated 1,200 spectators who attended the debut of Molière's \"George Dandin\" on 18 July 1668. As with the \"Plaisirs de l’Île enchantée\", this theater was destroyed shortly after the end of the fête.\n\nThe third fête or, more accurately, a series of six fêtes - \"Les Divertissments de Versailles\" - were held in July and August 1674 to celebrate the second conquest of Franche-Comté. The fête featured a number of theatrical productions that were staged throughout the grounds in temporary theaters. On 4 July, Lully's \"Alceste\" was performed for the court in the Cour de Marbre; on 11 July, Quinault's \"L'Églogue de Versailles\" was staged near the Trianon de Porcelaine; eight days later, the Grotte de Thétys served as the setting for Molière's \"le Malade Imaginaire\"; and Racine's \"Iphigénie\" debuted on 18 August in a theater constructed in the Orangerie.\n\nIn spite of the need for a permanent theater at Versailles, it would not be until 1681 that a permanent structure would be built. In that year, the Comptes des Bâtiments du Roi record payments for a theater that was constructed on the ground floor of the chateau between the corps de logis and the Aile de Midi. The interior of the theater – known as the salle de la Comédie – contained a semicircle of row seating with loges set into the bays of the lateral walls. On the south wall of the theater, abutting the wall of the Escalier des Princes, was the royal tribune, which contained a central room octagonal loge and two smaller loges on either side. The salle de la Comédie would function as a de facto permanent theater at Versailles until 1769, when it was destroyed in order to provide direct access to the gardens from the Cour Royale.\n\nIn 1688, Louis XIV ordered a small theater to be constructed in the north wing of the Grand Trianon. This structure was destroyed in 1703 to accommodate a new apartment for the king.\n\nBecause the salle de la Comédie was designed for stage plays, Versailles lacked a theatre in which more elaborate productions could be staged. For larger productions, the Grand Manège (the covered riding arena) in the Grand Écurie was converted for more elaborate entertainments, but the space had limitations. In 1685, Louis XIV approved plans for the construction of a larger permanent theater that could the more elaborate productions, such as pièces à machines.\n\nThe pièces à machines were theatrical presentations using ballet, opera, and special staging effects that required a theatre that could accommodate the complicated machinery used in the production of these plays. The Salle des Machines at the Tuileries Palace in Paris, designed by Carlo Vigarani, was the closest to Versailles. However, with Louis XIV's dislike for Paris – due in large part to his flight from the Tuileries in 1651 – and his increasing wish to keep his court at Versailles, the king approved the construction of a larger theater in 1685. With a plan more grandiose than the theatre of the Tuileries, the construction of this new theatre was much lauded by contemporary descriptions of Versailles.\n\nConstruction was planned for the northern end of the Aile des Nobles, and was well underway when the War of the League of Augsburg, which began in 1688, permanently halted construction. It would not be until the reign of Louis XV that construction on this site would resume.\n\nWith the return of the court to Versailles in 1722, spaces used by Louis XIV were once again pressed into service for the needs of the court. In 1729, as part of the festivities in celebration of the birth of the dauphin, a temporary theatre was constructed in the Cour de Marbre. The salle de la Comédie and the Manège of the Grand Écurie continued to be used as they had during the reign of Louis XIV. \n\nHowever, owing to Louis XV proclivity for more a more intimate theater, a number of temporary theaters known as the \"théâtres des cabinets\" were created. These theaters were most often constructed in one of the rooms of the petit appartement du roi, with the petite galerie being the most frequently used starting from 1746. In 1748, the Escalier des ambassadeurs was converted into a theatre, in which the Marquise de Pompadour staged and acted in a number of plays. Two years later, the theatre was dismantled when the Escalier des ambassadeurs was destroyed for the construction of the appartement de Madame Adélaïde.\n\nAcutely aware of the need for a larger and more permanent theater, as early as the 1740s Louis XV, seriously considered reviving Louis XIV's plans for a permanent salle de spectacle to be constructed at the northern end of the Aile de Nobles. However, owing to the Seven Years’ War, construction would not be able to commence for nearly 20 years. When fire destroyed the Grand Écurie and the theatre of the Manège in 1751, and since the salle de la Comédie had become an unfeasible venue due to its size for theatrical productions, Louis XV finally authorized Ange-Jacques Gabriel to design the Opéra in 1763.\n\nConstruction work on the Opéra began in earnest in 1765 and was completed in 1770. Gabriel reverted to an old design by J.H. Mansart and Gaspare Vigarani: the Salle des Ballets, at the far north end of the château, which had been abandoned at the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession. The terminal pavilion of the north wing, intended for this, had been carried up to its full height only on the garden side; on the street side it had advanced no further than the foundations. At the time, it represented the finest example in theatre design, having 712 seats, and it was the largest theatre in Europe. Today, it remains one of the few 18th century theaters to have survived to the present day. Gabriel's design for the Opéra was exceptional for its time since it featured an oval plan. As an economy measure, the floor of the orchestra level can be raised to the level the stage, thus doubling the floor space. The transition from the auditorium to the stage is managed by the introduction of a giant order of engaged Corinthian columns, with a cornice ranging with the whole Ionic entablature. The proscenium is formed by two pairs of columns, coupled in depth, with their entablature. On either side two more pairs, more widely spaced, enclosed with three tiers of boxes. Breaking with traditional Italian-style theatres which stacked tiered boxes like chicken coops, two balconies ring the house, topped by an ample colonnade that seems to extend into infinity thanks to a play of mirrors. It was planned that the Opéra should serve not only as a theatre, but as ballroom or banqueting hall as well. The theatre burned ten thousand candles in a single setting, therefore making it very expensive to rent the space out.\n\nIt opened May 16, 1770, with Lully's \"Persée\".\n\nOn 1 October 1789, the \"gardes du corps du roi\" held a banquet to welcome the Flanders Regiment, which had just arrived to strengthen protection for the royal family against the revolutionary rumblings that were being heard in Paris. At this banquet, Louis XVI, Marie-Antoinette, and the dauphin received the pledge of loyalty from these guards. Revolutionary journalist Jean-Paul Marat described the banquet as a counter-revolutionary orgy, with the soldiers ripping off the blue-white-red cockades they had been wearing and replacing them with white ones, the color that symbolized the Bourbon monarchy. In truth, there is no evidence of this act, and actual eyewitnesses and attendees, such as the queen's lady of the bedchamber Madame Campan, record no such destruction of cockades. This was the last event held in the Opéra during the Ancien Régime.\n\nBuilt entirely of wood, which is painted in faux marble to represent stone, the Opéra has excellent acoustics and represents one of the finest examples of neo-classical decoration. The theme of the decoration is related to Apollo and the Olympian deities. The decoration of the Opéra was directed by Augustin Pajou, who executed the bas-reliefs panels that decorate the front of the loges. The ceiling features a canvas by Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau in which Apollo and the Muses are depicted.\n\nIn spite of the excellent acoustics and the opulent setting, the Opéra was not often used during the reign of Louis XVI, largely on grounds of cost. However, for those occasions when the Opéra was used, they became events of the day. Some of the more memorable uses of the Opéra during the reign of Louis XVI included:\n\nOriginally used only for royal ceremonies and extraordinary performances, this pinnacle of the Gabriel family's work began to be used less and less because of the immense cost to stage productions there. During the period of its usage, however, it was a beautiful example of royal lavishness and love for theatrical performances, and the fact that attending opera was once again the fashionable thing to do for the upper class, thanks in part to Queen Marie Antoinette's patronage, should not be underestimated.\n\nWhen the royal family left Versailles in October 1789, the château and the Opéra were closed. While the château did see some activity under Napoléon I (redecoration of the parts of the queen's apartment for the empress Marie-Louise) and Louis XVIII, the Opéra did not reopen again until 1837, when Louis-Philippe redecorated the theater and presented Molière’s \"Le Misanthrope\". During the state visit of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert the Opéra Royal was converted into a banquet room for a gala dinner on 25 August 1855. This was to be one of the most elaborate events staged at Versailles during the Second Empire.\n\nIn 1872, during the Commune de Paris, the Opéra was converted by Edmond de Joly for use by the Assemblée nationale, who used the Opéra until 1876; between 1876 and 1879, the Sénat convened here.\n\n1952-1957 witnessed major restoration of the Opéra – generally considered one of the finest restoration projects undertaken at Versailles – when it was restored under the direction of André Japy to its 1770 state (Verlet, p. 384). The Opéra officially reopened on 9 April 1957 in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, with a presentation of Act II of Rameau’s \"Les Indes Galantes\". Since its restoration, the Opéra has been used for state functions as well as a variety of operatic and musical events (Langlois, 1958). \n\nThe Opéra was most recently closed in June of 2007 for an extensive two year renovation to bring the backstage and production areas up to safety standards. During this latest renovation, led by chief architect of Historical Monuments Frédéric Didiera, a new firewall was installed, the downstage timberframe stairs were restored to their original purpose, stage and lighting equipment were modernized, the technical grid was redone, dressing rooms were moved and brought up to modern standards, and adjacent spaces formerly given over to the Sénat, including the Actor's Building, were reclaimed to once again accommodate the needs of performers, workshops, and offices. The Opéra reopened its doors in September of 2009, and has since carried out an expanded and ambitious regular series of operatic, balletic, and concert performances, especially celebrating the works of the Baroque and Classical periods most closely associated with the Opéra and the Palace of Versailles.\n\nToday, with its superb acoustics and magnificent décor, the Opéra represents one of the finest 18th century opera houses in Europe. The importance of the Opéra Royal is directly linked to the history of the many theatres at Versailles and the history of theatrical stagings in 17th and 18th century France.\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

In 1921, \"The Globe\" merged into \"The Pall Mall Gazette\", which itself was absorbed into the \"Evening Standard\" in 1923.\n\n\"The Pall Mall Gazette\" took the name of a fictional newspaper conceived by William Makepeace Thackeray. Pall Mall is a street in London where many gentlemen's clubs are located, hence Thackeray's description of this imaginary newspaper in his novel \"The History of Pendennis\" (1848–1850):\n\n\"We address ourselves to the higher circles of society: we care not to disown it—the Pall Mall Gazette is written by gentlemen for gentlemen; its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born. The field-preacher has his journal, the radical free-thinker has his journal: why should the Gentlemen of England be unrepresented in the Press?\n\nUnder the ownership of George Smith from 1865 to 1880, with Frederick Greenwood as editor, the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" was a Conservative newspaper. Greenwood resigned in 1880 when the paper's new owner wished the paper to support the policies of the Liberal Party.\n\nWilliam Thomas Stead's editorship from 1883 to 1889 saw the paper cover such subjects as child prostitution; their campaign helped get the government to increase the age of consent from 13 to 16 in 1885. This was one of the first examples of investigative journalism, and Stead was arrested for \"unlawful taking of a child\" (when he purchased thirteen-year-old Eliza Armstrong from her mother for the meager price of £5, to highlight how easy it was to buy children). It distressed the owner Thompson who dismissed Stead, and hired the handsome society figure\nHenry Cust, editor from 1892 to 1896, who returned the paper to its Conservative beginnings.\n\nThompson sold the paper to William Walforf Astor in 1896. Sir Douglas Straight was editor until 1909, followed by F.J. Higginbottom, under whom the paper declined. Circulation doubled between 1911-1915 under the editor J.L.Garvin, but the paper declined once more under its last editor D.L. Sutherland. It was absorbed into the Evening Standard in 1923.\nSeveral well-known writers contributed to \"The Pall Mall Gazette\" over the years. George Bernard Shaw gained his first job in journalism writing for the paper. Other contributors have included Anthony Trollope, Friedrich Engels, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Charles Whibley, Sir Spencer Walpole, Arthur Patchett Martin, and Jamaican-born writer Eneas Sweetland Dallas.\n\n\"The Pall Mall Gazette\" is referred to in numerous other media works.

A professor of fine art at the University of Wisconsin, Lowe is the former curator of contemporary art at the National Museum of the American Indian. He is known for large site-specific installation pieces utilizing natural materials.\n\nLowe was born in Black River Falls, Wisconsin on the Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin reservation to Mabel Davis and Martin Lowe. The youngest of six siblings, Truman was thirteen years younger than his sister, Irene. Mabel worked a variety of positions as a cook at the local Mission School and as a laundress. When at home in Black River Falls, Martin was a farmer as well as traveling as a seasonal worker, picking blueberries and cranberries throughout the state. Surrounded often by close family, Winnebago was the language spoken at home. As a child, Lowe attended school at the Black River Indian Mission until grade 6, switching in 1957 to the non-Native school in Black River Falls proper.\n\nStarting in 1960 he worked during the summer at the Wisconsin Dells, \"playing Indian\" amongst other Native performers during an evening performance for tourists. Other summers he worked for the Dells Chamber of Commerce, dressing up in an \"Indian costume\" to greet tourists as they walked the streets, and serving as a tour guide on the Dell's excursion boats, again in \"costume\". Lowe's experience as a \"stereotype\" tour guide would later influence aspects of his work.\n\nGraduating from New Lisbon High School in the early 1960s, he applied and was accepted by the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. After switching majors, he settled on art education, studied all aspects of fine art media. Midway through his college experience he left in 1964 to work in a factory assembly line. In 1966 he married Nancy Knabe, whom he met when working in the Dells. A non-Native, of German and Norwegian descent, they were married at her family's church, Lyster Lutheran in Church Valley, Wisconsin. After their marriage, Nancy taught high school Home Economics while Lowe finished his undergraduate degree.\n\nUpon graduation, the couple moved to Valders, Wisconsin where, while creating artwork on his spare time, he taught elementary and secondary art classes. After teaching for two years, Lowe was accepted to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for fine arts, sponsored by a Ford Foundation fellowship. On October 2, 1971, his daughter Tonia Alison was born.\n\nLowe on his reasons for returning to obtain his Masters:\n\n\"I knew how to teach, but I wanted access to current information, and as much information as I could get my hands on, in order to be able to better help my students.\"\n\nAfter graduating in 1973, the Lowes moved to Emporia, Kansas where Truman was a visiting art lecturer at Emporia State University, teaching only for about two years before returning to Madison, serving as assistant dean of Multicultural Programming at University of Wisconsin. In 1975, Nancy gave birth to their second child, son Martin Howard (\"Kunu\"), and that same year Lowe was given a joint appointment at Madison in the Native American studies program, as well as assistant professor of sculpture, which he retained until 1988.\n\nWhile exhibiting and working on his art work, Lowe becomes tenured at University of Wisconsin-Madison, also being promoted to associate professor of art in 1984. After being promoted to professor of art in 1989, Lowe was elected as chair of the art department from 1992–1995.\n\nIn 2000 Lowe was appointed the curator of contemporary art for the National Museum of the American Indian. Taking a leave of absence from the university, Lowe curated the inaugural exhibition featuring artists George Morrison (Ojibwe) and Allan Houser (Chiricahua), remaining as curator until 2008.\n\nAs a child, Lowe would collect rocks along the Black River, scratching the river rocks together to create drawings by using the smaller rocks as pastels upon larger rocks. Eventually Lowe experimented with using rocks as pigment with substances such as motor oil and Vaseline. Disappointed with this process, he explored nature by creating drawings of \"how snow sits on trees,\" and taking his study hall time in the high school art room.\n\nWhile growing up, his family created \"craft\" objects, which provided minor supplemental income to the family. His mother made split-ash baskets while his father made the wooden handles for the baskets, and both of his parents created beadwork. Even the children learned the skills to create these family works, Lowe learning beadwork by kerosene lamp in the evening as a young man. These Lowe family creations were made for the tourist trade, delivering the freshly made creations by station wagon to the Wisconsin Dells, providing an offset from the seasonal farming positions the family participated in. During the summer, when the family was involved in seasonal work, they sold their crafts from a roadside stand they traveled with.\n\nLike many other Native artists Lowe was instilled with a degree of comfort regarding the creative practice of creation within the household. He wasn't aware of the Western idea of making a living full-time by art until he attended university. At university he fully delved into the concepts and creations revolving within Western art history; a social prestige regarding artistic creation, unlike his parents who would be considered \"craftspeople.\"\n\nLowe's first artist interest was Michelangelo of whom he spoke:\n\n\"Although my parents made a partial living weaving baskets, the two concepts of 'profession' and 'art' never came together in my mind until... college... [Then] I read everything I could get my hands on about Michelangelo...He was the first artist I'd met through my studies who went to work everyday and was paid by his patrons [and] employers for making art. Obviously, I learned encyclopedias from the work, but the practical lesson was that art could be a profession as well as a passion.\"\n\nLowe's early work was inspired heavily by the education he was receiving. Paintings showing exercises in abstraction and geometric patterns in the style of Frank Stella are seen in paintings like \"Suzy\" (1968) and color theory works such as \"Yellow Over Green\" and \"Yellow Over Red\" (1969), the latter two which have since been destroyed. Working in clay, Lowe created egg-shaped sculptures that sat on coiled stands, \"Collection of Eggs\" and \"Unmatched Halves\" (c. 1968), giving a fantasy yet comic feel to his early experiments in art.\n\nSculpture classes taught him about the power of the line in artworks and its placement in nature. Lowe studied the works of Brâncuși, where he familiarized himself with geometry in sculpture, and Henry Moore's works regarding scale in sculpture. And with the popularity of plastic in the 1960s Lowe expanded his mediums to complete 3-D works including a life-size toaster of sheet plastic made from a sandwich sealer, complete with pieces of toast in the slot, recalling the soft sculpture works of Claes Oldenburg at the time. His first undergraduate installation \"Laundry Bags\" (1969), showing a pile of clear plastic trash bags filled with colored rags piled in the corner of an exhibition space. This large-scale installation work would be a hallmark for Lowe's work in the future and throughout his career. \n\nContinuing to experiment with plastics, \"I looked at all kinds of plastic: clear, different thickness, some milky. I also liked it because it was so big, so flexible, so easy to store, and so cheap.\" Experimenting with layering, Lowe used plastic as his canvas, drawing with black and color markers to create a transparent yet uniformed design upon the plastic. His simple minimalistic works represented the concepts of transparency, pictorial depth, surface and illusion, reminiscent of works by Dorothea Rockburne.\n\nHis M.F.A. exhibition in spring of 1973 showcased these experimental installations. Long plastic sheets cut into fringe, draped around or sandwiched between sheets of Plexiglas that hung from the ceiling with raw fluorescent light behind the plastic. Influenced by Larry Bell's work to create a space where the work was indistinguishable from its surroundings, Lowe states about the exhibition:\n\nI arranged the pieces haphazardly in that space. I wanted to create an environment where one just moved from piece to piece without having the chance to stand back and think about the piece as a real object. I wanted to eliminate all that.\n\nUpon meeting George Morrison, Lowe found a role model. Morrison's Midwestern heritage and ability to blend in and out of Native and non-Native art communities provided a unique opportunity to explore involvement and separate from and within Native art worlds.\n\nDuring his return to obtain his Masters, the University of Wisconsin-Madison was a hotbed of activism regarding the Vietnam War, while in Indian Country the Red Power movement was taking shape. Aware of the energy brewing in Native America, Lowe focused on school:\n\nI didn't have the luxury - and I consider it a luxury - of being a protester because my focus was concentrated on getting information. I knew I wasn't going to be in that position for very long. I wanted to participate in gathering whatever information I could in the time I had, and I wanted to bring it all together, really to see what would happen. I needed time to work by myself.\n\nDespite lack of time to focus on protesting and involvement in political movements, Lowe made a six-hour trip to hear Native activist and writer Vine Deloria, Jr. speak. Speaking about the need for Native peoples to take advantage of educational and economic opportunities in order to widen Native opportunities, Lowe chose to make that his mantra for his life choices and career.\n\nMoving to Kansas in 1973 for a teaching position, the Lowe family lived on a farm. During this time Lowe realized \"[he] was really a Woodland Indian,\" owing to the lack of diversity in the landscape - he missed Wisconsin. However, Lowe's time in Kansas would not be without its benefits. Departing from plastics, he began to experiment with wood, and found natural objects. Creating assemblage pieces, abandoning synthetic materials completely. Living away from Wisconsin allowed Lowe to become aware of his heritage and environment, allowing him to re-embrace the nature of the Upper Midwestern environment and bring his own unique contemporary spin on skills learned within his family - woodworking and basketry.\n\nThis move towards natural materials coincided with the popularity of the back-to-the-land movement. Lowe discovered the Foxfire books as popular culture discovered the concept of the \"ecological Indian\".\n\nUpon returning to Wisconsin and joining faculty at the University, Lowe's work began to become embraced by viewers and critics as contemporary Indian art. Through interviews Lowe connected each work to unique techniques and traditions of Native concepts of craft and fine art. His work in the late 1970s embraced his own \"analysis of traditional Indian techniques,\" depicting war shields heavily decorated with feathers and often simple in their look. Celebrating the Native symbolism behind the feather as a rewarding, powerful object seen within many communities, it became an important part of his works and installations.\n\nLike many contemporary Native American artists, Lowe chooses his medium to explore the stories and experiences of Native peoples, allowing his artwork to serve as a form of cultural survival. The cosmology of the Winnebago people is told through a massive wooden sculpture \"Red Banks\" (1991), consisting entirely of wood at 12 × 37 × 8 feet. \"Red Banks\" serves as a visual analogy for oral tradition and myth, as well showing the framework upon which survival rests.\n\nAt the premier of \"Red Banks\" Lowe embraced the importance of the artist as a storyteller and archivist of culture:\n\nSince Winnebago history is largely oral, tribal artists have a particularly important role to play in preserving tradition as well as making non-Indians aware of Winnebago culture.\n\nOther stories told through Lowe's work include the smallpox epidemic on the Black River Falls Indian Mission in 1901 (\"Wooden Pole Construction\", 1983), serving as what has been described a \"contemporary version of the mnemonic device,\" an idea that flows throughout his entire catalog of work. Personal stories are also reflected on through works like \"Feather Tree\" (1990), which honors his grandmother and the land she lived in. Lowe's work has also flowed into two dimensional drawings, where he has chosen to honor his mother's legacy.\n\nMany of Lowe's works also embrace historically traditional works of Native peoples from the Winnebago, Woodland, and other Native American groups. The \"Headdress Series\" formed out of his interest in traditional Plains Indian regalia and a collection of pedestal and large scale sculptures incorporated the architecture of early shelters from the Woodlands communities. Many of his works have also incorporated other traditional Native objects frequently found within museum collections such as the work \"Cradle Board\" (1977–78) where Lowe used photographs found in the Wisconsin State Historical Society collections to serve as inspirations and putting his own twist on the concept of a cradle board. Many of the images from the historical society served as inspiration and research for his work, especially with housing and general community living in Winnebago communities and beyond.\n\nPrimitive housing and structures served as a way for Lowe to reflect on the disappearance of cultures in time, memory and history by way of an aesthetic. Their naked and simple—yet complexly built—designs reflect a \"ghost like\" presence of the past. In 1986 Lowe reflected on his sculpture work: \"My real interest is structures, the sculptural aspect of primitive structures...what intrigues me is that something is very primitive yet at the same time, very universal.\"\n\nSmall and large installations began to emerge in Lowe's work depicting higher conceptions influenced by his son's interest in astronomy. Works such as the \"Solstice\" series and \"Skychart\" series depict abstract astrological charts and images inspired by the exploration of peoples to new areas and regions with guidance from the sky.\n\nIn 1991 Lowe launched the first of site specific installations in a series called \"Red Ochre\". The first of the series, shown in Atlanta, Georgia, examined anthropological theories about human migration and early North American settlement, inspired by ancient burial sites and death rites. Further examinations of his work reveal the ideas of blending cultures, rituals and migration through time.\n\nIn 1993 the second installation was placed at the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis, Indiana. Lowe's work incorporated images of rock art, examining once again how cultures migration paths crossed by way of unifying natural artistic venues, with rock art serving as communication devices for cultures worldwide. In this work, Lowe invited the public to assist in the construction of the work to ensure the relevance of the piece.\n\nBoth expansive installations include the use of natural materials such as saplings, as well as brown paper, providing a rock like or textured look to selected mediums. However, both pieces were dramatically different, with the Eiteljorg work focusing heavily on murals and wall constructs, and the Atlanta work focusing on an exploratory forest-like environment.\n\nIf I have a religion, it must be canoeing...I canoe wherever there's water. It puts me in a totally different state of mind and provides all I need to exist. - Truman Lowe \n\nA classic symbol of Native America, the canoe has become a notable object scene throughout Lowe's work. A canoeist by recreation, Lowe attempts to reach beyond stereotypes and classic imagery by using the iconic canoe in his work. He also embraces his fascination with primitive structures, seeing the canoe both as a shelter and as a vehicle. Many of the canoes appear like wigwams; constructed wooden skeletons of various shapes and sizes, with curved aspects. The canoe is also represented mnemonically in selected works by way of highly constructed small sculptures.\n\nThe canoes are symbolic of journeys, from birth to death. The canoe's vaginal design and transportation characteristics provide it both male and female aspects in Lowe's eyes, \"vehicle and vessel\".\n\nWater is seen throughout many of Lowe's works, including the canoes. Again, Lowe works in large scale installations and smaller sculptures. In the \"Water Spirits,\" series, Lowe states \"the \"Water Spirits\" pieces are really an effort to show some respect for natural forces as well as what we would call spiritual forces.\" Wood and debris combine to reflect seasonal changes, the fragility of these natural environments and the importance of the flow of water.\n\nIn 1992 Lowe was commissioned by the Minnesota Arts Commission for Cloquet Community College. The sculpture sits within a large grouping of pine trees, made of polished stainless steel it hovers a foot and a half above the ground, intertwining through the trees like a stream. Utilized as a bench, large rocks are also placed underneath from nearby riverbeds to be glimpsed at under thin slits cut into the steel to represent the flowing of the water.\n\nOther notable works of the series include \"Ottawa\" (1992), which represents the steep slopes where water rapidly flows amongst the three rivers near the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Canada. Rows of unfinished strips of line \"flow\" in gradation representing a fast moving stream or roller coaster. An open structure that reflects the relationship between the river and its surroundings, it has been described as a high modernist work.\n\nShorelines and streambeds are also found in his sculptures. \"Water Mound\" (1994), a massive installation of wood, it represents sandbars that form during the changes of river systems. The river's edge is shown in other large installations such as \"Maumee Reflection\" (1987), depicting Lowe's vision of when land meets water at the confluence of three rivers near Fort Wayne, Indiana, where the work was displayed.\n\nMany of the water related works also depict aspects of basketry, with splints of wood which are usually used to form the shape of the basket. Again, Lowe shows another connection to his family and community creations, inspired by his mother's basketry work.\n\nIn the tradition of modernism, Lowe uses the grid in selected works. Reflective of works by Sol LeWitt and Eva Hesse, grids are used as representations of mapping systems—a way to describe environments and landscapes in a two-dimensional way. Native American communities were not traditionally map makers, unlike Europeans and the major land-surveying programs that would invade young America. An important part of the Manifest Destiny ideal, the grid was used systematically to distribute equal land to colonists. The grid is also symbolic of archeological digs and is seen in major landscape works by Lowe such as \"Effigy I\" (1984).\n\nMany of Lowe's constructions are created from willow saplings, often the only material used in installations. Lowe collects the saplings from Wisconsin farms in the summertime, gathering a large amount, peeling off the bark, and sanding the resulting sticks to bring out the white in the sapling. Flexibility and strength are essential with willow, allowing Lowe to bend and manipulate the wood to his needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1997, two additional CIA manuals were declassified in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by \"The Baltimore Sun\". The manuals in question have been referred to by various media sources as the \"torture manuals\".\n\nThese manuals were prepared by the U.S. military and used between 1987 and 1991 for intelligence training courses at the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA). Some of the material was similar to the older CIA manuals described below. The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training Teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru and Venezuela.\n\nThe Pentagon press release accompanying the release stated that a 1991-92 investigation into the manuals concluded that \"two dozen short passages in six of the manuals, which total 1169 pages, contained material that either was not or could be interpreted not to be consistent with U.S. policy.\"\n\nThe Latin America Working Group criticized this: \"The unstated aim of the manuals is to train Latin American militaries to identify and suppress anti-government movements. Throughout the eleven hundred pages of the manuals, there are few mentions of democracy, human rights, or the rule of law. Instead, the manuals provide detailed techniques for infiltrating social movements, interrogating suspects, surveillance, maintaining military secrecy, recruiting and retaining spies, and controlling the population. While the excerpts released by the Pentagon are a useful and not misleading selection of the most egregious passages, the ones most clearly advocating torture, execution and blackmail, they do not provide adequate insight into the manuals' highly objectionable framework. In the name of defending democracy, the manuals advocate profoundly undemocratic methods.\"\n\nAfter this 1992 investigation, the Department of Defense discontinued the use of the manuals, directed their recovery to the extent practicable, and destroyed the copies in the field. U.S. Southern Command advised governments in Latin America that the manuals contained passages that did not represent U.S. government policy, and pursued recovery of the manuals from the governments and some individual students. Notably, David Addington and Dick Cheney retained personal copies of the training manuals.\n\nSoon after, the U.S. Army issued the FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation manual, which was used until September 2006, when it was superseded by FM 2-22.3, Human Intelligence Collector Operations.\n\nThe first manual, \"KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation\", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual. KUBARK was a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency cryptonym for the CIA itself. The cryptonym KUBARK appears in the title of a 1963 CIA document \"KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation\" which describes interrogation techniques, including, among other things, \"coercive counterintelligence interrogation of resistant sources\". This is the oldest manual, and describes the use of abusive techniques, as exemplified by two references to the use of electric shock, in addition to use of threats and fear, sensory deprivation, and isolation.\n\nThe second manual, \"Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983\", was used in at least seven U.S. training courses conducted in Latin American countries, including Honduras, between 1982 and 1987. According to a declassified 1989 report prepared for the Senate intelligence committee, the 1983 manual was developed from notes of a CIA interrogation course in Honduras.\n\nBoth manuals deal exclusively with interrogation. Both manuals have an entire chapter devoted to \"coercive techniques\". These manuals recommend arresting suspects early in the morning by surprise, blindfolding them, and stripping them naked. Suspects should be held incommunicado and should be deprived of any kind of normal routine in eating and sleeping. Interrogation rooms should be windowless, soundproof, dark and without toilets.\n\nThe manuals advise that torture techniques can backfire and that the threat of pain is often more effective than pain itself. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used \"to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist.\" These techniques include prolonged constraint, prolonged exertion, extremes of heat, cold, or moisture, deprivation of food or sleep, disrupting routines, solitary confinement, threats of pain, deprivation of sensory stimuli, hypnosis, and use of drugs or placebos.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1985, after congressional committees began questioning training techniques being used by the CIA in Latin America, the 1983 manual went through substantial revision. In 1985 a page advising against using coercive techniques was inserted at the front of \"Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual\". Handwritten changes were also introduced haphazardly into the text. For example, \"While we do not stress the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them and the proper way to use them\", has been altered to, \"While we deplore the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them so that you may avoid them.\" (p. A-2) But the entire chapter on coercive techniques is still provided with some items crossed out.\n\nThe same manual states the importance of knowing local laws regarding detention but then notes, \"Illegal detention always requires prior HQS [headquarters] approval.\" (p. B-2)\n\nThe two manuals were completely declassified and released to the public in May 2004, and are now available online.\n\nIn 1983, the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983 methods were used by the U.S.-trained Honduran Battalion 3-16.\n\nOn January 24, 1997, \"KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation\" and \"Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983\" were declassified in response to a FOIA request filed by the Baltimore Sun in 1994. The Baltimore Sun was investigating \"kidnapping, torture and murder\" committed by the Honduran Battalion 3-16 death squad. The documents were released only after the Baltimore Sun had threatened to sue the CIA.\n\nIn the June 11 to 18, 1995 four-part series, \"The Baltimore Sun\" printed excerpts of an interview with Florencio Caballero, a former member of Battalion 3-16. Caballero said CIA instructors taught him to discover what his prisoners loved and what they hated, \"If a person did not like cockroaches, then that person might be more cooperative if there were cockroaches running around the room\" The methods taught in the 1983 manual and those used by Battalion 3-16 in the early 1980s show unmistakable similarities. In 1983, Caballero attended a CIA \"human resources exploitation or interrogation course,\" according to declassified testimony by Richard Stolz, who was the deputy director for operations at the time, before the June 1988 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The manual advises an interrogator to \"manipulate the subject's environment, to create unpleasant or intolerable situations.\"\n\nThe manual gives the suggestion that prisoners be deprived of sleep and food, and made to maintain rigid positions, such as standing at attention for long periods. Ines Consuelo Murillo, who spent 78 days in Battalion 3-16's secret jails in 1983, said she was given no food or water for days, and one of her captors entered her room every 10 minutes and poured water over her head to keep her from sleeping.\n\nThe \"Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual -- 1983\" gives the suggestion that interrogators show the prisoner letters from home to give the prisoner the impression that the prisoner's relatives are in danger or suffering.\n\n\"The Baltimore Sun\" reported that former Battalion 3-16 member Jose Barrera said he was taught interrogation methods by U.S. instructors in 1983: \"The first thing we would say is that we know your mother, your younger brother. And better you cooperate, because if you don't, we're going to bring them in and rape them and torture them and kill them.\" \n\n\n\nBaltimore Sun series:\n"}

{"id": "481128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=481128", "title": "Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty", "text": "Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty\n\nThe Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (also known as The True Record of the Joseon Dynasty) are the annual records of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, which were kept from 1413 to 1865. The annals, or \"sillok\", comprise 1,893 volumes and are thought to cover the longest continual period of a single dynasty in the world. With the exception of two \"sillok\" compiled during the colonial era, the \"Annals\" are the 151st national treasure of Korea and listed in UNESCO's Memory of the World registry.\n\nThe Annals has since 2006 been digitalized by the National Institute of Korean History and available on the internet with Modern Korean translation in Hangul and original text in Classical Chinese.\n\nIn January 2012, the National Institute of Korean History announced that they are to translate the Annals into English by the year 2033. They plan to start work in 2014 with an initial budget of , but estimate that a budget of is needed to complete the project. \n\nDuring the reign of a king, professional historiographers maintained extensive records on national affairs and the activities of the state. They collected documents and wrote daily accounts that included state affairs as well as diplomatic affairs, the economy, religion, meteorological phenomena, the arts, and daily life, among other things. These daily accounts became the \"Sacho\" (\"Draft History\"). Great care was taken to ensure the neutrality of the historiographers, who were also officials with legal guarantees of independence. Nobody was allowed to read the \"Sacho\", not even the king, and any historiographer who disclosed its contents or changed the content could be punished with beheading. These strict regulations lend great credibility to these records. \nYet at least one king, tyrannical Yeonsangun looked into the Annals, and this led to the First Literati Purge of 1498, in which one recorder and five others were cruelly executed because of what was written in the \"Sacho\". This incident led to greater scrutiny to prevent the king from seeing the \"Annals\". In the Later Joseon period when there was intense conflict between different political factions, revision or rewriting of \"sillok\" by rival factions took place, but they were identified as such, and the original version was preserved. \nThe original recorders recorded every word and act of the king in the \"Sacho\" although not all details were included in the final version. For instance, King Taejong fell from a horse one day and immediately told those around him not to let a recorder know about his fall. A recorder wrote both Taejong's fall and his words not to record it. In another instance, Taejong was recorded to complain about a recorder who eavesdropped on him behind a screen and followed him to a hunt behind a disguise. \n\nUpon the death of a king and the coronation of his successor, the \"Sillokcheong\" (\"Office for Annals Compilation\") used the \"Sacho\" to begin compilation of his annals.\n\nThe \"Annals\" of the first three kings of the Joseon dynasty, those of Taejo (r.1392–1398), Jeongjong (r.1399–1400), and Taejong (r. 1401–1418), were hand-written manuscripts. Later annals, from the Annals of Sejong (r. 1418–1450) onwards, were printed with movable metal and wooden type, which was unprecedented in the making of annals in Japan and China. \n\nFour separate repositories were established in Chunchugwan, Chungju County, Jeonju County, and Seongju County to store copies of the \"Annals\". All but the repository in Jeonju were burned down during the Imjin wars. After the war, five more copies of the \"Annals\" were produced and stored in Chunchugwan and the mountain repositories of Myohyang-san, Taebaeksan, Odaesan, and Mani-san. The Chunchugwan copy was lost in 1624, due to the treason of Yi Gwal. Part of the Mani-san copy was lost during the Manchu invasion (1636), and the surviving volumes moved to Jeongjok-san in 1678. The Myohyang-san copy was moved to Jeokseong-san in 1633. During the colonial era, the Japanese moved the Odae-san copy to Tokyo University, but most of the copy was soon lost in the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923. 47 books have remained, and in July 2006, the copy returned to South Korea. \n\nThe \"Annals\" are written in Classical Chinese; they were translated into modern Korean in the 1980s in North Korea and in 1994 in South Korea. Parts of the \"Annals of the Joseon Dynasty\" have been scanned by Seoul National University and are available online.\n\nThe annals of the last two Joseon rulers, the emperors Gojong and Sunjong, have been excluded from the \"Annals of the Joseon Dynasty\". Written during the Japanese occupation of Korea, \"Gojong sillok\" and \"Sunjong sillok\" are regarded as \"unreliable documents\" by Korean academics because of the influence of Japanese officials on their compilation as well as the falsification of historical events. Although they have been included in the National Institute of Korean History's modern Korean translation as the \"Annals of the Last Two Emperors of the Joseon Dynasty\", they are not considered part of the \"Annals of the Joseon Dynasty\" and are not included in the National Treasures of South Korea or UNESCO's Memory of the World register.\n\n\n"}
