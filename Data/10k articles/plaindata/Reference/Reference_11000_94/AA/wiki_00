{"id": "5858140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5858140", "title": "Arnold Paole", "text": "Arnold Paole\n\nArnold Paole (\"Arnont Paule\" in the original documents; an early German rendition of a Serbian name or nickname, perhaps Арнаут Павле, \"Arnaut Pavle\"; died c. 1726) was a Serbian hajduk who was believed to have become a vampire after his death, initiating an epidemic of supposed vampirism that killed at least 16 people in his native village of Meduegna (also rendered as Metwett; likely a German rendition of Serbian \"Medveđa)\", located at the West Morava river in Trstenik, Serbia.\n\nPaole's case, similar to that of Petar Blagojevich, became famous because of the direct involvement of the Austrian authorities and the documentation by Austrian physicians and officers, who confirmed the reality of vampires. Their report of the case was distributed in Western Europe and contributed to the spread of vampire belief among educated Europeans. The report and its significance for the subsequent eighteenth century vampire controversy are nowadays explained with the poor understanding of the process of corpse decomposition at the time.\n\nKnowledge of the case is based mostly on the reports of two Austrian military doctors, Glaser and Flückinger, who were successively sent to investigate the case. Scholars have suggested that Paole's case has influenced the depiction of vampires in popular culture texts.\n\nWith the Treaty of Passarowitz (\"Požarevac\", 1718), the Habsburg Monarchy annexed most of Serbia and the northern part of Bosnia, territories which had been part of the Ottoman Empire. These remained in Austrian control until the Treaty of Belgrade (1739), when the Austrians were forced to cede them back to the Turks. During this 20-year period, these newly conquered boundary districts were subject to direct military rule from Vienna for strategic, fiscal and other reasons. As a result of the devastation brought about by previous Austrian-Ottoman wars, these areas were in poor condition, with a scarce and partly nomadic population, little agriculture and an emphasis on cattle-breeding. The Austrian authorities sought to further economic development and to attract German-speaking Serbian settlers to the new territories. Many of the Serbs, especially those who had immigrated from Ottoman-held areas, were recruited as militiamen (hajduks) for the peacetime protection of the borders and for regular military service at war, in exchange for unalienable lots of land. It was in these communities that the earliest well-documented alleged vampire attacks were attested.\n\nThis outbreak is only known from Flückinger's report about the second epidemic and its prehistory. According to the account of the Medveđa locals as retold there, Arnold Paole was a hajduk who had moved to the village from the Turkish-controlled part of Serbia. He reportedly often mentioned that he had been plagued by a vampire at a location named Gossowa (perhaps Kosovo), but that he had cured himself by eating soil from the vampire's grave and smearing himself with his blood. About 1725, he broke his neck in a fall from a haywagon. Within 20 or 30 days after Paole's death, four people complained that they had been plagued by him. These people all died shortly thereafter. It was then remembered that Arnold had often related in the environs of Cassanovia, and on the Turkish Servia, he had often been tormented by a Turkish vampire. He also relayed that he attempted to cure himself by eating earth of the grave of the vampire, and smearing himself with his blood. Ten days later, and forty days after Arnold's death, the villagers, advised by their \"hadnack\" (a military/administrative title) who had witnessed such events before, opened his grave. They saw that the corpse was undecomposed with all the indications of an arch-vampire. His veins were replete with fluid-blood \"and that fresh blood had flowed from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears; that the shirt, the covering, and the coffin were completely bloody; that the old nails on his hands and feet, along with the skin, had fallen off, and that new ones had grown\". Further, \"his body was red, his hair, nails and beard had all grown again. Concluding that Paole was indeed a vampire, they drove a stake through his heart, to which he reacted by frightful shriek as if he were alive, groaning and bleeding, and burned the body. That done, they cut off his head and burnt the whole body. They then disinterred Paole's four supposed victims and performed the same procedure, to prevent them from becoming vampires as well.\n\nAbout five years later, in the winter of 1731, a new epidemic occurred, with more than ten people dying within several weeks, some of them in just two or three days without any previous illness and others after 3 days of languishing. The numbers and the age of the deceased vary somewhat between the two main sources.\n\nGlaser's report on the case states that by 12 December, 13 people had died in the course of six weeks. Glaser names the following victims (here rearranged chronologically): Miliza (Serbian \"Milica\", a 50-year-old woman); Milloi (Serbian \"Miloje\", a 14-year-old boy); Joachim (a 15-year-old boy); Peter (Serbian \"Petar\", a 15-day-old boy); Stanno (Serbian \"Stana\", a 20-year-old woman) as well as her newborn child, which Glaser notes was buried \"behind a fence, where the mother had lived\" due to not having lived long enough to be baptized; Wutschiza (Serbian \"Vučica\", a nine-year-old boy), Milosova (Serbian \"Milosava\", a 30-year-old wife of a hajduk), Radi (Serbian \"Rade\", a 24-year-old man), and Ruschiza (Serbian \"Ružica\", a 40-year-old woman). The sick had complained of stabs in the sides and pain in the chest, prolonged fever and jerks of the limbs. Glaser reports that the locals considered Milica and Stana to have started the vampirism epidemic. According to his retelling, Milica had come to the village from Ottoman-controlled territories six years before. The locals' testimony indicated that she had always been a good neighbour and that, to the best of their knowledge, she had never \"believed or practiced something diabolic\". However, she had once mentioned to them that, while still in Ottoman lands, she had eaten two sheep that had been killed by vampires. Stana, on the other hand, had admitted that when she was in Ottoman-controlled lands, she had smeared herself with vampire blood as a protection against vampires (as these had been very active there). According to local belief, both things would cause the women to become vampires after death.\n\nAccording to Flückinger's report, by the 7th of January, 17 people had died within a period of three months (the last two of these apparently after Glaser's visit). He mentions Miliza (\"Milica\", a 69-year-old woman, died after a three-month illness); an unnamed 8 year-old child; Milloe (\"Miloje\", a 16-year-old boy, died after a three-day illness); Stana (a 20-year-old woman, died in childbirth after a three-day illness, reportedly said that she had smeared herself with vampire blood) as well as her stillborn child (as Flückinger observes, \"half-eaten by the dogs due to a slovenly burial\"); an unnamed 10-year-old girl; Joachim (a 17-year-old, died after a three-day illness); the \"hadnack\"&apos;s unnamed wife; Ruscha (\"Ruža\" – variant of \"Ružica\" – a woman, died after a ten-day illness); Staniko (\"Stanjko\", a 60-year-old man); Miloe (\"Miloje\", the second victim of that name; a 25-year-old man); Ruža's child (18 days old); Rhade (\"Rade\", a 21-year-old servant of the local hajduk corporal, died after a three-month-long illness); the local standard-bearer's (\"barjaktar\"&apos;s) unnamed wife, apparently identical to Milosava in the other report along with her child; the eight-week-old child of the \"hadnack\"; Stanoicka (\"Stanojka\", a 20-year-old woman, the wife of a hajduk, died after a three-day illness). According to her father-in-law Joviza (\"Jovica\"), Stanojka had gone to bed healthy 15 days previous, but had woken up at midnight in terrible fear and cried that she had been throttled by the late Miloje. Flückinger states that the locals explain the new epidemic with the fact that Milica, the first to die, had eaten the meat of sheep that the \"previous vampires\" (i.e. Paole and his victims from five years prior) had killed. He also mentions, in passing, the claims that Stana, before her death, had admitted having smeared herself with blood to protect herself from vampires and would therefore become a vampire herself, as would her child.\n\nAccording to Augustin Calmet's analysis of the case, \"a girl named Stanoska, daughter of the Heyducq Jotiutzo, who went to bed in perfect health, awoke in the middle of the night in a tremble, uttering terrible shrieks, and saying that the son of Heyducq Millo who had been dead nine weeks, had nearly strangled her in her sleep. She fell into a languid state from that moment, and at the end of three days she died. What this girl had said of Millo's son made him known at once to be a vampire: he was exhumed and found to be such. The principle people of the place, with the doctors and surgeons, examined how vampirism could have sprung up again after the precautions they had taken years before.\"\n\nThe villagers complained of the new deaths to oberstleutnant Schnezzer, the Austrian military commander in charge of the administration. The latter, fearing an epidemic of pestilence, sent for Imperial Contagions-Medicus (roughly, Infectious Disease Specialist) Glaser stationed in the nearby town of Paraćin. On 12 December 1731, Glaser examined the villagers and their houses. He failed to find any signs of a contagious malady and blamed the deaths on the malnutrition common in the region as well as the unhealthy effects of the severe Eastern Orthodox fasting. However, the villagers insisted that the illnesses were caused by vampires. At the moment, two or three households were gathering together at night, with some asleep and others on the watch. They were convinced that the deaths wouldn't stop unless the vampires were executed by the authorities, and threatened to abandon the village in order to save their lives if that wasn't done. Failing Glaser consented to the exhumation of some of the deceased. To his surprise, he found that most of them were not decomposed and many were swollen and had blood in their mouths, while several others who had died \"more\" recently (namely Vučica, Milosava, and Rade) were rather decomposed. Glaser outlined his findings in a report to the Jagodina commandant's office, recommending that the authorities should pacify the population by fulfilling its request to \"execute\" the vampires. Schnezzer furthered Glaser's report to the Supreme Command in Belgrade (the city was then held by Austrian forces). The vice-commandant, Botta d'Adorno, sent a second commission to investigate the case.\n\nThe new commission included a military surgeon, Johann Flückinger, two officers, lieutenant colonel Büttner and J. H. von Lindenfels, along with two other military surgeons, Siegele and Johann Friedrich Baumgarten. On the 7th of January, together with the village elders and some local Gypsies, they opened the graves of the deceased. Their findings were similar to Glaser's, although their report contains much more anatomical detail. The commission established that, while five of the corpses (the \"hadnack\" 's wife and child, Rade, and the standard-bearer's wife and child) were decomposed, the remaining twelve were \"quite complete and undecayed\" and exhibited the traits that were commonly associated with vampirism. Their chests and in some cases other organs were filled with fresh (rather than coagulated) blood; the viscera were estimated to be \"in good condition\"; various corpses looked plump and their skin had a \"red and vivid\" (rather than pale) colour; and in several cases, \"the skin on ... hands and feet, along with the old nails, fell away on their own, but on the other hand completely new nails were evident, along with a fresh and vivid skin\". In the case of Milica, the hajduks who witnessed the dissection were very surprised at her plumpness, stating that they had known her well, from her youth, and that she had always been very \"lean and dried-up\"; it was only in the grave she had attained this plumpness. The surgeons summarized all these phenomena by stating that the bodies were in \"vampiric condition\" (\"Vampyrenstand\").\nAfter the examination had been completed, the Gypsies cut off the heads of the supposed vampires and burned both their heads and their bodies, the ashes being thrown in the Morava river. The decomposed bodies were laid back into their graves. The report is dated 26 January 1732, Belgrade, and bears the signatures of the five officers involved.\n\nOn the 13th of February, Glaser's father, Viennese doctor Johann Friedrich Glaser, who was also a correspondent of the Nuremberg journal \"Commercium Litterarium\", sent its editors a letter describing the entire case as his son had written to him about it already on the 18th of January. The story aroused great interest. After that, both reports (especially Flückinger's more detailed version) and the letter were reprinted in a number of articles and treatises.\n\nCalmet notes: \"They discovered at last, after much search, that the defunct Arnold Paul had killed not only the four persons of whom we have spoken, but also several oxen, of which the new vampires had eaten, and amongst others the son of Millo. Upon these indications they resolved to disinter all those who had died within a certain time, etc. Amongst forty, seventeen were found with all the most evident signs of vampirism; so they transfixed their hearts and cut off their heads also, then cast their ashes into the river. All the information and executions we have just mentioned were made judicial, in proper form, and attested by several officers who were garrisoned in the country, by the chief surgeons of the regiments, and by the principal inhabitants of the place. The verbal process of it was sent towards the end of last January to the Imperial Counsel of War at Vienna, which had established a military commission to examine into the truth of all these circumstances. Such was the declaration of the Hadnagi Barriarar and the ancient Heyducqs; and it was signed by Battuer, first lieutenant of the regiment of Alexander of Wurtemburg, Clickstenger, surgeon-in-chief of the regiment of Frustemburch, three other surgeons of the company and Guoichitz, captain at Stallach.\"\n\n\n"}

Distribution services are provided by Verisign. Prior to this, ICANN performed management responsibility under oversight of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an agency of the United States Department of Commerce.\n\nA combination of limits in the DNS definition and in certain protocols, namely the practical size of unfragmented User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, resulted in a practical maximum of 13 root name server addresses that can be accommodated in DNS name query responses. However the root zone is serviced by several hundred servers at over 130 locations in many countries.\n\nThe DNS root zone is served by thirteen root server clusters which are authoritative for queries to the top-level domains of the Internet. Thus, every name resolution either starts with a query to a root server or uses information that was once obtained from a root server.\n\nThe root servers clusters have the official names \"a.root-servers.net\" to \"m.root-servers.net\". To resolve these names into addresses, a DNS resolver must first find an authoritative server for the \"net\" zone. To avoid this circular dependency, the address of at least one root server must be known for bootstrapping access to the DNS. For this purpose operating systems or DNS server or resolver software packages typically include a file with all addresses of the DNS root servers. Even if the IP addresses of some root servers change, at least one is needed to retrieve the current list of all name servers. This address file is called \"named.cache\" in the BIND name server reference implementation. The current official version is distributed by ICANN's InterNIC.\n\nWith the address of a single functioning root server, all other DNS information may be discovered recursively, and information about any domain name may be found.\n\nThe root DNS servers are essential to the function of the Internet, as most Internet services, such as the World Wide Web and electronic-mail, are based on domain names. The DNS servers are potential points of failure for the entire Internet. For this reason, multiple root servers are distributed worldwide. The DNS packet size of 512 octets limits a DNS response to thirteen addresses, until protocol extensions (EDNS) lifted this restriction. While it is possible to fit more entries into a packet of this size when using label compression, thirteen was chosen as a reliable limit. Since the introduction of IPv6, the successor Internet Protocol to IPv4, previous practices are being modified and extra space is filled with IPv6 name servers.\n\nThe root name servers are hosted in multiple secure sites with high-bandwidth access to accommodate the traffic load. At first, all of these installations were located in the United States; however, the distribution has shifted and this is no longer the case. Usually each DNS server installation at a given site is a cluster of computers with load-balancing routers. A comprehensive list of servers, their locations and properties is available at http://root-servers.org. As of January 2016, there were 517 root servers worldwide.\n\nThe modern trend is to use anycast addressing and routing to provide resilience and load balancing across a wide geographic area. For example, the \"j.root-servers.net\" server, maintained by Verisign, is represented by 104 () individual server systems located around the world, which can be queried using anycast addressing.\n\nThe content of the Internet root zone file is coordinated by a subsidiary of ICANN which performs the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions. Verisign generates and distributes the zone file to the various root server operators.\n\nIn 1997, when the Internet was transferred from U.S. government control to private hands, NTIA has exercised stewardship over the root zone. A 1998 Commerce Department document stated the agency was \"committed to a transition that will allow the private sector to take leadership for DNS management\" by the year 2000, however, no steps to make the transition happen were taken. In March 2014, NTIA announced it will transition its stewardship to a \"global stakeholder community\". \n\nAccording to Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, Lawrence E. Strickling, March 2014 was the right time to start a transition of the role to the global Internet community. The move came after pressure in the fallout of revelations that the United States and its allies had engaged in surveillance. The chairman of the board of ICANN denied the two were connected, however, and said the transition process had been ongoing for a long time. ICANN president Fadi Chehadé called the move historic and said that ICANN will move toward multi-stakesholder control. Various prominent figures in Internet history, not affiliated with ICANN, also applauded the move.\n\nNTIA's announcement did not immediately affect how ICANN performs its role. On March 11, 2016 NTIA announced that it had received a proposed plan to transition its stewardship role over the root zone, and would review it in the next 90 days..\n\nThe proposal was adopted, and ICANN's renewed contract to perform the IANA function lapsed on September 30, 2016, resulting in the transition of oversight responsibility to the global stakeholder community represented within ICANN's governance structures. As a component of the transition plan, it created a new subsidiary called Public Technical Identifiers (PTI) to perform the IANA functions which include managing the DNS root zone.\n\nSince July 2010, the root zone has been signed with a DNSSEC signature, providing a single trust anchor for the Domain Name System that can in turn be used to provide a trust anchor for other public key infrastructure (PKI). The root zone is re-signed periodically with the root zone key signing key performed in a verifiable manner in front of witnesses in a key signing ceremony.\n\n\n\n"}

The Knights waged the Lithuanian Crusade to convert pagan Lithuanians into Christianity since the 1280s. The crusade was characterized with frequent raids into the enemy territory to loot and pillage. Since Lithuania lacked a developed road network, local Lithuanian and Prussian scouts would describe and document the best and most effective routes for the military raids into Lithuania.\n\nThe reports contained brief directions using both natural (rivers, lakes, swamps, forests) and man-made (villages, nobility estates, roads, formerly inhabited places) landmarks for navigation. It also described obstacles and provided locations of good places for rest camps, where to obtain drinking water or fodder for horses. The place names were recorded in old German, therefore some of them are quite distorted from their original Lithuanian form. Also, some places or place names did not survive to the present day. Therefore, there are many issues in trying to identify and locate the named places. However, the reports are still an important source for the study of Lithuanian local history, toponymy, geographic, social, and economic aspects of the 14th-century Lithuanian society. For example, \"Wegeberichte\" mentioned several \"alka\", i.e. sacred grooves or pagan shrines, and illustrated logistical difficulties faced by an invading army.\n\nThe scout reports were archived in the Prussian State Archive Königsberg. They were collected, organized, and first published in \"Scriptores Rerum Prussicarum\" as \"Die Littauischen Wegeberichte\" in 1863. The publisher, Theodor Hirsch, was the first to try and match place names in \"Wegeberichte\" with present-day locations. He also numbered and named the routes for easier referencing. A Lithuanian translation was prepared by Jurgis Jurginis in 1983, but it contains many inaccuracies. Several other historians studied \"Wegeberichte\", but overall is not a well-researched source.\n\n"}

Prior to the massacre, unlike many villages in the area, El Mozote had a reputation for neutrality. While many of its neighbors were largely Roman Catholic, and therefore often influenced by liberation theology and sympathetic to the guerrillas, El Mozote was largely Evangelical Protestant. The village had sold guerrillas some supplies but was also \"a place where the guerrillas had learned not to look for recruits.\"\n\nPrior to the massacre, the town's wealthiest man, Marcos Díaz, had gathered the citizens to warn them that the army would soon pass through the area in a counterinsurgency operation, but he had been assured that the town's residents would not be harmed if they remained in place. Concerned that fleeing the town would cause them to be mistaken for guerrillas, the townspeople chose to stay and extended an offer of protection to peasants from the surrounding area, who soon flooded the town.\n\nIn his 1994 book, \"The Massacre at El Mozote\", US journalist Mark Danner compiled various reports to reconstruct an account of the massacre:\n\nOn the afternoon of December 10, 1981, units of the Salvadoran army's Atlacatl Battalion arrived at the remote village of El Mozote after a clash with guerrillas in the vicinity. The Atlacatl was a \"Rapid Deployment Infantry Battalion\" specially trained for counter-insurgency warfare. It was the first unit of its kind in the Salvadoran armed forces and was trained by United States military advisors. Its mission, \"Operación Rescate\" (\"Operation Rescue\"), was to eliminate the rebel presence in a small region of northern Morazán where the FMLN had two camps and a training center.\n\nEl Mozote consisted of about 20 houses on open ground around a square. Facing onto the square was a church and, behind it, a small building known as \"the convent,\" used by the priest to change into his vestments when he came to the village to celebrate Mass. Near the village was a small schoolhouse.\n\nUpon arrival, the soldiers found not only the residents of the village but also campesinos who had sought refuge from the surrounding area. The soldiers ordered everyone out of their houses and into the square. They made people lie face down and searched them and questioned them about the guerrillas. They then ordered the villagers to lock themselves in their houses until the next day and warned that anyone coming out would be shot. The soldiers remained in the village during the night.\n\nEarly the next morning, the soldiers reassembled the entire village in the square. They separated the men from the women and children and locked them in separate groups in the church, the convent, and various houses.\n\nDuring the morning, they proceeded to interrogate, torture, and execute the men in several locations. Around noon, they began taking the women and older girls in groups, separating them from their children and machinegunning them after raping them. Girls as young as 10 were raped, with soldiers reportedly heard bragging how they especially liked the 12-year-old girls. Finally, they killed the children at first by slitting their throats, then by hanging them from trees, with one child as young as two years old. After killing the entire population, the soldiers set fire to the buildings.\n\nThe soldiers remained in El Mozote that night but, the next day, went to the village of Los Toriles and carried out a further massacre. Men, women, and children were taken from their homes, lined up, robbed, and shot, and their homes then set ablaze.\n\nNews of the massacre first appeared in the world media on January 27, 1982, in reports published by \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\". Raymond Bonner wrote in the \"Times\" of seeing \"the charred skulls and bones of dozens of bodies buried under burned-out roofs, beams, and shattered tiles.\" The villagers gave Bonner a list of 733 names, mostly children, women, and old people, all of whom, they claimed, had been murdered by government soldiers.\n\nAlma Guillermoprieto of the \"Post\", who visited the village separately a few days later, wrote of \"dozens of decomposing bodies still seen beneath the rubble and lying in nearby fields, despite the month that has passed since the incident... countless bits of bones—skulls, rib cages, femurs, a spinal column—poked out of the rubble.\"\n\nBoth reporters cited Rufina Amaya, a witness who had escaped into a tree during the attack. She told the reporters that the army had killed her husband and her four children, the youngest of whom was eight months old, and it lit the bodies on fire.\nSalvadoran army and government leaders denied the reports and officials of the Reagan administration called them \"gross exaggerations.\" The Associated Press reported that \"the U.S. Embassy disputed the reports, saying its own investigation had found... that no more than 300 people had lived in El Mozote.\"\n\nThe conservative organization Accuracy in Media accused the \"Times\" and \"Post\" of timing their stories to release them just before the congressional debate. Five months later, Accuracy in Media devoted an entire edition of its \"AIM Report\" to Bonner in which its editor Reed Irvine declared, \"Mr. Bonner had been worth a division to the communists in Central America.\" Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas Enders attacked Bonner and Guillermoprieto before a Senate committee, stating that there had been a battle between guerrillas and the army, but \"no evidence could be found to confirm that government forces systematically massacred civilians.\" Enders also repeated the claim that only 300 people had lived in Mozote, and it was impossible for the death toll to have reached that reported in the \"Times\" and \"Post\" stories.\n\nOn February 8, Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, told the committee that \"it appears to be an incident that is at least being significantly misused, at the very best, by the guerrillas.\"\n\nIn February, in an editorial, \"The Media's War\", \"The Wall Street Journal\" criticized Bonner's reporting as \"overly credulous\" and \"out on a limb.\" In \"Time\" magazine, William A. Henry III wrote a month later, \"An even more crucial if common oversight is the fact that women and children, generally presumed to be civilians, can be active participants in guerrilla war. \"New York Times\" correspondent Raymond Bonner underplayed that possibility, for example, in a much-protested January 27 report of a massacre by the army in and around the village of Mozote.\" U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton called Bonner an \"advocate journalist\". Bonner was recalled to New York in August and later left the paper.\n\nAlthough attacked less vigorously than Bonner, Alma Guillermoprieto was also a target of criticism. A Reagan official wrote a letter to the \"Post\" stating that she had once worked for a communist newspaper in Mexico, which Guillermoprieto denied.\n\nOn October 26, 1990, a criminal complaint was filed against the Atlacatl Battalion for the massacre by Pedro Chicas Romero of La Joya. Romero had survived the massacre himself by hiding in a cave above the town.\n\nIn 1992, as part of the peace settlement established by the Chapultepec Peace Accords signed in Mexico City on January 16 of that year, the United Nations-sanctioned Commission on the Truth for El Salvador investigating human rights abuses committed during the war supervised the exhumations of the El Mozote remains by an Argentinian team of forensic specialists beginning November 17. The excavation confirmed the previous reports of Bonner and Guillermoprieto that hundreds of civilians had been killed on the site.\n\nThe Salvadoran Minister of Defense and the Chief of the Armed Forces Joint Staff informed the Truth Commission that they had no information that would make it possible to identify the units and officers who participated in \"Operación Rescate\". They claimed that there were no records for the period. The Truth Commission stated in its final report:\n\nThere is full proof that on December 11, 1981, in the village of El Mozote, units of the Atlacatl Battalion deliberately and systematically killed a group of more than 200 men, women and children, constituting the entire civilian population that they had found there the previous day and had since been holding prisoner... there is [also] sufficient evidence that in the days preceding and following the El Mozote massacre, troops participating in \"Operation Rescue\" massacred the non-combatant civilian population in La Joya canton, in the villages of La Rancheria, Jocote Amatillo y Los Toriles, and in Cerro Pando canton.\n\nIn 1993, El Salvador passed an amnesty law for all individuals implicated by UN investigations, which effectively exempted the army from prosecution. That year, Danner published an article in the December 6 issue of \"The New Yorker\". His article, \"The Truth of El Mozote\", caused widespread consternation, as it rekindled the debate regarding the United States' role in Central America during the violence-torn 1970s and 1980s. He subsequently expanded the article into a book, \"The Massacre at El Mozote\" (1994). In a prefatory remark, Danner wrote:\n\nThat in the United States it came to be known, that it was exposed to the light and then allowed to fall back into the dark, makes the story of El Mozote—how it came to happen and how it came to be denied—a central parable of the Cold War.\n\nIn 1993, a special State Department panel that examined the actions of U.S. diplomats vis-a-vis human rights in El Salvador concluded that \"mistakes were certainly made... particularly in the failure to get the truth about the December 1981 massacre at El Mozote.\" In his study of the media and the Reagan administration, \"On Bended Knee\", U.S. author Mark Hertsgaard wrote of the significance of the first reports of the massacre:\n\nWhat made the Morazan massacre stories so threatening was that they repudiated the fundamental moral claim that undergirded US policy. They suggested that what the United States was supporting in Central America was not democracy but repression. They therefore threatened to shift the political debate from means to ends, from how best to combat the supposed Communist threat—send US troops or merely US aid?—to why the United States was backing state terrorism in the first place.\n\nA later court decision overturned the amnesty for defendants suspected of \"egregious human rights violations\" but attempts by Salvadoran lawyers to reopen the case repeatedly failed.\n\nOn March 7, 2005, the Organization of American States's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reopened an investigation into the El Mozote massacre based on the evidence found by the Argentine forensic anthropologists. As of December 2011, activists continued to lobby the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to hear the case.\n\nIn a January 2007 report in \"The Washington Post\", a former Salvadoran soldier, José Wilfredo Salgado, told of returning to El Mozote several months after the massacre and collecting the skulls of the youngest victims, whose remains were exposed by recent rains, for \"candleholders and good-luck charms.\"\n\nIn December 2011, the Salvadoran government formally apologized for the massacre, in a ceremony in the town. Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez, speaking on the government's behalf, called the massacre the \"blindness of state violence\" and asked for forgiveness.\n\nIn October 2012, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered El Salvador to investigate the El Mozote massacre and bring those responsible to justice. The court ruled that an amnesty law did not cover the killings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5172969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5172969", "title": "Ethnic majority", "text": "Ethnic majority\n\nAn ethnic majority refers to an ethnic group that comprises the majority of a particular population. Ethnicity refers to the mother's tongue and identification with a historical nation or other cultural heritage, as well as with religious traditions and behavioral practices inherited from relatives. A person that was adopted as child from another culture but raised in a domestic family may identify with the ethnic majority of the country. \n\nAn ethnic majority contrasts with those who mainly identify them selves with ethnic minorities (official minority languages) of the population, for example indigenous people, or with immigrant ethnicities. A national state is a state or country that originated from its ethnic majority or nation (nationality). Note that a person may identify with several etchnic groups, or with a multi-etchnic culture. \n\nIn anglo-saxic countries, ethnicity as well as race are registered in official statistics, based on self-reported identification by the individual, for example in view to discover discrimination. In for example Scandinavian countries, no official statistics is kept on ethnicity or race. According to the European GDPR law, it is typically not allowed to register ethnicity or race.\n\nIn the context of genealogy, for example medical genetics or genealogical DNA tests, ethnicity is defined based on biological rather than cultural heritage. However, various genealogical DNA tests result in contradictory and insecure estimates of the ethnic mix of a person, since the result of each test depends on the reference group and how it is divided into ethnic groups. Thus, it is typically not possible to securely determine if a person belongs to the ethnic majority or not using genetic tests. \n\nEthnicity is sometimes confused with race, which however is defined based on heritage from a certain continent. The zoological meaning of race cannot be applied to humans since race can not be identified unambiguously from biological features such as skin color. It is disputed to what extent race can be identified using genetics. \n\n"}
{"id": "226577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226577", "title": "Franklin Institute", "text": "Franklin Institute\n\nThe Franklin Institute is a science museum and the center of science education and research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is named after the American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, and houses the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial. Founded in 1824, the Franklin Institute is one of the oldest centers of science education and development in the United States.\n\nOn February 5, 1824, Samuel Vaughan Merrick and William H. Keating founded the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania for the Promotion of the Mechanic Arts.\n\nBegun in 1825, the Institute was an important force in the professionalization of American science and technology through the nineteenth century, beginning with early investigations into steam engines and water power. In addition to conducting scientific inquiry it fostered research and education by running schools, publishing the influential \"Journal of The Franklin Institute\", sponsoring exhibitions, and recognizing scientific advancement and invention with medals and awards.\n\nIn the late twentieth century the Institute's research roles gave way to educating the general public through its museum. The Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute, founded in 1924 to conduct research in the physical sciences, is now part of the University of Delaware. The Franklin Institute Laboratories for Research and Development operated from the Second World War into the 1980s.\nMany scientists have demonstrated groundbreaking new technology at the Franklin Institute. From September 2 to October 11, 1884, it hosted the International Electrical Exhibition of 1884, the first great electrical exposition in the United States. The world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system was later given by Philo Taylor Farnsworth on August 25, 1934.\n\nThe first female member, Elizabeth Skinner, was elected to membership in 1833. The Franklin Institute was integrated in 1870, when Philadelphia teacher and activist Octavius Catto was admitted as a member.\n\nThe Institute's original building at 15 South 7th Street, now the home of the Atwater Kent Museum, eventually proved too small for the Institute's research, educational programs, and library. The Institute moved into its current home on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, near the intersection with 20th Street, in 1934. The new facility was intended from the start to educate visitors through hand-on interactions with exhibits: \"Visitors to this museum would be encouraged to touch, handle, and operate the exhibits in order to\nlearn how things work.\" Funds to build the new Institute and Franklin Memorial came from the Poor Richard Club, the City Board of Trust, the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc., and the Franklin Institute. John T. Windrim's original design was a completely square building surrounding the Benjamin Franklin Statue, which had yet to be built. Despite the effects of the Great Depression, the Benjamin Franklin Memorial, Inc. raised $5 million between December 1929 and June 1930. Only two of the four wings envisioned by Windrim were built; these face the Parkway and share design elements with other cultural and civic structures around Logan Circle.\n\nOn March 31, 1940, press agent William Castellini issued a press release stating that the world would end the next day. The story was picked up by KYW, which reported, \"Your worst fears that the world will end are confirmed by astronomers of Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. Scientists predict that the world will end at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time tomorrow. This is no April Fool joke. Confirmation can be obtained from Wagner Schlesinger, director of the Fels Planetarium of this city.\" This caused a panic in the city which only subsided when the Franklin Institute assured people it had made no such prediction. Castellini was dismissed shortly thereafter.\n\nOn December 21, 2017, during a party hosted by the museum, a partygoer with his companions slipped into a closed-off exhibit of ten terracotta warriors on loan from China. After his companions left, the partygoer broke off and stole a thumb from one of the warriors. Law enforcement agents later recovered the stolen thumb. The vandalized cavalryman is valued at 4.5 million USD, and is considered a \"priceless part of China's cultural heritage\". The vandalism stoked outrage in Chinese media such as Xinhua. The Franklin Institute blamed its external security contractor, and stated it has reviewed its security measures and procedures to prevent such situations from recurring.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, the Franklin Institute began fundraising activities for the Inspire Science! capital campaign, a $64.7 million campaign intended to fund the construction of a 53,000 square foot building addition, new exhibits, and upgrades and renovations to the existing Institute building and exhibits.\n\nIn 2011, the Franklin Institute received a $10 million gift from Athena and Nicholas Karabots towards the Inspire Science! capital campaign. This gift is the largest gift in the Institute's history, and put the Franklin Institute within $6 million of the $64.7 million capital campaign goal. The Nicholas and Athena Karabots Pavilion will house not only a $10 million multiroom exhibit on neuroscience, but also a conference center, classroom space, and additional room for traveling exhibitions.\n\nThe most recognizable part of the Franklin Institute's Science Center is the Franklin Institute Science Museum. In the spirit of inquiry and discovery embodied by Benjamin Franklin, the mission of the Franklin Institute Science Museum serves to inspire an understanding of and passion for science and technology learning. Among other exhibits, the Science Museum holds the largest collection of artifacts from the Wright brothers' workshop.\n\n\nThe Science Center includes many pertinent attractions that are not museum exhibits. The Budd BB-1 \"Pioneer\" flying boat, in front of the museum, was the first stainless steel airplane built by the Edward F. Budd Manufacturing Corporation and has been on display since 1935.\n\nA mock-up which would eventually become the Lunar Module in the Apollo space program, first shown on display in the 1966–67 World's Fair, held in the New York Hall of Science, is also located on the grounds. (See .)\n\nIn 1933, Samuel Simeon Fels contributed funds to build The Fels Planetarium, only the second built in the United States after Chicago's Adler Planetarium. Fully reconstructed in 2002, the Planetarium's new design includes replacement of the original 40,000-pound stainless steel dome, originally built in 1933. The new premium dome is lighter and is in diameter. It is the first of its kind in the United States. The planetarium is also outfitted for visitors who are hearing impaired.\n\n\"The Tuttleman IMAX Theater\" is an IMAX dome theater that is 180° encompassing and tilted at 30 degrees. The seating places the audience up in the dome which is over across and 4.5 stories tall. In addition, the theater has 20,000 watts of amplifier power and over 50 speakers.\n\nEarly in 2008, extensive renovation of the museum's auditorium was completed. Previously a lecture hall, the space was renamed Franklin Theater, and features 3-D and hi-def Blu-ray digital projection capabilities. The Franklin Theater shows educational films during daytime hours while also including mass release feature-length films.\n\nIn the past, the Science Center has hosted many traveling exhibits including \"Storms\", \"Titanic\", \"Grossology\", \"Body Worlds\", \"Darwin\", and \"Robots\". In the summer of 2007, the Franklin Institute hosted \"Tutankhamun and The Golden Age of The Pharaohs,\" in the Mandell Center of the Franklin Institute Science Museum. The exhibit began its United States Tour in Los Angeles, CA, and went to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Chicago, IL, before coming to Philadelphia for its final American appearance. When the exhibit left Philadelphia on September 30, 2007, it traveled to London, England.\n\nThis exhibit was nearly twice the size of the original Tutankhamun exhibit of the 1970s, and contained 50 objects directly from Tut's tomb, as well as nearly 70 object from the tombs of his ancestors in The Valley of the Kings. The show also featured a CAT Scan that revealed what the Boy King may have looked like.\n\nThe Franklin Institute is a member of the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) and the American Alliance of Museums (AAM).\n\nThe Franklin Institute is also a member of the Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative with the Fort Worth Museum of Science & History; the Museum of Science, Boston; COSI Columbus, formerly known as the \"Center of Science and Industry\" in Columbus, Ohio; OMSI in Portland, Oregon; the Science Museum of Minnesota in Saint Paul, Minnesota; and the California Science Center, formerly the \"California Museum of Science & Industry\", in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe Benjamin Franklin National Memorial features a high marble statue, sculpted by James Earle Fraser. Originally opened in 1938, the Memorial was designed by architect John Windrim and modeled after the Pantheon in Rome. The Hall is in length, width, and height. The domed ceiling is self-supporting and weighs 1600 tons. The floors, walls, columns, pilasters, and cornices are made of marbles imported from Portugal, Italy, and France.\nThe United States Congress designated the Hall and statue as the official Benjamin Franklin National Memorial on October 25, 1972. The Memorial was dedicated by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in 1976.\n\nThe Benjamin Franklin National Memorial is the only privately owned National Memorial in the country, and it is maintained by the museum.\n\nOn December 30, 2005, Congress authorized the Institute to receive up to $10,000,000 in matching grants for the rehabilitation of the memorial and for the development of related exhibits.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial was re-opened after a summer-long restoration that included multimedia enhancements. Philadelphia's most famous citizen is now featured in \"Benjamin Franklin Forever\" - an hourly 3.5-minute multimedia presentation utilizing the entire rotunda.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the Franklin Institute's Frankliniana Collection, some of which is on rotating display in the Pendulum Staircase. Highlights include Franklin's 1777 Nini Medallion, the scale model of the bust from the statue in the Memorial, the figurehead of Franklin's bust from the \"USS Franklin\", his ceremonial sword used in the court of King Louis XVI, and the odometer that Franklin used to measure the postal routes in Philadelphia. Additionally, the Institute's \"Electricity\" exhibition highlights one of Franklin's lightning rods, his electricity tube, a Franklin Electrostatic Generator, the 1751 publication of Franklin's \"Experiments and Observations on Electricity\", and Thornton Oakley's two 1940 historical murals of Franklin and the \"Kite and Key\" experiment.\n\nIn 1826, \"The Journal of The Franklin Institute\" was established to publish US Patent information and to document scientific and technological achievements throughout the nation. It is the second oldest continuously published scientific journal in the country, and is now primarily devoted to applied mathematics.\n\nSince 1824, the Franklin Institute has maintained the longest continuously awarded science and technology awards program in the United States, and one of the oldest in the world. The first issue of the \"Journal of The Franklin Institute\", dated January 1826, makes the first written reference to these awards. Before 1998 several medals were awarded by the Franklin Institute, such as (year indicates when the award was first presented): the Elliott Cresson Medal (1875), the \"Edward Longstreth Medal\" (1890), the Howard N. Potts Medal (1911), the Franklin Medal (1915), the George R. Henderson Medal (1924), the \"Louis E. Levy Medal\" (1924), the John Price Wetherill Medal (1926), The Frank P. Brown Medal (first awarded per FI site is 1941), Stuart Ballantine Medal (1947), and the \"Albert A. Michelson Medal\" (1968). Past winners include Henry Ford, Frank Lloyd Wright, Marie Curie, and Thomas Edison.\n\nIn 1998 all of the endowed medals were reorganized as the \"Benjamin Franklin Medals\". Multiple medals are given every year, for different fields of science and engineering. The fields awarded today are \"Chemistry\", \"Computer and Cognitive Science\", \"Earth and Environmental Science\", \"Electrical Engineering\", \"Life Science\", \"Mechanical Engineering\" and \"Physics\". In the past also the fields \"Earth Science\", \"Engineering\" and \"Materials Science\" were rewarded.\n\nAdditionally since 1990, the \"Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science\" (shortly the \"Bower Science Award\") and the \"Bower Award for Business Leadership\" have been awarded annually. They are funded by a $7.5 million bequest in 1988 from Henry Bower, who was a chemical manufacturer in Philadelphia. The Bower Science Award contains $250,000 of cash, one of the largest amounts for a science award in the U.S.\n\nThe Institute's Committee on Science and the Arts determines the winners of these awards. Recipients and related information can be found in the laureates database.\n\nThe Franklin Institute also undertakes research in informal science education. Areas of special strength are educational technology, school partnerships, and youth leadership. In addition, the Center has built a substantial portfolio of unique online resources of the history of science, including online exhibits on Ben Franklin and the Heart, as well as resources on the Wright Aeronautical Engineering Collection.\n\nOpening in September 2006, The \"Science Leadership Academy\" is a partnership between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia.\n\nThe Franklin Institute offers summer institutes and school year mini-courses for K-8 teachers, in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia and Curriculum & Instruction Office.\n\n\"Partnerships for Achieving Careers in Technology and Science\", or PACTS, is a year-round program of science enrichment, career development, and leadership opportunities for diverse middle- and high-school students in the Philadelphia Region. PACTS students use hands-on science workshops, field based research, field trips, and laboratory experiments to learn how science affects their everyday lives.\n\n\"Girls at the Center\" is a partnership between the Franklin Institute and the Girl Scouts of the USA provided girls and their families a chance to learn about science together. Over 100 sites participated in the program, with over seventy of the sites still active today. Girls at the Center provided activities for the girls to do with their families at home, as well as projects to be completed on site, all culminating in a year-end party.\n\nThe Franklin Institute is a member of the Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network (NISE Net).\n\n"}
{"id": "1648647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1648647", "title": "Ghost detainee", "text": "Ghost detainee\n\nGhost detainee is a term used in the executive branch of the United States government to designate a person held in a detention center, whose identity has been hidden by keeping them unregistered and therefore anonymous. Such uses arose as the Bush administration initiated the war on terror following the 9/11 attacks of 2001 in the United States. As documented in the 2004 \"Taguba Report\", it was used in the same manner by United States (US) officials and contractors of the Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2003-2004.\n\nAccording to the Swiss senator Dick Marty's memorandum on \"alleged detention in Council of Europe states\", the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has captured about one hundred persons on European territory and subsequently rendered them to countries where they may have been tortured. This number of one hundred extraordinarily rendered persons is in addition to the estimated hundred U.S. ghost detainees.\n\nAccording to then-CIA chief Michael Hayden in 2007, the CIA had detained up to 100 people at secret facilities abroad (known as black sites) since the 2002 capture of the suspected Al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah.\n\nOne example is Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen abducted by the CIA in Macedonia in January 2004. He was taken to a CIA black site in Afghanistan, known as the Salt Pit, for questioning under 'enhanced interrogation techniques' before he was determined to be innocent in March and eventually released in May 2004 after some additional delays. His abduction was said to be a case of mistaken identity. Germany initially claimed that it did not know of el-Masri's abduction until his return to the country in May 2004. But, on June 1, 2006, the BND (German intelligence agency) declared that it had known of El-Masri's seizure 16 months before Germany was officially informed of his arrest.\n\nIn a 2007 report, Human Rights Watch related the claims of an alleged ghost detainee, Marwan Jabour, a Palestinian who was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, in May 2004. He claimed to have been held for more than a month in a secret detention facility operated by Pakistanis and Americans in Islamabad. He was flown to a CIA prison in Afghanistan, where he was held in secret, incommunicado detention for more than two years. During his ordeal, he was tortured, beaten, forced to stay awake for days, and kept naked and chained to a wall for more than a month.\n\nAt least 39 detainees who were once held by the CIA in secret detention remain \"disappeared,\" according to \"Off the Record,\" a report jointly published June 7, 2007 by six leading human rights groups, including Amnesty International, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, and Human Rights Watch. Spokesmen say that their report:\n\n... reveals the extent to which the United States has illegally used \"proxy detention\" to empty its secret sites and demonstrates that far from targeting the \"worst of the worst,\" the system sweeps up low-level detainees and even involves the detention of the wives and children of the \"disappeared,\" in violation of their human rights. 'Off the Record' also documents allegations concerning the treatment of detainees while in secret detention, including torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nThe practice of \"ghosting\" first achieved widespread attention in 2005 when the \"Washington Post\" broke a story suggesting that the U.S. Army and the CIA were detaining \"unlawful enemy combatants\" at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq with little or no due process. According to the article, the CIA asked military intelligence officials to let them house ghost detainees at Abu Ghraib by September 2003 and proposed a Memorandum of Understanding between the agencies on the topic that November. The Army and the Defense Department have acknowledged that the United States has used ghosting in the past, but have said it was limited to isolated incidents. According to documents obtained by the \"Post\", \"unregistered CIA detainees were brought to Abu Ghraib several times a week in late 2003.\"\n\nThe Post cited as evidence the 2004 report by Major General Antonio Taguba:\n\n... in a report describing abuses of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, [he] blamed the 800th Military Police Brigade, which guarded the prison, for allowing 'other government agencies' — a euphemism that includes the CIA — to hide 'ghost' detainees at Abu Ghraib. The practice, he wrote, 'was deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine, and in violation of international law'.\n\nWhen news of a detainee known only as Triple X became known to the public in late 2003, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was questioned about him. Rumsfeld was evasive, and speculated about why someone would want to keep a prisoner hidden from the Red Cross. This is considered a war crime under international law.\n\nOn September 9, 2004, General Paul J. Kern testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, stating that an inquiry he led found that the Army had cooperated with the CIA in hiding dozens of ghost detainees from the Red Cross. Kern told the Committee there may have been as many as 100 ghost detainees.\n\nIn addition to allegations and reports about ghost detainees in Iraq or East Asian countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, there have been reports that the US had held prisoners in detention centers in some European states. In 2006 the Swiss senator, Dick Marty wrote a memorandum on \"alleged detention in Council of Europe states.\" He said the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had captured about 100 persons on European territory and subsequently rendered them to countries where they may have been tortured. The BBC reported that this number of 100 extraordinarily rendered persons is in addition to the estimated 100 U.S. ghost detainees.\n\nThe practice has been criticized by Amnesty International and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as improper and illegal; it prevents these prisoners from having contact with inspectors and human rights advocates, and the families of the prisoners have to deal with a \"forced disappearance\". One 2005 report by Amnesty International indicates that more than 100 ghost detainees may currently be being held in U.S.-operated black sites.\n\nIn May 2005, Irene Khan of Amnesty International addressed the issue in a speech: \n\nAccording to U.S. official sources there could be over one hundred ghost detainees held by the U.S. In 2004, thousands of people were held by the U.S. in Iraq, hundreds in Afghanistan, and undisclosed numbers in undisclosed locations. AI (Amnesty International) is calling on the U.S. government to \"close Guantanamo and disclose the rest.\" What we mean by this is: either release the prisoners or charge and prosecute them with due process.\"\n\n\n\n\"This collection consists of documents concerning individuals apprehended after September 11, 2001 and held by the U.S. at military bases or detention facilities outside the U.S. and the rendition of detainees and other individuals to foreign powers.\"\nLinks courtesy of Internet Archive's Wayback Machine\n"}

It is a companion film to 1967's \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\"; the two were initially intended to be one 3½ hour film. The films are named after the colours of the Swedish flag.\n\n\"Blue\" is a second version of \"Yellow,\" taking place before and after the first film. It has a more somber and bitterly satiric style, and a further explication of the framing narrative. Questions of lesbianism, religion and critiques of meritocracy are discussed. \n\nLena Nyman won the award for Best Actress at the 5th Guldbagge Awards for her role in this film and \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\".\n\nAfter the actress Lena had a sexual relationship with Börje, whose affairs with other women caused her to hate him and question her commitment to Martin Luther King's philosophy of nonviolence, she continues to explore her sexuality and politics. She befriends a woman named Sonja, and they travel to Ströms Vattudal where they enjoy nude swimming and other excursions. While hiking, Lena also looks into a cabin and sees two women having lesbian sex. Lena returns to Stockholm, where she stays with the couple Hans and Bim. Bim notices Lena scratching herself, which Lena attributes to allergies. After Hans and Bim have an argument, Hans visits Lena in her bedroom. Bim enters with a magnifying glass and insists at looking at Lena's hand. She discovers Lena has scabies, disproving Lena's belief her constant itching owed to allergies and mosquito bites.\n\nLena approaches Börje in the car dealership where he now works, to inform him about the possibility that he also has scabies. He confirms he has been itching and accuses her of giving him the disease, citing her sexual promiscuity. She argues back he is just as promiscuous, resulting in a highly public heated argument. After he loses his job, they both head to the clinic for treatment.\n\n"}

News about the apparition became widespread and many people came to visit the cathedral that would temporarily house the painting. According to Miguel Sánchez’s account of the apparition, when the painting was placed in the cathedral church, “all the city learned of it; and everyone was moved to such a degree that all wanted to see face to face this Miracle so new; and devotion hurried everyone to come together in Christian gatherings.” It would become so popular in the surrounding areas that a hermitage was quickly held on December 26, 1531. This special devotion became such an important part of Mexican life that the local priests began to think about how to ask permission from the Pope for a special Mass and proper office for celebrating the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Unfortunately, little was done about this until Francisco Siles proposed a new plan to the Viceroy of New Spain in 1663.\n\nThis group of painters consisted of Juan Salguero, Tomás Conrado, Sebastián López de Avalos, Nicolás de Angulo, Juan Sánchez and Alonso se Zarate. These men were well-known, acclaimed artists, and were considered to be masters of painting. After examining the tilma painting, they all came to the conclusion that it was “impossible that any human artist could have painted or created a work so smooth and outstanding and beautifully formed on a fabric so coarse and rough as the tilma.” In addition, these men found that the tilma was painted from the reverse side of the fabric and could not determine whether the painting was done with oil or tempera paints and declared that only the “Lord [their] God alone knows the secret of this work.”\n\nThe three physicians called in to examine the image were Don Luis de Cádenas Soto, Don Jerónimo Ortiz, and Don Juan de Malgarejo who were all Physicians-Royal of Mexico. They were brought in to observe how the colors on the tilma could still be so bright after 135 years. They declared that the damp and salty air from Lake Texcoco in conjunction with the hot and humid climate should have caused de-lustering of the image and caused it to dull. On March 28, 1666, the three men declared that the brightness of the image colors could not be explained by natural means.\n\n\n\nAccording to A.M. Sada Lambretón, the \"Proceedings of 1666\" are very important as proof of the Guadalupe tradition and as support to the life, virtues, reputation and holiness and cult of Blessed Juan Diego. This collection of documents was reviewed during Juan Diego’s canonization in 2002. After a revival of the proceedings in 1723 by Bishop José Pérez de Lanciego Aguilar, the Office of Our Lady of Guadalupe was formally approved in 1894.\n\n\n"}

The advantages are reduced POS terminal costs, platform independence, and reduced administrative costs. JavaPOS was based on a Windows POS device driver standard known as OPOS. JavaPOS and OPOS have since been folded into a common UnifiedPOS standard.\n\nJavaPOS can be used to access various types of POS hardware. A few of the hardware types that can be controlled using JavaPOS are\n\nIn addition to referring to the standard, the term JavaPOS is used to refer to the application programming interface (API).\n\nThe JavaPOS standard includes definitions for \"Control Objects\" and \"Service Objects\". The POS software communicates with the Control Objects. The Control Objects load and communicate with appropriate Service Objects. The Service Objects are sometimes referred to as the \"JavaPOS drivers.\"\n\nThe POS software interacts with the control object to control the hardware device. A common JavaPOS library is published by the standards organization with an implementation of the Control Objects of the JavaPOS standard.\n\nEach hardware vendor is responsible for providing Service Objects, or \"JavaPOS drivers\" for the hardware they sell. Depending on the vendor, drivers may be available that can communicate over USB, RS232, RS485, or even an Ethernet connection. The hardware vendors will typically create JavaPOS drivers that will work with Windows. The majority of vendors will also create drivers for at least one flavor of Linux, but not as many. Since there is not nearly as much marketshare to capture for Apple computers used as POS systems, only a few JavaPOS drivers would be expected to work with Mac OS X. (And those would be more likely due to happy circumstance rather than careful design.)\n\nThe committee that initiated JavaPOS development consisted of Sun Microsystems, IBM, and NCR. The first meeting occurred in April, 1997 and the first release, JavaPOS 1.2, occurred in March 28, 1998. The final release as a separate standard was version 1.6 in July 2001. Beginning with release 1.7, a single standards document was released by a UnifiedPOS committee. That standards document is then used to create the common JavaPOS libraries for the release.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1596654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1596654", "title": "Jim Duggan", "text": "Jim Duggan\n\nJames Edward Duggan Jr. (born January 14, 1954), better known by his ring name \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE on a Legends contract. His best-known character is that of an American patriot, which sees him use a 2x4 length of wood as a weapon, the battle cry \"Hooo!\" and the U-S-A! cheer.\n\nIn the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE), Duggan was the winner of the first ever Royal Rumble match in 1988 and in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), he was a one time United States Heavyweight Champion and a one time (and the final) World Television Champion.\n\nDuggan grew up in Glens Falls, New York, where he became a star athlete in high school. Duggan is of English and Scottish ancestry. He was raised Presbyterian. His father was the Chief of police for the City of Glens Falls. Duggan was a letterman in football, track, wrestling, and basketball. In wrestling, Duggan won the New York State High School wrestling championship, unlimited weight class division – the first wrestler from Glens Falls to do so.\n\nUpon graduating from high school, he was recruited by Ohio State University, but would instead choose to play football at Southern Methodist University (SMU), where he was eventually voted team captain. Duggan earned his bachelor's degree in applied plant biology. After college, Duggan was signed by the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League, but was released after being plagued by knee injuries.\n\nDuggan broke into the professional wrestling business thanks in large part to wrestler Fritz Von Erich. The two met while Duggan was on a recruiting trip to SMU. Duggan's first professional match was in 1979 against Gino Hernandez. Duggan began his career as a villain. Training at the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas as well as with Samoan wrestling promoter Peter Maivia, Duggan gained the attention of Vince McMahon, Sr. and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nAfter a brief stint with the WWF, Duggan began to work regularly for Georgia Championship Wrestling. During this time, Duggan was known by two in-ring aliases: in the United States as \"Big\" Jim Duggan and in Hawaii as The Convict, a masked wrestler. After wrestling for a Birmingham, Alabama-based promotion, Duggan began wrestling in a promotion based in San Antonio, Texas where he adopted his well-known \"Hacksaw\" nickname.\n\nIn 1982, Duggan made his debut in Mid-South Wrestling. Upon debuting as a heel, and bounty hunter for Skandor Akbar, Duggan soon became a member of the Rat Pack faction, alongside Ted DiBiase, Matt Bourne, and Mr. Olympia. After newcomer \"Hacksaw\" Butch Reed debuted within the promotion, Duggan and Reed had a personal feud for a time over who would be the true \"Hacksaw\". The Rats also feuded with stars such as Reed, Magnum T.A. and the Junkyard Dog. During this time, Duggan interfered in a DiBiase/JYD match while wearing a gorilla suit during the Louisiana State Fair, causing JYD to lose a \"Loser Leaves Town\" match in Shreveport, Louisiana. After DiBiase aligned himself with Skandor Akbar, Duggan refused to go along with him and became a face for the first time in his career. At this time, Duggan began carrying his iconic 2x4.\n\nAs a fan favorite, he won the Mid-South Tag Team Championship with Magnum T.A. and later won the North American Heavyweight Championship. After the Mid-South North American title was retired when Mid-South became the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) in 1986, Duggan lost to Terry Gordy in a tournament final to determine the first UWF World Heavyweight Champion. Duggan then teamed up with Terry Taylor and won the UWF World Tag Team Championship for the second time. After losing a Loser Leaves Town match to the One Man Gang, Duggan left the UWF for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nDuggan was signed to the WWF in January 1987, making his first major appearance with the WWF at WrestleMania III, where he also made his pay-per-view debut. In the weeks preceding WrestleMania, Duggan began his first WWF feud with Nikolai Volkoff. At the event, he ran to ringside prior to a match between The Killer Bees and The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff and interrupted Volkoff's pre-match singing of the Russian national anthem. Duggan had previously done this on TV matches leading up to the event.\n\nOn May 26, 1987 Duggan and the Iron Sheik were arrested for DUI in New Jersey. Duggan was on the verge of release from the company, but was ultimately brought back in a lower spot on roster. Although he did not win any major titles in the promotion, for seven years he was a consistent fan favorite with his patriotic gimmick. His character was mainly comical, as he rarely was in major contention for titles. His first major WWF match was at the first-ever Survivor Series pay-per-view in 1987, when he participated in the first Survivor Series match and was a member of the winning team.\n\nBy the late fall of 1987, Duggan received his first major push since his return, being placed in a feud opposite \"King\" Harley Race, who was using a monarch gimmick who sneered at wrestlers he thought were below him. Duggan vowed he would never give in to Race's demands to bow to him, and during a televised confrontation, took Race's crown and cape, though Race would later get them back. At the 1987 Slammy Awards, where Duggan presented the nominees for \"Best Ring Apparel,\" an on-stage shoving match between him and the winner (Race), a wild brawl broke out between the two, going backstage and eventually reaching back to the main stage before interrupting another award presentation and Gorilla Monsoon stepping in to separate the two. Duggan eventually defeated Race several times in both televised and non-televised shows.\n\nDuggan participated in the first-ever Royal Rumble match in 1988, where he was the 13th of twenty entrants. He won the match after he last eliminated the One Man Gang.\n\nAt WrestleMania IV, he participated in a 14-man tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship, where he lost to Ted DiBiase in the first round after interference from André the Giant. Shortly after WrestleMania IV, Duggan -- upset that André cost him his match -- came to the ring during one of André's matches and challenged him; a feud erupted when André suddenly grabbed Duggan and began throttling him, before Duggan knocked André out with his 2x4 board. André generally came out the winner in their matches, usually by interference from André's manager Bobby Heenan. André also interfered in several of Duggan's matches against other wrestlers, including Hercules on the April 30 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\".\n\nDuggan earned a shot at the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship against The Honky Tonk Man in July 1988, but Honky Tonk got himself disqualified, thus retaining the title.\n\nDuggan then began displaying traits of an American patriot by feuding with several foreign villains in the fall of 1988. He got involved in a feud with Dino Bravo, and the two were on opposing sides as Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts' team fought André the Giant's at the 1988 Survivor Series. Duggan was disqualified after he used his 2x4 on Bravo. Duggan's team eventually lost the match. His next feud was with Russian Boris Zhukov, whom he defeated in a flag match on the November 26 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". He restarted his feud with Dino Bravo, and at the 1989 Royal Rumble, Duggan and The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) defeated Bravo and The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond) in a two out of three falls match. He was involved in a rivalry with Bad News Brown, which culminated in a match at WrestleMania V where both men fought to a no contest.\n\nIn mid-1989, he started a feud with King Haku, who was awarded the crown on the July 9, 1988 edition of \"Superstars\" when Harley Race was forced to vacate the crown due to injuries sustained in a match against Hulk Hogan on the March 12, 1988 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". Duggan defeated Haku to win the crown and earn the title of \"King of the WWF\" on the May 13, 1989 edition of \"Superstars\". On the May 27 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", Duggan earned a shot at the Intercontinental Championship against \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude. Duggan won the match by countout, and Rude retained the title, as a title cannot change hands via countout or disqualification. At SummerSlam, Duggan teamed with Demolition (Ax and Smash) in a six-man tag team match and defeated André the Giant and The Twin Towers (Akeem and The Big Bossman).\nHe eventually lost his crown to \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, who began calling himself \"Macho King\", and started a feud with Savage. At Survivor Series, he captained a team dubbed \"The 4x4's\" against Savage's team, \"The King's Court\". Although Duggan eliminated Greg Valentine with his 3-Point Stance Clothesline, Duggan's team lost the match. He faced Savage again on the January 27 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". Duggan defeated another former rival, Dino Bravo at WrestleMania VI. He began teaming with his former rival, Nikolai Volkoff and started a feud with The Orient Express (Tanaka and Sato), whom they beat at SummerSlam. He began a short feud with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Sgt. Slaughter and faced Slaughter for the title on the February 1 edition of \"The Main Event\". Slaughter retained the title by getting himself disqualified.\n\nIn late 1991, he patched up things with Sgt. Slaughter, who had turned babyface, and the pair formed a tag team. At Survivor Series, the duo joined the Texas Tornado and Tito Santana in an elimination match to defeat a team led by Col. Mustafa. On the February 8 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", Duggan and Slaughter defeated the Beverly Brothers (Blake and Beau). At WrestleMania VIII, he teamed up with Virgil, Sgt. Slaughter, and Big Bossman against The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs), The Mountie, and Repo Man. Slaughter eventually left active wrestling and Duggan continued to pursue his singles career again.\n\nIn mid-1992, Duggan was moved to undercard status. In early 1993, he was involved in a feud with the then near 600 pound Yokozuna, who was the number one contender to the WWF Championship. Manager Mr. Fuji was bad mouthing America and Duggan challenged his protégé to a match. The match was promoted by claiming that no one had knocked Yokozuna off his feet, even though Yokozuna had fallen off his feet shortly before, during the 1993 Royal Rumble match. The stipulations to the match were if Duggan knocked Yokozuna off his feet, Duggan would win. On the February 6 edition of \"Superstars\", Duggan won the match after knocking Yokozuna down completely, but then was manhandled by the much bigger Yokozuna after the match and fell victim to four Banzai Drops, sidelining Duggan for about four months.\n\nDuggan eventually returned to television and started a feud with then-Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels, challenging him for the title on the May 3 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\". Michaels ran through the crowd, and retained the title by countout. On the next show, to prevent Michaels from pulling the stunt again, Duggan received a return bout in a lumberjack match which Michaels won on a disqualification. As Michaels and the lumberjacks brawled after the match, Duggan came to and cleared the ring with his 2-by-4. Duggan then competed in the King of the Ring tournament, defeating Papa Shango to qualify before losing to Bam Bam Bigelow in the quarterfinals. He continued to appear on WWF programming until the summer, when he left the company after losing several pre-Summerslam matches to Yokozuna.\n\nAfter spending a year wrestling independents throughout the Northeast and a tour of Austria for Catch Wrestling Association, Duggan signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the summer of 1994. He debuted on the August 6 edition of \"WCW Saturday Night\", defeating Rip Rogers. A month later at Fall Brawl, as a replacement for the injured Ricky Steamboat, he defeated Steve Austin in a squash match lasting thirty-five seconds to win the United States Heavyweight Championship. After becoming champion, he quickly started a feud with Austin, and eventually defeated him in a title rematch at Halloween Havoc by disqualification. The two had a second title rematch on the November 16 edition of \"Clash of the Champions\", where Duggan retained the title again by disqualification. Duggan's reign ended at Starrcade (1994), where he was defeated by Vader.\n\nAfter he lost the U.S. title to Vader, Duggan moved to the mid-card division and began wrestling on \"Saturday Night\". He defeated Bunkhouse Buck at SuperBrawl V. He faced former WWF rival Meng (known as Haku in WWF) in a martial arts match at Uncensored, which Meng won. At The Great American Bash, he defeated Sgt. Craig Pittman by disqualification in Pittman's pay-per-view debut. At Bash at the Beach (1995), Duggan lost to Kamala.\n\nIn late 1995, Duggan started a feud with Big Bubba Rogers, which culminated in a Taped Fist match at World War 3, which Rogers won. Duggan participated in the first-ever three ring, 60 man battle royal for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, but was eliminated. He fought Loch Ness to a double disqualification at a \"Main Event\" taping before SuperBrawl VI. Duggan then started a short feud with Diamond Dallas Page, to whom he lost in a Taped Fist match at Bash at the Beach. At World War 3, he unsuccessfully participated in a three ring 60 man battle royal to determine the #1 contender to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Duggan had no major pay-per-view matches for over two years before he disappeared in 1998 after he was diagnosed with kidney cancer.\n\nAfter successfully beating his cancer, Duggan returned to wrestling and replaced Buff Bagwell in a match against Berlyn at Fall Brawl, which Duggan lost. Soon after, Duggan became involved in a storyline where he became a janitor for WCW. Duggan then started a feud with the anti-American stable the Revolution (Shane Douglas, Dean Malenko, Perry Saturn, and Asya). At Starrcade (1999), he and his surprise partners, the newly reunited Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, and Rick Steiner), faced the Revolution in a losing effort after the Club turned on Duggan. As a result of losing, the next night on \"Nitro\", Duggan was forced to denounce the U.S. flag but he refused to do so. In response, the Revolution attacked him and began beating him until The Filthy Animals, who were also feuding with the Revolution, saved Duggan.\n\nDuring this period, he found the World Television Championship in a trash can, which had been thrown away by the previous champion Scott Hall earlier and claimed it for himself. He would make title defenses exclusively on \"Saturday Night\", and remained champion until the title was deactivated. After WCW was rebooted and the nWo storyline ended, it was replaced by two new factions in WCW called The Millionaire's Club and the New Blood, which began feuding with one another. The Millionaire's Club consisted of veterans and the New Blood consisted of young wrestlers of the 1990s. Duggan joined the Millionaire's Club and helped them in their war against the New Blood.\n\nNear the end of his career in WCW, he became involved in more major storylines, including one that involved him becoming a villain by abandoning the patriotic gimmick for a short time to join Lance Storm and his faction Team Canada. This angle began when Duggan started working with the Misfits In Action (MIA) but at Fall Brawl, he turned on MIA's leader U.S. Champion General Rection during Rection's title defense against Team Canada's Lance Storm. Duggan was the special guest enforcer for the match, and helped Storm in winning the match. During this time Duggan shaved his trademark beard, didn't bring his trademark 2x4 to the ring, and sang \"O Canada\". At Halloween Havoc, Duggan and Storm teamed up against General Rection in a handicap match for Storm's U.S. Title. Duggan missed an attack on Rection, which led to Rection pinning Duggan to win the match. Duggan continued to unintentionally cost Team Canada many of their victories, but he helped Storm to defeat The Cat in a match at Starrcade. However, after the match, Team Canada turned on Duggan, who then began feuding with Team Canada, and at Sin he was the special guest referee in a Penalty Box match between Team Canada and the Filthy Animals. Despite Duggan's role as the referee, Team Canada won the match after Storm forced Kidman to submit.\n\nAfter WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, Duggan began wrestling in the independent circuit. On December 5, 2002, Duggan defeated Krusher Kong at LWE Xplosion. On the March 12, 2003 pay-per-view of NWA Total Nonstop Action (TNA), Duggan made a surprise appearance and defeated fellow WCW alum Mike Sanders. Duggan made another appearance in TNA on October 29, where he lost to Jeff Jarrett.\n\nDuggan appeared on the October 3, 2005 edition of \"Raw\", dubbed \"The Homecoming\" along with several other WWF/E alumni. He and the other legends attacked Rob Conway after Conway came to the ring and insulted them. He was also one of the \"legends\" available for fans to select to team with Eugene in a match at Taboo Tuesday to face the team of Conway and Tyson Tomko (Jimmy Snuka was chosen instead of Duggan). He returned to WWE again after Royal Rumble, with a message from John Cena to Lita after Edge lost the WWE Championship: \"HOOOOO!\" Duggan and Edge began a short feud with each other which culminated in a match that occurred two weeks later on \"Raw\", which Edge won after Lita provided a distraction.\n\nAfter feuding with Edge and Lita, he became mentor and tutor to Eugene and the two feuded with the Spirit Squad. He began working on \"Heat\" but also made a few appearances on \"Raw\" with Eugene and The Highlanders. On the November 6 edition of \"Raw\", Duggan and Eugene faced the Spirit Squad in a match with the stipulation that the losing team would disband and never team up again. After Duggan was caught off guard after the other Spirit Squad members interfered and then pinned for the win, Eugene snapped and attacked Duggan. He started a feud with Eugene, and three weeks later, the two had a match with each other, which Eugene won.\n\nAt New Year's Revolution, Duggan teamed with Super Crazy in a tag team turmoil match to determine the number one contenders to the World Tag Team Championship, in a losing effort. On the January 15 edition of \"Raw\", Duggan was dragged out by Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) and was beaten to a pulp. Edge and Orton feared Duggan would help out Shawn Michaels in a handicap match and wanted to set an example for anyone else backstage that wished to do the same. On the March 5 edition of \"Raw\", he faced Chris Masters in a Masterlock Challenge, but was unable to break the hold.\n\nAfter months of wrestling on \"Heat\", Duggan returned to \"Raw\" in July, teaming up with The Sandman and feuding with Carlito and William Regal. This team was short lived as Duggan soon returned to \"Heat\" and Sandman was soon released from his contract with WWE. On the August 6 edition of \"Raw\", Duggan was a contestant in the \"WWE Dating Game\", a parody of \"The Dating Game\". However, Duggan lost when Maria chose Ron Simmons.\n\nOn December 31, he lost a 2008 Royal Rumble qualifying match to the returning Umaga. After that, he began primarily appearing on \"Heat\" once again, defeating locals and teaming with Super Crazy. On the March 17 episode of \"Raw\", he participated in a 17-on-2 handicap elimination tag team match as part of the 17 members of the \"Raw\" roster against John Cena and Randy Orton. After Cody Rhodes was eliminated, all the remaining \"Raw\" wrestlers attacked Cena and Orton, resulting in their disqualification. Duggan also took part in a 12-on-12 tag team preview match on the March 25 episode of \"ECW\". He competed 24-man battle royal was held just before WrestleMania XXIV aired to determine the #1 contender for an ECW Championship match. The match was eventually won by Kane.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, Duggan started a short feud with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase after Rhodes and DiBiase tried to convince Duggan to retire and let the young talent run the show. Soon after, Duggan would come out and announce that he would take Rhodes and DiBiase's advice and retire, but Jerry Lawler stopped him by convincing Duggan to stay. Duggan and Lawler then wrestled Rhodes and DiBiase on the August 25, 2008 edition of \"Raw\", but lost the match. On the October 20 edition of \"Raw\", Duggan confronted Santino Marella and Beth Phoenix during one of Marella's tirades against his three possible opponents at Cyber Sunday (Roddy Piper, Goldust, and The Honky Tonk Man). Upset at being interrupted, Marella took off his clothes, getting ready to fight Duggan. Yet before a fight could begin, Marella instructed Phoenix to throw the clothes in Duggan's face, a move that temporarily distracted Duggan. Marella then smashed a guitar over Duggan's head, ending the segment. Duggan would appear on \"Raw\"'s 800th episode during Kung Fu Naki's in-ring dance segment, which also involved various other members of the WWE roster.\n\nIn 2009, Duggan appeared in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering at #29 and setting a record for the most years between Royal Rumble appearances. He was eliminated from the match by Big Show. On the August 10 episode of \"Raw\", Duggan made his final televised appearance as Sgt. Slaughter had him come out in place of Bret Hart, due to the episode taking place in Canada, when he introduced \"The best there was, the best there is, and the best there ever will be\" in order to mock the Canadian fans.\n\nHe then resumed wrestling on the independent circuit. He recently appeared on Pro Wrestling Ohio's \"Wrestlelution 3\" where he defeated \"The Megastar\" Marion Fontaine.\n\nOn November 30, 2013, at WrestleCade 2013, Duggan defeated Daivari.\n\nHe has signed on with Global Force Wrestling as a \"legend\" to help promote GFW events and tours. To promote the shows, GFW's Jeff Jarrett and Duggan have appeared at Dell Diamond on Thursday, May 28. \n\nIn January 2016, Duggan appeared in an event for Modern Vintage Wrestling in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nOn May 6, 2017, at AWF Head to the Edge, Duggan defeated Josh Price. \n\nOn June 1, 2018, Duggan wrestled for Impact Pro Wrestling at the Armageddon Expo, held at the Horncastle Arena in Christchurch, New Zealand.

On the February 3, 2012 episode of \"SmackDown\", Duggan teamed with Santino Marella in a losing effort against the WWE Tag Team Champions Primo and Epico. On April 10, 2012, Duggan made an appearance on \"SuperSmackDown LIVE: Blast from the Past\", where he lost to Hunico by disqualification. Later that year, he appeared on the July 3 \"SuperSmackDown LIVE: The Great American Bash\" event, teaming with Sgt. Slaughter and Santino Marella to face Hunico, Camacho, and Drew McIntyre.\n\nIt was announced in February 2012 that Duggan would appear on a WWE original reality show called \"WWE Legends House\". The show premiered on the WWE Network on April 17, 2014.\n\nDuggan appears as himself in the film \"Pro Wrestlers vs Zombies,\" in which he battles the undead with his 2x4.\n\nIn 1991 Duggan appeared in the \"Harry and the Henderson\"s TV series' 16th episode.\n\nDuggan appears in the sixth episode of the second season of \"GamesMaster\" in the UK, where he played WWF on the Super Nintendo against a boy he picked from the crowd, Hacksaw played as Macho Man Randy Savage and was beaten.\n\nDuggan also appeared in the season five finale of \"Duck Dynasty\".\n\nDuggan and former WWF announcer Sean Mooney began recording a weekly podcast on the MLW Radio Network called \"Primetime with Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Sean Mooney\".

{"id": "3769633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3769633", "title": "Lacrimae rerum", "text": "Lacrimae rerum\n\nLacrimae rerum () is the Latin phrase for \"tears of things.\" It derives from Book I, line 462 of the \"Aeneid\" (c. 29–19 BC), by Roman poet Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro) (70–19 BC). Some recent quotations have included \"rerum lacrimae sunt\" or \"sunt lacrimae rerum\" meaning \"there are tears of (or for) things.\" \n\nIn this passage, Aeneas gazes at a mural found in a Carthaginian temple dedicated to Juno that depicts battles of the Trojan War and the deaths of his friends and countrymen. Aeneas is moved to tears and says \"sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt\" (\"There are tears for [or 'of'] things and mortal things touch the mind.\")\n\nThe genitive \"rerum\" can be construed as \"objective\" or \"subjective.\" The scholar David Wharton observes that the \"semantic and referential indeterminacy is both intentional and poetically productive, lending it an implicational richness most readers find attractive.\" In English, however, a translator must choose either one or the other, and interpretation has varied. Those who take the genitive as \"subjective\" translate the phrase as meaning that things feel sorrow for the sufferings of humanity: the universe feels our pain. Others translate the passage to show that the burden human beings have to bear, ever present frailty and suffering, is what defines the essence of human experience. Yet in the next line, Aeneas says: \"Release (your) fear; this fame will bring you some deliverance.\" Those who take the genitive as \"objective\" understand the phrase as meaning that there are tears \"for\" things (in particular, the things Aeneas has endured) evinced in the mural: i.e., the paintings show Aeneas that he finds himself in a place where he can expect compassion and safety.\n\nThe context of the passage is as follows:\nAeneas sees on the temple mural depictions of key figures in the Trojan War – the war from which he had been driven to the alien shores of Carthage as a refugee: the sons of Atreus (Agamemnon and Menelaus), Priam, and Achilles, who was savage to both sides in the war. He then cries out:\n<poem>\n\"Sunt hic etiam sua praemia laudi;\nsunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt.\nSolve metus; feret haec aliquam tibi fama salutem.\"\n\n\"Here, too, the praiseworthy has its rewards;\nthere are tears for things and mortal things touch the mind.\nRelease your fear; this fame will bring you some safety.\"\nVirgil, \"Aeneid\", 1.461 ff.</poem>\n\nA translation by Robert Fagles renders the quote as: \"The world is a world of tears, and the burdens of mortality touch the heart.\"\n\nRobert Fitzgerald, meanwhile, translates it as: \"They weep here / For how the world goes, and our life that passes \\ Touches their hearts.\"\n\nIn his television series Civilisation, episode 1, Kenneth Clark translated this line as \"These men know the pathos of life, and mortal things touch their hearts.\"\n\nThe poet Seamus Heaney rendered the first three words, \"There are tears at the heart of things.\"\n\nThe phrase is sometimes taken out of context, on war memorials for example, as a sad sentiment about life's inescapable sorrows. In the poem the phrase appears as Aeneas realises that he need not fear for his safety, because he is among people who have compassion and an understanding of human sorrow.\n\n\n"}

The first description of the law of contagion appeared in \"The Golden Bough\" by James George Frazer. Bonewits and Bonewits have noted parallels in quantum physics.\n\nAccording to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a saint, god or other venerated figure confers benefits to relics, as do temples and churches, by virtue of their having religious rituals conducted within them. Psychics and mediums commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their \"focus\" for psychometry or clairvoyance or during séances.\n\nDangers include, for example, a sorcerer or witch might acquire a lock of hair, nail clipping or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a curse. Voodoo dolls resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers.\n\nEven among people who do not profess a belief in magic, psychological experiments have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a serial murderer.\n\n"}

{"id": "333245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333245", "title": "New Right", "text": "New Right\n\nNew Right is a descriptive term for various right-wing political groups or policies in different countries. It has also been used to describe the emergence of Eastern European parties after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Soviet-style communism.\n\nIn Australia, \"the New Right\" refers to a late 1970s/1980s onward movement both within and outside of the Liberal/National Coalition which advocates economically liberal and increased socially conservative policies (as opposed to the \"old right\" which advocated economically conservative policies and small-l liberals with more socially liberal views). Unlike the United Kingdom and United States, but like neighbouring New Zealand, the 1980s saw the Australian Labor Party initiate Third Way economic reforms, which bear some familiarity to \"New Right\" ideology. After the John Howard Coalition ended the 13-year rule of the Hawke-Keating Labor government at the 1996 federal election, economic reforms were taken further, some examples being wholesale labor market deregulation (e.g. WorkChoices), the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), the privatisation of the telecommunications monopoly Telstra, and sweeping welfare reform including \"work for the dole\". The H. R. Nicholls Society, a think tank which advocates full workplace deregulation, contains some Liberal MPs as members and is seen to be of the New Right.\n\nEconomic liberalism, also called economic rationalism in Australia, was first used by Labor's Gough Whitlam. It is a philosophy which tends to advocate a free market economy, increased deregulation, privatisation, lower direct taxation and higher indirect taxation, and a reduction of the size of the welfare state. The politicians favouring New Right ideology were referred to as \"dries\", while those advocating continuation of the economic policies of the post-war consensus, typically Keynesian economics, or were more socially liberal, were called \"wets\" (the term \"wets\" was similarly used in Britain to refer to those Conservatives who opposed Thatcherite economic policies, but \"dries\" in this context was much rarer in British usage).\n\nThe new right in Brazil has grown sharply in recent years within population, intelligentsia and academia. That is mainly due to a generalized discontent with the left-wing government and its policies.\n\nThis new movement distinguishes itself from what is known in Brazil as \"old right\", which was ideologically associated to the Brazilian military government, União Democrática Nacional (National Democratic Union) and Integralism. It is identified by positive views regarding democracy, personal freedom, free-market capitalism, reduction of bureaucracy, privatization of state-run companies, tax cuts, parliamentary, political reform. It rejects \"cultural Marxism\", Socialism of the 21st century and Populism.\n\nThere have been two major phenomena relating to the rise of the new Brazilian right: the Free Brazil Movement, which has managed to bring together millions of people on demonstrations against the government in March 2015; and the creation of the New Party (Partido Novo) and Libertários, the first liberal party since the First Brazilian Republic.\n\nSome Brazilian new-right thinkers are: Kim Kataguiri, and his movement Movimento Brasil Livre (Free Brazil Moviment), Roberto Campos, Wilson Martins, Olavo de Carvalho, Luiz Felipe Pondé, Paulo Francis, José Guilherme Merquior, Bruno Tolentino and Miguel Reale.\n\nAs a result of this movement, in the 2018's brazilian election, Jair Messias Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil with 55% of the votes, his right hand in economic subjects, Paulo Guedes, graduated from the University of Chicago, will be his Economy Minister.\n\nThe term New Right (Spanish: \"Nueva derecha\") has come into mainstream political discourse since the election of Sebastián Piñera in 2010, when interior minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter used it to describe his government. Hinzpeter's introduction of the term caused a buzz among newspapers, politicians and analysts. According to a column published in \"The Clinic\", the New Right is different from the old dictatorial right of Augusto Pinochet, in the sense that it embraces democracy. It is also different from the religiously conservative Unión Demócrata Independiente party, in that it is more open to discussing issues like divorce. According to the same analysis, the New Right is becoming increasingly pragmatic, as shown by their decision to increase taxes following the 2010 Chilean earthquake.\n\nIn France, the New Right (or \"Nouvelle Droite\") has been used as a term to describe a modern think-tank of French political philosophers and intellectuals led by Alain de Benoist. Another noted intellectual, who was once part of Alain de Benoist's GRECE, is Guillaume Faye. Although accused by some critics as being \"far-right\" in their beliefs, they themselves claim that their ideas transcend the traditional left–right divide and actively encourages free debate. France also has one Identitarian New Right group (which is connected with Thule Seminar in Germany); that is Terre et Peuple of Pierre Vial, who was once an integral part and founding member of Alain de Benoist's GRECE.\n\nIn Germany, the \"Neue Rechte\" (literally, new right) consists of two parts: the \"Jungkonservative\" (literally, young conservatives), who search for followers in the civic part of the population; and, secondly, the \"Nationalrevolutionäre\" (national revolutionists), who are looking for followers in the ultra-right part of the German population, and use the rhetoric of right-wing politicians such as Gregor and Otto Strasser. Another noted New Right group in Germany is Thule Seminar of Pierre Krebs.\n\nFailos Kranidiotis, a Greek politician who had been expelled by New Democracy chairman Kyriakos Mitsotakis for expressing views more similar to political rival Golden Dawn than those of former Prime Minister of Greece Konstantinos Mitsotakis whose legacy expressed the most important principle of its recently elected leadership, including Adonis Georgiadis who had been a member only since leaving far-right Popular Orthodox Rally in 2012, instead of those expressed by the previous heads of the party who had close friendships with him, specifically Kostas Karamanlis, Antonis Samaras and Vangelis Meimarakis, founded the New Right party based on national liberalism in May 2016.\n\nThe New Right (NR) was the name of a far-right/nationalist political party in the Netherlands from 2003 to 2007. The Party for Freedom (PVV), founded in 2005 and led by Geert Wilders, also is a New Right movement. Since March 2017 Forum voor Democratie is another new right party in the Dutch parliament.\n\nIn New Zealand, as in Australia, it was the Labour Party that initially adopted \"New Right\" economic policies. \"Rogernomics\" involved monetarist approaches to controlling inflation, corporatisation of government departments, and the removal of tariffs and subsidies, while the party also pursued social liberal stances such as decriminalisation of male homosexuality, pay equity for women and adopting a nuclear-free policy. This meant temporary realignment within New Zealand politics, as \"New Right\" middle-class voters voted Labour at the New Zealand general election, 1987 in approval of its economic policies. At first, Labour corporatised many former government departments and state assets, then emulated the Conservative Thatcher administration and privatised them altogether during Labour's second term of office. However, recession and privatisation together led to increasing strains within the Labour Party, which led to schism, and the exit of Jim Anderton and his NewLabour Party, which later formed part of the Alliance Party with the Greens and other opponents of New Right economics.\n\nHowever, dissent and schism were not to be limited to the Labour Party and Alliance Party alone. During the Labour Party's second term in office, the Opposition New Zealand National Party (popularly known as 'National') selected Ruth Richardson as Opposition finance spokesperson, and when National won the 1990 general election, Richardson became Minister of Finance, while Jenny Shipley became Minister of Social Welfare. Richardson introduced deunionisation legislation, known as the Employment Contracts Act, in 1991, while Shipley presided over social welfare benefit cuts, designed to reduce \"welfare dependency\" – both core New Right policy initiatives.\n\nIn the early nineties, maverick National Party MP Winston Peters also came to oppose New Right economic policies, and led his elderly voting bloc out of the National Party. As a result, his New Zealand First anti-monetarist party has been a partner in coalition governments led by both National (1996–98) and Labour (2005–08 and 2017-ongoing). Due to the introduction of the MMP electoral system, a New Right \"Association of Consumers and Taxpayers\" party, known as ACT New Zealand, was formed by ex-Labour New Right-aligned Cabinet Ministers like Richard Prebble and others, and maintaining existing New Right policy initiatives such as the Employment Contracts Act, while also introducing US-style \"welfare reform.\" ACT New Zealand aspired to become National's centre-right coalition partner, but has been hampered by lack of party unity and populist leadership that often lacked strategic direction.\n\nAs for Labour and National themselves, their fortunes have been mixed. Labour was out of office for most of the nineties, only regaining power when Helen Clark led it to victory and a Labour/Alliance coalition and centre-left government (1999–2002). However, the Alliance disintegrated in 2002.\n\nNational was defeated in 1999 due to the absence of a suitable stable coalition partner, given New Zealand First's partial disintegration after Winston Peters abandoned the prior National-led coalition. When Bill English became leader of National in 2001, it was thought that he might lead the party away from its prior hardline New Right economic and social policies, but his indecisiveness and lack of firm policy direction led to ACT New Zealand gaining the New Right middle-class voting basis in 2002. When Don Brash became leader, New Right middle-class voters returned to National's fold, causing National's revival in fortunes at the New Zealand general election, 2005. However, at the same time, ACT New Zealand strongly criticised it for deviating from its former New Right economic policy perspectives, and at the same election, National did little to enable ACT's survival. Don Brash resigned as National party leader, being replaced by John Key, who was a more moderate National MP.\n\nAs for the centre-left, Helen Clark and her Labour-led coalition were criticised by ex-Alliance members and non-government organisations for their alleged lack of attention to centre-left social policies, while trade union membership recovered due to Labour's repeal of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 and labour market deregulation and the deunionisation that had accompanied it in the nineties. It is plausible that Clark and her Cabinet were influenced by Tony Blair and his British Labour Government, which pursued a similar balancing act between social and fiscal responsibility while in government.\n\nIn Poland, a conservative libertarian and eurosceptic political party Congress of the New Right (New Right) was founded on 25 March 2011 from former political parties Freedom and Lawfulness (WiP) and Real Politics Union (UPR) by Janusz Korwin-Mikke. It is backed up by various voters, some conservatives, people who want to legalize marijuana and citizens who endorse free market and capitalism.\n\nIn South Korea, the South Korean New Right movement is a Korean attempt at neoconservative politics. The Lee Myung-bak government led by President Lee Myung-bak and the conservative Grand National Party is noted for being a benefactor of the domestic New Right movement.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term New Right more specifically refers to a strand of Conservatism that the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan influenced. Thatcher's style of New Right ideology, known as Thatcherism, was heavily influenced by the work of Friedrich Hayek (in particular the book \"The Road to Serfdom\"). They were ideologically committed to economic liberalism as well as being socially conservative. Key policies included deregulation of business, a dismantling of the welfare state, privatization of nationalized industries and restructuring of the national workforce in order to increase industrial and economic flexibility in an increasingly global market.\n\nIn the United States, New Right refers to three historically distinct conservative political movements. These American New Rights are distinct from and opposed to the more moderate tradition of the so-called Rockefeller Republicans. The New Right also differs from the Old Right (1933–55) on issues concerning foreign policy with neoconservatives being opposed to the non-interventionism of the Old Right.\n\nThe first New Right (1955–64) was centered around the libertarians, traditionalists, and anti-communists at William F. Buckley's \"National Review\". Sociologists and journalists had used \"new right\" since the 1950s; it was first used as self-identification in 1962 by the student activist group Young Americans for Freedom.\n\nThe first New Right embraced \"fusionism\" (classical liberal economics, traditional social values, and an ardent anti-communism) and coalesced through grassroots organizing in the years preceding the 1964 presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater. The Goldwater campaign, though failing to unseat incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, galvanized the formation of a new political movement.\n\nFirst New Right figures:\n\nThe second New Right (1964–2014) was formed in the wake of the Goldwater campaign and had a more populist tone than the first New Right. The second New Right tended to focus on emotional, wedge issues (such as abortion) and was often linked with the Religious Right. The second New Right formed a policy approach and electoral apparatus that brought Ronald Reagan into the White House in the 1980 presidential election. The New Right was organized in the American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation to counter the so-called \"liberal establishment\". In elite think tanks and local community organizations alike, new policies, marketing strategies, and electoral strategies were crafted over the succeeding decades to promote strongly conservative policies. \n\nSecond New Right figures:\n\nSince 2014, the term 'New Right' has been used to describe the sudden wave of young conservative, libertarian, classical liberal, nationalist alt-lite, and supporters of President Donald Trump. This emergence came in reaction to a perceived rise in social progressivism, the big government policies of the Obama presidency, PC culture in places of higher education, cultural marxism in popular culture, liberal bias in the mainstream media, and the rise of democratic socialism and globalism. This third wave of the new right share a number of the views of the alt-right, but reject its racialism, antisemitism and homophobia.\n\nThird New Right figures:\n\n\n\n"}

The park consists of a outdoor sculpture museum and beach. The park's lead designer was Weiss/Manfredi Architects, who collaborated with Charles Anderson Landscape Architecture, Magnusson Klemencic Associates and other consultants. It is situated at the northern end of the Seattle seawall and the southern end of Myrtle Edwards Park. The former industrial site was occupied by the oil and gas corporation Unocal until the 1970s and subsequently became a contaminated brownfield before the Seattle Art Museum proposed to transform the area into one of the only green spaces in Downtown Seattle.\n\nAs a free-admission outdoor sculpture park with both permanent and visiting installations, it is a unique institution in the United States. The idea of green space for large, monumental sculpture in Seattle was first discussed between Virginia and Bagley Wright, Mary and Jon Shirley (former president of Microsoft and Chairman of the Seattle Art Museum Board of Directors), and Seattle Art Museum director (and wife of William Gates Sr.) Mimi Gardner Gates. The idea grew further during a discussion in 1996 between Robert Measures and Martha Wyckoff while stranded on a fly fishing trip in Mongolia due to a helicopter crash. Wyckoff, being a trustee of the Trust for Public Land, soon after began an effort to identify possible locations for the park.\n\nA $30 million gift from Mary and Jon Shirley established them as foundational donors. As part of constructing the sculpture park, 5.7 million dollars were spent transforming of the seawall and underwater shoreline inside Myrtle Edwards park. A three level underwater slope was built with 50,000 tonnes of riprap. The first level of the slope is large rocks to break up waves. The second is a flat \"bench\" level to recreate an intertidal zone. The lower level is covered with smaller rocks designed to attract sealife and large kelp. It is hoped that this recreated strand will help revitalise juvenile salmon from the Duwamish River and serve as a test for future efforts.\n\nMaintenance of the sculptures has been an ongoing issue. The environment near a large salt water body has been corrosive to pieces like \"Bunyon's Chess\", made primarily of exposed wood and metal. Tall painted pieces such as \"Eagle\" need to be watched for damage from birds and their waste. Maintenance of these large structures is expensive, requiring scaffolding or boom lifts. The paint on \"Eagle\" is also easily damaged by the mechanical clipping of grass near the base of its installation, requiring the gardeners to use scissors instead of a lawn mower near the sculpture.\n\n\n\nThe park has received numerous awards for its design, engineering and environmental restoration.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to and during the park’s opening in 2007, the project received positive reviews from many regional and national press sources, and the Olympic Sculpture Park has now become an icon for Seattle. Frommer’s guide calls it “the best thing to happen to Seattle in years.”\n\nBefore the construction of the Olympic Sculpture Park began, there was substantial criticism in the community that the new park would result in the complete shutdown of the Waterfront Streetcar, a fixture of the Seattle waterfront since 1982, because of the park's needed demolition of the streetcar's maintenance and storage facility. The storage and maintenance building was located on a portion of the park's proposed site, and the new park was not designed to either incorporate the existing building or construct a replacement facility. As a result, the streetcar \"carbarn\" was demolished and the line shut down in November 2005, despite an offer by the staff of the Waterfront Streetcar to modify the carbarn into a sculpture to fit into the park, the route being named, by National Geographic Society, as one of the 10 Great Streetcar routes, and its great popularity with tourists and locals. A new facility has been proposed to be built in Pioneer Square to allow the route to reopen in the future. As of 2013, King County Metro, and City of Seattle fail to implement a plan for said new carbarn.\n\nAs soon as the park opened it was also criticized by the public for two policies that seemed to conflict with the easy public accessibility of an open-air museum: \"Don't Touch\" and \"Limited Photography\". The park hired security officers to enforce these rules.\n\nOn its weekend opening, both major local papers, the Seattle Times and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran articles about the museum's \"Don't Touch\" policy. The policy was instituted by Chief Conservator Nicholas Dorman to protect the pieces from damage, not just from scratching and vandalism, but long-term changes caused by oils left by human contact. The largest and one of the most accessible pieces, \"Wake\" by Richard Serra, has a delicate patina of rust that could be protected by a coating but has not because it conflicts with the museum's ideal to present and preserve the piece in its purest form.\n\nOne of the park's prominent pieces, \"Typewriter Eraser, Scale X\" by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, is on three-year loan from its owner, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Unlike the other sculptures in the park, there was initially a posted sign indicating that the public does not have permission to photograph this sculpture, in spite of its current position alongside Elliott Avenue, a major street running through the park. After some criticism, the prohibition was lifted, with a Seattle Art Museum spokesperson claiming it was \"a misinterpretation of the loan agreement\". The text prohibiting photography was subsequently covered up with masking tape.\n\nMuch of the sculpture comes from local collections or were specifically commissioned for the park. Some of the donated pieces have been referred to as the \"equivalent of an unwanted birthday present left on the curb for charity.\" By commissioning sculptures, the park has been criticized for placing art that does not have \"staying power\" by artists who have not proven their worth.

He stands at a spiritual crossroads and gives (or denies) permission to speak with the spirits of Guinee, and is believed to speak all human languages. In Haiti, he is the great elocutioner. Legba facilitates communication, speech, and understanding.\n\nHe usually appears as an old man on a crutch or with a cane, wearing a broad brimmed straw hat and smoking a pipe, or sparkling water. The dog is sacred to him. Legba is syncretized with Saint Peter, Saint Lazarus, and Saint Anthony.\n\nIn Benin, Nigeria and Togo, Legba is viewed as young and virile, is often horned and phallic, and his shrine is usually located at the gate of the village in the countryside. Alternatively, he is addressed as Legba Atibon, Atibon Legba, or Ati-Gbon Legba.\n\nIn the 1949 novel The Kingdom of This World, by Alejo Carpentier, Solimán gives Pauline Bonaparte a Papa Legba mascot for a safe journey back to Europe because of the Yellow Fever outbreak. Later, when in Rome, the ill Solimán tries to reach for the god Legba. Also in this novel, Papa Legba is referred to as \"the Lord of the Roads,\" in the scene where Ti Noel discovers a large gnarled tree that is comparable to Legba's crutches after freeing himself from slavery. \n\nIn the 1972 novel, \"Mumbo Jumbo\", by Ishmael Reed, the main character is a Voodoo priest named Papa Labas after Papa Legba.\n\nIn his study of the Delta blues, Robert Palmer discusses the appearance of Legba in blues lyrics and lore. Palmer notes that Legba can be referred to/identified as \"the Devil\", \"Papa Legba\", and \"The Black Man\" throughout the history of the blues.. This is also made clear in ethnomusicologist Bruno Blum's text for the CD box set \"Voodoo in America\" (scroll for English version) , where reference to Papa Legba, deity of roads and crossroads, in Robert Johnson's iconic song \"Crossroads\" is explained.\n\nIn the 1983 novel \"Praisesong for the Widow\" by Paule Marshall, Part III (\"Lavé Tête\"), Papa Legba appears in disguise to guide the heroine Avey Johnson when she has arrived at a crucial crossroad in her life.\n\nIn 1982, Elton John released a UK B-side titled \"Hey, Papa Legba,\" with lyrics by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin. The musical groups Talking Heads, The Smalls, Angel, Sun City Girls, and Sun God have also made songs named after him. The Talking Heads song can be found on their 1986 album (and soundtrack to the David Byrne film of the same name), \"True Stories\"; the Talking Heads song has been covered regularly by Widespread Panic, whose performance of the song can be heard on their live album, Light Fuse, Get Away.\n\nA 1985 episode of the TV series \"Miami Vice\" (Season 2, Episode 8, \"Tale of the Goat\") centers around a malign Vodou priest by the name of Papa Legba (played by Clarence Williams III). In keeping with the image of Legba often conceptualised in Haitian Vodou subculture, Papa Legba is depicted as \"controlling\" the gateway to the spiritual world (through the use of drugs), walking with the aid of crutches, and smoking a pipe.\n\nThere is extensive referencing to Voodoo in the Sprawl trilogy by William Gibson. In the second book, \"Count Zero\", Papa Legba stands at the gateway to cyberspace as the \"master of roads and pathways,\" with other loa appearing throughout the book. Papa Legba and Voodoo appear again in \"Spook Country\", a book from one of Gibson's other trilogies.\n\nIn Chapter XXII of James Branch Cabell's \"Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice\", Jurgen and Queen Anaitis (lady of the lake) pass a statue of Legba in the courtyard. Jurgen remarks \"Now certainly, Queen Anaitis, you have unusual taste in sculpture\".\n\nIn the 1986 film \"Crossroads\", blues musicians Robert Johnson and Willie Brown sell their souls to a \"Mr. Legba\" at a Mississippi crossroads. Later in the film Legba takes the name \"Scratch\". In this movie, however, Legba is mistaken for the Christian devil (or the popular notion of the devil), who takes the main character's soul in exchange for a successful musical career in blues.\n\nThere is a brief reference to Papa Legba in Neil Gaiman's \"American Gods\".\n\nThere is a single reference to Atibon Legba in the song \"Black Cat Bone\" on the Mission album \"The Brightest Light\".\n\nErzulie, Damballa, Baron Samedi and Papa Legba, all appear in the WildCats original comic series, assisting Voodoo against Mait' Carrefour.\n\nThey also appear (or are referenced to) in Terry Pratchett's book \"Witches Abroad\" (1991).\n\nThe character Galeb from \"Tales of Monkey Island\" was based on Papa Legba.\n\nPapa Legba is invoked by the Marvel Comics character Brother Voodoo for support.\n\nIn 2013 Lance Reddick portrayed Papa Legba in \"\", where the character is depicted wearing a top hat and black tuxedo jacket, more in keeping with one of the Barons (e.g. Baron Samedi). This depiction is of a crossroads demon rather than the loa of communication.\n\nThe 2014 \"Danse Vaudou\" episode of \"Constantine\" has Papa Legba summoned by the character Papa Midnight to open a channel allowing the living to speak and attain closure with the dead.\n\nPapa Legba is mentioned in the 2014 horror film, \"Jessabelle\", where he is called upon to open the door for a dead spirit to return to the living.\n\nThe 2014 album \"Memoirs of a Murderer\" by heavy metal band King810, includes an introduction for the track \"Take It\" with vocals by singer David Gunn: \"Papa, Papa Legba, open up the gate for me.\"\n\nIn the 2017 novel \"The People's Police\" by Norman Spinrad, three people from New Orleans appear on TV hoping for publicity and support from the people against the banks, corporate fat cats, and corrupt politicians. Papa Legba responds by asking \"What do you offer?\"\n\nIn 2017, Bruno Blum released a song named \"Papa Legba\" on his \"Culte\" album, in which he depicts Papa Legba as an alien, using the 'Papa Legba' voodoo drum pattern. A subsequent animation video directed by Pascal Le Gras was also issued.\n\nIn the 2017 novel \"American Street\" by Ibi Zoboi, PaPa Legba appears in Detroit, Michigan, often near the corner of American Street and Joy Road.\n\nIn 2018, Papa Legba (Lance Reddick) briefly returns in the \"\", the eighth season of \"American Horror Story\"\n\n\n"}

The title is a portmanteau of the French words \"rubrique\" (section) and \"bric-à-brac\". Initially published in \"Pilote\" magazine, the series was republished as five hardbound books between 1970 and 1974 by Dargaud, and again in 2002 as one volume, which also included previously unpublished content. It is widely regarded as one of the cornerstones of today's humorous \"bande dessinée\".\n\n\"Rubrique-à-Brac\" is an assortment of short (two to three pages) unrelated strips, drawn in black and white (although the 2002 re-publication was colorized). Its fairly realistic graphics contrast with the surreal, sometimes satirical humour of its textual content. The result is comparable to a graphical form of deadpan humour. \nThe backgrounds are almost non-existent, and a large portion of the panels is occupied by elaborate dialogues.\n\n\"Rubrique-à-Brac\" revisits an extremely wide range of subjects, such as historical figures, classic fairy tales, folklore, foreign countries and cultures, sport, the making of comics (in strips in which the author is often involved), movie and television clichés, music, youth and infancy (often in strips implicitly telling the author's life), science, or the various uses of everyday items and everyday life.

It was opened on 11 October 1891 by Artur Hazelius (1833–1901) to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era.\n\nThe name \"Skansen\" has also been used as a noun to refer to other open-air museums and collections of historic structures, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in the United States, e.g. Old World Wisconsin and Fairplay, Colorado.\n\nThe 19th century was a period of great change throughout Europe, and Sweden was no exception. Its rural way of life was rapidly giving way to an industrialised society and many feared that the country's many traditional customs and occupations might be lost to history. Artur Hazelius, who had previously founded the Nordic Museum on the island of Djurgården near the centre of Stockholm, was inspired by the open-air museum, founded by King Oscar II in Kristiania in 1881, when he created his open-air museum on the hill that dominates the island. Skansen became the model for other early open-air museums in Scandinavia and later ones elsewhere.\n\nSkansen was originally a part of the Nordic Museum, but became an independent organisation in 1963. The objects within the Skansen buildings are still the property of the Nordic Museum.\n\nAfter extensive travelling, Hazelius bought around 150 houses from all over the country (as well as one structure from Telemark in Norway) and had them shipped piece by piece to the museum, where they were rebuilt to provide a unique picture of traditional Sweden. Only three of the buildings in the museum are not original, and were painstakingly copied from examples he had found. All of the buildings are open to visitors and show the full range of Swedish life from the Skogaholm Manor house built in 1680, to the 16th century Älvros farmhouses.\n\nSkansen attracts more than 1.3 million visitors each year. The many exhibits over the 75 acre (300,000 m²) site include a full replica of an average 19th-century town, in which craftsmen in traditional dress such as tanners, shoemakers, silversmiths, bakers and glass-blowers demonstrate their skills in period surroundings. There is even a small patch growing tobacco used for the making of cigarettes. There is also an open-air zoo containing a wide range of Scandinavian animals including the bison, brown bear, moose, grey seal, lynx, otter, red fox, reindeer, wolf, and wolverine (as well as some non-Scandinavian animals because of their popularity). There are also farmsteads where rare breeds of farm animals can be seen.\n\nIn early December the site's central Bollnäs square is host to a popular Christmas market that has been held since 1903, attracting around 25,000 visitors each weekend. In the summer there are displays of folk dancing and concerts.\n\nSince 1897, Skansen has been served by the Skansens Bergbana, a funicular railway on the northwest side of the Skansen hill. The funicular is 196.4 meters long, with a total rise of 34.57 meters.\n\n\n"}

These currencies were allowed to fluctuate by 2.25% against the dollar. The Smithsonian Agreement was created by the Group of Ten (G-10) nations (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) raised the price of gold to 38 dollars, a 8.5% increase over the previous price at which was the US government had promised to redeem dollars for gold. In effect, the changing gold price devalued the dollar by 7.9%.\n\nThe Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 established an international fixed exchange rate system based on the gold exchange standard, in which currencies were pegged to the United States dollar, itself convertible into gold at $35/ounce.\n\nA negative balance of payments, growing public debt incurred by the Vietnam War and Great Society programs, and monetary inflation by the Federal Reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued in the 1960s. The drain on US gold reserves culminated with the London Gold Pool collapse in March 1968.\n\nOn August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon unilaterally suspended the convertibility of US dollars into gold. The United States had deliberately offered this convertibility in 1944; it was put into practice by the U.S. Treasury. The suspension made the dollar effectively a fiat currency.\n\nNixon's administration subsequently entered negotiations with industrialized allies to reassess exchange rates following this development.\n\nMeeting in December 1971 at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the Group of Ten signed the Smithsonian Agreement. The US pledged to peg the dollar at $38/ounce (instead of $35/ounce; in other words: the USD rate lost 7.9 %) with 2.25% trading bands, and other countries agreed to appreciate their currencies versus the dollar: Yen +16.9 %; Deutsche Mark +13.6 %, French Franc +8.6 %, British pound the same, Italian lira +7.5 %. The group also planned to balance the world financial system using special drawing rights alone.\n\nAlthough the Smithsonian Agreement was hailed by President Nixon as a fundamental reorganization of international monetary affairs, it failed to encourage discipline by the Federal Reserve or the United States government. The dollar price in the gold free market continued to cause pressure on its official rate; soon after a 10% devaluation was announced on 14 February 1973, Japan and the OEEC countries decided to let their currencies float. A decade later, all industrialized nations had done so.\n\n\n\n"}

Hardware-based implementations run distinct DNS server devices for the desired access granularity within the networks involved. Software solutions use either multiple DNS server processes on the same hardware or special server software with the built-in capability of discriminating access to DNS zone records. The latter is a common feature of many server software implementations of the DNS protocol (cf. Comparison of DNS server software) and is sometimes the implied meaning of the term \"split-horizon DNS\", since all other forms of implementation can be achieved with any DNS server software.\n\nSplit-horizon DNS is designed to provide different authoritative answers to an identical query and DNSSEC is used to ensure veracity of data returned by the Domain Name System. These apparently conflicting goals create the potential for confusion or false security alerts in poorly constructed networks. Research has produced recommendations to properly combine these two DNS features.\n\nOne common use case for split-horizon DNS is when a server, \"host1\" in the example below, has both a private IP address on a local area network (not reachable from most of the Internet) and a public address, i.e. an address reachable across the Internet in general. By using split-horizon DNS the same name can lead to either the private IP address or the public one, depending on which client sends the query. This allows for critical local client machines to access a server directly through the local network, without the need to pass through a router. Passing through fewer network devices improves the network latency.\n\nInternal DNS view, the server is named host1.example.net:\n\nExternal view:\n\n\n"}

She served as pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Warwick for ten years and taught in its Centre for Translation and Comparative Cultural Studies, which closed in 2009. As of 2016, she is a professor of comparative literature at the Universities of Glasgow and Warwick. Educated around Europe, she began her career in Italy and has lectured at universities in the United States. In 2007, she was elected a Fellow at the Royal Society of Literature.\n\nAmong her more than twenty books, several have become mainstays in the field of literary criticism, especially \"Translation Studies\" (1980) and \"Comparative Literature\" (1993). A book on Ted Hughes was published in 2009. Another book edited by Bassnett is \"Knives and Angels: Women Writers in Latin America\". Bassnett's collaboration with several intellectuals in a series of book projects has been received well. In 2006, she co-edited with Peter Bush the book \"The Translator as Writer\". In addition to her scholarly works, Bassnett writes poetry which was published as \"Exchanging Lives: Poems and Translations\" (2002).\n\nIn her 1998 work \"Constructing Cultures: Essays on Literary Translation\" (written with André Lefevere), Bassnett states that \"the shift of emphasis from original to translation is reflected in discussions on the visibility of the translator. Lawrence Venuti calls for a translator-centered translation, insisting that the translator should inscribe him/herself visibly into the text\".\n\nIn a 2006 essay titled \"Reflections on Comparative Literature in the Twenty-First Century\", she engaged with Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak who argues in \"Death of a Discipline\" (2003) that the field of comparative literature must move beyond its eurocentrism if it is to stay relevant. While she agrees with Spivak that eurocentrism has marginalised literatures from the non-West, she also argues that Spivak's argument puts comparatists from Europe, who are familiar with its literatures, in a precarious position. To Bassnett, the way out for European comparatists is to critically investigate their past. Bassnett also recanted her previous stance that comparative literature is a dying subject that will slowly be replaced by translation studies. Rather, she argues that comparative literature and translation theory continue to be relevant today if taken as modes of reading that literary critics can use to approach texts.\n\nClive Barker, Bassnett's long-term partner and a theatre studies academic at Warwick, died in 2005. \n\n"}

Many 19th-century writers such as Ambrose Bierce, Yda Addis, and Gertrude Atherton appeared regularly in its pages. It was considered one of the most important publications in California, and it had a great deal of political influence.\n\nAs a staunch Republican, Pixley used \"The Argonaut\" to support Leland Stanford and other owners of the Central Pacific Railroad. Pixley, who served as \"The Argonaut's\" editor and publisher, had been California's 8th attorney general when Stanford was governor. The journal was founded as a counterweight to Denis Kearney, an Irish-born labor leader who represented many of the Irish immigrants who worked for the railroad. Pixley, who wanted someday to become governor of California himself, was said to have handed out gold coins to sway voters.\n\nJerome Hart became the magazine's editor in 1891.\n\nThe magazine was revived in 1991, by Warren Hinckle, and continues in both print and online formats.\n"}

Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery.\n\nThe next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts him about the murder and says that the police know that he was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder. Mill receives a postcard from the writer suggesting that they meet at a hotel bar. While Mill is waiting, he is cornered by two screenwriters, Tom Oakley (Richard E. Grant) and Andy Sivella (Dean Stockwell), who pitch \"Habeas Corpus\", a legal drama featuring no major stars and with a depressing ending. Because Mill is not alone, his stalker does not appear. After leaving the club, Mill receives a fax in his car, advising him to look under his raincoat. He discovers a live rattlesnake in a box and, terrified, bludgeons it with his umbrella.\n\nMill tells June that his near-death experience made him realize he has feelings for her. Apprehensive that Larry Levy continues encroaching on his job, Mill invites the two writers to pitch \"Habeas Corpus\" to him, convincing Levy that the movie will be an Oscar contender. Mill's plan is to let Levy shepherd the film through production and have it flop. Mill will step in at the last moment, suggesting some changes to salvage the film's box office, letting him reclaim his position at the studio. Having persuaded Bonnie to leave for New York on studio business, Mill takes June to a Hollywood awards banquet and their relationship blossoms.\n\nAfter Bonnie confronts Mill about his relationship with June, Mill coldly severs their relationship in front of two writers. Mill takes June to an isolated Desert Hot Springs resort and spa. In the middle of Mill and June making love, Mill confesses his role in Kahane's murder, and June responds by saying she loves him. Mill's attorney (Sydney Pollack) informs him that studio head Joel Levison (Brion James) has been fired, and that the Pasadena police want Mill to participate in a lineup. An eyewitness has come forward, but she fails to identify Mill.\n\nOne year later, studio power players are watching the end of \"Habeas Corpus\" with a new, tacked-on, upbeat Hollywood ending and famous actors in the lead roles. Mill's plan to save the movie has worked and he is head of the studio. June is now Mill's wife and pregnant with his child. Bonnie objects to the film's new ending and is fired by Levy. Mill rebuffs her when she appeals her termination to him. Mill receives a pitch over the phone from Levy and a man who reveals himself as the postcard writer. The man pitches an idea about a studio executive who kills a writer and gets away with murder. Mill gives the writer a deal, if he can guarantee the executive a happy ending. The writer's title for the film is \"The Player\".\n\nAltman had troubles with the Hollywood studio system in the 1970s after a number of studio films (\"McCabe & Mrs. Miller\", \"The Long Goodbye\") lost money or had trouble finding audiences despite the critical praise and cult adulation they received. Altman continued to work outside the studios in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, often doing small budget projects or filmed plays to keep his career alive. Although it was distributed by Fine Line Features rather than a major studio (FLF was a division of New Line Cinema), \"The Player\" was a comeback to making films in Hollywood. It ushered in a new period of filmmaking for Altman, who continued on to an adaptation of Raymond Carver's short stories, \"Short Cuts\" (1993).\n\nThe opening sequence shot lasts 7 minutes and 47 seconds without an edit. Fifteen takes were required to shoot this scene, but, according to the slate at the beginning of the shot, the tenth take was used in the final edit.\n\nAltman was praised for the sex scene in which Robbins and Scacchi were filmed from the neck up. Scacchi later claimed that Altman had wanted a nude scene, but that it was her refusal which led to the final form.\n\nThe editing of \"The Player\" by Geraldine Peroni was honored by a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. In 2004, Tony Sloman wrote an appreciation of the film's editing:\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Bitingly cynical without succumbing to bitterness, \"The Player\" is one of the all-time great Hollywood satires -- and an ensemble-driven highlight of the Altman oeuvre.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 86 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nAltman won a number of European best-director awards (the BAFTA Award, Best Director at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival) and he was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director (the film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical). Tolkin was nominated for a Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and he received an Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Geraldine Peroni's editing was nominated for both the Academy Award and the BAFTA Award. Tim Robbins also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Comedy or Musical and Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn 2015, \"Entertainment Weekly\"s 25th anniversary year, it named \"The Player\" in its list of the 25 best movies since the magazine's beginnings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43366231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43366231", "title": "This Is Not a Movie", "text": "This Is Not a Movie\n\nThis Is Not a Movie is a 2010 Mexican experimental science fiction film written and directed by Olallo Rubio. It stars Edward Furlong in three roles, playing different personalities of the same character, who prepares for the end of the world by sequestering himself in a Las Vegas hotel while he grapples with existential questions. The score was composed by musician Slash. It premiered at the Morelia International Film Festival in 2010 and was released in Mexico on January 28, 2011.\n\nConcerned that he cannot remember his past, Pete Nelson prepares for the end of the world by going to Las Vegas. In his hotel room, three distinct personalities emerge and argue with each other over the nature of reality and how to best spend the remaining time. The first personality, a bitter man who blames his failed life on \"the system\", wants to explore his forgotten past. The second personality, a drunken hedonist, wants to leave the hotel and take advantage of the prostitution and gambling in Las Vegas. A third personality, which emerges after debates between the first two, questions the nature of reality and states that they are all fictional characters in the screenplay of a hack writer.\n\nEventually, a ghost appears, whom Pete identifies as Jimmy, a friend who died years ago. Jimmy points out plot holes in the film, including the fact that he can perceive each of the three personalities. With this evidence, Pete's personalities become more convinced that they are in a film, though they also debate the idea that he whole situation is a dream, which the third personality decries as further evidence that the writer is a hack. Nelson experiences a series of hallucinations or dreams in the form of parodic short films and trailers laced with conspiracy theories. One lampoons the Apple \"think different\" ad campaign and states that anyone who actually thinks differently is assassinated. Another posits a cabal of world leaders and businessmen who control the world through a company called Propaganda. Films like \"\", \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", \"The Delta Force\", \"Leaving Las Vegas\", and \"The Holy Mountain\" are spoofed, mentioned or referenced. There is a scene where Pete confronts the audience (and himself) by breaking the fourth wall and threatening to kill the camera.\n\nThe first personality tires of the other two personalities and shoots both. Jimmy's ghost then shoots him, but Pete does not die. Instead, the CEO of Propaganda reappears as a disembodied voice and guides Pete to place where they can talk face-to-face. There, the man reveals himself as a former CIA agent and the screenwriter who created Pete. Depressed about his lack of success in finishing the screenplay, the writer explains that he has become suicidal and threatens to kill himself, which was the source of the apocalypse in Pete's world. The writer berates Pete for derailing the writing process and taking over the character. Pete is unable to talk the writer out his course of action, and the film ends as the writer shoots himself in the head.\n\n\nThe film was shot in Mexico City and Las Vegas and was produced from 2003 to 2008 with a budget of $3 million. Slash scored the film, and it features songs by Monster Magnet. The Deleted scenes available in the Blu-ray edition include an animated sequence where Alice Cooper plays on the soundtrack.\n\n\"This Is Not a Movie\" premiered at the Morelia International Film Festival and was released in Mexico on January 28, 2011. Lorber released it on DVD in the United States on March 20, 2012.\n\nHoward Feinstein of \"Screen Daily\" wrote that the themes are \"all wrong for a film\" and \"go nowhere\". Harry H. Long of the \"Lebanon Daily News\" said the film's themes are unclear and scattershot, but the film is \"masterfully done\" and features a \"tour-de-force performance\" from Furlong. Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk rated it 0.5/5 stars and wrote that although the film is not poorly made, the writing is shallow and immature. Devon Ashby of CraveOnline rated it 2.5/10 stars and wrote that it \"[fails] to compensate for its lack of superficial content with convincing thematic resonance or formal commentary\".\n"}

It also includes interactive travel forums.\n\nTripAdvisor was an early adopter of user-generated content. The website services are free to users, who provide most of the content, and the website is supported by a hotel booking facility and an advertising business model.\n\nTripAdvisor, headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts, is the largest travel website in the world, with more than 315 million reviewers (active and inactive) and over 500 million reviews of hotels, restaurants, attractions and other travel-related businesses. TripAdvisor Media Group operates 25 travel brands including TripAdvisor, Airfarewatchdog, BookingBuddy, Citymaps, Cruise Critic, Family Vacation Critic, FlipKey, GateGuru, Holiday Lettings, Holiday Watchdog, Independent Traveler, Jetsetter, lafourchette, Niumba, OneTime, SeatGuru, SmarterTravel, Tingo, TravelPod, Tripbod, VacationHomeRentals, Viator, and VirtualTourist. TripAdvisor operates websites internationally.\n\nTripAdvisor was founded by Stephen Kaufer, Langley Steinert, Nick Shanny, and Thomas Palka in February 2000. Kaufer has stated that the original idea wasn't a user generated social media site to swap reviews, \"We started as a site where we were focused more on those official words from guidebooks or newspapers or magazines. We also had a button in the very beginning that said, \"Visitors add your own review\", and boy, did that just take off.\" Original financing was obtained from Flagship Ventures, the Bollard Group, and private investors.\n\nIn 2004, the company was purchased by IAC/InterActiveCorp.\n\nIn August 2005, IAC spun off its travel group of businesses under the Expedia, Inc. name.\n\nIn April 2009, TripAdvisor launched its official site in China, since then it has indexed more than 20,000 hotels and restaurants information and customer reviews, and made top lists, becoming one of the biggest travel websites as of July 2011.\n\nIn September 2010, SmarterTravel, part of TripAdvisor Media Group, launched SniqueAway (now Jetsetter), the first members-only site where each travel deal is endorsed by the people.\n\nIn March 2011, TripAdvisor informed all registered TripAdvisor members that an unauthorized third party had stolen some of TripAdvisor's email list and might use it to create spam messages. No passwords or other information was stolen. This happened shortly before many other companies reported similar thefts of the addresses on their email lists.\n\nIn April 2011, it was announced that Expedia would split into two publicly traded companies by spinning off the TripAdvisor brand of travel sites. According to Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, the move \"allows the two businesses to be pure plays and to operate with the proper amount of focus to grow respectively.\"\n\nAccording to a July 2011 PhoCusWright survey of 3,641 respondents, solicited at random through a pop-up invitation link on TripAdvisor.com and commissioned by Trip Advisor, “98% of participants found that TripAdvisor’s hotel reviews … accurately reflect the experience.”\n\nIn December 2011, TripAdvisor was spun off from Expedia in a public offering.\n\nTripAdvisor becomes the world’s largest travel site, with nearly 280 million unique monthly visitors.\n\nIn April 2012, the company launched a connection to Facebook that lets users select reviews from people in their social graph.\n\nIn October 2014, Trip Advisor released a new feature, \"Just for you\", offering tailored hotel recommendations based on the user's preferences and search history on the site. This feature mirrored the \"Tribes\" feature launched on competitor site Gogobot in 2013.\n\nAs per its annual shareholder report, Trip advisor earns 43% of its revenues through its two most significant advertising partners, Expedia and Priceline (and their subsidiaries).\nIt derives a substantial portion of its revenue from advertising and redirections. These include revenues from the sale of advertising, mostly through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based and subscription-based advertising. The company also has master advertising contracts with its advertising partners.\nIts advertisers usually depend on this advertising to generate sales leads, customers, bookings, or revenue and profit on a cost-effective basis. Click-based advertising revenue accounts for the majority of its advertising revenue. Its CPC pricing for click-based advertising depends, in part, on competition between advertisers. Its advertisers currently focus more on traffic volume rather than per-click profit. Hence they do not reduce the CPC. As of 2017, Trip advisor employed 3,217 part time and full time employees, of whom 51% were located in USA.\n\nIn May 2007, TripAdvisor acquired Smarter Travel Media operator of SmarterTravel.com and BookingBuddy.com; SeatGuru.com; TravelPod.com; and Travel-Library.com.\nAlso in May 2007, TripAdvisor acquired The Independent Traveler, Inc., publisher of Cruise Critic.com and IndependentTraveler.com\n\nIn February 2008, TripAdvisor acquired Holiday Watchdog, user-generated travel site in the U.K.\nIn July 2008, TripAdvisor acquired Virtualtourist, a travel website with reportedly over 1 million registered members and OneTime.com, a travel comparison site.\n\nIn July 2008, TripAdvisor acquired a majority stake in FlipKey.com, a vacation-rental website. In October 2009, TripAdvisor purchased Kuxun.cn, China’s second-largest consumer travel site and hotel and flight search engine. Kuxun was later sold to Meituan.\n\nIn June 2010, TripAdvisor acquired the United Kingdom's largest independent vacation rental website, holidaylettings.co.uk.\n\nIn July 2011, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition of Where I've Been, a Chicago-based Travel Facebook app for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIn October 2012, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition of Wanderfly, an NYC-based travel inspiration website for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIn April 2013, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition of Jetsetter, an NYC flash sale site.\n\nIn June 2013, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition of GateGuru, an NYC-based flight and airport information mobile app for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIn October 2013, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition of Oyster.com, an NYC-based hotel review and photography website, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIn May 2014 TripAdvisor acquired Vacation Home Rentals and Tripod.\n\nIn May 2014, LaFourchette agreed to be acquired by TripAdvisor, for $140 million in an all cash deal. In July 2014, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition.\n\nIn August 2014, TripAdvisor acquired Viator, Inc. for $200M.\n\nIn October 2014, TripAdvisor acquired mytable and restopolis.\n\nIn January 2015, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition of Iens, a Dutch restaurant review website and SeatMe, a Dutch website for reserving seats in a restaurant. According to TripAdvisor, this is to stimulate growth in The Netherlands.\n\nIn April 2015, TripAdvisor acquired Portuguese startup BestTables.\n\nIn May 2015, TripAdvisor acquired Australian startup Dimmi for $25 million.\n\nIn August 2016, TripAdvisor acquired New York City startup Citymaps.com, which developed a social mapping site and original cross platform map engine based on OpenStreetMap data.\n\nIn October 2016, TripAdvisor announced its acquisition of Couverts, a Dutch restaurant review, a Dutch website for reserving seats in a restaurant. According to TripAdvisor, this is to stimulate growth in The Netherlands.\n\nIn April 2018, Tripadvisor acquired Icelandic startup, Bokun, the provider of travel businesses with management software to assist with bookings and reselling services. \n\nTripAdvisor has been the subject of controversy for allowing unsubstantiated anonymous reviews to be posted about any hotel, B&B, inn, or restaurant.\n\nApproximately 30 hotels have been blacklisted by TripAdvisor for suspicious reviews, including a Cornwall hotel that bribed guests to leave positive reviews of the hotel.\n\nTripAdvisor has stated that reviews are not posted to the website instantly, but are subject to a verification process which considers the IP address and email address of the author, and tries to detect any suspicious patterns or obscene or abusive language. The website also allows the community of users to report suspicious content, which is then assessed by Tripadvisor staff.\n\nIn September 2011, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched a formal investigation into TripAdvisor after receiving a complaint submitted by online investigations company KwikChex that its claims to provide trustworthy and honest reviews from travelers are false. The ASA found that TripAdvisor \"should not claim or imply that all its reviews were from real travellers, or were honest, real or trusted\", and as a result of the investigation, TripAdvisor was ordered to remove the slogan \"reviews you can trust\" from its UK web site. It changed its hotel review section slogan to 'reviews from our community.'\n\nTripAdvisor stated that the branding change had been planned for some time and that changes began in June 2011, before the ASA investigation. ASA commented that \"it was concerned that consumers might be fooled by fraudulent posts since the entries could be made without any form of verification,\" but recognised that TripAdvisor used \"advanced and highly effective fraud systems\" in an attempt to identify and remove fake content.\n\nIn 2012, an action was brought in a Sheriff Court in Scotland, by a guesthouse owner who claimed damages for malicious statements. TripAdvisor asserted that the Scottish courts lacked jurisdiction. The outcome of this case was called a \"landmark victory\", as the pursuer (plaintiff) secured two points of law in the UK: \nThe case was found to involve issues relating to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Act, 1977: these issues were referred to a higher court in Stornoway.\n\nIn 2012, TripAdvisor was fined $80,000 by the U.S. Department of Transportation for violating new fair trading regulations requiring taxes and fees to be shown for prices quoted for airfares.\n\nIn May 2013, a fake restaurant was set up by a disgruntled businessman and reportedly had diners looking for the eatery in an alley filled with garbage cans. The fake listing went undetected on TripAdvisor for over 2 months until it was exposed by KwikChex.\n\nIn March 2014, TripAdvisor's Chinese site came under scrutiny because KwikChex uncovered that a reviewer had reviewed 51 Parisian restaurants in one month, while also reviewing 50 Hotels in other countries.\n\nIn December 2014, the Italian Antitrust Authority fined TripAdvisor €500,000 for improper commercial practices on the TripAdvisor website. The Italian Authority stated that Tripadvisor and its Italian arm should stop publishing misleading information about the sources of the reviews. In June 2015, a fake restaurant created by a newspaper rose to the top of the site's rankings in Italy.\n\nAn ex-hotel manager at Meriton says that guests were offered inducements to change ratings they left on the site.\n\nDietmar Doering, a German hotelier based in Sri Lanka accused TripAdvisor of hosting malicious reviews of his resort \"The Cosy Beach\" in Marawila. He claimed he was compelled to take legal action for the estimated damages of US$500,000.\n\nIn November 2017, TripAdvisor was cited in two reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and CBS News that it was responsible for deleting numerous reviews that raised red flags of complaisant criminal responsibility by resorts in Playa del Carmen, a popular tourist resort in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. The reports cited that the company deleted reviews from two women who were raped at the Iberostar Paraiso Maya in separate incidents 2010 and 2015 respectively, one of which involved a hotel security guard. After assurances from hotel staff they would help out and contact the authorities but failed to take any follow-up action, the women took their advisories and warnings to TripAdvisor, which deleted their reviews. The first victim, Kristie Love, had her review eventually put back up on TripAdvisor's site successfully, while in the case of the second victim, Jamie Valeri, the company refused to budge after citing her report as \"hearsay.\" The reports also highlighted at least a dozen other incidents at hotels and resorts across Mexico, including that of a 29-year-old man who was raped by a massage therapist at a resort in the same area, where reviewers had attempted to warn people through reviews on the company's site about criminal incidents that the resorts and local authorities had failed to pursue any criminal or legal action for, only to have those reviews either taken down or declined for posting by TripAdvisor.\n\nIn November 2017, Oobah Butler, a journalist for Vice Media, used fake reviews to boost a nonexistent restaurant named The Shed at Dulwich to the top of Tripadvisor rankings for restaurants in London. When questioned about its fraud-prevention systems, TripAdvisor responded that this type of fraud was not generally seen, because unlike artificially good reviews for a real restaurant, creating good reviews for a non-existent restaurant is not profitable.\n\n\nTop 10 Airlines in the World Announced By TripAdvisor==External links==\n"}

{"id": "36811772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36811772", "title": "Wittmoor bog trackway", "text": "Wittmoor bog trackway\n\nThe Wittmoor bog trackway is the name given to each of two historic corduroy roads, trackway No. I being discovered in 1898 and trackway No. II in 1904 in the \"Wittmoor\" bog in northern Hamburg, Germany. The trackways date to the 4th and 7th century AD, both linked the eastern and western shores of the formerly inaccessible, swampy bog. A part of the older trackway No. II dating to the period of the Roman Empire is on display at the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.\n\nBoth bog trackways are located in the Wittmoor bog in the Hamburg districts of Duvenstedt, Lemsahl-Mellingstedt and the Norderstedt district of Glashütte in Schleswig-Holstein. Both trackways have been disturbed by historical peat cutters. In 1898 Ludwig Frahm, a local school teacher and historian followed a hint from Hinrich Mohr, a carpenter from Poppenbüttel, showing him the location of what he called a Russian causeway which is actually trackway No. I. In 1900 Frahm excavated a few planks of the trackway, publishing his findings in 1901 and 1913. The two bog trackways found in Wittmoor were excellently preserved due to the moist, peaty soil.\n\nBog trackway I (location: ) was discovered in 1898, in 1900 and 1901 Frahm excavated a part of the trackway together with Prof. Wilms and it was re-examined by the archaeologists Prejawa and Kolumbe in the 1930s. The trackway ran in southeasterly direction through the Wittmoor and had a length of about . Even during World War II most of the western part of the pead bog were cut for fuel production which destroyed large sections of the trackway. This bog trackway was built up in a much easier technique than the older bog trackway II The path consisted of clean-hewn oak planks ranging from to in length and to width laid directly on the surface of the bog. The trackway was embedded in the peat in a depth of only from below the surface. Also in this part of the bog peat was regularly taken for fuel production, which gradually destroyed the trackway. The well-preserved wooden planks of the way were taken by the peat cutters and used as firewood.\n\nBog trackway No. II (location: ) was discovered in 1904 by Hamburg state geologist Dr. Wolff. It too runs in a southeasterly direction through the Wittmoor, and had a length of about and was located parallel to and south-southwest of trackway No. I. This path was gradually destroyed through regular peat cutting. In 1947 approximately of the central part was excavated by Kellermann in 1947 which is now on displayed in the permanent collection of the Archaeological Museum in Hamburg. The substructure of the road consisted of two split oak planks that were placed parallel to each other on a sand or gravel foundation on the formerly swampy terrain. The thresholds were piles of split oak boards ranging from about to in length, widths between and and thickness of to laid transverse to the direction of the path. The thresholds were notched so as to prevent slipping on the boards. Every second threshold was cut diagonally at the ends. Through the gaps birch poles were driven into the ground to prevent slipping of the thresholds. A large part of the excavated path resembled a building site, the woods were torn out of the path way and thrown together in one place. Beside it newly trimmed timbers were found which were designed to be built in the new way, as well as items interpreted as tools, like a crowbar and mallet. Charred small pieces of wood indicating a fireplace. In 1938 the bog trackway was initially dated by pollen analysis to the 6th century BC; however, a radiocarbon dating performed in 1957 yielded an age nearer the beginning of the Christian era. The most recent dendrochronological dating performed in 1996 yielded a felling date of the trees around the 330 AD\n\nThe discovery of the two bog trackways disproved the old doctrine that such bog trackways only occurred south of the river Elbe. They show that in earlier times, a lively exchange between the western and eastern shores of the marshland occurred, and that the routes were considered so important that a significant logistical and substantive effort was expended to build paths through the marsh rather than circumvent the area. No archaeological evidence for settlements have been detected belonging to the bog trackways.\n"}
