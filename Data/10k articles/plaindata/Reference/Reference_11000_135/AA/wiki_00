Almajiri is gotten from an Arabic word \"Al-Muhajirun\" which can be translated to mean a person who leaves his home in search of Islamic knowledge.\n\nThis system of education started in Nigeria in a town named Kanem-Borno, which had a majority of its rulers widely involved in Quranic literacy. More than 700 years later, the Sokoto caliphate was founded by a revolution based on the teachings of the Qur'an. Sokoto caliphate and Borno caliphate started running the Almajiri system together. During this precolonial era, students used to stay with their parents for proper moral upbringing. All the schools available then were in a close proximity with the immediate environment of the students. Inspectors were introduced to go round the schools and after inspection they report to the Emir of the province all the matters regarding the affairs of the school. The schools were funded by the community, parents, zakkah, sadaqqah and sometimes through the farm output of the students.\n\nThe year 1904 brought a new twist to the almajiri system of education, as the British invaded the northern part of Nigeria. During the invasion most Emirs were killed and others were disposed. The remaining emirs lost controls of their territories, this resulted also in the lost of fundamental control of the almajiri. Boko was introduced, boko meaning western education. The British abolished the state funding of almajiri schools. With no support from the community, Emirs and government, the system collapsed. The teachers and students had no financial support, so, they turned into alms begging and menial jobs for survival.\n\nA report by the National Council for the Welfare of the Destitute (NCWD) approximated the number of current almajiri to 7 million. The system now lacks things like good teachers and basic amenities like proper clothing and shelter. Most of the almajiri do not graduate and are left with the option to do menial jobs. \n"}
{"id": "689992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=689992", "title": "Antonio Inoki", "text": "Antonio Inoki\n\nMuhammad Hussain Inoki (born on February 20, 1943) is a Japanese professional wrestling and mixed martial arts promoter, politician, and retired professional wrestler and martial artist, best known by his ring name . Inoki's ring name is a homage to fellow professional wrestler Antonino Rocca. \n\nInoki began his professional wrestling career in the Japanese Wrestling Association (JWA) under the tutelage of Rikidōzan. Inoki quickly became one of the most popular stars in the history of Japanese professional wrestling. Inoki parlayed his wrestling career into becoming one of Japan's most recognizable athletes, a reputation bolstered by his 1976 fight against world champion boxer Muhammad Ali. The fight against Ali served as a predecessor to modern day mixed martial arts. With Ric Flair, Inoki headlined two shows in North Korea in 1995 that drew 150,000 and 190,000 spectators, the highest attendances in professional wrestling history. Inoki was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2010. \n\nInoki began his promoting career in 1972, when he founded New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). He remained the owner of NJPW until 2005 when he sold his controlling share in the promotion to the Yuke's video game company. In 2007, he founded the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF). In 2017, Inoki founded ISM and the following year left IGF.\n\nIn 1989, while still an active wrestler, Inoki entered politics as he was elected to the Japanese House of Councillors. During his first term with the House of Councillors, Inoki successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein for the release of Japanese hostages before the outbreak of the Gulf War. His first tenure in the House of Councillors ended in 1995, but he was reelected in 2013.\n\nInoki was born in an affluent family in Yokohama in 1943. He was the sixth son and the second youngest of the seven boys and four girls. His father, Sajiro Inoki, a businessman and politician, died when Kanji was five years old. Inoki entered the Higashidai Grade School. Inoki was taught karate by an older brother while in 6th grade. By the time he was in 7th grade at Terao Junior High School, he was 180 centimeters tall and joined the basketball team. He later quit and joined a track and field club as a shot putter. He eventually won the championship at the Yokohama Junior High School track and field competition.\n\nThe family fell on hard times in the post-war years, and in 1957, the 14-year-old Inoki emigrated to Brazil with his grandfather, mother and brothers. His grandfather died during the journey to Brazil. Inoki won regional championships in Brazil in the shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw, and finally the All Brazilian championships in the shot put and discus.\n\nInoki met Rikidōzan at the age of 17. He went back to Japan for the Japanese Wrestling Association (JWA) as Rikidōzan's disciple. One of his dojo classmates was Giant Baba. After Rikidozan's death, Inoki worked in Baba's shadow until he joined the original Tokyo Pro Wrestling in 1966.\n\nAfter a long excursion of wrestling in the United States, Inoki found a new home in Tokyo Pro Wrestling. While there, Inoki became their biggest star. Unfortunately, the company folded in 1967, due to turmoil behind the scenes.\n\nReturning to JWA in late 1967, Inoki was made Baba's partner and the two dominated the tag team ranks as the \"B-I Cannon\", winning the NWA International tag team belts four times. Wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino tells a story about Inoki trying to \"shoot\" him during a tag match in Osaka to build his reputation against the then-world champ. Bruno powered out of the hold, pounded Inoki mercilessly and threw him out of the ring. Inoki allegedly refused to re-enter the ring with Sammartino and tagged in Baba to finish the match.\n\nFired from JWA in late 1971 for planning a takeover of the promotion, Inoki founded New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in 1972. His first match as a New Japan wrestler was against Karl Gotch.\n\nIn June 1979, he fought with Pakistani wrestler Zubair Jhara Pahalwan and lost the fight in the fifth round. In 2014, twenty two years after Zubair Jhara's death, he announced to take Jhara's nephew \"Haroon Abid\" under his guardianship.\n\nOn November 30, 1979, Inoki defeated WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund in Tokushima, Japan to win the title. Backlund then won a rematch on December 6. However, WWF president Hisashi Shinma declared the re-match a no contest due to interference from Tiger Jeet Singh, and Inoki remained Champion. Inoki refused the title on the same day, and it was declared vacant. Backlund later defeated Bobby Duncum in a Texas Death match to regain the title on December 12. As Inoki refused the title, his reign is not included nor is it recognized by WWE in its official history, and Backlund is recognized as having one reign from 1978 to 1983.\n\nIn 1995 the Japanese and the North Korean governments came together to hold a two-day wrestling festival for peace in Pyongyang, North Korea. The event drew 150,000 and 190,000 fans respectively to Rungnado May Day Stadium. The main event saw the only match between Inoki and Ric Flair, with Inoki coming out on top. Days before this event, Inoki and the Korean press went to the grave and birthplace of Rikidōzan and paid tribute to him.\n\nInoki's retirement from professional wrestling matches came with the staging of the \"Final Countdown\" series between 1994 and 1998. This was a special series in which Inoki re-lived some of his mixed martial arts matches under professional wrestling rules, as well as rematches of some of his most well known wrestling matches. As part of the Final Countdown tour, Inoki made a rare World Championship Wrestling appearance; defeating WCW World Television Champion Steven Regal in a non-title match at \"Clash of the Champions XXVIII\". Inoki faced Don Frye in the final match of his professional wrestling career.\n\nIn 2005, Yuke's, a Japanese video company, purchased Inoki's controlling 51.5% stock in New Japan.\n\nTwo years later in 2007, Inoki founded a new promotion called Inoki Genome Federation.\nOn February 1, 2010, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) announced on its Japanese website that Inoki would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2010. Inoki was presented with a Hall of Fame certificate by WWE's Ed Wells and stated that he would be attending the WrestleMania XXVI weekend festivities, during which he was inducted by Stan Hansen.\n\nIn 2017, Inoki created a new company, ISM. ISM held its first event on June 24. On March 23, 2018, Inoki left IGF.\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Inoki entered politics in 1989, when he was elected into the House of Councillors as a representative of his own Sports and Peace Party in the Japanese House of Councillors election, 1989.\n\nIn 1990, Inoki traveled to Iraq in \"an unofficial one-man diplomatic mission\" and successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein for the release of Japanese hostages before the outbreak of the Gulf War. It was then that he personally organized a wrestling event in Iraq () for the purpose of freeing the 41 captive Japanese nationals. He subsequently retained his seat in the Japanese House of Councillors election, 1992. He failed to win re-election in the Japanese House of Councillors election, 1995 following a number of scandals reported in 1994, and left politics for the next eighteen years.\nInoki's regular visits to the country have strained his relations with the Japanese Diet where he is a representative.\nOn June 5, 2013, Inoki announced that he would again run for a seat in the Japanese Diet under the Japan Restoration Party ticket. Inoki won the election to return to Japan's Upper House as an MP.\n\nIn November 2013, he was suspended from the Diet for 30 days because of an unauthorized trip to North Korea. He had visited on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the armistice in the Korean War, and had met with senior North Korean figure Kim Yong-nam during his visit. This was Inoki's 27th visit to North Korea; he explained in an interview that the North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens had caused the Japanese government to \"close the door\" on diplomacy with the North, but that the issue would not be resolved without ongoing communication, and that he saw his relationship with North Korean-born Rikidōzan as a crucial link to the people of the North.\n\nHe was reportedly considering running for governor of Tokyo in 2014 following another visit to North Korea.\n\nInoki joined the splinter of the Japanese Restoration Party, Party for Japanese Kokoro, in 2014. In January 2015, he helped to establish a new party named the Assembly to Energize Japan, which he left in 2016, to sit in the 'Independents Club'.\n\nIn September 2017, Inoki re-established his position that Japan should make more of an effort to have co-operative dialogue with North Korea, in the wake of North Korea launching ballistic missiles over Hokkaido. This was succeeded by another of Inoki's controversial trips to the nation.\n\nInoki was married to actress Mitsuko Baisho from 1971 to 1987, and together they had a daughter, Hiroko. Inoki operates a wrestling themed restaurant in Shinjuku, Tokyo named Antonio's Inoki Sakaba Shinjuku.\n\nInoki converted to Shia Islam in 1990 during a pilgrimage to Karbala, the Shiite holy city in Iraq. He was in Iraq negotiating for the release of several Japanese hostages. This was only revealed in 2012, along with the declaration that he had changed his name to Muhammad Hussain Inoki. Inoki has reportedly described himself as both a Muslim convert and a Buddhist.\n\nInoki was amongst the group of professional wrestlers who were tutored in the art of hooking and shooting by the professional wrestler Karl Gotch. Inoki named his method of fighting \"strong style.\" This method of wrestling (which was taught to Inoki by Gotch) borrowed heavily from professional wrestling's original catch wrestling roots, and is one of the most important influences of modern shoot wrestling.\n\nInoki faced many opponents from all dominant disciplines of combat from various parts of the world, such as boxers, judoka, karateka, kung fu practitioners, sumo wrestlers and professional wrestlers. These bouts included a match with then-prominent karate competitor Everett Eddy. Eddy had previously competed in a mixed skills bout against boxer Horst Geisler, losing by knockout. The bout with Eddy ended with the karateka \"knocked out\" by a professional wrestling powerbomb followed by a Hulk Hogan-esque leg drop. Another such match pitted Inoki against 6'7\" Kyokushin karate stylist Willie \"The Bear Killer\" Williams. (So-called because he had allegedly fought a bear for a 1976 Japanese film entitled \"The Strongest Karate 2\"). This bout ended in a doctor stoppage after both competitors repeatedly fell out of the ring. Although many of the matches were rigged and scripted, they are seen as a precursor to modern mixed martial arts. When asked about Inoki's fighting skills, business colleague Carlson Gracie stated Inoki was \"one of the best fighters he'd seen.\"\n\nHis most famous bout was against heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali on June 26, 1976, in Tokyo. Inoki initially promised Ali a rigged match to get him to fight in Japan, but when the deal materialized, Ali's camp feared that Inoki would turn the fight into a shoot, which many believe was Inoki's intention. Ali visited a professional wrestling match involving Inoki and witnessed Inoki's grappling ability. The rules of the match were announced several months in advance. Two days before the match, however, several new rules were added which severely limited the moves that each man could perform. A rule change that had a major effect on the outcome of this match was that Inoki could only throw a kick if one of his knees was on the ground. In the match, Ali landed a total of six punches to Inoki, and Inoki kept to his back in a defensive position almost the full duration of the match of 15 rounds, hitting Ali with a low kick repeatedly. The bout ended in a draw, 3–3. Ali left without a press conference and suffered damage to his legs as a result of Inoki's repeated kicks.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Inoki has promoted a number of MMA events such as \"NJPW: Ultimate Crush\" (which showcased pro wrestling matches and MMA matches on the same card), as well as annual \"Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye\" shows which took place on New Year's Eve in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Some of the major attractions of these events involve the best of NJPW against world-renowned fighters in mixed martial arts matches. Inoki vs. Renzo Gracie was a professional wrestling match that took place at \"Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2000\" against mixed martial artist Renzo Gracie. Inoki was also the ambassador for the International Fight League's Tokyo entry before that promotion's demise.\n\nInoki appears both in the manga and anime \"Tiger Mask\", in a secondary role: in the Japanese series he is the only one who was able to win over Naoto Date, i.e. Tiger Mask, and the two became best friends subsequently.\n\nInoki appeared in the film \"The Bad News Bears Go to Japan\" as himself. A subplot in his scenes involved Inoki seeking a rematch with Ali. Gene LeBell, who also appears in these scenes as a manager of Inoki's scheduled opponent, Mean Bones Beaudine, was the referee of Inoki's match with Ali. Inoki's appearance in the film culminates with a match against the main character, Marvin Lazar (played by Tony Curtis), when Beaudine suddenly becomes unavailable to participate. Professional wrestler Héctor Guerrero served as Curtis's stunt double for the wrestling portions of this scene.\n\nInoki had the starring role in the film \"Acacia\" directed by Jinsei Tsuji.\n\nIn Oh!Great's manga Air Gear, Inoki is regularly referred to by the author, and also the characters as an influence on their fighting style. The manga also makes several less than complimentary references to Inoki's large chin. Along with Inoki, Steve Austin of the World Wrestling Federation has been referred to in Air Gear's pages, often in naming things.\n(This is based on the translation by Tanoshimi Manga, and later by Balantine Books/Del Rey Books. Other translations may omit these references).\n\nThe pro-wrestler character Kanji Igari in the manga (and anime) series Baki the Grappler is based heavily on Inoki. \n\nSeveral episodes of the Japanese comedy show \"Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!\" (most notably 2007's \"Do Not Laugh at the Hospital\" and 2009's \"Do Not Laugh as a Hotel Man\") have included parodies of Inoki. In the former, three \"patients\" are presented as being Inoki, with each imitating Inoki's in-ring persona; while in the latter, the guest known only as \"Shin Onii\" was asked to imitate Inoki as if he were a hotel bellhop.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13730623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13730623", "title": "Armoured flight deck", "text": "Armoured flight deck\n\nAn armoured flight deck is an aircraft carrier flight deck that incorporates substantial armour in its design.\n\nComparison is often made between the carrier designs of the Royal Navy (RN) and the United States Navy (USN). The two navies followed differing philosophies in the use of armour on carrier flight decks, starting with the design of the RN's and ending with the design of the , when the USN also adopted armoured flight decks. The two classes most easily compared are the RN's \"Illustrious\" class and and their nearest USN contemporaries, the and es. The \"Illustrious\" class followed the \"Yorktown\" but preceded the \"Essex\", while the \"Implacable\"-class design predated the \"Essex\" but these ships were completed after the lead ships of the \"Essex\" class. The development of armoured flight deck carriers proceeded during World War II, and before the end of World War II both the USN, with , and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), with and would also commission armoured flight deck carriers, while all USN fleet aircraft carriers built since 1945 feature armoured flight decks. The remainder of the IJN carrier force during World War II had unarmoured flight decks just like the \"Yorktown\" and \"Essex\" classes of the USN.\n\nIn choosing the best design for their carriers, the British had to consider the advantages and disadvantages of hangar design. There was a choice between open or closed hangar and the position of the armour. The placing of the strongest deck affected the strength of the hull. The further apart the deck and the keel, the stronger the design. If the flight deck was placed above the main deck then it had to be built to allow for movement with expansion sections. A closed hangar design was the strongest structurally and made for a lighter hull and the RN carried this concept one step further and designed the armoured flight deck to also act as the strength deck without any underlying plating, thus achieving an armoured flight deck on the lowest possible displacement.\n\nThe carriers that were built with armoured decks fall into two distinct types – those with armour at the flight deck level protecting the hangar and those that only had armour for the lower levels of the ship, typically the hangar deck. The different thickness of armour, and how they were distributed, are described in the table below.\n\nArmour at the flight deck level would protect the hangar deck and the aircraft stored there from most bombs. The armour of the \"Illustrious\" class was intended to protect against 1,000 pound bombs. In the \"Illustrious\" class, the armoured flight deck extended for about two-thirds of the length of the ship, bounded by the two aircraft lifts (which were without the armour). The deck was closed by armoured sides and bulkheads, forming an armoured box. The bulkheads had sliding armoured portals to allow access between the hangar and the aircraft lift. There were lateral strakes of main deck armour that extended from the base of the hangar side-wall to the top of the main side belt. The latter protected the machinery, magazines and aircraft fuel and weaponry stores. The RN's closed and armoured hangars were capable of being environmentally sealed for protection against chemical weapon attack. The armoured design meant that it would have to be attacked with Armour Piercing (AP) bombs, which have much less blast effect than higher-capacity General Purpose (GP) bombs carrying about twice the explosive amount. GP bombs also caused severe hull damage if they exploded in the water close to the hull; AP bombs, much less so. \n\nThe USN open hangar design allowed large numbers of aircraft to be warmed up while inside, theoretically reducing the time required to range and launch a strike, but stowage of fuelled and armed aircraft in an unarmoured hangar was extremely dangerous:\n\nDuring the war, the British fitted immersion heaters to the oil tanks of their aircraft so minimal warm-up was required when they reach the flight deck.\n\nThe US carriers after the Lexington class and the earlier Japanese carriers had their armour placed at the hangar deck, essentially treating the hangar spaces and flight deck as superstructure – making these areas very vulnerable to the blast from GP bombs and other explosions, which in turn caused massive casualties in comparison to RN designs. A bomb that struck the flight deck would likely penetrate and explode in the hangar deck, but the armour there could still protect the ship's vitals – including the engine spaces and fuel storage. The flight deck could also possibly fuze light bombs prematurely, which would reduce the chance of them going through the hangar deck. Such a design allowed for larger, open-sided hangar bays (improving ventilation but making the ship very vulnerable to chemical weapon attack) and the installation of deck-edge elevators. USN carriers with hangar deck armour only, usually had wooden decking over thin mild steel flight decks which were easy to repair. The USN moved the structural strength deck to the flight deck, starting with the which had \"...an enclosed...\" hangar.\n\nAviation fuel delivery and stowage systems were extremely vulnerable. The Royal Navy stowed aviation fuel in cylindrical tanks, that in turn were surrounded by seawater. RN aviation fuel lines were purged with carbon dioxide when not in use. The USN used a similar system, which was further improved after the two navies began exchanging information in 1940. Pre-war USN and IJN carrier designs used a fuel stowage system which was not as secure as that used by the RN, but allowed for much greater stowage capacity. Several USN and IJN carriers were lost due to aviation gas fume explosions.\n\nThe Royal Navy had to be ready to fight a war in the confines of the North Sea and Mediterranean Sea, under the umbrella of land-based enemy air forces. The Royal Navy, with its extensive network of bases and colonies in the Pacific Ocean, had also to be ready to fight in the vast expanses of the Pacific, as did the USN and the IJN, but the USN and IJN did not have to worry about operating in the Mediterranean. The differences in construction were determined by doctrine that was largely driven by the different approaches to the same tactical problem: How to destroy the enemy's aircraft carriers while surviving the inevitable counter strike. Prior to WWII the RN and USN both recognised that the dive bomber could disable the flight decks of enemy aircraft carriers:\n\nThe RN was thus faced with designing a carrier that would be survivable under the conditions to be expected in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific Oceans, and before the development of effective naval radar; these conflicting demands resulted in the development of aircraft carriers whose decks were armoured against 500 lb Armour Piercing bombs and 1000 lb General Purpose bombs. The RN considered that an unarmoured carrier would be unlikely to be able fly off more than one deck load of strike aircraft prior to being attacked so the armoured flight deck carriers accepted a reduction in hangar capacity to the equivalent to one deck load of aircraft. USN, IJN some RN Fleet carriers such as \"Ark Royal\" had sufficient aircraft capacity to allow for two ranges, each equal to a full deck load of strike aircraft. The RN and IJN limited their aircraft carrier's aircraft capacity to the capacity of their hangars, and struck down all aircraft between operations. The USN, typically, used a permanent deck park to augment the capacity of their aircraft carrier's hangars. The use of a permanent deck park appeared to give USN carriers a much larger aircraft capacity than contemporary RN armoured flight deck carriers. The flight deck armour also reduced the length of the flight deck, reducing the maximum aircraft capacity of the armoured flight deck carrier, however the largest part of the disparity between RN and USN carriers in aircraft capacity was due to the use of a permanent deck park on USN carriers.\n\nThe Royal Navy also had the disadvantage that they entered into World War II with the Royal Navy being pitted against large, land based, air-forces whose aircraft also had superior performance to all existing naval aircraft, while the RAF's increased demand for high performance land based aircraft, after the Fall of France, actually retarded the production and development of Fleet Air Arm aircraft. On the other hand, the RN rapidly introduced new technologies, such as radar which enhanced the defensive capability of aircraft carriers. The RN thus had to develop new operational doctrines during the war. The USN, in contrast, was able to benefit from technology transfers from the UK and the wartime experiences of the RN, which was freely shared with the USN, prior to its entry into the war, allowing it to anticipate the changes needed to prepare its carriers for the coming conflict with Japan. The USN designed the armoured flight decks of the \"Midway\"-class carriers based upon an analysis of the effectiveness of RN armoured flight decks. The IJN also benefited from being able to observe the effectiveness of RN aircraft carriers in action, while both the USN and IJN were able to introduce new aircraft types, prior to their entry into World War II.\n\nAll RN fleet carriers had hangar heights, except the two \"Implacable\"-class ships, which had heights, and \"Indomitable\" which had a lower hangar and a upper hangar. The \"Illustrious\" class had a single high hangar that was long. Within the confines of ship design, and the Second London Naval Treaty to which they complied, the \"Indomitable\" and \"Implacable\"-class carriers had to accept a reduction in hangar heights (to keep the metacentric height within acceptable limits) and size, and as a result, had some restriction on aircraft types supplied via Lend-Lease. IJN carriers typically had high hangars, including \"Taihō\" and \"Shinano\". The USN had hangar heights while the \"Yorktown\", \"Wasp\", \"Essex\", and \"Midway\" classes had hangar heights.\n\nThe British approach of armoured flight decks was meant as an effective form of passive defence from bombs and kamikaze attacks that actually struck their carriers, while the American carriers primarily relied on fighters to prevent the carriers from being hit in the first place. In addition, RN carriers such as \"Ark Royal\" or \"Illustrious\" had far heavier anti-aircraft (AA) outfits than their USN counterparts, up to the introduction of the USN \"Essex\"-class carriers. \"Ark Royal\", in 1940, carried 16 x 4.5-inch guns, 32 40mm \"Pom-pom\" and 32 0.5 inch guns against 8 x 5-inch, 16 x 28 mm and 24 x .5-inch guns for \"Enterprise\", in 1940. \"\"In wartime, however, the US Navy found the armoured carriers fascinating. After having examined HMS Formidable in 1940, the US naval attaché commented that, were he crossing the Pacific, he would prefer her to a Yorktown, the closest US equivalent, on the basis that she might carry fewer aircraft, but she would be much more likely to get there\".\" Late in the war when the USN operated many carriers together and had improved radar, their fighter and AA defence was reasonably effective, yet both conventional and kamikaze attacks were still able to penetrate USN defences. \"Bunker Hill\" and \"Franklin\" nearly succumbed in 1945. The larger air groups (80–110 planes, vs. 52–81 for late war British ships) allowed for a more effective combat air patrol (CAP) without reducing strike capability, improving the protection of the whole battle group and lessening the workload of the carrier escorts. Carrier fighters were able to shoot down far more kamikaze aircraft than any amount of deck armour would have protected against showing the value of absolute numbers, but in the early war period IJN aircraft had little difficulty in penetrating USN CAPs; near the end of the war, veteran American fighter pilots in superior F6F Hellcat and F4U Corsair fighters were able to defeat the young, inexperienced and ill-trained kamikaze pilots with ease and run up huge kill scores but attackers were still able to get through. (In addition to larger aircraft complements, the US Navy had larger fleets and more resources, so they could establish destroyer pickets as part of their \"Big blue blanket\" defense system, and develop dedicated AAW ships such as the antiaircraft cruisers which would have also drawn attention away from the carriers.) On the surface, the record seems balanced.\n\nBritish naval historian D.K. Brown put the practical difference between American and British design philosophies in no uncertain terms: \"More fighters would have been better protection than armour,\" but that British designs were good for the circumstances in which they were meant to be used. Yet, even , Britain's newest carrier prior to World War II, never operated close to her theoretical aircraft capacity. Prior to the development of effective radar and high speed monoplane fighters, a successful fighter defence was extremely unlikely for any navy thus calling into doubt D.K. Brown's conclusions. The benefits of flight deck armour were intended to counter these issues. \n\nFewer aircraft meant a lower priority to attack than the more heavily armed American carriers and the RN's operational doctrine dictated smaller airgroups, and the armoured hangar carriers had smaller Avgas and ammunition supplies to match. However, RN carriers carried far more aircraft later in the war, making use of the deck park when they adopted USN style operational doctrine. The 2nd generation RN armoured carriers, \"Indomitable\" and the \"Implacable\" class which had an additional half length lower hangar, were considerably less outmatched by their USN counterparts in the numbers of aircraft operated. The RN operating in harsher weather protected their aircraft from the elements and did not use a permanent deck park in the earlier part of the war. \n\nUS carriers and their fighters shot down more than 1,900 suicide aircraft during \"Operation Kikusui\" (the last and largest Kamikaze attack in the Okinawa campaign), versus a mere 75 for the British, yet both forces suffered the same number of serious hits (four), on their carriers. However the kamikazes made 173 strikes against other USN targets and the 4 USN carriers suffered a massive death toll, in contrast to the relatively light casualties on the RN carriers.\nThe kamikaze threat overall was serious, but Allied defences neutralised it, and many kamikaze strikes missed the deck armour entirely, or bounced off the decks of both British or American carriers. In some cases, kamikazes either struck glancing blows that did only superficial damage that was fixed within minutes or hours, or missed entirely, due to the poor training and poorer flight experience of their pilots. The majority of kamikazes that did inflict harm caused no more damage than they would have against smaller ships. After a successful kamikaze hit, the British were able to clear the flight deck and resume flight operations in just hours, while their American counterparts often could do the same, but not always; in some cases repairs took a few days or even months. The USN liaison officer on commented: \"When a kamikaze hits a U.S. carrier it means 6 months of repair at Pearl [Harbor]. When a kamikaze hits a Limey carrier it’s just a case of \"Sweepers, man your brooms.\"”\n\nAmerican carriers of the \"Essex\" class suffered very high casualties from serious kamikaze hits, though they did survive. The ships were most vulnerable during the period just prior to and during the launching of strikes. Early versions of the design also had a unified ventilation system that would transfer smoke and heat from the hangar deck to the lower decks in the event of a fire. While not a kamikaze attack was attacked by a dive bomber and struck by two bombs, one semi-armour piercing (SAP) and one general purpose (GP), when she had 47 aircraft preparing for a strike on Honshu. Both bombs penetrated into her hangar and set off ordnance and fuel from ruptured aircraft tanks for a planned ground attack relying on GP bombs and \"Tiny Tim\" missiles, killing 724 personnel. was severely damaged by pair of kamikaze hits during preparations for an attack on Okinawa which killed 346 men. Each of these USN carriers suffered more casualties than all the British RN armoured carriers combined, illustrating the life saving features of RN carrier design. \"Illustrious\", which had the highest toll, suffered 126 fatal casualties and 84 wounded when hit by six 1100 lb bombs on 10 January 1941. The USN studied the superior defensive qualities of Royal Navy armoured carriers and this analysis is partly revealed in the damage report following the attack on on 13 March 1945:\n\nPaul Silverstone in US warships of World War II notes regarding US carriers that,'vast damage was often caused by suicide planes (Kamikaze) crashing through the wooden flight decks into the hangar below'. Whereas in British carriers 'the steel flight decks showed their worth against Kamikaze attacks.'\n\nThe only Allied carrier lost to a deck hit was the American light carrier, . Indeed, many light and escort carriers were unarmoured, with no protection on the hangar or flight deck, and thus they fared poorly against deck hits.\n\nWhat was not discovered until late in the war was that the kamikaze impacts proved to have a long-term effect on the structural integrity of some British carriers. Their postwar life was shortened, as the RN had a surplus of carriers with many in shipyards being constructed. The USN rebuilt carriers such as \"Franklin\" that had been completely gutted and the crew decimated by IJN attacks. was an excellent example of this; while she weathered a severe kamikaze hit in 1945 which cratered her deck armour, the hit caused severe internal structural damage and permanently warped the hull (damage worsened in a postwar aircraft-handling accident wherein a Vought Corsair rolled off a lift and raked the hangar deck with 20mm cannon fire, causing a severe fire); but plans to rebuild her as per \"Victorious\" were abandoned due to budget cuts, not structural damage, and she lingered in reserve until 1956 before being towed off to the breakers. However, no citation is ever given for this accident which appears to be a distorted fabrication of Formidable's May 18, 1945, hangar fire. She carried no air group post war, and never carried the 20 mm Corsair. The Royal Navy planned to rebuild most of the armoured carriers in the early postwar period:\n\n\"Illustrious\" suffered a similar battering, especially off of Malta in 1941 when hit by German dive bombers and late in the war was limited to 22 knots (41 km/h) because her centreline shaft was disabled due to accumulated wartime damage; she spent five years as a training and trials carrier (1948–53) and was disposed of in 1954. \"Indomitable\" was completely refit to like-new condition, only to suffer a severe gasoline explosion on board, which caused \"considerable structural and electrical damage to the ship\". \"Indomitable\" was refitted between 1948 and 1950 and served as flagship of the Home Fleet then served a tour of duty in the Mediterranean, where she was damaged by the petrol explosion. She was partially repaired before proceeding under her own power to Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 Coronation Review, before being placed in reserve in 1954. \"Indomitable\" was scrapped in 1956. The explosion which occurred on \"Indomitable\"s hangar deck, while severe, would also have caused severe casualties and extensive damage to an \"Essex\"-class carrier, several of which returned to service after hangar explosions, primarily due to the USN's considerable financial and material resources. The postwar Royal Navy could only afford to rebuild \"Victorious\" and had to abandon plans to rebuild four other armoured carriers due to cost, and to provide crews to man the postwar built carriers, such as , due to reductions in manpower.\n\nAnother factor is the advantage in resources that the US Navy had over the Royal Navy. The numerous and capacious American yards on the East and West Coasts allowed the US Navy to build and repair carriers at a more leisurely pace and higher quality individually, while producing ships collectively at a furious rate. The British with their strained facilities were forced to rush repairs (indeed the overloaded British shipyards had forced some vessels to be sent to the US for repairs) and some ships such as \"Illustrious\", were forced into service even though not fully repaired. The RN was in a state of continual contraction after WWII, and simply did not have the resources or inclination to repair ships that it could no longer man.\n\nWhile flight deck level armour was eventually adopted by the Americans for the design, the strength deck remained on the hangar level. \"Midway\" had originally been planned to have a very heavy gun armament (8-inch weapons). The removal of these weapons freed up enough tonnage to add of armour at the flight deck level. While this made a great deal of sense from an air group perspective, the \"Midway\" ships sat very low in the water for carriers (due to their much greater displacement), certainly much lower than the smaller \"Essex\"-class carriers, and had a great deal of difficulty operating in heavy seas. Flight deck armoured ships almost universally (except for the \"Midway\" class as completed) possessed a hurricane bow, where the bows were sealed up to the flight deck; wartime experience demonstrated that ships with the hurricane bow configuration (also including the American \"Lexington\" class) shipped less water than ships with an open bow. Late-life refits to \"Midway\" to bulge her hull and improve freeboard instead gave her a dangerously sharp roll, and made flight operations difficult even in moderate seas. This was therefore not repeated on \"Coral Sea\" (\"Franklin D. Roosevelt\" had been decommissioned years earlier). After the war, most of the \"Essex\"-class ships were modified with a hurricane bow and in the case of \"Oriskany\" the wooden flight deck surface was replaced with aluminium for improved resistance against the blast of jet engines, making them appear to have armoured flight decks, but in fact their armour remained at hangar level.\n\nThe supercarriers of the postwar era, starting with the — nearly longer and wider in the beam than their World War II counterparts – would eventually be forced to move the strength deck up to the flight deck level as a result of their great size; a shallow hull of those dimensions became too impractical to continue. The issue of protection had no influence on the change; the \"Forrestal\" class had an armoured flight deck of at least 1.5\" thickness. Some of the follow on classes to the \"Forrestal\"s also had armoured flight decks although deck armour is of little to no use against modern anti-ship missiles, it may help limit the damage from flight deck explosions. The experience of World War II caused the USN to change their design policy in favour of armoured flight decks:\n\n"}

The first volume appeared in March 1907 and the last three volumes appeared in 1912, followed by a master index volume in 1914 and later supplementary volumes. It was designed \"to give its readers full and authoritative information on the entire cycle of Catholic interests, action and doctrine\".\n\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" was published by the Robert Appleton Company (RAC), a publishing company incorporated at New York in February 1905 for the express purpose of publishing the encyclopedia. The five members of the encyclopedia's Editorial Board also served as the directors of the company. In 1912 the company's name was changed to The Encyclopedia Press. Publication of the encyclopedia's volumes was the sole business conducted by the company during the project's lifetime.\n\nThe encyclopedia was designed to serve the Roman Catholic Church, concentrating on information related to the Church and explaining matters from the Catholic point of view. It records the accomplishments of Catholics and others in nearly all intellectual and professional pursuits, including artists, educators, poets and scientists. While more limited in focus than other general encyclopedias, it was far broader in scope than previous efforts at comprehensive Catholic encyclopedias, which had studied only internal Church affairs.\n\nIt offers in-depth portrayals of historical and philosophical ideas, persons and events, from a Catholic perspective, including issues that divide Catholicism from Protestantism and other faith communities. Since the encyclopedia was first published starting in 1907 and has never been updated (versus the \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\"), many of its entries may be out of date either with respect to the wider culture or to the Catholic ecclesiastical world. In particular, it predates the creation of the Vatican City State (1929) and the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), which introduced many significant changes in Catholic practice: For example, the online version of the entries on Judaism and Islam at newadvent.org states in an editorial note: \"To complement this article, which was taken from the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia, New Advent recommends a prayerful reading of 'Nostra Aetate' from the Second Vatican Council.\"\n\nThe writing of the encyclopedia began on January 11, 1905, under the supervision of five editors:\n\nThe first edition was initially printed by Robert Appleton Company. The volumes came out sequentially the first two in 1907 and the last three in 1912:\nThe editors had their first editorial meeting at the office of \"The Messenger\", on West 16th Street, New York City. The text received a \"nihil obstat\" from an official censor, Remy Lafort, on November 1, 1908 and an imprimatur from John Murphy Farley, Archbishop of New York. This review process was presumably accelerated by the reuse of older authorized publications. In addition to frequent informal conferences and constant communication by letters, the editors subsequently held 134 formal meetings to consider the plan, scope and progress of the work, culminating in publication on April 19, 1913. A first supplement was published in 1922; a second supplement in nine loose-leaf sections was published by The Gilmary Society between 1950 and 1958.\n\nIn 1912, a special completely illustrated commemorative volume was awarded to those patrons who contributed to the start of the enterprise by buying multiple encyclopedia sets early on.\n\nThere was controversy over the presence of the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" in public libraries in the United States with nativist protests that this violated the separation of church and state, including a successful appeal in Belleville, New Jersey.\n\nThe encyclopedia was later updated under the auspices of The Catholic University of America and a 17-volume \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" was first published in 1967, and then in 2002.\n\n\"The Catholic Encyclopedia and its makers\" states that:\n\nThe work is entirely new, and not merely a translation or a compilation from other encyclopedic sources. The editors have insisted that the articles should contain the latest and most accurate information to be obtained from the standard works on each subject.\n\nHowever, \"from standard works\" allows that some of the articles from European contributors such as Pierre Batiffol (French), Johann Peter Kirsch (German) had previously been published in whole or in part in Europe and were translated and edited for the Encyclopedia. Those who wrote new articles in English include Anthony Maas and Herbert Thurston.\n\nUnder copyright law of the United States, all works published in the United States before 1923 are in the public domain. In 1993, Kevin Knight, then a 26-year-old resident of Denver, Colorado, decided, during the visit of Pope John Paul II to that city for World Youth Day, to launch a project to publish the 1913 edition of the encyclopedia on the Internet. Knight founded the Web site New Advent to host the undertaking. Volunteers from the United States, Canada, France, and Brazil helped in the transcription of the original material. The site went online in 1995, and transcription work ended in 1997.\n\nIn 2007, Catholic Answers published a watermarked version derived from page scans. This version has since been replaced with a transcription of the \"Encyclopedia\" similar to that found at the New Advent site. The Catholic Answers transcription, however, is an exact transcription of the original text, whereas the New Advent version at times modernizes certain words (e.g., using the names of Old Testament books found in modern Bibles, such as \"1 & 2 Chronicles\" and \"Obadiah\", in place of the Vulgate/Douay–Rheims titles, such as \"1 & 2 Paralipomenon\" and \"Abdias\") and Biblical citation formatting (i.e., the Catholic Answers version retains the original's usage of Roman numerals for chapter numbers [e.g., Genesis i, 1], while the New Advent version uses Arabic numerals throughout [e.g., Genesis 1:1]).\n\nOther scanned copies of the 1913 Encyclopedia are available on Google Books, at the Internet Archive, and at Wikimedia Commons. Wikisource also hosts a transcription project backed by the scans hosted at Commons.\n\nThe 1922 supplement to the Encyclopedia is also in the public domain and is available online. The \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\" also is available online at some libraries.\n\n\n"}

The list's release was met with strong criticism from the US and British governments, while media and other countries have reacted less strongly saying that the entries are not secret and easily identified.\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), it \"Developed and executed the Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) which extends our protection strategy overseas to include important foreign infrastructure that if attacked or destroyed would critically impact the U.S. The prioritized National Critical Foreign Dependencies List (NCFDL) currently contains over 300 assets and systems in over 50 countries.\" According to the 2009 National Infrastructure Protection Plan, the CFDI was launched by the federal government \"working in close coordination and cooperation with the private sector\" in 2007 \"to identify assets and systems located outside the United States, which, if disrupted or destroyed, would critically affect public health and safety, the economy, or national security. The resulting strategic compendium guides engagement with foreign countries in the CIKR [critical infrastructure and key resources] protection mission area\". Using an initial inventory of infrastructure located outside the United States created by the federal government, DHS and the Department of State (DOS) developed the CFDI, \"a process designed to ensure that the resulting classified list of critical foreign dependencies is representative and leveraged in a coordinated and inclusive manner.\"\n\nDevelopment of the CFDI was planned in three phases, on an annual and ongoing basis. The first phase was identification, beginning with \"the first-ever National Critical Foreign\nDependencies List in FY2008\". This was done by the DHS working with \"other Federal partners\", in a process that \"includes input from public and private sector CIKR community partners.\" Next comes prioritization, in which \"DHS, in collaboration with other CIKR community partners and, in particular, DOS, prioritized the National Critical Foreign Dependencies List based on factors such as the overall criticality of the CIKR to the United States and the willingness and capability of foreign partners to engage in collaborative risk management activities.\" The third \"involves leveraging the prioritized list to guide current and future U.S. bilateral\nand multilateral incident and risk management activities with foreign partners. DHS and DOS established mechanisms to ensure coordinated engagement and collaboration by public entities, in partnership with the private sector.\"\n\nThe \"2008 Critical Foreign Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) list\" was contained in a February 2009 diplomatic cable to the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, which was leaked, redacted and released in the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks in 2010. The BBC described it as \"one of the most sensitive\" leaks as of 6 December 2010. In its redaction process, WikiLeaks removed only a minority of the details of names and locations, and left the rest uncensored; details of the exact location of the assets were not included in the list. The list did not include any military facilities, but rather facilities important for the global supply chain, global communications, and economically important goods and services.\n\nIn the cable the State Department asked American diplomats to identify installations overseas \"whose loss could critically impact the public health, economic security, and/or national and homeland security of the United States.\" The order was under the direction of the Department for Homeland Security in co-ordination with the Department of State.\n\nIn summary the list consists of Submarine communications cables, major port hubs, critical sea lanes, oil pipelines, mines, dams, and pharmaceutical facilities. A major emphasis on European pharmaceutical facilities was said by the BBC to suggest a fear of biological warfare or global pandemic.\n\nThe cable had been classified secret and not for review by non-U.S. personnel. The publication of the cable was followed by strong criticism from the US government and the British government, but a tepid response from news outlets and other foreign nations.\n\nWikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said with reference to the cable: \"This further undermines claims made by the US Government that its embassy officials do not play an intelligence-gathering role. Part of the cable read: \"Posts are not/not being asked to consult with host governments with respect to this request.\" Hrafnsson later explained to \"The Times\" that the list itself \"had been made available to 2.5 million people including military personnel and private contractors by the U.S. government\". He went on to say: \"in terms of security issues, while this cable details the strategic importance of assets across the world, it does not give any information as to their exact locations, security measures, vulnerabilities or any similar factors, though it does reveal the U.S. asked its diplomats to report back on these matters.\"\n\nUS State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley denounced the disclosure saying it \"gives a group like al-Qaeda a targeting list.\" Anthony Cordesman, a 'national security analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies', said: \"this has given a global map – a menu, if not a recipe book – to every extremist group in the world. To me it would be amazing to see how WikiLeaks could rationalize this.\" However, Alistair Millar, 'director of the Center on Global Counterterrorism Cooperation', said: \"it's a little different...than with diplomatic cable leaks...in this case, this is largely information available to everyone if they really wanted to look.\"\n\nJanet Napolitano, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said the list \"could jeopardize our national security\".\n\nA spokesman for British prime minister David Cameron said: \"The leaks and their publication are damaging to national security in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. It is vital that governments are able to operate on the basis of confidentiality of information.\"\n\nVic Toews, the Public Safety Minister of Canada, seemed \"unconcerned or unaware\" of the release of the list. He said: \"I don't follow gossip very much so I don't really know the impact of WikiLeaks, but I can assure you that the security agencies in Canada are following it very closely and to the extent that I need to be involved and address those issues, they will brief me on the issues.\"\n\nLin Yu-fang, a politician in Taiwan, stated, in regards to the revealing of the six undersea telecommunications cables in China, there are \"actually no secrets concerning the cables\", but he said there \"could be certain thorny political or military issues involving Taiwan, the U.S. or Japan if more sensitive secrets were exposed\".\n\nA CBS article elaborating on the release stated that \"although much of the information contained [in the list] was already in the public domain, officials in Washington and London have been quick to condemn WikiLeaks for publishing it, calling the act evidence of the organization's willingness to potentially aid terror groups in its mission to reveal U.S. secrets.\" The \"New York Times\" stated that the list \"appears largely limited to sites that any would-be terrorist with Internet access and a bit of ingenuity might quickly have identified.\"\n\nThe \"Lancashire Evening Post\" pointed out in an article that the list \"contains information on defence sites in Lancashire which is more than five years out of date.\" The article specifically pointed out that the \"Royal Ordnance (RO) site at Chorley...has been developed as Buckshaw Village for the past five years\" and the \"BAE facility in Plymouth, Devon...[was] sold as part of a deal three years ago.\"\n\nMayne Pharma told the \"Herald-Sun\" that \"its entry on a classified diplomatic cable is out-of-date and full of errors\", since the drug listed on the cable as its resource, a snake anti-venom, hasn't been made by the company for \"more than ten years\".\n\nRoger Aston, the chief executive of Mayne Pharma, said: \"I can only go on what I can see now in the media (about WikiLeaks) but judging from what I've seen about what they've said about Mayne Pharma and Faulding, a lot of it (the information) is old, out of date stuff that's not relevant.\"\n\nDean Veverka of Southern Cross concurred, saying, \"(Roger Aston's comments) that the information in the WikiLeaks document was ten years out of date could be accurate. To only list Southern Cross as the only internet cable network here might have been relevant 10 years ago (when only coaxial cables were available), but Australia now has seven cables going out of country. Australia has a very resilient network nowadays.\"\n\nBill Gorman, sales director of David Brown Ltd., said: \"We make gearboxes for our platinum and gold mines. We have supplied equipment via the US for other countries, but have only once exported directly to the States, for a copper mine seven years ago. I have no idea why we're on the list.\"\n\nA BAE Systems spokeswoman said: \"The information in the list was incorrect. The site in Plymouth was sold in 2007, and in Chorley, there are no longer any weapons manufacturing, although there is still an office there. The information about Preston was correct. The safety and security of our people and facilities is of highest priority.\"\n\nThe 2008 CFDI list, as redacted by WikiLeaks, listed the following infrastructures:\n\nA number of sea ports were listed, including several Chinese ports (Shanghai Port, Guangzhou Port, Hong Kong Port, Ningbo Port, Tianjin Port) as well as one Taiwanese port (Kaohsiung Port) and several European ports (Port of Antwerp, Port of Hamburg, Rotterdam Port).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His uncle, Billy Gates, was a booking agent for Chicago promoter Fred Kohler. After Chicago, he worked in Detroit until 1964. He then worked on and off in Australia under Jim Barnett until 1974 when he relocated with Barnett to Atlanta becoming involved in Georgia Championship Wrestling. After Georgia, he worked in Florida in 1975 managing Pak Song Nam.\n\nOn February 20, 1975, Hart and wrestlers Austin Idol and Bobby Shane were passengers on a Cessna 182 flown by wrestler Buddy Colt, which crashed into Tampa Bay in Florida, killing Shane.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he became a manager called \"Playboy\" Gary Hart. During the late 1960s, he managed The Spoiler, as well as the tag team duo The Spoilers, which consisted of Spoilers #1 (Don Jardine) and #2 (Smasher Sloan). They won several tag team titles in 1968 and 1969 under Hart's guidance.\n\nHart became the booker for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW; then known as Big Time Wrestling) in 1976, a position he held until January 1983, then again from 1986-1988. The years between 1982 and 1985 are considered to be the \"Golden Years\" of the promotion. Hart created the classic feud between the Von Erichs and the Fabulous Freebirds, as well as forming The Stable of H. & H. Ltd in 1982 with Arman Hussian that introduced characters (Bugsy McGraw, Bill Irwin, Checkmate, Killer Brooks and Ten Gu) thought he also managed the Great Muta, the One Man Gang and the Samoan Swat Team. Hart additionally managed talent such as \"Gorgeous\" Gino Hernandez and Gentleman Chris Adams. Along with booking, he also managed Nord the Barbarian, Abdullah The Butcher, Al Perez and Jeep Swenson under the stable \"New Age Management\".\n\nDuring World Class' golden era, Hart was also a manager in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic regions of the NWA; joining these two areas exclusively in 1983 shortly after the start of the Freebirds-Von Erichs feud, when he left World Class due to a pay dispute. Hart returned to Texas in the summer of 1984 and following a short hiatus in 1986; stayed with the federation until 1988. Hart was also a promoter and manager in San Antonio for Texas All-Star Wrestling, the successor of Joe Blanchard's Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW) group. He also worked for the ICW, first as the heel manager of Bruiser Brody, Kevin Sullivan and Mark Lewin. During one storyline, Hart had a falling out with Sullivan, after which Lewin attacked Hart with a sleeper hold.\n\nShortly after the folding of WCCW, Hart continued to manage Al Perez in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Jim Crockett Promotions in 1988, along with Larry Zbyszko. In 1989, he managed the stable J-Tex Corporation, which included Terry Funk, Dick Slater, Buzz Sawyer, The Dragonmaster, and The Great Muta. They feuded primarily with Ric Flair and Sting, but Ole and Arn Anderson later teamed up with Flair and Sting to even the sides up (and thus bringing back The Four Horseman briefly). J-Tex disbanded in early 1990.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Hart returned to Texas and began a new wrestling promotion in North Dallas, the Texas Wrestling Federation, which showcased many former stars of World Class and those who are competing in the USWA/World Class promotion.\n\nDuring the 1990s, following the demise of the Global Wrestling Federation, Hart and Chris Adams were involved in many Texas-based wrestling promotions, including an ill-fated attempt to revive World Class (billed as World Class II: The Next Generation) at the Dallas Sportatorium. Hart retired in 1999, but made a surprise return in Major League Wrestling (MLW), during the promotion's \"Reloaded Tour\" on January 9–10, 2004. Hart appeared following the main event (on January 9) pitting Low Ki against Homicide, where the three laid out several wrestlers from the locker room, as well MLW president Court Bauer.\n\nHart died on March 16, 2008, following a heart attack at his home in Euless, Texas, after returning from an autograph session in Pennsylvania. On April 5, 2008, Peach State Pandemonium, an internet wrestling program, aired a two-hour tribute program in the memory of Hart. \"Cowboy\" Bill Watts, Jack Brisco, James Beard, Abdullah The Butcher, Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes, Kevin Sullivan, George Steele, Skandor Akbar, and Jim Ross were among those who attended. Following his death, his autobiography, \"My Life In Wrestling...With A Little Help From My Friends\", was released on June 30, 2009 but is now out of print.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20941535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20941535", "title": "Giantess", "text": "Giantess\n\nA giantess is a female giant: either a mythical being resembling a woman of superhuman size and strength or a human woman of exceptional stature, often the result of some medical or genetic abnormality (see gigantism).\n\nThe Titanides, sisters and children of Titans, may not have originally been seen as giants, but later Hellenistic poets and Latin ones tended to blur Titans and Giants. In a surviving fragment of Naevius' poem on the Punic war, he describes the Gigantes Runcus and Purpureus (Porphyrion):\nEduard Fraenkel remarks of these lines, with their highly unusual plural \"Atlantes\", \"It does not surprise us to find the names \"Titani\" and \"Gigantes\" employed indiscriminately to denote the same mythological creatures, for we are used to the identification, or confusion, of these two types of monsters which, though not original, had probably become fairly common by the time of Naevius\".\nOther giantesses in Greek myth include Periboea, the princess of the giants that participated in the Gigantomachy, and the queen and princess of the Laestrygonians who participated in the attacking and devouring of Odysseus' crew.\n\nGrid was a giantess who saved Thor's life. She was aware of Loki's plans to get Thor killed at the hands of the giant Geirrod and sets out to help him by supplying him with a number of magical gifts. These gifts were: a girdle of might, a pair of magical iron gloves, and a magical wand.\n\nThe giantess Gerd was very beautiful and her brilliant, naked arms illuminated air and sea. Freyr fell in love at first sight and the account of her wooing is given in the poem Skirnismál. She never wanted to marry Freyr, and refused his proposals (delivered through Skirnir, his messenger) even after he brought her eleven golden apples and Draupnir. Skirnir finally threatened to use Freyr's sword to cover the earth in ice and she agreed to marry Freyr. She became the mother of the mythic Swedish king Fjölnir.\n\nSkaði journeyed to Ásgard to avenge her father Þjazi, whom the gods had killed. She agreed that she would have that renounced if they allowed her to choose a husband among them and if they succeeded in making her laugh. The gods allowed her to choose a husband, but she had to choose him only from his feet; she choose Njord because his feet were so beautiful that she thought he was Baldr. Then Loki succeeded in making her laugh, so peace was made, and Odin made two stars from Þjazi's eyes.\n\nAfter a while, she and her husband separated, because she loved the mountains (Þrymheimr), while he wanted to live near the sea (Noatun). The Ynglinga saga says that later she became wife of Odin, and had many sons by him.\n\nAt Baldr's funeral, his burning ship was set to sea by Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.\n\nUpon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger Hermod, Hel promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. And all did, except a giantess, Thokk, who refused to mourn the slain god. And thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarok, when he and his brother Hod would be reconciled and rule the new Earth together with Thor's sons.\n\nGiantesses are fairly common in Indian mythology. The demoness Putana (who attempted to kill the baby Krishna with poisoned milk from her breasts) is usually drawn as a giantess.\n\nGiantesses are common in the folklore of Ireland and the British Isles, particularly Scotland and Wales. They were often depicted as loving and beautiful people and, in later versions of myths, seemed to resemble Vikings, who had raided the coasts, in appearance. A notable giantess in Irish mythology is Bébinn.\n\nIn Lewis Carroll's story \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", there are several scenes where the heroine Alice grows to giant size by means of eating something (like a cake or a mushroom). Similarly Arthur C. Clarke's story \"Cosmic Casanova\" describes an astronaut's revulsion at discovering that an extraterrestrial female he adored on a video screen is in fact thirty feet tall.\n\nSize-changing heroines have appeared in such comics as \"Doom Patrol\", \"Mighty Avengers\", \"Marvel Adventures Avengers\", \"Team Youngblood\", and \"Femforce\". In the latter series, the giantess-superheroines Tara and Garganta combine immense size and strength with beauty and femininity, and have a cult following among both men and women. Conversely, size-changing villainesses, such as Wonder Woman foe Giganta, use their strength and beauty for less altruistic purposes as a weapon to crush their foes. Giantesses are also common in the manga and anime mediums of Japan. She-Hulk's nickname is \"The Jade Giantess\", due to the main character growing in size and more powerful when becoming She-Hulk.\n\nThe giantess also appears in modern-day art, illustration and fashion. UK based illustrator Emma Melton has used the giantess as a symbol in her illustrated fashion line 'Blessed by a Giantess', which aims to promote healthy body image in young girls and spread the message that 'We are all beautiful.\n\nThe giantess theme has also appeared in motion pictures, often as a metaphor for female empowerment or played for absurd humor. The 1958 B-movie \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\" formed part of a series of size-changing films of the era which also included \"The Incredible Shrinking Man\", \"The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock\", and \"Village of the Giants\". The 1993 remake of \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\", starring Daryl Hannah in the title role, was advertised as a comedy; many scenes did parody earlier size-changing movies (most notably \"The Amazing Colossal Man)\", although the central theme was feminist. The heroine Nancy, formerly a cipher to her domineering father and husband, is empowered by her new-found size and starts to take control of her destiny, and encourages other women to do the same. Both versions of the movie enjoy a cult following.\n\nMore recent movies with giantess themes are \"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\" (1992), \"Malèna\" (2000), \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" (2000), \"Hable con ella\" a.k.a. \"Talk to Her\" (2002), \"Ella Enchanted\" (2004), \"The Ant Bully (2006), \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" (2009) and \"Roger Corman's Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader\" (2012). In \"Malèna\", there is a scene where the young protagonist, Renato Amoroso, fantasizes about being a few inches tall and having Monica Bellucci (Malena), pick him up and take him to her bosom. In \"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\", after Adam grew 112 feet tall and had been wandering through Las Vegas, Diane Szalinski, who was the wife of Wayne Szalinski and mother of Adam, asked her husband to enlarge her so she can hug Adam and prevent Hendrickson from harming her son. As she was exposed to electrical waves, Diane became a 120 foot tall giantess, but later returns to her normal size with her son Adam at her side.\n\nIn \"Dude, Where's My Car?\", five nubile female characters morph into an extraterrestrial 20 foot tall giantess played by Jodi Ann Paterson (Playboy Playmate of the Year 2000) who picks up one of the characters and eats him. \"Talk to Her\" features a sequence in the style of early silent cinema called 'The Shrinking Lover,' where an accidentally shrunken scientist is rescued from his mother's clutches by his lover, who carries him home in her handbag. The shrunken scientist then roams his lover's body while she lies in bed. \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" features a satirization of \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\" in which the main protagonist, Susan Murphy, is clobbered by a radioactive meteor that causes her to grow up to 49 feet, 11½ inches, becoming Ginormica. In The Ant Bully, Lucas and the ants escape down the kitchen sink drain, believing that Tiffany is a giantess as she walks into the kitchen with her sandals on her feet and crushing an ant. In \"Roger Corman's Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader\", Cassie Stradford, a college student of Iron Coast University, steals the drug and injects herself with it to make her very pretty. However, the drug had a really big side effect when she starts to grow taller and taller until she is a 50 foot tall giantess. When Brittany discovers this, she tried to seduce Kyle into giving it to her. Even when Kyle was trying to prevent her from knowing, she was accidentally injected with more of the drug than Cassie and growing into a 75 foot tall giantess. After a brief catfight, Cassie injected the antidote into Brittany, making her shrink into a dwarf.\n\nOutside of Hollywood, giantesses have also appeared in special interest films. AC Comics giantess Garganta is featured in a live action DVD movie available from accomics.com entitled \"Gargantarama\", which also includes giantess scenes from many movies as well as the feature length 1958 B-movie \"Attack of the 50 Foot Woman\". Embracing the use of the giantess in popular culture, AC has made it a frequently recurring theme in their products.\n\nGiantesses have also appeared in advertisement campaigns, with similar erotic/humorous intent. In 2003, a commercial for the Italian company Puma featured the theme. The giantess, played by model/actress Valentina Biancospino, stomps around town causing havoc and swallowing a man whole before finally picking up a man (played by Italian footballer Gianluigi Buffon) and kissing him. The following year, Lee Dungarees commercials used the giantess theme alongside the slogan \"Whatever Happens, Don't Flinch,\" hiring model Natalia Adarvez to play a 90 foot tall giantess. Also that same year, Victoria Silvstedt (1997 Playboy Playmate of the Year) posed as a giantess for an advertisement for Max Power London, a car show held in London in November 2004. In the February 12th, 2005 edition of the UK newspaper, \"The Sun\", Miss Silvstedt again posed as a giantess of Godzilla height next to various London landmarks. In a CSL ad, actress Claire Forlani appeared as a 98 foot tall giantess walking around the city of London and meets a giant, who is the same height as her.\n\nGiantesses have also appeared in some television series such as \"Genie in the House\", \"Snorks\", \"Schoolhouse Rock\", \"The Electric Company\", \"The Muppet Show\", \"Dexter's Laboratory\", \"Animaniacs\", \"Toonsylvania\" episode in \"Attack of the Fifty Footed Woman\", \"Totally Spies!\" episode in \"Attack Of The 50 Ft Mandy\", \"Phineas and Ferb\", and \"The 7D\". The \"Snorks\" episode \"The Littlest Mermaid\" features a scene where a mermaid grows into a giantess caused by a machine. The \"Schoolhouse Rock\" episode \"Unpack Your Adjectives\" includes a scene where a tall girl grows into a 34 foot giantess, causing only her legs and sandals to be seen. She then stomps on a small boy who wouldn't stop laughing at how tall she grew. In the first episode of \"The Electric Company\", Judy Graubart grows into a giantess while holding up a sign for the kid audience to read that says \"giant\". In the \"Dexter's Laboratory\" episode \"The Big Sister\", Dee Dee becomes a 65 foot giantess after eating an experimental cookie. The \"Animaniacs\" character Katie Ka-Boom sometimes grew giant sized before she turned into a monster. In the \"Phineas and Ferb\" episode \"Attack of the 50 Foot Sister\", Candace Flynn grows into a giantess after she uses some of Phineas and Ferb's growth potion. In the episode \"Pony Tale\" of \"Genie in the House\", Max's niece Louise gets left with the girls, and when she learned of the genie's existence, she made a wish of wanting to get big, in which the genie was forced to accept her command and made her into 55 foot tall giantess for a brief time.\n\nThe giantess theme occasionally manifests in music videos as well, notably Pamela Anderson's role as a giantess in the video Miserable for the rock group Lit. In the video, the band members perform on Anderson's body and are eventually devoured by her at the end, a metaphor for women as \"maneaters\".\n"}
{"id": "87030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87030", "title": "Glottochronology", "text": "Glottochronology\n\nGlottochronology (from Attic Greek γλῶττα \"tongue, language\" and χρóνος \"time\") is the part of lexicostatistics dealing with the chronological relationship between languages.\n\nThe idea was developed by Morris Swadesh under two assumptions: that there does, indeed, exist a relatively stable \"basic vocabulary\" (referred to as \"Swadesh lists\") in all languages of the world; and that any replacements happen in a way analogous to radioactive decay, in constant percentages per time elapsed. Meanwhile, there exist many different methods, partly extensions of the Swadesh method, now more and more under the biological assumptions of replacements in genes. However, Swadesh's technique is so well known that, for many people, 'glottochronology' refers to it alone.\n\nThe original method presumed that the core vocabulary of a language is replaced at a constant (or constant average) rate across all languages and cultures, and can therefore be used to measure the passage of time. The process makes use of a list of lexical terms. Lists were compiled by Morris Swadesh and assumed to be resistant against borrowing (originally designed in 1952 as a list of 200 items; however, the refined 100 word list in Swadesh (1955) is much more common among modern day linguists). This core vocabulary was designed to encompass concepts common to every human language (such as personal pronouns, body parts, heavenly bodies, verbs of basic actions, numerals 'one' and 'two', etc.), eliminating concepts that are specific to a particular culture or time. It has been found that this ideal is not in fact possible and that the meaning set may need to be tailored to the languages being compared. Many alternative word lists have been compiled by other linguists, often using fewer meaning slots.\n\nThe percentage of cognates (words that have a common origin) in these word lists is then measured. The larger the percentage of cognates, the more recently the two languages being compared are presumed to have separated.\n\nRobert Lees obtained a value for the \"glottochronological constant\" (r) of words by considering the known changes in 13 pairs of languages using the 200 word list. He obtained a value of 0.805 ± 0.0176 with 90% confidence. For the 100 word list Swadesh obtained a value of 0.86, the higher value reflecting the elimination of semantically unstable words. This constant may be related to the retention rate of words by:-\n\nwhere \"L\" is the rate of replacement, ln is the logarithm to base e, and \"r\" is the glottochronological constant\n\nThe basic formula of glottochronology in its shortest form is:-\n\nwhere \"t\" = a given period of time from one stage of the language to another, \"c\" = proportion of wordlist items retained at the end of that period, and \"L\" = rate of replacement for that word list.\n\nOne can also therefore formulate that:\n\nBy testing historically verifiable cases where we have knowledge of \"t\" through non-linguistic data (e. g. the approximate distance from Classical Latin to modern Romance languages), Swadesh arrived at the empirical value of approximately 0.14 for \"L\" (meaning that the rate of replacement constitutes around 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium).\n\nGlottochronology was found to work in the case of Indo-European, accounting for 87% of the variance. It is also postulated to work for Hamito-Semitic (Fleming 1973), Chinese (Munro 1978) and Amerind (Stark 1973; Baumhoff and Olmsted 1963). For the latter, correlations have been obtained with radiocarbon dating and blood groups as well as archaeology.\nNote that the approach of Gray and Atkinson, as they say, has nothing to do with \"glottochronology\".\n\nThe concept of language change is old, and its history is reviewed in Hymes (1973) and Wells (1973). Glottochronology itself dates back to the mid-20th century. An introduction to the subject is given in Embleton (1986) and in McMahon and McMahon (2005).\n\nGlottochronology has been controversial ever since, partly owing to issues of accuracy, as well as the question of whether its basis is sound (see e.g. Bergsland 1958; Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Fodor 1961; Chretien 1962; Guy 1980). These concerns have been addressed by Dobson et al. (1972), Dyen (1973) and Kruskal, Dyen and Black (1973). The assumption of a single-word replacement rate can distort the divergence-time estimate when borrowed words are included (Thomason and Kaufman 1988). Chrétien purported to disprove the mathematics of the Swadesh-model. At a conference at Yale in 1971 his criticisms were shown to be invalid. See the published proceedings under Dyen (1973) The same conference saw the application of the theory to Creole language (Wittmann 1973).\nAn overview of recent arguments can be obtained from the papers of a conference held at the McDonald Institute in 2000. These presentations vary from \"Why linguists don't do dates\" to the one by Starostin discussed above.\nSince its original inception, glottochronology has been rejected by many linguists, mostly Indo-Europeanists of the school of the traditional comparative method. Criticisms have been answered in particular around three points of discussion.\n\n\nSomewhere in between the original concept of Swadesh and the rejection of glottochronology in its entirety lies the idea that glottochronology as a formal method of linguistic analysis becomes valid with the help of several important modifications. Thus, inhomogeneities in the replacement rate were dealt with by Van der Merwe (1966) by splitting the word list into classes each with their own rate, while Dyen, James and Cole (1967) allowed each meaning to have its own rate. Simultaneous estimation of divergence time and replacement rate was studied by Kruskal, Dyen and Black.\n\nBrainard (1970) allowed for chance cognation and drift effects was introduced by Gleason (1959). Sankoff (1973) suggested introducing a borrowing parameter and allowed synonyms.\n\nA combination of these various improvements is given in Sankoff's \"Fully Parameterised Lexicostatistics\". In 1972 Sankoff in a biological context developed a model of genetic divergence of populations. Embleton (1981) derives a simplified version of this in a linguistic context. She carries out a number of simulations using this which are shown to give good results.\n\nImprovements in statistical methodology related to a completely different branch of science – changes in DNA over time – have sparked a recent renewed interest. These methods are more robust than the earlier ones because they calibrate points on the tree with known historical events and smooth the rates of change across these. As such, they no longer require the assumption of a constant rate of change (Gray & Atkinson 2003).\n\nAnother attempt to introduce such modifications was performed by the Russian linguist Sergei Starostin, who had proposed that\n\n\nThe resulting formula, taking into account both the time dependence and the individual stability quotients, looks as follows:\n\nIn this formula, −\"Lc\" reflects the gradual slowing down of the replacement process due to different individual rates (the less stable elements are the first and the quickest to be replaced), whereas the square root represents the reverse trend – acceleration of replacement as items in the original wordlist \"age\" and become more prone to shifting their meaning. The formula is obviously more complicated than Swadesh's original one, but, as shown in Starostin's work, yields more credible results than the former (and more or less agrees with all the cases of language separation that can be confirmed by historical knowledge). On the other hand, it shows that glottochronology can really only be used as a serious scientific tool on language families the historical phonology of which has been meticulously elaborated (at least to the point of being able to clearly distinguish between cognates and loanwords).\n\nThe McDonald Institute hosted a conference on the issue of time-depth estimation in 2000. The published papers give an idea of the views on glottochronology at that time. These vary from \"Why linguists don't do dates\" to the one by Starostin discussed above. Note that in the referenced Gray and Atkinson paper, they hold that their methods can not be called \"glottochronology\", by confining this term to its original method.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13652", "title": "Hindi", "text": "Hindi\n\nHindi (Devanagari: हिन्दी, \"Hindī\"), or Modern Standard Hindi (Devanagari: मानक हिन्दी, \"Mānak Hindī\") is a standardised and Sanskritised register of the Hindustani language. Hindi written in the Devanagari script is one of the official languages of India, along with the English language. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India. However, it is not the national language of India because no language was given such a status in the Indian constitution.\n\nHindi is the \"lingua franca\" of the \"Hindi belt\", and to a lesser extent other parts of India (usually in a simplified or pidginized variety such as Bazaar Hindustani or Haflong Hindi). Outside India, several other languages are recognized officially as \"Hindi\" but do not refer to the Standard Hindi language described here and instead descend from other dialects of Hindustani, such as Awadhi and Bhojpuri. Such languages include \"Fiji Hindi\", which is official in Fiji, and Caribbean Hindustani, which is a recognized language in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Apart from specialized vocabulary, spoken Hindi is mutually intelligible with Urdu, another recognized register of Hindustani.\n\nAs a linguistic variety, Hindi is the fourth most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish and English. Alongside Urdu as Hindustani, it is the third most-spoken language in the world, after Mandarin and English.\n\nThe term \"Hindī\" originally was used to refer to inhabitants of the region east of the Indus. It was borrowed from Classical Persian \"Hindī\" (Iranian Persian \"Hendi\"), meaning \"Indian\", from the proper noun \"Hind\" \"India\".\n\nThe name \"Hindavī\" was used by Amir Khusrow in his poetry.\n\nLike other Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi is a direct descendant of an early form of Vedic Sanskrit, through Sauraseni Prakrit and Śauraseni Apabhraṃśa (from Sanskrit \"apabhraṃśa\" \"corrupted\"), which emerged in the 7th century A.D.\n\nModern Standard Hindi is based on the Khariboli dialect, the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region, which came to replace earlier prestige dialects such as Awadhi, Maithili (sometimes regarded as separate from the Hindi dialect continuum) and Braj. \"Urdu\" – another form of Hindustani – acquired linguistic prestige in the later Mughal period (1800s), and underwent significant Persian influence. Modern Hindi and its literary tradition evolved towards the end of the 18th century. However, modern Hindi's earlier literary stages before standardization can be traced to the 16th century. In the late 19th century, a movement to further develop Hindi as a standardised form of Hindustani separate from Urdu took form. In 1881, Bihar accepted Hindi as its sole official language, replacing Urdu, and thus became the first state of India to adopt Hindi. Modern Standard Hindi is one of the youngest Indian languages in this regard.\n\nAfter independence, the government of India instituted the following conventions:\n\nOn 14 September 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted Hindi written in the Devanagari script as the official language of the Republic of India replacing Urdu's previous usage in British India. To this end, several stalwarts rallied and lobbied pan-India in favor of Hindi, most notably along with Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Kaka Kalelkar, Maithili Sharan Gupt and Seth Govind Das who even debated in Parliament on this issue. As such, on the 50th birthday of Beohar Rajendra Simha on 14 September 1949, the efforts came to fruition following the adoption of Hindi as the official language. Now, it is celebrated as Hindi Day.\n\nIn Northeast India a pidgin known as Haflong Hindi has developed as a \"lingua franca\" for various tribes in Assam that speak other languages natively. In Arunachal Pradesh, Hindi emerged as a lingua franca among locals who speak over 50 dialects natively.\n\nPart XVII of the Indian Constitution deals with the official language of the Indian Commonwealth. Under Article 343, the official languages of the Union has been prescribed, which includes Hindi in Devanagari script and English:\n\n(1) The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything in clause (1), for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement: Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorize the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devanagari form of numerals in addition to the international form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union\n\nIt shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.\n\nIt was envisioned that Hindi would become the sole working language of the Union Government by 1965 (per directives in Article 344 (2) and Article 351), with state governments being free to function in the language of their own choice. However, widespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in South India (such as the those in Tamil Nadu) led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English indefinitely for all official purposes, although the constitutional directive for the Union Government to encourage the spread of Hindi was retained and has strongly influenced its policies.\n\nAt the state level, Hindi is the official language of the following Indian states: Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal. Each may also designate a \"co-official language\"; in Uttar Pradesh, for instance, depending on the political formation in power, this language is generally Urdu. Similarly, Hindi is accorded the status of official language in the following Union Territories: Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, National Capital Territory.\n\nNational language status for Hindi is a long-debated theme. In 2010, the Gujarat High Court clarified that Hindi is not the national language of India because the constitution does not mention it as such.\n\nOutside Asia, the Awadhi language (A Hindi dialect) with influence from Bhojpuri, Bihari languages, Fijian and English is spoken in Fiji. It is an official language in Fiji as per the 1997 Constitution of Fiji, where it referred to it as \"Hindustani\", however in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called \"Fiji Hindi\". It is spoken by 380,000 people in Fiji.\n\nHindi is also spoken by a large population of Madheshis (people having roots in north-India but have migrated to Nepal over hundreds of years) of Nepal. Hindi is quite easy to understand for some Pakistanis, who speak Urdu, which, like Hindi, is part of Hindustani. Apart from this, Hindi is spoken by the large Indian diaspora which hails from, or has its origin from the \"Hindi Belt\" of India. A substantially large North Indian diaspora lives in countries like the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Fiji and Mauritius, where it is natively spoken at home and among their own Hindustani-speaking communities. Outside India, Hindi speakers are 8 million in Nepal; 863,077 in United States of America; 450,170 in Mauritius; 380,000 in Fiji; 250,292 in South Africa; 150,000 in Suriname; 100,000 in Uganda; 45,800 in United Kingdom; 20,000 in New Zealand; 20,000 in Germany; 16,000 in Trinidad and Tobago; 3,000 in Singapore.\n\nLinguistically, Hindi and Urdu are two registers of the same language and are mutually intelligible. Hindi is written in the Devanagari script and uses more Sanskrit words, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and uses more Arabic and Persian words. Hindi is the most commonly used official language in India. Urdu is the and \"lingua franca\" of Pakistan and is one of 22 official languages of India.\n\nThe splitting of Hindi and Urdu into separate languages is largely motivated by politics, namely the Indo-Pakistani rivalry.\n\nHindi is written in the Devanagari script, an abugida. Devanagari consists of 11 vowels and 33 consonants and is written from left to right. Unlike for Sanskrit, Devanagari is not entirely phonetic for Hindi, especially failing to mark schwa dropping in spoken Standard Hindi.\n\nThe Government of India uses Hunterian transliteration as its official system of writing Hindi in the Latin script. Various other systems also exist, such as IAST, ITRANS and ISO 15919.\n\nTraditionally, Hindi words are divided into five principal categories according to their etymology:\n\n\nHindi also makes extensive use of loan translation (calqueing) and occasionally phono-semantic matching of English.\n\nHindi has naturally inherited a large portion of its vocabulary from Śaurasenī Prākṛt, in the form of \"tadbhava\" words. This process usually involves compensatory lengthening of vowels preceding consonant clusters in Prakrit, e.g. Sanskrit \"tīkṣṇa\" > Prakrit \"tikkha\" > Hindi \"tīkhā\".\n\nMuch of Modern Standard Hindi's vocabulary is borrowed from Sanskrit as \"tatsam\" borrowings, especially in technical and academic fields. The formal Hindi standard, from which much of the Persian, Arabic and English vocabulary has been replaced by neologisms compounding \"tatsam\" words, is called \"Śuddh Hindi\" (pure Hindi), and is viewed as a more prestigious dialect over other more colloquial forms of Hindi.\n\nExcessive use of \"tatsam\" words sometimes creates problems for native speakers. They may have Sanskrit consonant clusters which do not exist in native Hindi, causing difficulties in pronunciation.\n\nAs a part of the process of Sanskritization, new words are coined using Sanskrit components to be used as replacements for supposedly foreign vocabulary. Usually these neologisms are calques of English words already adopted into spoken Hindi. Some terms such as \"dūrbhāṣ\" \"telephone\", literally \"far-speech\" and \"dūrdarśan\" \"television\", literally \"far-sight\" have even gained some currency in formal Hindi in the place of the English borrowings \"(ṭeli)fon\" and \"ṭīvī\".\n\nHindi literature is broadly divided into four prominent forms or styles, being \"Bhakti\" (devotional – Kabir, Raskhan); \"Śṛṇgār\" (beauty – Keshav, Bihari); \"Vīgāthā\" (epic); and \"Ādhunik\" (modern).\n\nMedieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of Bhakti movement and the composition of long, epic poems. It was primarily written in other varieties of Hindi, particularly Avadhi and Braj Bhasha, but to a degree also in Khariboli, the basis for Modern Standard Hindi. During the British Raj, Hindustani became the prestige dialect.\n\n\"Chandrakanta\", written by Devaki Nandan Khatri in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi. The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was Munshi Premchand, who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Literary, or \"Sāhityik\", Hindi was popularised by the writings of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Bhartendu Harishchandra and others. The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Hindustani popular with the educated people.\n\nThe \"Dvivedī Yug\" (\"Age of Dwivedi\") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, who played a major role in establishing Modern Standard Hindi in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love.\n\nIn the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as \"Chāyāvād\" (\"shadow-ism\") and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as \"Chāyāvādī\". Jaishankar Prasad, Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala', Mahadevi Varma and Sumitranandan Pant, are the four major \"Chāyāvādī\" poets.\n\n\"Uttar Ādhunik\" is the post-modernist period of Hindi literature, marked by a questioning of early trends that copied the West as well as the excessive ornamentation of the \"Chāyāvādī\" movement, and by a return to simple language and natural themes.\n\nThe Hindi Wikipedia was the first Indic-language wiki to reach 100,000 articles. Hindi literature, music, and film have all been disseminated via the internet. In 2015, Google reported a 94% increase in Hindi-content consumption year-on-year, adding that 21% of users in India prefer content in Hindi.\n\nMany Hindi newspapers also offer digital editions.\n\nThe following is a sample text in High Hindi, of the Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (by the United Nations):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both form the literary basis of Japanese mythology and Shinto; however, the story differs in some aspects between these works, with the most accepted for the Japanese being the one of the Kojiki.\n\nAt the beginning the universe was immersed in a beaten and shapeless kind of matter (chaos), sunk in silence. Later there were sounds indicating the movement of particles. With this movement, the light and the lightest particles rose but the particles were not as fast as the light and could not go higher. Thus, the light was at the top of the Universe, and below it, the particles formed first the clouds and then Heaven, which was to be called . The rest of the particles that had not risen formed a huge mass, dense and dark, to be called Earth.\n\nWhen Takamagahara was formed, the first three gods of Japanese mythology appeared:\n\nSubsequently two gods emerged in Takamagahara from an object similar to a reed-shoot:\n\n\nThese five deities, known as Kotoamatsukami, appeared spontaneously, did not have a definite sex, did not have a partner (\"hitorigami\") and went into hiding after their emergence.

Designed by New Jersey-based architect and artist Adam Kalkin, it opened in June 1, 2001. The prefabricated building was made of three trans-oceanic shipping containers housed within a commercially produced metal shell, supplied by Cameron Construction Company, Ferrisburgh, Vermont. The two-story structure also included two glass garage doors and a pair of metal grid balconies. The balcony on the north side of the house projects from the wall, and is thus described by Kalkin as the \"male\" side of the house.\n\nThough the building has never served as a home, it was appointed like one, having two bedrooms each with an associated bathroom, and a central kitchen in the main living space with a sink and refrigerator in the island near the western door. One bedroom was to the south of the main living area on the first floor. The other bedroom was on the second floor on the north end of the house. The south end second floor consisted of a sitting room/office with a half-bath. \n\nWhen it was first opened to the public in 2001, Kalkin House was named the Collector's House, envisioned as a 21st-century historic house museum. In order to tie the contemporary architecture to the rest of Shelburne Museum, interior designer Albert Hadley was commissioned to outfit the building with folk art from the museum's collection and furniture. That interior remained intact until 2006 when the structure was renamed Kalkin House and converted into a space for temporary exhibitions highlighting contemporary design, without removing the kitchen or bathroom fixtures from the structure. The 2006 Kalkin House exhibition, \"Homey and Hip\" consisted of twenty pieces of household furniture on loan from Knoll with the stipulation that visitors could sit on the pieces. The interior was not portrayed as a domestic interior again until 2009 when Queens, New York-based textile artist Richard Saja re-imagined the space with his installation \"The Bright and Shining Light of Irreverence: Richard Saja and the Historically Inaccurate School\". \n\nThe structure was removed from the museum grounds in June 2012 by Engineers Construction (a Vermont-based civil contractor) that intends to reuse the building.\n\nAdam Kalkin (American, born 1963) graduated from Vassar College in 1984 and later studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, England. He was awarded a Young Architects Design Award from Progressive Architecture magazine in 1990. In 2005, his Push Button House was shown at Art Basel Miami Beach, and was re-configured as the Illy Café at the Venice Biennale in 2007.\n\n\n"}

Many of the most popular medical wikis take the form of encyclopedias, with a separate article for each medical term. Some of these websites, such as WikiDoc and Radiopaedia, are editable by anyone, while others, such as Ganfyd, restrict editing access to professionals. The majority of them have content available only in English.\n\nThe largest and most popular general encyclopedia, Wikipedia, also hosts a significant amount of health and medical information.\n\nAskDrWiki is a medical wiki encyclopedia created by Cleveland Clinic Cardiology Fellows Kenny Civello and Brian Jefferson. The project was started as a response to the lack of free online medical information found in several community hospitals and was created to form a repository of cardiovascular information that could be readily accessed for reference. It was launched in August 2006. The site now holds medical review articles, clinical notes, pearls, and medical images. The wiki allows anyone with a medical background to contribute or edit medical articles, of which there are over 2,000 .\n\nThe purpose of the site is to provide reliable and easily accessed health information for the medical community including physicians, nurses, and medical students. The information published on the site is not meant to supersede medical training but to serve as a repository of medical review articles to give medical professionals an online source where they can review medical topics. The website is similar to Wikipedia because it runs on MediaWiki software allowing users to add and edit articles, but differs in that all users must be credentialed based on their medical training before they are allowed to publish. Its goal is not to compete with Wikipedia regarding consumer health-related topics, but to serve as an expert medical wiki and provide a source of up-to-date medical information for healthcare providers.\n\nIn December 2006, AskDrWiki was referenced in a \"British Medical Journal\" article, \"How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine\", as one of the early adopters of using video hosting sites such as YouTube and Google Video to host medical videos. It was also discussed in a 2007 \"Nature Medicine\" article on medical wikis. AskDrWiki has been featured in other media including \"The Plain Dealer\", \"Medical Economics\" and \"The American Medical Association News\".\n\nAs of February 2015, although still online, the wiki had minimal ongoing contributions, with only 3 edits in 2014.\n\nClinfowiki is devoted to topics in Biomedical informatics and is maintained by the Department of Medical Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology at Oregon Health and Science University. Dean F. Sittig launched the site on 27 June 2005, and Vishnu Mohan was its editor.\n\nEyeWiki is a medical wiki community and online medical wiki encyclopedia, launched in July 2010 by ophthalmologists supported by the AAO. The wiki provides information about eye diseases and their management, including medical and surgical treatments.\n\nEyeWiki content is created and edited only by ophthalmologists and ophthalmologists in training.\nGanfyd is a medical wiki community and encyclopedia, created in November 2005 by a group of doctors working in the United Kingdom. Only registered medical practitioners or persons working under their direction, and a small number of invited non-medical specialists, may edit Ganfyd articles. The intention was to make the material reliable enough for professional medical use. it has over 8000 content pages.\n\nHemOnc.org is a hematology/oncology wiki which was originally created by oncologists to provide information about chemotherapy regimens and hematology/oncology medications. Its contributors are practicing physicians and other medical professionals. Its current focus is to provide clinicians referenced information about chemotherapy regimens, medications used in hematology/oncology, and to allow medical professionals to share any useful references or medical information with each other to improve their clinical & academic practice.\n\nHemOnc.org runs on MediaWiki software and also Semantic MediaWiki. Anyone may sign up for an account and suggest additional information to be added. Editing privileges are activated for account holders whose credentials are verified. The content is not under an open license.\n\nData about HemOnc.org has been presented at the 2013 ASCO Quality Care Symposium, and it has been profiled in the oncology press. The website's chemotherapy regimen database has also been used for academic research projects.\nRadiopaedia is a bespoke wiki-based international collaborative radiology educational resource with reference articles, radiology images, and patient cases. It is aimed at registrars, residents and consultant radiology staff. An iPhone/iPad application was released in 2009.\n\nUsers of the site are free to add and edit content as well as to maintain their own case library. In an attempt to reduce vandalism and peer-review content, a panel of section editors are appointed from time to time to review changes and ensure that the presented material is as accurate and relevant as possible.\n\nWikiDoc (alternatively spelled Wiki Doc) is a medical wiki encyclopedia where contributors are not required to have credentials in a biomedical field. WikiDoc was started in December 2005 by C. Michael Gibson, of Harvard Medical School. The original content came from Gibson's chief residency notes, board review notes, and content from a variety of copyleft sources including The U.S. National Library of Medicine, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Wikipedia and Ask Dr Wiki. WikiDoc differs from Wikipedia in the following ways: it is oriented more to medical professionals, and has medical news, a toolbar to search internet on the right hand side to gather articles, guidelines and slides, a toolbar on the left to see what page most people looked at next, and a board review course (in Beta testing).\nWikEM is a wiki-based website and point-of-care mobile application for emergency medicine clinicians. WikEM started as a database created from notes and checklists passed from each resident class to the next at the Harbor-UCLA emergency medicine residency program, but is now open to all clinical providers. WikEM was launched in its current form in 2009. WikEM's mobile applications are available in both iOS and Android, allowing for quick mobile usage, as well as offline use in austere environments and disaster situations. It calls itself The Global Emergency Medicine Wiki.\nWikiLectures is a collaborative project focused on creating and storing medical study materials. It is developed by students and teachers from various Czech and Slovak medical faculties. WikiLectures is part of the project MEFANET, a network linking medical schools in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nEditors of WikiLectures take care of promoting the authors, editorial process contributions, technical support, WikiLectures structure and ensure the safety of the project. WikiLectures contain articles, notes, prepared exam topics, guides for practitioners, and study books. WikiLectures are constantly growing. The articles are written by medical students, faculty professionals and doctors. The administration and security is provided by the editorial board. Articles in WikiLectures are regularly checked by editors and experts in various branches of medicine. Articles checked by teachers are always marked by a special sign.\n\nThe Encyclopaedia of Medical Imaging was a wiki encyclopedia of medical imaging used in radiology and radiography. Its online version is called Medcyclopaedia. As of December 2012, the site no longer exists.\n\nThe encyclopedia was the result of a collaboration of the Nycomed Amersham Intercontinental Continuing Education in Radiology Institute (NICER Institute), Sweden, Department of Radiology, Lund University, Sweden, and Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway. It was provided and copyrighted by the healthcare unit of General Electric corporation. Retrieval of images (other than thumbnails) required registration.\n\nThe website contained 3,600 pages.\n\nMedpedia was a collaborative project launched on 17 February 2009. Its aim was to create an open access medical wiki encyclopedia in association with Harvard Medical School, Stanford School of Medicine, Berkeley School of Public Health, University of Michigan Medical School, the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) as well as other contributors. Content was licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) license and ran on modified MediaWiki software. Harvard Medical School did not have a role in, nor was it responsible for, the content that appeared in the “wiki” section of Medpedia.\n\nAnyone with medical knowledge was welcome to become part of Medpedia's community. However, to qualify to edit or contribute to the main content, approved editors needed an M.D., D.O., or Ph.D. in a biomedical field. Others could contribute by writing in suggestions for changes to the site using the \"Make a suggestion\" link at the top of each page. An approved editor could review and potentially add submitted suggestions.\n\nMedpedia was composed of three primary components:\n\nA 2012 literature review of 50 academic journal articles about the use of social media by clinicians remarked that Medpedia had \"launched in 2009 with substantial institutional backing\" but that the authors \"did not find articles reporting success metrics\" for it.\n\nAround January 2013 the site abruptly closed. Medpedia's founder James Currier acknowledged that this was permanent in a blog post in July 2013.\n\nWikiSurgery is a collaboratively-built online encyclopedia hosted by the International Journal of Surgery. As of November 2013, the site's homepage is still up but none of the rest of the website is viewable.\n\n\n"}

It is so-called for the complex of internationally significant museums, all part of the Berlin State Museums, that occupy the island's northern part:\n\nIn 1999, the museum complex was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nA first exhibition hall was erected in 1797 at the suggestion of the archaeologist Aloys Hirt. In 1822, Schinkel designed the plans for the Altes Museum to house the royal Antikensammlung, the arrangement of the collection was overseen by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The island, originally a residential area, was dedicated to \"art and science\" by King Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1841. Further extended under succeeding Prussian kings, the museum's collections of art and archeology were turned into a public foundation after 1918. They are today maintained by the Berlin State Museums branch of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.\n\nMuseum Island further comprises the Lustgarten park and the Berlin Cathedral. Between the Bode and Pergamon Museums it is crossed by the Stadtbahn railway viaduct. The adjacent territory to the south is the site of the former royal and imperial Berlin Palace and the Palace of the Republic.\n\nThe Prussian collections became separated during the Cold War during the division of the city, but were reunited after German reunification, except for some art and artefacts removed after World War II by Allied troops. These include the Priam's Treasure, also called \"the gold of Troy\", excavated by Heinrich Schliemann in 1873, then smuggled out of Turkey to Berlin and smuggled out of Germany to Moscow. Today it is kept at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.\n\nAs for the city's major museums, it took much of the 1990s for a consensus to emerge that Museum Island's buildings should be restored and modernized, with General Director Wolf-Dieter Dube's cautious plan for their use finally approved in January 1999. Then, six months later, Peter-Klaus Schuster took over and set in motion a far more ambitious program intended to turn Museum Island into a \"Louvre on the Spree\". The federal government pledged $20 million a year through 2010 for projects to enhance Berlin's prestige and Unesco declaring the island a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe contents of the museums were decided on as follows: The Pergamon, with the Greek altar that gives it its name, retained much of its collection and was defined as a museum of ancient architecture. The Neues Museum presented archaeological objects as well as Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures, including the renowned bust of Queen Nefertiti. The Altes Museum, the oldest on the island, displayed Greek and Roman art objects on its first floor and hold exhibitions on its second floor. The Bode Museum's paintings went from Late Byzantine to 1800. And, as now, the Alte Nationalgalerie will cover the 19th century. Once this process is completed, perhaps by 2020, the Gemäldegalerie’s painting collection will be transferred to the Bode, and a new annex, and Museum Island will present all art from the ancient civilizations to 1900. The James Simon Gallery, a $94 million visitors’ center designed by the British architect David Chipperfield, is being built beside the Neues Museum. It will in turn be linked to the Neues, Altes, Pergamon and Bode Museums by an underground passageway decorated with archaeological objects.\n\nOnce the Museum Island Master Plan is completed, the so-called Archaeological Promenade will connect four of the five museums in the Museum Island. The Promenade will begin at the Old Museum in the south, lead through the New Museum and the Pergamon Museum and end at the Bode Museum, located at the northern tip of the Island. Before World War II, these museums were connected by bridge passages above ground; they were destroyed due to the effects of the war. There have never been plans to rebuild them; instead, the central courts of individual museums will be lowered, which has already been done in the Bode Museum and in the New Museum. They will be connected by subterranean galleries. In a way, this archaeological promenade can be regarded as the sixth museum in the Island, because it is devised not only as a connecting corridor but also as a strung-out exhibition room for interdisciplinary presentations. The Archaeological Promenade may be characterized as a cross-total of the collections that are shown separately (in accordance with cultural regions, epochs, and art genres) in the individual museums of the Island. The Archaeological Promenade will address multi-focus topics that have occupied the human mind irrespective of time and cultural region, be it a question of life after death or issues of beauty and other topics.\n\nMuseum Island is referenced in the song \"On the Museum Island\" by folk artist Emmy the Great.\n\nThe southern section of the island, south of Gertraudenstraße, is commonly referred to as Fischerinsel (Fisher Island) and is the site of a high-rise apartment development built when Mitte was part of East Berlin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "432236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=432236", "title": "Pee-wee's Big Adventure", "text": "Pee-wee's Big Adventure\n\nPee-wee's Big Adventure is a 1985 American adventure comedy film directed by Tim Burton in his full-length film directing debut and starring Paul Reubens as Pee-wee Herman with supporting roles provided by Elizabeth Daily, Mark Holton, Diane Salinger, and Judd Omen. Reubens also co-wrote the script with Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol. Described as a \"parody\" or \"farce version\" of the 1948 Italian classic \"Bicycle Thieves\", it is the tale of Pee-wee Herman's nationwide search for his stolen bicycle.\n\nAfter the success of \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\", Reubens began writing the script to \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" when he was hired by Warner Bros.. The producers and Reubens hired Burton to direct when they were impressed with his work on \"Vincent\" and \"Frankenweenie\". Filming took place in both California and Texas.\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 1985, grossing over $40 million in North America. It eventually developed into a cult film and has since accumulated positive feedback. The film was nominated for a Young Artist Award and spawned two sequels, \"Big Top Pee-wee\" (1988) and \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\" (2016). Its financial success, followed by the equally successful \"Beetlejuice\" in 1988, prompted Warner Bros. to hire Burton as the director for the 1989 film \"Batman\".\n\nPee-wee Herman has a heavily accessorized bicycle that he treasures and that his neighbor, Francis Buxton, covets. A bike shop employee, Dottie, has a crush on Pee-wee, but he does not reciprocate it. Pee-wee's bike is stolen while he is shopping at a mall. The police tell Pee-wee that they cannot help him find his bike. Pee-wee thinks Francis took it, and confronts him. Francis' father convinces Pee-wee that Francis did not steal the bike. Pee-wee then offers a $10,000 reward for his bike. Francis, who did indeed pay to have someone steal the bike, is frightened by Pee-wee's relentlessness and then pays to have it sent away. After holding an unsuccessful meeting to locate the bike, Pee-wee angrily rejects Dottie's offers of help. Desperate, he visits \"Madam Ruby\", a phony psychic. Ruby, inspired by the Al and Moe's Bargain Basement shop across the street, tells Pee-wee that his bike is in the basement of the Alamo Mission in San Antonio. Pee-wee hitchhikes to Texas, getting rides from a fugitive, Mickey; and from Large Marge, the ghost of a deceased truck driver.\n\nAt a truck stop, Pee-wee discovers his wallet is missing and pays for his meal by washing dishes. He befriends Simone, a waitress who dreams of visiting Paris. As they watch the sunrise at a dinosaur museum, Pee-wee encourages her to follow her dreams, but Simone tells him about her jealous and large boyfriend, Andy, who disapproves. Andy arrives and tries to attack Pee-wee, who escapes onto a moving train and meets Hobo Jack. Pee-wee eventually arrives at the Alamo, but learns at the end of a guided tour that the building does not have a basement. At a bus station, Pee-wee encounters Simone, who tells him that she and Andy broke up and she is on her way to Paris. She tells Pee-wee not to give up finding his bike. Pee-wee calls Dottie at the bike shop and apologizes for his behavior. Andy spots Pee-wee and resumes his attack. Pee-wee evades Andy at a rodeo by disguising himself as a rodeo bull rider. Forced to ride for real, Pee-wee does well but receives a concussion.\n\nPee-wee enters a biker bar for one large wine and to make a phone call, but the outlaw motorcycle club threatens to kill him after he accidentally knocks over their motorcycles. Pee-wee makes a last request, dancing to the song \"Tequila\". His dance wins over the bikers, who give him a motorcycle for his journey. Pee-wee crashes his motorcycle immediately afterwards. Pee-wee wakes up in a hospital and learns from a television news report that his bike is being used as a prop in a movie starring a bratty child named Kevin Morton. Pee-wee sneaks into Warner Bros. Studios and takes the bike. He is chased by security across the studio lot and through several sets before escaping.\n\nLater, Pee-wee discovers a burning pet shop and rescues the animals. Although the firefighters declare Pee-wee a hero, the police arrest him for his disruption at the studios. Pee-wee meets the president of Warner Bros., Terry Hawthorne, and explains his journey to retrieve the bike. Hawthorne decides to drop the charges and make a special movie about Pee-wee and his bike, which is returned to him.\n\nLater at a drive-in theater, Pee-wee and Dottie attend the premiere of his biopic, an action movie starring James Brolin as \"P.W. Herman\" and Morgan Fairchild as Dottie. The two must retrieve a sport bike called the X-1, which contains an important microfilm and has been stolen by the Soviets. Pee-wee has a cameo appearance as a hotel bellhop, though his voice has been dubbed. At the drive-in, Pee-wee gives refreshments to all the people he met along his journey. Pee-wee also encounters Francis, who tells reporters that he is Pee-wee's best friend who taught him how to ride. Francis claims to be knowledgeable about Pee-wee's bike, but accidentally catapults himself into the air using one of the bicycle's gadgets. As Pee-wee leaves the drive-in, Dottie asks why he is not staying for the rest of the movie. Pee-wee answers, \"I don't have to see it, Dottie. I lived it.\" He and Dottie then ride off together at the movie screen in silhouette.\n\n\nMichael Varhol who co-wrote the script with Reubens and Hartman cameos as a photographer. Director Tim Burton has an uncredited cameo as the street thug who confronts Pee-wee in a rainy back-alley. Other minor roles include Ed Herlihy as Mr. Buxton and Cassandra Peterson (a.k.a. Elvira, Mistress of the Dark) as the Biker Mama of Satan's Helpers. James Brolin portrays \"P.W. Herman\" and Morgan Fairchild is Dottie in the in-movie production about Pee-wee's life. Heavy metal band Twisted Sister, and veteran comedy star Milton Berle cameo as themselves.\n\nThe film contains numerous \"conceptual continuity\" links to other Tim Burton films and other productions:\n\n\nThe success of \"The Pee-wee Herman Show\" prompted Warner Bros. to hire Paul Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea was to do a remake of \"Pollyanna\" with Pee-wee Herman in the Hayley Mills role. Reubens claims that \"Pollyanna\" is his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Brothers had a bike to get around the backlot, and so he requested one of his own. This inspired Reubens to start on a new script. \n\nHaving left The Walt Disney Company and with \"Frankenweenie\" receiving positive reviews within film studios, Tim Burton was looking for a full-length film to direct. When Reubens and the producers of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" saw Burton's work on \"Vincent\" and \"Frankenweenie\", they decided to hire Burton for their film. Burton felt he connected with Reubens' personality and the humor of the \"Pee-wee Herman Show\". After hiring Burton to direct, Reubens, Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol reworked the script again. The team purchased Syd Field's \"Screenplay\" and wrote the script as faithful as to what the book advised. \"It’s a 90-minute film, it’s a 90-page script,\" Reubens explained. \"On page 30 I lose my bike, on page 60 I find it. It's literally exactly what they said to do in the book...There should be like a MacGuffin kind of a thing, something you’re looking for, and I was like, 'Okay, my bike.'\"\n\nFilming locations included Glendale, Pomona, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Burbank, Cabazon (at the Cabazon Dinosaurs), Port Hueneme, California, and San Antonio, Texas. Burton and Reubens had tensions with Warner Bros. studio executives over the shooting schedule. Burton hired CalArts classmate Rick Heinrichs for scenes involving stop-motion animation.\n\nTo compose the film score, Burton brought in Danny Elfman, who had previously composed the music for \"Forbidden Zone\". He relished the opportunity to compose an orchestral score rather than a pop score and wanted it to be taken as the work of a composer rather than the dabbling of a pop musician. Elfman already had the main title theme written before he signed on. At the time, Elfman was the lead singer of Oingo Boingo, but the working relationship between Burton and Elfman would overshadow his performing life and continue for most of Burton's films.\n\nIn 1986 Varèse Sarabande released an album on record, cassette and compact disc featuring cues from the movie and 1986's \"Back to School\", also scored by Elfman. While both films had their scores recorded in Hollywood, the album recording was made in London and performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by John Coleman. In 2010 many of the original tracks were subsequently released by Warner Bros. Records as part of \"The Danny Elfman & Tim Burton 25th Anniversary Music Box\".\n\n\"Clown Dream\" is also used in the video game \"Grand Theft Auto V\". It is also often used as the opening music during Primus concerts.\n\nThe film also features \"Burn in Hell\" by Twisted Sister and \"Tequila\" by The Champs.\n\n\"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" opened on August 9, 1985 in the United States in 829 theaters, accumulating $4,545,847 over its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically.\n\n\"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" received generally positive reviews at the time of the film's release, before eventually developing into a cult film. As of July 2018, \"Rotten Tomatoes\" reported that 87% of 45 critics gave the film a positive review. By comparison Metacritic calculated an average score of 47 from 13 reviews collected. The film was nominated with a Young Artist Award for Best Family Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical).\n\nChristopher Null gave positive feedback, calling it \"Burton's strangest film.\" \"Variety\" compared Paul Reubens to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, while \"Empire\" called the film \"a one-comic masterpiece\" and \"a dazzling debut\" for Burton. Stephanie Zacharek of \"Salon.com\" explained \"Everything about \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", from its toy-box colors to its superb, hyper-animated Danny Elfman score to the butch-waxed hairdo and wooden-puppet walk of its star and mastermind is pure pleasure.\" Burton was offered the opportunity to direct \"Big Top Pee-wee\", but had no interest and was already working on his own pet project, \"Beetlejuice\". Positive reviews of \"Beetlejuice\" and the financial success of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" prompted Warner Bros. to offer Burton the director's helm for \"Batman\".\n\nRoger Ebert never officially reviewed \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" but in 1987 it topped his list of \"Guilty Pleasures\" and he did mention it in his review of \"Big Top Pee-wee\", saying the sequel was not as magical as the first. The second paragraph of that review contrasted the two films explaining what he liked in \"Big Adventure\" that he didn't like in \"Big Top\". Gene Siskel, however, gave \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" a negative review and even called it one of the worst movies of 1985.\n\nWarner Home Video released \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" on DVD in May 2000. The release included audio commentary by Tim Burton, Paul Reubens and Danny Elfman as well as deleted scenes.\n\n"}

Parker (born June 20, 1960) holds the INSEAD Chair Professorship of Management Science at INSEAD (Fontainebleau, France). He has patented a method to automatically produce a set of similar books from a template which is filled with data from database and internet searches. He claims that his programs have written more than 200,000 books. Parker publishes the automated books through Icon Group International, using several Icon group subheadings. Via EdgeMaven Media, he also provides applications for firms from different business domains to create their own computer-authored content material.\n\nBorn dyslexic, Parker early on developed a passion for dictionaries. He gained undergraduate degrees in mathematics, biology, and economics. He received a Ph.D. in business economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and has master's degrees in finance and banking from Aix-Marseille University and managerial economics from Wharton.\nHe was a senior consultant at EMCI, and an economist for Nathan Associates in Washington, D.C., before moving to the european graduate business school and research institution INSEAD.\n\nAs well as co-authoring some technical economic articles, Parker has written six books on national economic development and economic divergence. These insist that consumer utility and consumption functions must be bounded by physical laws, against economic axioms which violate laws of physics such as conservation of energy.\n\nParker is also involved—as entrepreneur publisher and editor—in new media reference work projects. He is the instigator of Webster's Online Dictionary: The Rosetta Edition, a multilingual online dictionary created in 1999 and using the \"Webster's\" name, now in the public domain. This site compiles different online dictionaries and encyclopedia including the \"Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary\" (1913), the Wiktionary, and Wikipedia.\n\nMost of Parker's automatically generated books target niche markets (the \"long tail\" concept). Examples include:\n\n\nAll books are self-published paperbacks. Ninety-five percent of the ordered books are sent out electronically; the rest are print on demand. Parker plans to extend the programs to produce romance novels.\n\nBeginning in 1998, Parker launched literacy initiatives, based on his consultations with the World Bank, designed to create educational materials for under-served languages. These have included programs which can produce scripts for animated game shows intended to teach English to non-native speakers, some of which are available on YouTube. Recently he has collaborated with various projects sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In one project, Parker worked with Plant Resources of Tropical Africa (PROTA) by assisting researchers to more quickly synthesize the dispersed information on useful tropical plants. This resulted in the creation of a public access portal covering the biodiversity of plants in Africa. In another he is engaged in creating automated rural radio weather programs in collaboration with Farmer Voice Radio. Similar projects are underway with The Grameen Foundation, Farm Radio International, and the GSM Association, generating radio scripts, agricultural call center content, and SMS content platforms in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, and India, among other developing counties.\n\nUsing a collection of automation programs called \"Eve\", Parker has applied his techniques within his dictionary project to digital poetry; he reports posting over 1.3 million poems, aspiring to reach one poem for each word found in the English language. He refers to these as \"graph theoretic poems\" since they are generated using graph theory, where \"graph\" refers to mathematical values that relate words to each other in a semantic web. He has posted in the thesaurus section of his online dictionary the values used in these algorithms. Genres produced include the following: acrostic, butterfly, cinquain, diamante, ekphrastic, fib or Fibonacci poetry, gnomic poetry, haiku, Kural, limerick, mirror cinquain, nonet, octosyllable, pi, quinzaine, Rondelet, sonnet, tanka, unitoum, waka, simple verse, and xenia epigram. Genres were created by Parker to allow one genre of poem for each letter of the English alphabet, including Yoda, for Y (poetry using the grammar structure of the famous \"Star Wars\" character), and Zedd for Z (poems shaped like the letter Z). His poems are didactic in nature, and either define the entry word in question, or highlight its antonyms. He has stated plans to expand these to many languages and is experimenting with other poetic forms.\n\nSources for the content of some books are electronic databases. These sources are cited in the published works.\n\n\n"}

Phoenix has observed an inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest who are attending or who have attended civil aviation universities and colleges in the State of Arizona.\n\nThe recommendations outlined by Williams were ignored or put aside because of other concerns. The memo was seen by at least a dozen FBI officials, including John P. O'Neill, but it was never passed to acting director Thomas J. Pickard, his successor Robert Mueller, or the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, the existence of the memo was not made known to President George W. Bush and his senior national security staff until May 2002. Mueller told Congress in a 2002 hearing that failure to act on the memo was due to deficits in the Bureau's analytical capabilities.\n\nThe memo became the subject of another communiqué in 2002 when FBI agent Coleen Rowley took advantage of the federal Whistleblower Protection Act provisions to inform FBI Director Robert Mueller that his public statements about lack of \"advance knowledge\" by the Bureau have no basis in facts.

It evolved as a separation of the literal crown and property of the nation state from the person and personal property of the monarch. In this context it should not be confused with any physical crown.\n\nA bill is a proposed law under consideration by a legislature. A bill is not law until passed by the legislature and, in most cases, approved by the executive, Privy Council and monarch by Royal Assent. Once a bill is enacted into law it is called an \"act\" or \"statute\".\n\nNumerous Bills and Acts of succession were used to determine heirs and potential heirs to the throne, during the reign of the incumbent monarch, and especially before, during and after the changeovers between the Tudors, Stuarts, Hanoverians, and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the present Windsors, all of which necessitated changes and amendments to prior succession legislation to accommodate circumstances of the day. Historically and presently, legislation to amend laws of succession generally argue for amendments to several historic acts, adjudged relevant to succession issues of the day. The Bill of Rights 1688 and the Coronation Oath Act 1688, the Act of Settlement 1700, the Union with Scotland Act 1706, the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705 and Princess Sophia's Precedence Act 1711, the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the Union with Ireland Act 1800, the Accession Declaration Act 1910 and the Regency Act 1937. The 1937 Regency Act came into legislative existence as a consequence of the abdication of King Edward VIII, as such passing succession to his brother Albert Duke of York (King George VI) in 1937, who was succeeded by his daughter Queen Elizabeth II in 1952.\n\nPre-legislative Scrutiny: Joint committee of both houses review bill and vote on amendments that government can accept or reject. Reports are influential in later stages as rejected committee recommendations are revived to be voted on.\n\nFirst Reading: No vote occurs. Bill is presented, printed, and in private members' bills, a Second Reading date is set.\n\nSecond Reading: A debate on the general principles of the bill is followed by a vote.\n\nCommittee Stage: A committee considers each clause of the bill, and may make amendments.\n\nReport Stage: An opportunity to amend the bill. The House consider clauses to which amendments have been tabled.\n\nThird Reading: A debate on final text as amended. In the Lords, further amendments may be tabled at this stage.\n\nPassage: The bill is then sent to the other House which may amend it.\n\nCommittee Stage: \"Same procedures\"\n\nReport Stage: \"Same procedures\"\n\nPassage: The bill is then returned to the original House.\n\nPre-legislative Scrutiny to consider all amendments.\n\nThe bill is then processed for Royal Assent, if accepted, the bill becomes an Act.\nThe Succession to the Crown Act 2013 is a piece of legislation in the United Kingdom which alters the laws of succession to the British throne. It was published on 13 December 2012 and received Royal Assent on 25 April 2013. Known as the Perth Agreement, on 28 October 2011, at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Perth, Western Australia, heads of government of 16 Commonwealth realms, which share Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, announced that they would introduce legislation to end the primacy of male children over female in the succession to the Crown. The Succession to the Crown Bill is to give effect in the United Kingdom to the agreement between heads of government. \n\nThe argument for changing the law on succession can be stated simply: the law as it stands is considered to discriminate against women and Catholics. The Government has said that it opposes discrimination in all forms, including against Catholics. However, numerous attempts to alter the succession to remove such clauses through Private Members’ bills have not been successful, and the Government has now brought forward its own legislation on the matter. Consequently, to change the law, the government have sought consent of the fifteen Commonwealth countries that have the Queen as their head of state, under the preamble to the Statute of Westminster 1931. Amending old legislation fundamental to the British constitution, have raised further questions about the nature of the established church and the Union between England and Scotland. \n\nPrivate Members' bills\n\nThe First, Second and Third Succession Acts were created to determine successors of Henry VIII, in consequence of his several wives. These circumstances evoked more legislation. In response to his excommunication; that Henry's \"imperial crown\" had been diminished by \"the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions\" of the Pope, the Act of Supremacy in 1534 declared that the King was \"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England\" and the Treasons Act 1534 made it high treason, punishable by death, to refuse to acknowledge the King as such.\n\nHistorical precedence of prior succession acts usually determines later succession issues. There are several events in the history of royal successions showing why succession acts were necessary at the time of their creation. The Bill of Rights 1688 came about as a consequence of the circumstances after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, and the successions of William III and Mary II, who became regents in return for accepting this Bill of Rights, and a new Coronation Oath Act 1688, from the Convention Parliament.\n\nThe Bill of Rights limited royal power and established the supremacy of Parliament. This rights bill also established the frequency of parliaments, freedom of speech in parliament, debates or proceedings not to be questioned out of parliament. This Bill also especially established that; \"without parliamentary consent the king could not\"; suspend or create laws, raise taxes by prerogative, or raise a standing army in peace time.\n\nThe Oath Act reiterated precedent that \"By the Law and Ancient Usage of this Realm\" monarchs of England took a solemn coronation oath to maintain the statute laws and customs of the country and of its inhabitants. This established a new coronation oath to be taken by future monarchs. This oath was different from the traditional coronation oath which recognized laws as being the grant of the King, whereas the Act's new oath sought the King to rule according to the law agreed in parliament.\n\nHis Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 (1 Edw. 8 & 1 Geo. 6 c. 3), was the Act of the British Parliament that recognized and ratified the abdication of King Edward VIII from the throne of the United Kingdom and the dominions of the British Commonwealth, and passed succession to his brother Prince Albert, Duke of York (who became King George VI). The Act also excluded any possible future descendants of Edward from the line of succession. Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry his lover, Wallis Simpson, after facing opposition from the governments of the United Kingdom and the British dominions. Although Edward VIII had signed a declaration of abdication the previous day (10 December 1936), he was still King until he gave royal assent to this Act, which occurred on 11 December. The Act was passed through the Houses of Parliament in one day, with no amendments.\n\n"}

Special elections are rare, as substitutes are chosen at every election.\n\nUntil 2018, the Senate was completely renewed every six years since senators are barred from immediate reelection. As of 2018, Senators can now serve a second term.\n\nIn Spanish, it is conventional to refer to each Legislature of the Senate by the Roman numeral of its term.\n\nThe current session (whose term lasts from 2018 to 2021) is known as the LXIV Legislatura (\"64th Legislature\").\n\nSenators are elected to serve during two legislatures of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. Thus, current senators (who were elected in the general election of July 1, 2018) will serve during the 64th and 65th Legislatures of the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, senators are the representatives of the nation. To be a senator, for any of the two principles of choice, you must meet the following requirements:\n\nSenators are elected for a period of six years, corresponding to two legislatures and cannot be reelected for the immediate period, although alternately.\n\nThey are elected by direct popular suffrage and secret ballot in every state of the republic. Each political party registers a list with two formulas of candidates, consisting of two owners and their alternates: the number 1 of the formula First Formula is denominated to him, and 2, Second Formula. The formula of candidates obtaining the highest number of votes is elected complete, becoming the first two senators of the entity; the third Senate seat is awarded to the candidate of First Formula of the political party that won second place of votes or first minority.\n\nThere are also 32 senators elected by proportional representation. For this election, each political party registers a list of 32 candidates, and these are allocated by proportional representation according to the number of votes obtained by each political party in the national election.\nFor their internal government has two main instances, namely:\n\nFor the office of legislative affairs, senators integrate into Commissions that are dedicated to a particular issue. The most important committees are those of Interior, Constitutional Issues, Defense, Finance, Justice, among others. Each senator belongs to at least three different commissions, and each committee shall elect a Chairman and two Secretaries 5 (according to the Commission) to coordinate their work.\n\nA senator holds office for a period of six years for which he was elected (from September 1 of the year of its election to the 31 August six years later), divided into two legislatures of three years each.\n\nFrom 1 September 2015 is installed LXIII Legislature, which will end its term on 31 August 2018. Senators were elected to office in the 2012 elections for a period of six years and are at their posts from 1 September of that year, therefore they will hold office from the LXII Legislature to LXIII Legislature.\n\nThe two chambers of the General Congress divided its exercise into two ordinary sessions, the first from September 1 to December 15 and the second from February 1 to April 30, it should be required may convene special sessions to dispatch urgent or pertinent matters.\n\nThe time between the regular sessions known as Recesses.

{"id": "356167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356167", "title": "Stone Cold Steve Austin", "text": "Stone Cold Steve Austin\n\nSteve Austin (born Steven James Anderson on December 18, 1964, later Steven James Williams), better known by the ring name \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, is an American retired professional wrestler, actor, producer, and television host. Austin is currently signed under a Legends contract in the WWE.\n\nAustin enjoyed a successful mid-card career as \"Stunning\" Steve Austin in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1991 to 1995. After a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in late 1995, he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as The Ringmaster. Rebranded as \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin the following year, he gained significant mainstream popularity as a brazen, vulgar, beer-drinking antihero who routinely defied the establishment and his boss, company chairman Vince McMahon. This persona of Austin's became the \"poster boy\" of the Attitude Era, a boom period in WWF business in the latter 1990s and early 2000s. He also introduced the long-standing \"What?\" chant in professional wrestling. A number of prominent industry figures, including McMahon, have declared Austin to be the biggest star in WWF/WWE history and stressed that he surpassed the popularity of Hulk Hogan. Veteran professional wrestling journalist Wade Keller remarked that Austin is \"in every conversation for the greatest wrestling act of all time\", as well as for \"the most profitable and the most influential\".\n\nAustin held 19 championships throughout his wrestling career, as he is a six-time WWF Champion, a two-time Intercontinental Champion and a four-time WWF Tag Team Champion—thus making him the fifth Triple Crown Champion in WWE history—while also being a two-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion, a two-time WCW World Television Champion, a one-time WCW World Tag Team Champion and a one-time NWA World Tag Team Champion in WCW. He was also the winner of the 1996 King of the Ring tournament as well as the 1997, 1998 and 2001 Royal Rumbles, making him the only three-time winner of the event. Furthermore, he was awarded the unsanctioned Million Dollar Championship by Ted DiBiase.\n\nAustin has main evented multiple pay-per-view events for the WWE, including three WrestleManias (XIV, XV and X-Seven). He was forced to retire from in-ring competition in 2003 due to a series of knee injuries and a serious neck injury. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, he was featured as the Co-General Manager and Sheriff of \"Raw\". Since 2005, he has continued to make occasional appearances, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009 by Vince McMahon. In 2011, Austin returned to WWE to host the reboot of the reality series \"Tough Enough!\".\n\nAustin was born in Austin, Texas. His parents, James and Beverly Anderson (née Harrison), divorced when he was around a year old. His mother moved to Victoria, Texas, and in 1968, married Ken Williams. Austin adopted his stepfather's surname and later, legally changed his name to Steven James Williams. Austin has three brothers (Scott, Kevin, and Jeff) and one younger sister (Jennifer). Kevin is less than a year younger, and Austin has hypothesized in his autobiography that their father may have left because he could not handle another child so soon. Austin spent most of his childhood in Edna, Texas. After finishing his schooling from Edna High School, Austin got a football scholarship at Wharton County Junior College, followed by a full scholarship at the University of North Texas.\n\nDeciding to become a wrestler, Austin joined Chris Adams' school in the Dallas Sportatorium, where Adams also wrestled for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). Adams' training was purely technical, teaching Austin the moves, but nothing relating to kayfabe (still somewhat a guarded secret at the time) or business. His first lesson in that came from Tony Falk, the referee in his 1989 televised WCCW debut against Frogman LeBlanc, who called the spots to lead him to a pinfall and a $40 payday.\n\nInitially working under his real name, he was named Steve Austin by Memphis booker Dutch Mantell during the merger of World Class and the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) into the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). The name change occurred to avoid confusion with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams, a well-known wrestler during that time. Austin later returned to Dallas, managed by Percy Pringle and accompanied by Jeannie Adams (Adams' ex-girlfriend and Austin's girlfriend at the time) and feuded with Adams and his wife Toni.\n\nAustin then left the USWA in 1990 and signed with WCW the next year. It was during this time Austin adopted the \"Stunning\" nickname that followed him to WCW.\n\nAustin was originally paired with a valet named Vivacious Veronica, but was later joined by Jeannie Adams, known as \"Lady Blossom\". Just weeks after his debut, Austin defeated Bobby Eaton for his first WCW World Television Championship on June 3, 1991 and later that year joined Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance. Austin lost the WCW World Television Championship to Barry Windham in a two out of three falls match on April 27, 1992, but regained the title from Windham on May 23 and enjoyed a second lengthy reign as champion before losing the title to Ricky Steamboat on September 2, while The Dangerous Alliance disbanded shortly thereafter. At Halloween Havoc on October 25, Austin replaced Terry Gordy, teaming with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams to wrestle Dustin Rhodes and Windham for the unified WCW and NWA World Tag Team Championships. The teams wrestled to a thirty-minute time limit draw.\n\nIn January 1993, Austin formed a tag team known as The Hollywood Blonds with Brian Pillman. They won the unified NWA and WCW World Tag Team Championship on March 3 by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas and held the title for five months. At \"Clash of the Champions XXIII\" on June 16, the Blondes faced Ric Flair and Arn Anderson in a two out of three falls tag team title match and were defeated, but retained the title as one fall had been determined by a disqualification. At \"Clash of the Champions XXIV\" on August 18, Austin and Pillman were scheduled to defend their title against Anderson and Paul Roma, but a legitimate injured Pillman was replaced by Steven Regal, with whom Austin lost to Anderson and Roma.\n\nWith Pillman still injured, Austin joined Colonel Robert Parker's Stud Stable. After Pillman returned, Austin betrayed and defeated him in a singles match at \"Clash of the Champions XXV\" on November 10. At Starrcade on December 27, Austin defeated Dustin Rhodes in a two out of three falls match with two straight falls to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Austin lost the title to Ricky Steamboat on August 24, 1994 and was scheduled to face Steamboat in a rematch for the title at Fall Brawl on September 18, but Steamboat was unable to wrestle due to a legit back injury and Austin was awarded the title by forfeit. His second reign with the title ended just minutes later when he lost to Steamboat's replacement, Jim Duggan, in a match that lasted thirty-five seconds. Austin unsuccessfully challenged Duggan for the United States Heavyweight Championship at both Halloween Havoc on October 23 and \"Clash of the Champions XXIX\" on November 16.\n\nAfter returning from a knee injury in early 1995, Austin took part in a tournament for the vacant WCW United States Heavyweight title, where he defeated Duggan via countout in the first round, but lost to Randy Savage in the quarterfinals. In 1995, Austin was fired by WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff after suffering a triceps injury while wrestling on a Japanese tour—Bischoff and WCW did not see Austin as a marketable wrestler. Additionally, Bischoff thought Austin was hard to work with.\n\nAustin was contacted by Paul Heyman of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), who had managed him in WCW. Heyman hired Austin to do in-ring interviews as he still had not recovered from his injury enough to wrestle.\n\nWhile in ECW, Austin used the platform to develop his future \"Stone Cold\" persona, as well as a series of vignettes running down WCW in general and Bischoff in particular, most memorably in several promos that mocked his then-status as \"Nitro\" host by introducing \"Monday NyQuil\", where he was joined by \"Bongo\" (a set of drums, meant to represent Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael) in promoting the show \"where the big boys play with each other\". Also several wrestlers credited ECW as the place where Austin developed his microphone skills. Austin has credited Heyman as the man who taught him how to cut a promo. While with ECW, Austin was known as \"Superstar\" Steve Austin and had a match with The Sandman and feuded with Mikey Whipwreck.\n\nWhipwreck, who was the ECW World Heavyweight Champion at the time, defeated Austin for the title at November to Remember on November 18. During this time, Austin learned Whipwreck's finishing move (the \"Whipper-Snapper\") and would adopt it and popularize it in his later career as the \"Stone Cold Stunner\". The Sandman defeated Austin and Whipwreck in a triple threat match at December to Dismember on December 9 for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Heyman would later state that he had wanted Austin to win the title, but Austin had refused because he felt he was more effective \"as the hunter, rather than the hunted\".\n\nAustin joined the WWF after Kevin Nash and Jim Ross helped convince WWF's owner Vince McMahon to hire him in late 1995. He debuted on the January 8, 1996 episode of \"Raw\" and was awarded the Million Dollar Championship by his manager, Ted DiBiase. Austin had his debut match on the January 15 episode of \"Raw\" where he defeated Matt Hardy. Initially, Austin wrestled as The Ringmaster, but his full name was acknowledged by announcers, although it was not part of his official billing.\n\nWhile making his first pay-per-view appearance at the Royal Rumble on January 21, where he was 'scripted' to be in the Final Four, which could have given him an early push, Austin botched the ringpost save against Fatu and slipped out of the ring early. Austin soon thought the Ringmaster idea was weak and so asked for a change. The WWF gave Austin a list with names inspired by \"The Iceman\" Richard Kuklinski, including Otto Von Ruthless, Ice Dagger, Fang McFrost and Chilli McFreeze. Austin shaved his head bald and grew a goatee, while on March 11 \"The Ringmaster\" moniker (now merely a prefix to his ring name) would be discarded in favor of his most famous nickname, \"Stone Cold\". The name itself was inspired by a cup of tea, while his persona for the new name was inspired by serial killer Richard Kuklinski. Austin wrestled Savio Vega on the March 11 episode of \"Raw\" to a double countout, before defeating Vega in his first WrestleMania appearance at WrestleMania XII on March 31. At on April 28, Austin lost to Vega in a rematch. At on May 26, Austin lost a Caribbean strap match to Vega. In accordance to the pre-match stipulations, DiBiase was forced to leave the WWF, giving Austin the opportunity to forge his own path. Austin later told announcer Dok Hendrix that he had purposely lost the match in order to rid himself of DiBiase, who in reality was headed for rival promotion WCW.\n\nAustin's rise to stardom began at the 1996 King of the Ring, where he won the King of the Ring tournament by defeating Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts in the finals. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous promo during his coronation, telling Roberts: \"You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your Psalms, talk about ... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!\". Austin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an un-telegraphed stroke of luck. Triple H was originally scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring, but was punished for the infamous Curtain Call incident that had transpired earlier that year. \"Austin 3:16\" ultimately became one of the most popular catchphrases in wrestling history and subsequently the slogan became one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history. It is also credited as the iconic moment that began the WWF's \"Attitude Era\".\nAustin spoke about Bret Hart, challenging him constantly and taunting him relentlessly. Hart finally accepted Austin's challenge and returned to the WWF in October 1996. At Survivor Series, in a match to determine the number-one contender to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Austin lost to Hart when Hart used the turnbuckle to push himself backwards while locked in the Million Dollar Dream and pinned Austin (this match would go on to create the foundations for the eventual year-long feud between the two). The match came hot on the heels of an incident broadcast live on \"Raw Is War\", which saw Austin \"break into\" Brian Pillman's house, with Pillman holding a gun. During the 1997 Royal Rumble match, Austin was originally eliminated by Bret Hart, but the officials did not see it, and he snuck back into the ring and eliminated Hart by throwing him over the ropes, winning the match himself. This led to the first-ever pay-per-view main event of Austin's WWF career at , after Shawn Michaels suffered a knee injury and left the WWF World Heavyweight Championship suddenly vacant. Austin was eliminated early from the four-way match at In Your House 13 for the title after injuring his own knee, but was involved in the finish which saw Hart win his fourth WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost the next night on \"Raw Is War\" to Sycho Sid due to Austin's interference, continuing his feud with Hart. At WrestleMania 13, Hart defeated Austin in a Submission match with Ken Shamrock as a special referee. During the match, Austin had been cut and was bleeding profusely from his face, but he still refused to tap out when Hart locked in his Sharpshooter. Austin finally passed out from blood loss, still held in the Sharpshooter, and lost the match. After the bell, Hart continued to hold the Sharpshooter on Austin, who despite his wounds refused any assistance back to the locker room, thus turning Hart heel and Austin babyface in a rare double-turn. However, Austin portrayed an anti-hero instead of a traditional babyface. Austin eventually got his revenge on Hart in the main event of , in a match to determine the number-one contender to The Undertaker's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Austin won when Hart was disqualified due to assistance from The British Bulldog, earning him a title match against The Undertaker at . Austin faced Hart once again in a street fight on the April 21 episode of \"Raw Is War\", injuring his opponent's leg with a steel chair during the bout. The match was ruled a no contest, but Austin proceeded to beat Hart while he was on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance. At A Cold Day In Hell, Austin had The Undertaker down with the Stone Cold Stunner, but distracted by timely interference on the part of Brian Pillman, Austin's old tag team partner from WCW, who rang the bell before Austin got the cover, Undertaker then nailed Austin with a Tombstone Piledriver and achieved the victory off the distraction.\n\nDuring this time, Austin found a way to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions. On May 26, 1997, Austin and Shawn Michaels defeated Owen Hart and The British Bulldog for the title. They held the title until July 14, before Michaels was forced to vacate due to an injury. That same night a tournament was held to determine who would face Austin and a partner of his choosing for the vacant championship. Hart and Bulldog won the tournament, with Austin refusing to pick a partner and choosing to wrestle the former tag team champions by himself. Late in the match, a debuting Dude Love came out to offer assistance and Austin became a two-time tag team champion. Austin continued his feud with the Hart family, becoming embroiled in a heated rivalry with Owen Hart, who pinned a distracted Austin and secured victory for The Hart Foundation in the ten-man Tag Team match main event of , where Austin was partnered with Ken Shamrock, Goldust and The Legion of Doom.\n\nAt SummerSlam, Austin and Owen Hart faced each other with Hart's Intercontinental Championship on the line and an added stipulation that Austin would have to kiss Hart's buttocks if he lost. During the match, Hart botched a piledriver and dropped Austin on his head, resulting in a legitimate broken neck and temporary paralysis for Austin. As Hart stalled by baiting the audience, Austin managed to crawl over and pin Hart using a roll-up to win the Intercontinental Championship. A visibly injured and dazed Austin was helped to his feet by a number of referees and led to the back. Due to the severity of his neck injury, Austin was forced to relinquish both the Intercontinental Championship and the Tag Team Championships. On September 22, 1997 on the first-ever \"Raw Is War\" to be broadcast from Madison Square Garden, Hart was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Austin entered the ring with five NYPD officers following, and assaulted Hart. As it looked like Austin was going to fight the officers, Vince McMahon ran into the ring to lecture Austin about why he could not be physically able to compete. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested as part of the storyline. Austin was sidelined until Survivor Series. However, in the interim he made several appearances, one being at where he was involved in the finish of a match between Hart and Faarooq, which was the final match in a tournament for the Intercontinental Championship. Austin hit Faarooq with the Intercontinental Championship belt while the referee's back was turned, causing Hart to win the match. Austin's motive was to keep the Intercontinental Championship around Hart's waist, as demonstrated when he interfered in Hart's matches on the October 20 and 27 episodes of \"Raw Is War\". Austin regained the Intercontinental Championship from Hart at Survivor Series.\n\nWith Hart out of the way, Austin set his sights on The Rock, who stole Austin's title belt on the November 17 episode of \"Raw Is War\" after Austin suffered a beating by his Nation of Domination stablemates. In the weeks to come, The Rock began declaring himself to be \"the best damn Intercontinental Champion ever\". The Rock kept possession of the title belt until , when Austin defeated him to retain the title and get his title belt back. As Austin had used his pickup truck to aid in his victory, McMahon ordered him to defend the title against The Rock the next night on \"Raw Is War\". In an act of defiance after forfeiting the title to The Rock, Austin tossed the title belt into the Piscataqua River.\n\nAfter Bret Hart's controversial departure for WCW, Austin and Shawn Michaels were the top stars in the company. Austin won the 1998 Royal Rumble, lastly eliminating The Rock. The next night on \"Raw Is War\", Austin interrupted Vince McMahon in his presentation of Mike Tyson, who was making a special appearance, over the objection of McMahon referring to Tyson as \"the baddest man on the planet\". Austin flipped off Tyson, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon's embarrassment, who began to publicly disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion. Tyson was later announced as \"the special enforcer\" for the main event at WrestleMania XIV, although he appeared to be aligning himself with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Shawn Michaels' stable D-Generation X. This led to Austin's WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against Michaels at WrestleMania XIV, which he won with help from Tyson, who turned on DX by making the deciding three-count against Michaels and later hit him with his knock-out punch. This was Michaels' last match until 2002 as he had suffered two legitimate herniated discs and another completely crushed at the hands of The Undertaker in a casket match at the Royal Rumble. With Michaels' absence and winning the WWF World Heavyweight title, the Austin Era was ushered in.\nOn the \"Raw Is War\" after Austin won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Vince McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature and that things could be done \"the easy way or the hard way\". Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to \"play ball\" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, punch his boss in the \"corporate grapefruits\" and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at , where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\" (Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at King of the Ring. Austin lost the WWF Championship to Kane in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.\n\nAustin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on \"Raw Is War\". Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at SummerSlam. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at , where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on . Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon later fired him, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at \"gunpoint\", which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read \"Bang! 3:16\". During that segment, McMahon also learned that Stone Cold was later re-signed by his son, Shane McMahon. In the semifinals of the Survivor Series tournament to award the vacant WWF Championship, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on \"Raw Is War\", Judge Mills Lane ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory. However, because the title would not change hands via disqualification, The Rock still kept the championship. At , Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the 1999 Royal Rumble.\nAustin's next definitive chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the 1999 Royal Rumble match. On \"Raw Is War\", McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon slipped out of the ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It turned out to be a trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of The Corporation. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announcers table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to Big Boss Man and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.\n\nWith McMahon turning down his number-one contender spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot the next night on \"Raw Is War\". At , Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a steel cage match, with the WWF Championship opportunity at WrestleMania XV at stake. During the match, Paul Wight made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor. Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship. Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at , in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at Over the Edge. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, Stephanie and Linda McMahon made Austin the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap ladder match at King of the Ring with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on \"Raw Is War\", Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on \"Raw Is War\" and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at Fully Loaded, where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.\n\nAustin held on to the WWF Championship until SummerSlam when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring Triple H. Triple H was originally scheduled to win his first championship at the event, but Austin refused to drop it to him, believing Triple H was not over enough with the crowd yet, so Mankind would be used as a transitional champion, dropping the title to Triple H the next night on \"Raw Is War\". Austin would get his rematch at No Mercy against Triple H, but he lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer that was meant for Triple H. When Survivor Series rolled around, Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship against Triple H and The Rock. However, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot. Austin then underwent neck surgery by Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, due to Austin's injury from the piledriver at SummerSlam two years prior. He was away for a nine-month rehabilitation, with the car angle as his reason for leaving.\n\nIn April 2000, Austin appeared at Backlash, attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin's official return at Unforgiven, Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin down at Survivor Series the previous year. Rikishi admitted to being the driver because \"he did it for The Rock\". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with him gone, Rock, a fellow Samoan, would be able to ascend to the top of the company. At No Mercy, Austin was back to face Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin mentioned he was going to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, the match being deemed no contest and Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and Kurt Angle, Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head, and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At Survivor Series, Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's automobile with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. Austin won his third Royal Rumble in January 2001, last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at No Way Out in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one.\n\nWith The Rock defeating Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin was set to face The Rock at WrestleMania. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, Debra, being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon, but then relieved of that role after failing to prevent a brawl between Rock and Austin. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Austin faced The Rock for the second time and before the match began it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside, then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time. After the match, Austin celebrated by shaking hands with Mr. McMahon, turning Austin heel.\n\nThe next night on \"Raw Is War\", after teasing a quick face turn, the heel turn continued and he also altered his character considerably over the next few months; in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect from the fans and wrestlers that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him and even going so far as to hugging him and bringing him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer and together with Austin viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on \"SmackDown!\", when, during an interview with Jim Ross about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves The Two-Man Power Trip.\n\nAustin and Triple H were the top heels in the company, and feuding with The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating Kane and The Undertaker for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Backlash, they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. At Judgment Day, Triple H lost his Intercontinental title to Kane. The following night on \"Raw Is War\", Austin and Triple H wrestled against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit with the tag team titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle. As planned, the team lost the tag team titles at the end of the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's \"SmackDown!\", criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, with Kurt Angle joining the group as Triple H's replacement. For most of the next month leading to King of the Ring, he constantly fell victim to a double submission involving Jericho's Walls of Jericho and Benoit's Crippler Crossface and did not wrestle as he was nursing an injury, but continued to feud with the reigning tag team champions, eventually costing them the titles on the \"SmackDown!\" preceding King of the Ring against the Dudley Boyz. Austin defeated Jericho and Benoit in a Triple Threat match, despite interference from the debuting Booker T. Stone Cold suffered a back injury during the match after Booker T dropped Stone Cold through the announcer's table.\nAfter King of the Ring, Austin was left without a feud as Benoit was lost for the next year after neck surgery and Jericho moved on to other things. He began a small spat with Angle over who was McMahon's biggest supporter. Meanwhile, the purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) by McMahon began to bear fruit as The Invasion began. McMahon was not able to fight off the invading WCW wrestlers, and when they formed an alliance with a group of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni that were signed to the WWF and both Shane and Stephanie McMahon were now aligned against their father, McMahon's empire began to crumble and he had zero help from his two biggest stars at the time. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his WWF Championship, as well as an annoying tag-along. Finally, a frustrated McMahon called Austin out and demanded that he bring \"the old Stone Cold\" back, even going as far as asking Austin to give him a Stone Cold Stunner, so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at the upcoming InVasion pay-per-view in July. A dejected Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of \"Raw Is War\" he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face again. At InVasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and The Undertaker and Kane against the team of WCW's Booker T and Diamond Dallas Page and ECW's Rhyno and The Dudley Boyz. Late in the match, however, as Angle had Booker in the ankle lock, Austin turned on Angle by Stunning him and joined the Alliance, turning Austin heel once again. The reason why Austin did this was that he felt McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, that he was trying to get in touch with The Rock to return, and that he himself was \"unappreciated\" when McMahon insisted he return to the old Austin. Austin was immediately made the Alliance's new leader and began to feud with Angle over his WWF Championship.\n\nAustin lost his title to Angle at Unforgiven by submitting to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch due to his hand being under the ropes. Austin received that rematch on the October 8 episode of \"Raw\" and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance. Austin then began feuding with Alliance member Rob Van Dam, who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at No Mercy later that month and won by pinning the latter. On the October 29 episode of \"Raw\", Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. Survivor Series was coming up and it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and Big Show.\n\nAt Survivor Series, Austin was one of the last two wrestlers in the match, with The Rock being the other, and was the last remaining hope for the Alliance to survive. Late in the match, Austin attempted to win the match with the Rock Bottom, the Rock's finishing maneuver, but failed to earn a three count. He then kicked out of his own Stone Cold Stunner, which the Rock nailed on him, and attacked two referees including Alliance referee Nick Patrick. With the officials down, Angle ran to the ring and picked up Austin's title belt. He then entered the ring and struck Austin with it, betraying the Alliance and enabling The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom on Austin for the pin and the victory. With that, the InVasion ended, the Alliance was forced to disband, and Austin's future in the company was in question. Eventually, McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the title and award it to Angle for his actions. Just before he could, Ric Flair returned to the WWF for the first time since his 1993 departure and announced he was now half owner of the company. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his title belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again.\n\nFlair then decided that Austin would face off against The Rock, who was still in possession of the former WCW World Heavyweight Championship (which was renamed the World Championship), at the upcoming Vengeance pay-per-view in December to unify the titles. However, since Austin was still feuding with Angle and Rock had an unresolved feud with Jericho over his own title, McMahon overruled Flair and said that both men would wrestle their respective rivals for their respective titles at Vengeance, with the winners to face each other and the winner of that match to be crowned Undisputed WWF Champion. Austin won his first match by defeating Angle and faced World Champion Jericho in the unification match. Austin lost the match and his title after McMahon and Booker T interfered. Immediately after, Austin and Booker T began feuding which led to various fights in strange venues, such as a church confessional, a bingo hall and a supermarket.\n\nBeginning 2002, although Austin's character remained with the WWF's most popular wrestlers as top face, his upcoming storylines in the build-up to WrestleMania were somewhat questionable compared to those of his previous years. In the 2002 Royal Rumble, Triple H made his long-awaited return from injury, with him and Austin two of the last four participants in the ring along with Kurt Angle and Mr. Perfect. Austin was eliminated by Kurt Angle, but he shortly went back in the ring and hit all three with a steel chair. A few days later on \"Raw,\" he defeated Kurt Angle to earn a shot at Chris Jericho's Undisputed WWF Championship at No Way Out.\n\nIn the build-up to No Way Out, McMahon had re-signed the New World Order (nWo), who started a feud with him. Austin refused a beer gift from them, and the nWo costing him his match against Jericho later that night. Problems in the backstage creativity were however then seemingly beginning to surface. Austin was reported as being unhappy regarding Hulk Hogan's return to the WWF, and was reported as refusing to lose to Hogan in a proposed match at WrestleMania X8, while Hogan reportedly told McMahon the same regarding losing to Austin. In recent years, Austin has this to say about why the match never took place: \"I guarantee you, if my head had been at a little different place, then by all rights, a [match] should have happened\", Austin told JR. \"Physically and mentally where I was at, I could go. I think Hogan probably would have been a step or two behind that. That wasn't acceptable to me, and I didn't want to slow myself down. I say that with all due respect to Hulk Hogan, because he had a hellacious run. That was my thought process back in the day. I didn't think we could deliver\". Consequently, the match was re-billed as The Rock defeating Hogan, whilst Austin defeated Scott Hall, climaxing his feud with the nWo.\n\nIn a surprise altercation, the next night on \"Raw\", Austin refused to show up and took a week-long break without the company's consent, claiming exhaustion. McMahon claimed his actions caused fury among fans who had paid to see him that night. Austin returned on the April 1, 2002 episode of \"Raw\", the first of the new \"brand extension\" era. The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at Backlash, which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo, and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at Judgment Day. In an interview on WWE's premier Internet program, \"Byte This!\", in May 2002, Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did. The commentators struggled to keep Austin's opinions on a neutral wavelength, leading to the WWE apologising to fans for the outburst and stated it was not part of Austin's current or upcoming storylines. McMahon responded a week later on the same show playing down the outburst, claiming that Austin was merely the type of wrestler who was occasionally difficult to work with. \n\nThe WWE rehired Eddie Guerrero for Austin to feud with, while also prepping Austin for a feud with Brock Lesnar. However, Austin vetoed any matches that would result in him losing to Lesnar and ultimately walked out of the company. Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak and did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of the magnitude that Austin held. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin's growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra (see below).\n\nAfter Austin no-showed the June 10 episode of \"Raw\", his storylines were dropped. Austin walked out again, publicly stating he felt bad storylines were presented to him by the creative team. This time his departure was for good. McMahon, along with longtime Austin supporter and real-life friend Jim Ross, buried Austin on WWE programming, referring to him as \"taking his ball and going home\" because he was not getting his way, whilst also explaining to the fans that neither he nor Ross were able to persuade Austin to change his mind. McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Ric Flair, but it was transitioned to Eddie Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on \"Raw\" that night, despite being drafted to \"SmackDown!\", and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon. Austin's merchandise continued to sell greatly in the weeks following his departure, however with no sign of a return likely to be seen, the company stopped marketing his character, his merchandise, and removed his profile from WWE.com.\n\nFor the remainder of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, by the end of the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with \"WWE Raw Magazine\", he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and the way in which he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers, claiming he had no problem with Scott Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about his singles match with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to the expectations of his fans or Hall's, and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with Kevin Nash re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends. In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.\nAustin confessed he had a major rift with Triple H's role in the company upon his return in 2002, but insisted as of 2003 they resolved their issues. In addition, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure. In February, Austin returned at No Way Out by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania in another short match against Bischoff on \"Raw\", but was then defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania XIX, who returned about the same time as a smug, \"sell out\" villain, which, ultimately, became Austin's last official match in WWE. \n\nThe night after on \"Raw\", Austin was fired in the storyline by Bischoff on medical grounds. The next day, Austin gave an interview on WWE.com announcing his retirement from wrestling, although he stated that he and Vince McMahon had reached an agreement seeing him only appear in non-wrestling roles on a weekly basis. In reference to Bischoff firing him on \"Raw\" that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on \"Raw\" were legitimate and mainly related back to his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, and had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001. He confessed wrestling against the advice of his doctors up until his departure in 2002, which forced him to quit wrestling, and cited this as the sole reason as to why he suddenly departed, with doctors advising an awkward or violent move performed on him could have resulted in Austin being permanently disabled or resulting in death.\n\nThe following month, Austin began his non-wrestling career with WWE and began a fresh storyline when he was brought back by Linda McMahon as the Raw Co-General Manager. He continued this storyline for the remainder of the year, still showing wrestling moves including the \"Stone Cold Stunner\" and several exchanges of punches and kicks, although limiting regularity of these being performed. On the November 17, 2003, episode of \"Raw\", Austin was \"fired\" from \"Raw\" as the result of a stipulation in a match at Survivor Series where Austin's hand-picked team of wrestlers failed to beat Bischoff's team of wrestlers. After Survivor Series, Mick Foley would become the new Co-General Manager of \"Raw\", and began a (kayfabe) petition to have Austin re-instated. Austin quickly returned to WWE television before the end of 2003 when he was part of the \"Tribute to the Troops\" taped live in front of U.S. troops in Iraq, posing and attacking Mr. McMahon. He returned to \"Raw\" on December 29 as its \"Sheriff\", giving a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" to Eric Bischoff and rehiring Shawn Michaels, who had just been \"fired\" by Bischoff.\n\nAustin appeared on-and-off as 2004 began, culminating in him being the special guest referee for the Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg match at WrestleMania XX. On April 17, WWE announced that they were unable to settle long-running contract disputes with Austin and had again parted ways.\n\nAustin made his first appearance on WWE programming in a year at WrestleMania 21 where he was confronted by Roddy Piper in \"Piper's Pit\", until Carlito interrupted to insult both. This resulted in Carlito receiving a stunner from Austin and Piper throwing him out of the ring. The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" as well. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at ECW One Night Stand in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Eric Bischoff. He returned at \"Raw Homecoming\", delivering \"Stone Cold Stunners\" to Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon, Stephanie McMahon and Linda McMahon. An angle including Jim Ross being fired led to a match in which Austin agreed to face Jonathan Coachman at Taboo Tuesday, with the stipulation of Ross regaining his announcing job had Austin won and Austin losing his own job had he lost. Austin hurt his back prior to the match and could not wrestle unless he was heavily medicated, so the match was cancelled. To explain away his failure to appear at Taboo Tuesday, Vince McMahon said on \"Raw\" that Austin had been involved in an accident, thus preventing him from competing. Batista substituted for Austin, defeating Coachman along with Vader and Goldust. The stipulation was dropped due to Austin not competing. He returned to WWE briefly to face John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) in a beer drinking contest at the March 5, 2006, episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". Austin inducted Bret Hart into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006.\nAustin returned to WWE programming (appearing on \"Raw\", \"ECW\", and \"SmackDown!\") in March 2007, partially to promote his starring role in the release of WWE Films' production, \"The Condemned\". On March 31, 2007, Austin inducted Jim Ross into the WWE Hall of Fame. At WrestleMania 23, Austin, as a special guest referee, officiated the match between Bobby Lashley and Umaga. The stipulation for the match was that if Lashley lost, Donald Trump's head would be shaved, and if Umaga lost, Mr. McMahon's head would suffer that fate. During the match, Austin delivered \"Stone Cold Stunners\" to Umaga, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon and Donald Trump. Lashley won the match and Trump, Austin and Lashley then shaved Mr. McMahon's head. Austin ended by hitting the \"Stone Cold Stunner\" on McMahon, as well as Donald Trump. He then appeared in a video on the June 11 episode of \"Raw\" as part of \"Mr. McMahon's Appreciation Night\", where he shared his thoughts on his past feuds with McMahon. Austin appeared on the August 18, 2007 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", as a possible illegitimate child of Mr. McMahon and stunned McMahon and Jonathan Coachman. He then appeared at SummerSlam to aid Matt Hardy in battling Montel Vontavious Porter in a beer drinking contest. The match ended in a no contest after Austin handed a beer to MVP and gave him the \"Stone Cold Stunner\". Austin made another appearance at Cyber Sunday, where he guest refereed a World Heavyweight Championship match between Batista and The Undertaker. On the November 5 episode of \"Raw\", Austin made an appearance to confront Santino Marella for criticizing \"The Condemned\". The argument ended as Marella received a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" from Austin, who then walked backstage only to return with a Budweiser beer truck to hose down Marella and his valet Maria with beer. Austin appeared on the \"Raw 15th Anniversary\" special, attacking Vince McMahon. On October 26, 2008, at Cyber Sunday, Austin was the special guest referee during a match between Batista and Chris Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship.\nOn the January 12, 2009, episode of \"Raw\", Austin was announced to be the first member of the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2009. He was inducted by his long-term on-screen rival Vince McMahon, who referred to Austin as \"the greatest WWE [wrestler] of all time\". During the induction, Austin said he was officially closing the door on his wrestling career and starting a new chapter in his life. \n\nAustin appeared as the guest host of \"Raw\" on the March 15, 2010, episode, where he moderated a contract signing between Vince McMahon and Bret Hart for their match at WrestleMania XXVI. In early 2011, Austin was announced as the head trainer and host for the revival of \"Tough Enough\". On the March 7 episode of \"Raw\", Austin interrupted the contract signing of the special guest referee to the Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler match at WrestleMania XXVII, originally scheduled to be John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield; Austin attacked Layfield and signed the contract instead. Although Lawler won by submission, the Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision and disqualified Lawler, claiming that Austin had \"overstepped his authority\". He appeared on \"Raw\" the following night with the cast from \"Tough Enough\", while also getting into an altercation with The Miz and Alex Riley. On the June 6 episode of \"Raw\", Austin appeared to declare Andy Leavine as the winner of \"Tough Enough\". He also served as the special guest referee in the evening's tag team main event, John Cena and Alex Riley against The Miz and R-Truth, hitting Miz with a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" and aiding Cena. However, the Anonymous Raw General Manager chimed in and the Anonymous Raw General Manager's ringside mouthpiece Michael Cole announced that since Austin had abused his authority as referee, The Miz and R-Truth had won via disqualification. Austin did not take kindly to the Anonymous Raw General Manager overturning his decision and Cole also received a \"Stone Cold Stunner\", which was followed with another \"Attitude Adjustment\" courtesy of Cena. Austin and Cena closed the show, celebrating with a beer bash. Austin appeared as the special guest General Manager on the \"WWE All-Stars\" episode of \"Raw\". During the show, Austin destroyed the Anonymous Raw General Manager's laptop by running over it with his ATV.\nAustin appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, 2014, with Hulk Hogan and The Rock in the opening segment. Austin made an appearance on the October 19, 2015 episode of \"Raw\", introducing The Undertaker and promoting the WrestleMania 32 event. Austin again appeared on \"Raw\" the following week, where he promoted the \"WWE 2K16\" video game in a backstage segment.\n\nAt WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, Austin, alongside Mick Foley and Shawn Michaels, confronted The League of Nations, where Austin delivered a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" to Rusev and King Barrett. While Austin was celebrating with Michaels and Foley, The New Day tried to convince Austin to dance with them in celebration. While Austin reluctantly at first danced along, he attacked Xavier Woods with a \"Stone Cold Stunner\". On \"Raw\"'s 25th anniversary episode on the January 22, 2018, Austin appeared and performed a \"Stone Cold Stunner\" on Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon.\n\nAustin had guest roles on \"Celebrity Deathmatch\" and Seasons 4 and 5 of CBS's \"Nash Bridges\", where he played San Francisco Police Department Inspector Jake Cage. He has appeared on \"V.I.P\" and \"Dilbert\". His motion picture debut was in a supporting role as Guard Dunham in the 2005 remake of \"The Longest Yard\". Austin had his first starring film role, as Jack Conrad, a dangerous convict awaiting execution in a Salvadoran prison, who takes part in an illegal deathmatch game that is being broadcast to the public in the 2007 action film \"The Condemned\".\n\nIn 2010, Austin appeared in \"The Expendables\" as Dan Paine, the bodyguard and right-hand man for the primary antagonist of the film, played by Eric Roberts. It was his last American theatrical release film until 2013. Austin appeared as Hugo Panzer on television series \"Chuck\". He has also starred in \"Damage\", \"Hunt to Kill\", \"The Stranger\", \"Tactical Force\", \"Knockout\", \"Recoil\", \"Maximum Conviction\", and \"The Package\".\n\nIn April 2013, Austin started a weekly podcast named \"The Steve Austin Show\" which is family-friendly, while his second podcast \"The Steve Austin Show – Unleashed!\" is more adult-oriented. Both shows are available at PodcastOne. As of May 2015, the podcasts averaged 793,000 downloads a week and had nearly 200 million overall downloads. In February 2018, Austin announced that the \"Unleashed\" version of the podcast had been dropped and merged with the family-friendly version in order to appeal to more sponsors. The podcast has also transitioned to a live broadcast for the WWE Network (podcasted after a short exclusivity period) with monthly specials since 2014.\n\nAustin hosted the reality competition show \"Redneck Island\" on CMT, which began in June 2012 and concluded with its fifth season in April 2016. In July 2014, his reality competition show \"Steve Austin's Broken Skull Challenge\" premiered on CMT. The show entered into its fifth season in September 2017.\n\nStone Cold has appeared in almost all of the WWF and WWE video games. Austin has also appeared as the cover athlete for several video games, including \"WWE 2K16\". \n\nAustin dated Kathryn Burrhus throughout high school and college, and the two married on November 24, 1990. Nonetheless, Austin pursued a relationship with Jeanie Clarke (\"Lady Blossom\"), with whom he was working. His marriage to Burrhus was quickly annulled on August 7, 1992, and Austin and Clarke married on December 18, 1992. Together, they have two daughters, Stephanie (born in 1992), and Cassidy (born in 1996). Cassidy lives with her mother in England, while Stephanie resides in Los Angeles. Austin also adopted Jade, Clarke's daughter with former husband Chris Adams. Austin and Clarke divorced on May 10, 1999. Jade lives in the U.S. with her husband and son.\n\nOn September 13, 2000, Austin married wrestling valet Debra Marshall.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Wrestling Observer\" newsletter reported that Austin legally changed his real name (Steven Williams) to his wrestling name Steve Austin. In late 2009, Austin married his fourth wife, Kristin, with whom he splits his time between his home in Marina Del Rey, California and his property in Nevada that he has named the Broken Skull Ranch 2.0. \n\nOn June 15, 2002, Debra Marshall called police to the couple's home and told officers that Austin had beaten her on the head, back, and legs then stormed out of the house before police arrived. According to police reports, Debra suffered a swollen cheek and eye and bruises to her back and shoulder. Austin called the house while officers were there and was told he was in trouble but declined a request to return to the house or report to the police station. On August 14, 2002, Austin was arrested and charged with domestic abuse. He pleaded no contest on November 25, 2002, and was given a year's probation, a $1,000 fine, and ordered to carry out 80 hours of community service.\n\nMarshall would later claim that Austin was a steroid user, and this incident was the result of roid rage. Austin filed for divorce from Marshall on July 22, 2002, and the divorce was finalized on February 5, 2003.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, Austin allegedly assaulted his girlfriend Tess Broussard during a dispute at his Texas home, according to a San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground. Broussard landed on her hands and knees, and later told officers she had injured her right hand. Broussard provided a written statement to police, who photographed her injuries.\n\nOn June 29, 2007, Marshall told \"Fox News\" that Austin beat her three times. She also stated that WWE knew of the abuse, working to conceal the bruises on her face, and kept her from revealing that Austin hit her, as it would cost the company millions of dollars.\n\nDuring his early years as wrestler, Austin was a technical wrestler. However, after his neck injury against Owen Hart in 1997, he changed his style from technical to brawler. His most famous finishing move is the Stone Cold Stunner, or simply Stunner. During his time as The Ringmaster he used the Million Dollar Dream as finisher, since it was Ted DiBiase's finisher. During his time in WCW, Austin used the Stun Gun as finisher.\n\nOne of Austin's taunts during the Attitude Era was to show the middle finger. In August 2001, Austin cut a promo, debuting his catchphrase \"What?\", which is used today by fans when they want to mock wrestlers during promos.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36876180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36876180", "title": "Tangendorf disc brooch", "text": "Tangendorf disc brooch\n\nThe Tangendorf disc brooch is an Iron Age fibula from the 3rd century AD, which was dug up in 1930 from the sand of a Bronze Age tumulus near Tangendorf, Toppenstedt, Harburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. The front of the elaborately crafted garment fibula is decorated with a rear-facing four-legged animal, probably a dog or a deer. It is one of Harburg's most important finds from the period of the Roman Empire, and is in the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.\n\nThe Tangendorf disc brooch was found in 1930 in a tumulus (at ) on a parcel of land known as \"\" (in the black dorn), on the outer northwest corner of Tangendorf. While digging off sand from a Bronze Age grave mound in his field, farmer Heinrich Wille found the fibula together with a bronze hair clip (German: ) and a bronze spear blade. The hair clip and the spear blade were passed to the Helms-Museum; however, the brooch was left with a teacher of the Tangendorf elementary school.\n\nIn the summer of 1938 the teacher asked Helms-Museum's director Willi Wegewitz to pick up a neolithic stone axe. While handing over the stone axe the brooch was rediscovered in a drawer, among the school's exercise equipment. The teacher was considering disposing of the brooch because he thought it was simply a worthless modern object without any archaeological significance. Wegewitz immediately arranged an excavation of the tumulus. The mound's original diameter of was still clearly visible on the ploughed field and further remnants of a hair clip were discovered. The farmer revealed that he had found the brooch on the edge of the grave mound in the amount of the increased soil in sand; he had not noticed that \"Erdverfärbungen\" (earth discolorations), might indicate a cremation burial.\n\nThe fibula is a multilayered structure. Its face consists of a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of . This is fixed by three silver rivet pins to an identically sized, thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate was filled with a now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (tin pest). The decoration consists of a quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.\n\nDue to the improper recovery without accurate documentation of the find, accurate statements can not be given about the archaeological context the disc brooch to the Iron Age burial and the Bronze Age secondary burial. It is also not known how many additional grave goods were lost. Compared to similar finds, all of these burials should have usually contained other jewellery and utensils. Based on the statements of farmer Wille, the Iron Age grave with the disc brooch was suspected to be a cremation burial, on top of a pre-existing burial mound, a suspicion which is supported from many other Iron Age grave findings. The brooch is a high-quality, most likely Germanic, goldsmiths' work, inspired by Roman models. The animal depicted is interpreted as a dog or an antler-less deer. The reason for the depiction of a rear-facing animal may be found in Germanic art conventions or it may based on mythological ideas, but it can also be attributed to the fact that it allows a larger depiction of the animal within the available space. The protruding edge of the rear silver disc and the remains of organic material beneath the copper disk suggests that the front plates of the fibula was surrounded by an ornate ring of ivory of about width.\n\nA similar, diameter, disc brooch is known from a burial at Häven in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, but depicts a forward-facing animal. The similarities in manufacture and decoration are so striking that Wegewitz believed they were produced in the same workshop. Parallels of the illustrated animal are known from archaeological finds on a silver goblet from Nordrup (near Skaftelev in Slagelse Municipality, Zealand (Denmark), a belt decoration plate from Skedemosse (Sweden), a drawing on a Quadi vessel shard of the 2nd century from Prikas, Olomouc, Moravia (Czech Republic), and on the gold bracteate of Ponsdorf Mistelbach District, Lower Austria. According to Willi Wegewitz the Tangendorf disc brooch is one of the most magnificent brooches of the period of the Roman Empire from northern Germany and Scandinavia.\n\nAfter detailed analysis of the construction, Hans Drescher manufactured two reconstructions of the Tangendorf disc brooch, one copy for the Helms-Museum and the second for the Niedersächsisches Landesmuseum Hannover. Drescher used ivory for the organic ring, giving a decorative contrast between its white color and the golden disc. Drescher published his detailed findings in 1955.\n\nSince 2002, Toppenstedt has used a stylized representation of the brooch in its coat of arms.\n\n"}
{"id": "40286608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40286608", "title": "The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food", "text": "The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food\n\nThe Book of Tasty and Healthy Food (\"\", \"Kniga o vkusnoi i zdorovoi pishche\") is a Russian cookbook written by scientists from the Institute of Nutrition of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. The cookbook was first published in 1939, and a further edition was published in 1952. An English translation (by Boris Ushumirskiy) appeared in 2012.\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution, the official ideology promoted communal food preparation and dining, to maximise use of labour and resources and to liberate women to work. However, combined with widespread food shortages, this resulted in poor food quality and limited choice.\n\nAnastas Mikoyan, who was People's Commissar of the Food Industry of the USSR in the 1930s, became convinced that the USSR needed to modernise the way it produced and consumed food. He travelled widely, bringing many innovations back to the USSR, including the manufacture of canned goods and the mass production of ice cream. In the late 1930s, he spearheaded a project to produce a home cookbook which would encourage a return to the domestic kitchen.\n\nPrior to its introduction, the staple cookbook of Russian cuisine had been Elena Molokhovets' \"A Gift to Young Housewives\", which had been published in numerous editions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Russia and remained in many households after the Revolution. However, as it had been aimed at middle- and upper-class households, it was frowned upon as being bourgeois. Moreover, many of its recipes relied on ingredients that were unavailable and techniques that were impractical in Soviet Russia. The new cookbook was thus aimed to become a reference work for the new Soviet cuisine.\n\nAs with most publications at this time in the USSR, the cookbook had both a practical and propagandistic purpose. On the practical side, it contained recipes using modern techniques and foods and provided advice on diet, hygiene and etiquette. As propaganda, it began with a chapter on the successes of the domestic food industry and its recipes combined ingredients from across the many republics of the USSR. Moreover, as many of these ingredients were usually unavailable, the cookbook also served as an image of what the USSR aspired to be, a land of abundance and variation.\n\nRecipes range from the sumptuous (sturgeon in jelly, cold piglet with horseradish) to the everyday (cabbage stuffed with meat, bean soup). They were accompanied with lavish full-page illustrations of prepared dishes and food production.\n\nBritish chef Mary Berry modified and improved one of the book's recipes, which combined herring with egg, on her BBC 2 cookery program \"Easter Feasts\" (first aired April 13 2017).\n\n"}

Its front-gable orientation, accentuated with a multi-paned, triangular pedimental window, reflects the popular Greek Revival style. \n\nIn 1952 the Shelburne Museum rolled the building to the grounds on a specially laid railroad track. The first level re-creates a late nineteenth-century general store with fully stocked shelves displaying the types of goods available for purchase. Smaller adjoining rooms offer a variety of community services including a post office, a barbershop, and a taproom. The adjacent wing houses a replication of a nineteenth-century Apothecary Shop that the museum added after moving the building to the grounds. \n\nThe building’s second story exhibits medical equipment, tools, and furnishings spanning the first half of the 20th century. Replicated settings include a dentist’s laboratory and examining room, the offices of an ophthalmologist, and those of an ear, nose, and throat physician. \n\n\n"}

It aims to address people's prejudices by helping them to talk to those they would not normally meet. The organisation uses a library analogy of lending people rather than books. These people have \"experienced prejudice, social exclusion or stigma,\" and participants can ask them questions so as to \"learn about the other person and also challenge their own prejudices.\" The Human Library Organization is active in over 80 countries, in which there are a few permanent Human Libraries but most happen as events.\n\nThe organization began in Copenhagen in 2000 when the first Human Library event was held at Roskilde Festival. The event was run by Ronni and Dany Abergel, Asma Mouna, Christoffer Erichsen, then working at the Danish Youth NGO Stop Volden (which translates to Stop the Violence), inspired by the American Stop the Violence Movement. The first event ran four days with eight hours of conversations each day and more than 1000 people took part.\n\nThe next Human Library was hosted in Oslo, Norway by Ronni Abergel for the Nordic Minister Councils youth assembly \"Unge I Norden\". The event was prepared in partnership with Terese Mungai-Foyn and went on to inspire the establishment of the Norwegian Human Library program in 2003. \n\nThe first permanent Human Library was established in Lismore, Australia in 2006.\n\n"}
