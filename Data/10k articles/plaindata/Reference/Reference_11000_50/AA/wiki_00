A bias incident is different from a hate crime in that it does not necessarily involve criminal activity. Examples include graffiti, verbal abuse, and distribution of hate-group literature.\n\nOrganizations such as the U.S. Community Relations Service, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the Anti-Defamation League recommend that school administrators denounce bias incidents on their campuses regardless of whether a crime is committed. Reasons for having such a policy include preventing minor incidents from escalating into violence and protecting the reputation of the school and its surrounding community. Supporters of such policies say that they help maintain an atmosphere of civility in which people feel free to express themselves without fear of retaliation. A 2014 article in \"The Daily Caller\" argues that bias response policies that do not clearly define their scope are a threat to free speech because they could punish the expression of legitimate opinions.\n\nA response to a bias incident begins with the victim or a bystander reporting it to the school's administration. After receiving the report, a school official (often a campus police officer) may begin to collect evidence and offer physical and emotional support to the victim. The institution may issue a public statement in order to dispel rumors, calm tensions, and state that bias incidents are not tolerated. School leadership may hold an open meeting to discuss the incident. Diversity training events may be included during orientation programs in an effort to prevent bias incidents from happening in the future.\n\nEven if there is no crime to prosecute, some jurisdictions encourage their citizens to report bias incidents to the police. Police officers can provide assistance to the victims, and some police departments are required to keep records of reported bias incidents.\n\n"}
{"id": "175570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175570", "title": "Bloom County", "text": "Bloom County\n\nBloom County is an American comic strip by Berkeley Breathed which originally ran from December 8, 1980, until August 6, 1989. It examined events in politics and culture through the viewpoint of a fanciful small town in Middle America, where children often have adult personalities and vocabularies and where animals can talk.\n\nOn July 12, 2015, Breathed started drawing \"Bloom County\" again. The first revived strip was published via Facebook on July 13, 2015.\n\n\"Bloom County\" originated from a comic strip known as \"The Academia Waltz\", which Breathed produced for \"The Daily Texan\", the student newspaper of the University of Texas. The comic strip attracted the notice of the editors of \"The Washington Post\", who recruited him to do a nationally syndicated strip. On December 8, 1980, \"Bloom County\", syndicated by The Washington Post Writers Group, made its debut and featured some of the characters from \"Academia Waltz,\" including former frat-boy Steve Dallas and the paraplegic Vietnam war veteran Cutter John.\n\nBreathed set \"Bloom County\" in a small town. Breathed said he made the choice because he had followed a girlfriend to Iowa City, Iowa; Breathed commented, \"You draw—literally—from your life if you’re going to write anything with some juice to it. I did just that.\"\n\nBreathed's hand-printed signature on his strips was usually presented in mirror image, i.e. right to left.\n\nBreathed was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning in 1987 for \"Bloom County\". The win was disapproved of by many members of Association of American Editorial Cartoonists.\n\nAt the very beginning of the strip (December 1980), the central setting was the Bloom boarding house run by the grandparents of Milo Bloom. As the strip continued, various boarders (and/or pets) moved into the boarding house. In the order the characters debuted:\n\n\n\n\"For detailed summaries of all storylines, see the entries for the individual books.\"\n\nBreathed decided to end the strip in 1989. In keeping with the continuity of the Bill the Cat/Donald Trump storyline, Trump \"buys out\" the comic strip and fires all of the cast. In the strip's final weeks the cast found new \"jobs\" with other comic strips. A \"goodbye party\" was held over the course of the week where characters talked about joining new strips. Portnoy and Hodge Podge get jobs as janitors behind the scenes at \"Marmaduke\"; Steve Dallas joins the cast of \"Cathy\" and attempts to pitch himself as a new superhero, but is quickly fired from both jobs; Michael Binkley becomes a wild boar skinner for \"Prince Valiant\". Lola Granola says that she's been invited to pose for \"Playboy\", which Opus dislikes. Milo Bloom is seen with a snake swallowing him head first and informing Opus he would be appearing Tuesdays in \"The Far Side\". Oliver Wendell Jones is seen with the distinct features of \"Family Circus\" characters. He informs Opus he is being \"bussed in\" to the strip as part of a court order. Once \"Bloom County\" characters are scattered, only Opus is left as part of a plot to transition to Breathed's next strip in \"Bloom County\"'s final week.\n\nShortly after \"Bloom County\" ended, Breathed started a Sunday-only strip called \"Outland\" with original characters and situations introduced in \"Bloom County\"'s final days. However, Opus, Bill and other characters eventually reappeared and slowly took over the strip. \"Outland\" ran from September 3, 1989, to March 26, 1995. Another Sunday-only spinoff strip called \"Opus\" ran from November 23, 2003, to November 2, 2008.\n\nOn July 12, 2015, Breathed posted to his Facebook page a photo with the caption \"A return after 25 years. Feels like going home.\" The photo showed him drawing a comic strip with the title \"Bloom County 2015\" with Opus pictured in the first frame. A fan asked in the comments on the picture if this was in response to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and Mr. Breathed responded to the comment that \"This creator can't precisely deny that the chap you mention had nothing to do with it.\" The next day, July 13, 2015, the first comic of the revived strip was officially posted online, also to Breathed's Facebook page. The strip was relaunched under the \"Bloom County 2015\" title, only to be renamed simply as \"Bloom County\" at the start of 2016.\n\nOn the return of the strips Breathed stated, Breathed originally had no plans of publishing the new strips outside of his Facebook page, commenting that “Newspapers need deadlines, alas. Like my departed friend Douglas Adams used to say, the only part of deadlines I enjoyed was the whooshing sound as they sped by.” An archive of the new strips has started at GoComics since then. A new book was announced in June 2016, \"Bloom County Episode XI: A New Hope\" will be a compilation of strips from 2015 and 2016.\n\n\"Bloom County\" has had an influence on other cartoonists, particularly cartoonists who have an irreverent bent or tackle political topics in their work.\n\nFor example, Scott Kurtz, creator of the webcomic \"PvP\", acknowledged Breathed's contributions at one point with a strip expressing the opinion that \"so many webcomics. ..are nothing but \"Bloom County\" ripoffs\", then lampooning itself by mimicking Breathed's art and dialogue style in the final panel.\n\nAaron McGruder, creator of the comic and later animated series \"The Boondocks\", has paid homage to Breathed's work as well, with a few aspects of the strip bearing more than a passing resemblance to important \"Bloom County\" features (including at least a couple of artistic similarities), and an episode of the animated series wherein the character Uncle Ruckus calls Breathed \"Master Penguin Draw'er\".\n\nThe series was adapted into the 1991 animated Christmas special entitled \"A Wish for Wings That Work\", which is now available on DVD.\n\nThe fictional setting of \"Bloom County\" served as a recurring backdrop for the comic and its sequels, although the nature of the setting was frequently altered.\n\nIn the comics, the county is presented as a stereotypical American midwestern small town. The small town setting was frequently contrasted with the increasing globalization taking place in the rest of the world; though Bloom County contained the likes of farmers and wilderness creatures by default, it was frequented by Hare Krishnas, feminists, and rock stars.\n\nWhile the location of Bloom County is never explicitly mentioned, there have been some clues in the strip. When Oliver Jones identified Bloom County as the place where Halley's Comet would crash into Earth, a sign was seen saying that it was at 35.05 N 146.55 E. This would place it in the Pacific Ocean, about 300 miles off the coast of Japan. Oliver's previous calculation was 39.43 N 105.01 W, which would place it just south of Denver, Colorado. In an early strip, Milo gives his address as \"Box 163, Bloom County, N.I., 12460\", the zip code for which would place it about 30 miles southwest of Albany, New York. Another strip has Opus trying to make airline reservations to Des Moines, Iowa. He balks at the outrageously high quoted price for a ticket stating that \"Des Moines is just 94 miles from Bloom County\". Geographically, this would place Bloom County in either Iowa or the far north-central tier of counties of Missouri, but likely referring to the distance from Iowa City, where the strip was produced, to Des Moines. (See Real World References below). Also, in a Sunday strip with L.H. Puttgrass, he is holding a King Soopers bag, which would place the comic in Colorado. On January 29, 2016, Berkeley Breathed posted on Facebook that \"The Bloom County boarding house still sits in beautiful hayseedless Iowa City, home for this cartoonist for four years.\"\n\nThe county was home to the Bloom Boarding House, Steve Dallas' law offices, the \"Bloom Beacon\" and \"Bloom Picayune\" newspapers, at least one pond, and Milo's Meadow. In the comic's later years, the county contained what appeared to be a big-city ghetto (\"the wrong side of the tracks\", as it was known).\n\nThe geographical profile of the county was fluid as the artistic style of the strip evolved. During most of \"Bloom County\"'s run, the rural meadow setting was presented realistically, while in its later years it became increasingly more abstract.\n\nThe \"Outland\" setting of the strip was originally set apart from the county by way of a magical doorway. By \"Outland\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> end, the Outland appeared to be a part of Bloom County itself.\n\nThe final \"Outland\" strip listed the characters as living at \"555 Hairybutt St. Bloom County, Outland\".\n\n\"Opus\" also takes place in Bloom County.\n\nThe setting of \"Bloom County\" resembled Iowa City, Iowa, in several ways; Breathed lived there during the early years of the strip. The Bloom Boarding House, for example, which appeared as a high contrast photo within the strip, is modeled after the Linsay House located at 935 East College Street in Iowa City. Another Iowa City landmark, The Prairie Lights Bookstore, was referred to in the strip as the Prairie Lights Newsstand, original \"Bloom County\" artwork from Breathed hangs in the bookstore. An original \"Bloom County\" strip hangs in the Iowa City Public Library. Breathed used the call letters KRNA to refer to \"Bloom County\"'s rock radio station featuring \"Rockin' Charmin' Harmon\". The call letters belong to an actual Iowa City rock station which featured a disc jockey named \"Charmin'\" Jeff Harmon in the 1980s. Several Iowa City local news items also directly inspired \"Bloom County\" storylines. For example, a fictional Ronald Reagan sexist gaffe, referring to women as \"little dumplin's\", was lifted from University of Iowa football coach Hayden Fry's comment, infuriating feminists at the university.\n\nLike many other popular comic strips, \"Bloom County\" has been republished in various collections. By 2004, the comic strip was reprinted in 11 books, the first having been published in 1983 and the last in that year. None of the reprints contained complete runs of the strip, although \"Bloom County Babylon\" contained many of the strips that preceded \"Loose Tails\". All of the daily strips have been reprinted in \"Comics Revue\" magazine.\n\nIDW Publishing published \"The Bloom County Library\", a five volume hardback collection of all \"Bloom County\" strips, beginning in October 2009. This series is part of their \"Library of American Comics\" series. It is a complete reprint of the strip, including side notes about cultural and political references made in the strip, \"Headlines\" breaks to identify the top stories of the day, and commentary from Breathed. Each volume has three separate releases: a standard edition, a signed edition, and a signed, remarked edition. Breathed said that the reason why the strips printed in \"The Bloom County Library\" were not published in previous collections was that the publisher would not let Breathed publish 400 pages each year, so Breathed had to reduce the content in each book. Breathed also said that he believes that, \"I just closed my eyes and dropped a dart on the ones to be included.\" He felt relieved the publishers did not \"have to ask […] to do this again.\"\n\nOn October 25, 2017 IDW published \"Bloom County: Real, Classy, & Compleat: 1980-1989\", collecting the complete run of \"Bloom County\" in two volumes. An \"Ultimate Collectors Set\" was also released, including the original art from a daily strip featuring Opus, a page from Breathed's sketchbooks, and a personalized sketch of Opus on the slipcover.\n\n\nPublished by The Library of American Comics, an imprint of IDW Publishing.\n\n\n"}

The further the user 'drills' into the application (e.g., test, result, diagnosis, etc.) all context aware applications continue to drill-down into the data, in context with the user's requests.\n\nContext management is gaining in prominence in healthcare due to the creation of the Clinical Context Object Workgroup standard committee (CCOW) which has created a standardized protocol enabling applications to function in a 'context aware' state.\n\nContext management is gaining in the Business Rule market as well. Knowing the context of any information exchange is critical. For example, a seller may need to know such things as: is this shipment urgent, is this a preferred customer,\ndo they need English or Spanish, what model is the part for? Without context, mistakes and run-on costs rapidly ensue.\nIn automating information integration, knowing and defining context of use is the single most pervasive and important factor.\nThis context mechanism is at the heart of allowing users to quantify what their context factors are precisely, this removes the guess work from business transaction exchanges between business transaction information management partners and allows them to formalize their collaboration agreements exactly.\n\n\n"}

It is celebrated on 15 August (28 August N.S. for those following the Julian Calendar) as the Feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates the Dormition not on a fixed date, but on the Sunday nearest 15 August.\n\nThe death or Dormition of Mary is not recorded in the Christian canonical scriptures.\n\nHippolytus of Thebes, a 7th- or 8th-century author, claims in his partially preserved chronology to the New Testament that Mary lived for 11 years after the death of Jesus, dying in AD 41.\n\nThe term \"Dormition\" expresses the belief that the Virgin died without suffering, in a state of spiritual peace. This belief does not rest on any scriptural basis, but is based on apocryphal writings. In Pseudo-John the Evangelist's \"Liber de Dormitione Mariae\", lit. \"Book of the Dormition of Mary\", known in English as \"The Falling Asleep of the Holy Mother of God\", Mary's soul is carried to heaven, while her body is carried away by angels to be preserved until the ultimate resurrection.\n\nThe Feast of the Dormition is preceded by a two-week fast, referred to as the Dormition Fast. From August 1 to August 14 (inclusive) Orthodox and Eastern Catholics fast from red meat, poultry, meat products, dairy products (eggs and milk products), fish, oil, and wine. The Dormition Fast is a stricter fast than either the Nativity Fast (Advent) or the Apostles' Fast, with only wine and oil (but no fish) allowed on weekends. As with the other Fasts of the Church year, there is a Great Feast that falls during the Fast; in this case, the Transfiguration (August 6), on which fish, wine and oil are allowed.\n\nIn some places, the services on weekdays during the Fast are similar to the services during Great Lent (with some variations). Many churches and monasteries in the Russian tradition perform the lenten services on at least the first day of the Dormition Fast. In the Greek tradition, during the Fast either the Great Paraklesis (Supplicatory Canon) or the Small Paraklesis is celebrated every evening except Saturday evening and the Eves of the Transfiguration and the Dormition.\n\nThe first day of the Dormition Fast is a feast day called the Procession of the Cross (August 1), on which day it is customary to have an outdoor procession and perform the Lesser Blessing of Water. In Eastern Orthodoxy it is also the day of the Holy Seven Maccabees, Martyrs Abimus, Antonius, Gurias, Eleazar, Eusebonus, Alimus, and Marcellus, their mother Solomonia, and their teacher Eleazar. Therefore, the day is sometimes referred to as \"Makovei\". Finally it is also considered the First of the three \"Feasts of the Saviour\" in August, the Feast to the All-Merciful Saviour and the Most Holy Mother of God.\n\nIn Orthodoxy and Catholicism, in the language of the scripture, death is often called a \"sleeping\" or \"falling asleep\" (Greek κοίμησις; whence κοιμητήριον > \"coemetērium\" > cemetery, \"a place of sleeping\"). A prominent example of this is the name of this feast; another is the Dormition of Anna, Mary's mother.\n\nThe Dormition tradition is associated with various places, most notably with Jerusalem, which contains Mary's Tomb and the Basilica of the Dormition, and Ephesus, which contains the House of the Virgin Mary, and also with Constantinople where the Cincture of the Theotokos was enshrined from the 5th through 14th centuries.\n\nThe first four Christian centuries are silent regarding the end of the Virgin Mary's life, though it is asserted, without surviving documentation, that the feast of the Dormition was being observed in Jerusalem shortly after the Council of Ephesus.\n\nUp until the 5th century Church Fathers do not mention the death of the Virgin, and before the 4th-5th century Dormition was not celebrated among the Christians as a holy day.\n\nFor example, Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310/20–403), a Jew by birth, born in Phoenicia, converted to Christianity in adulthood and lived as a monk for over 20 years in Palestine from 335-340 to 362, writes in \"Panarion\" in \"Contra antidicomarianitas\" about the death of the Virgin Mary the following:\n\nChristians in the late 4th century had different opinions regarding Mary's death; some believed that she was martyred. For this reason, Ambrose, for example, wrote:\n\nThe earliest Dormition traditions surface in manuscripts at some point in the late 5th century, when three distinct narrative traditions describing the end of Mary's life suddenly appear. Stephen Shoemaker characterised them as the \"Palm of the Tree of Life\" narratives, the \"Bethlehem\" narratives, and the \"Coptic\" narratives—aside from a handful of atypical narratives.\n\nThe events of the Dormition of the Virgin and her burial are dealt with in several known apocrypha: \"Tale of the Dormition of the Virgin\" by Pseudo-John the Theologian (emerged in the mid-5th century or later), \"De transitu Virginis Mariae\" by Pseudo-Melito of Sardis (5th century), the composition of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, \"According to John, Archbishop of Thessalonica.\" One of these apocrypha is placed in the \"History of the Church\" by Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos.\n\nAll listed apocrypha are quite late - 5th and 6th century - and their content differs from each other. Therefore, the Church did not adopt all their content, but only the basic idea that the Virgin Mary blissfully rested and Her soul was adopted by her Son Jesus Christ at Dormition. According to Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos in his \"History of the Church,\" Emperor Maurice (582—602) issued an edict which set the date for the celebration of the Dormition - August 15. After that Christians in the empire began to celebrate the death of the Virgin Mary. Modestus, Patriarch of Jerusalem (630—632) said at this celebration, while preaching, that he regrets the lack of specific information about the death of the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn Rome the feast called Dormitio Beatae Virginis was established by Pope Sergius I (687-701), borrowed from Constantinople.\n\nAccording to later Catholic tradition, Mary, having spent her life after Pentecost supporting and serving the nascent Church, was living in the house of the Apostle John, in Jerusalem, when the Archangel Gabriel revealed to her that her death would occur three days later. The apostles, scattered throughout the world, are said to have been miraculously transported to be at her side when she died. The sole exception was Thomas, who was preaching in India. He is said to have arrived in a cloud above her tomb exactly three days after her death, and to have seen her body leaving to heaven. He asked her \"Where are you going, O Holy One?\", at which she took off her girdle and gave it to him saying \"Receive this my friend\", after which she disappeared. Thomas was taken to his fellow apostles, whom he asked to see her grave, so that he could bid her goodbye. Mary had been buried in Gethsemane, according to her request. When they arrived at the grave, her body was gone, leaving a sweet fragrance. An apparition is said to have confirmed that Christ had taken her body to heaven after three days to be reunited with her soul. Orthodox theology teaches that the Theotokos has already undergone the bodily resurrection, which all will experience at the second coming, and stands in heaven in that glorified state which the other righteous ones will only enjoy after the Last Judgment.\n\nThe Dormition of the Theotokos is celebrated on August 15 (August 28, N.S. for those following the Julian Calendar), the same calendar day as the Roman Catholic Feast of the Assumption of Mary. The Dormition and the Assumption are the different names respectively in use by the Eastern and Catholic traditions for the end of Mary's life and departure from the earth, although the beliefs are not necessarily identical.\n\nThe Orthodox Church specifically holds one of the two Roman Catholic alternative beliefs, teaching that Mary died a natural death, like any human being; that her soul was received by Christ upon death; and that her body was resurrected on the third day after her repose, at which time she was taken up, bodily only, into heaven when the apostles, miraculously transported from the ends of the earth, found her tomb to be empty. The specific belief of the Orthodox is expressed in their liturgical texts used at the feast of the Dormition.\n\nThe Catholic doctrine of the Assumption covers Mary's bodily movement to heaven, but the dogmatic definition avoids saying whether she was dead or alive at that point. The question had been in dispute in Catholic theology, and although she is normally shown in Catholic art as alive at the point of assumption, many Catholics believe she had died in the normal way. Pope Pius XII alludes to the fact of her death at least five times, but left open the question of whether or not Mary actually underwent death in connection with her departure, in his Apostolic constitution, \"Munificentissimus Deus\" (1950), which dogmatically defined ex cathedra (\"i.e.\", infallibly) the Assumption.\n\nOn 25 June 1997 during a General Audience Pope John Paul II stated that Mary experienced natural death prior to her assumption into Heaven, stating:\nIt is true that in Revelation death is presented as a punishment for sin. However, the fact that the Church proclaims Mary free from original sin by a unique divine privilege does not lead to the conclusion that she also received physical immortality. The Mother is not superior to the Son who underwent death, giving it a new meaning and changing it into a means of salvation. Involved in Christ’s redemptive work and associated in his saving sacrifice, Mary was able to share in his suffering and death for the sake of humanity’s Redemption. What Severus of Antioch says about Christ also applies to her: “Without a preliminary death, how could the Resurrection have taken place?” (Antijulianistica, Beirut 1931, 194f.). To share in Christ’s Resurrection, Mary had first to share in his death. The New Testament provides no information on the circumstances of Mary’s death. This silence leads one to suppose that it happened naturally, with no detail particularly worthy of mention. If this were not the case, how could the information about it have remained hidden from her contemporaries and not have been passed down to us in some way? As to the cause of Mary’s death, the opinions that wish to exclude her from death by natural causes seem groundless. It is more important to look for the Blessed Virgin’s spiritual attitude at the moment of her departure from this world. In this regard, St Francis de Sales maintains that Mary’s death was due to a transport of love. He speaks of a dying “in love, from love and through love”, going so far as to say that the Mother of God died of love for her Son Jesus (Treatise on the Love of God, bk. 7, ch. XIII-XIV). Whatever from the physical point of view was the organic, biological cause of the end of her bodily life, it can be said that for Mary the passage from this life to the next was the full development of grace in glory, so that no death can ever be so fittingly described as a “dormition” as hers.\"\n\nBoth views agree that she was taken up into heaven bodily.\n\nThe Eastern Catholic observance of the feast corresponds to that of their Orthodox counterparts, whether Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox.\n\nMalankara orthodox church which is an oriental orthodox church celebrated feast of dormition on August 15 with great importance as that day is the national independence day of India.\n\nIt is customary in many places to bless fragrant herbage on the Feast of the Dormition.\n\nIn some places, the Rite of the \"Burial of the Theotokos\" is celebrated at the Dormition, during the All-Night Vigil. The order of the service is based on the service of the Burial of Christ on Great Saturday. An Epitaphios of the Theotokos, a richly embroidered cloth icon portraying her lying in state is used, together with specially composed hymns of lamentation which are sung with Psalm 118. Special Evlogitaria for the Dormition are chanted, echoing the Evlogitaria of the Resurrection chanted at matins on Sundays throughout the year as well as on Lazarus Saturday and Great Saturday. This Epitaphios is placed on a bier and carried in procession as is the Epitaphios of Christ on during Great Saturday.\n\nThis practice began in Jerusalem, and from there it was carried to Russia, where it was followed in various Dormition Cathedrals, in particular that of Moscow. The practice slowly spread among the Russian Orthodox, though it is not by any means a standard service in all parishes, or even most cathedrals or monasteries. In Jerusalem, the service is chanted during the Vigil of the Dormition. In some Russian churches and monasteries, it is served on the third day after Dormition.\n\nThe Feast of the Dormition has a one-day Forefeast and 8 days of Afterfeast. The feast is framed and accentuated by three feasts in honour of Jesus Christ, known as the \"Three Feasts of the Saviour in August\". These are: the Procession of the Cross (August 1), the Transfiguration (August 6), and the Icon of Christ \"Not Made by Hand\" (August 16).\n\nThe Maronite Church has a tradition that their Third Anaphora of the Apostle Peter or \"Sharrar\" (the Maronite redaction of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari) was originally composed for and used at the funeral of the Theotokos. This tradition probably developed because in its final form the anaphora has twelve paragraphs, i.e., one for each concelebrating apostle present at the funeral mass of the Theotokos.\n\nOne might notice the similarities between the traditional depictions of the Dormition of the Theotokos in Byzantine iconography and the account of the death of the Egyptian Desert Father, Sisoes the Great. In both Christ is seen coming to receive the soul of the dying saint surrounded by an aureola or cloud of blinding light and accompanied by the angels and prophets. In Byzantine iconography the other Christs shown surrounded by such a cloud of light are those also seen in icons of the Transfiguration, the Resurrection and the Last Judgment. One might further note that in some icons of the Dormition the Theotokos is depicted at the top of the icon in a similar aureola before the opening gates of heaven. This suggests that contemporary accounts of the deaths of the Desert Fathers accompanied by sudden burst of light came to influence the development of the iconography of the Dormition.\n\nThe Dormition is known as the Death of the Virgin in Catholic art, where it is a reasonably common subject, mostly drawing on Byzantine models, until the end of the Middle Ages. The \"Death of the Virgin\" by Caravaggio, of 1606, is probably the last famous Western painting of the subject.\n\n\n\n<http://www.protobulgarians.com/Statii%20ot%20drugi%20avtori/Goran%20Blagoev%20-%20Pokraastvaneto%20na%20rusite.htm></ref>"}

Expert determination is a procedure by which the parties to a dispute appoint an independent and neutral expert to determine the dispute in private. Like arbitration, it allows trade secrets and other sensitive information to be kept out of the public domain. The expert will be a person with specialist or technical knowledge relevant to the dispute.\n\nThe practice itself is well established where complex legal institutions either have not developed, or are unavailable, such as tribal societies and criminal organisations.\n\nIn the context of modern jurisprudence, the word \"expert\" appears first in \"Bottomley v Ambler\" 1878 38 LT 545, this was however used ambiguously also referring to arbitrators having the qualification of expert.

Published by Geiger of Lewiston, Maine, the \"Farmers' Almanac\" provides long-range weather predictions for both the U.S. and Canada, informative and quirky articles, tips, and valuable calendars, and information on everything from the best days to garden, fish, view planets and meteor showers, and take vacations, to full moon dates and lore, and ways to use natural remedies and life hacks for a healthier, less-stressful life. \n\nEach new year’s edition is released at the end of August of the previous year and contains 16 months of weather predictions broken into 7 zones for the continental US as well as seasonal weather maps for the winter and summer ahead. \n\nIn addition to the U.S. version, there is a Canadian \"Farmers’ Almanac\" and a Promotional Version that is sold to businesses as a marketing and public relations tool.\n\nFounded in 1818, the \"Farmers’ Almanac\" mixes a blend of long-range weather predictions, humor, fun facts, and advice on gardening, cooking, fishing, conservation, and other topics.\n\nThe \"Farmers’ Almanac\" has had seven editors. Poet, astronomer, and teacher David Young, Philom., held the post for 34 years from the day he and publisher Jacob Mann first founded The Almanac Publishing Company in Morristown, New Jersey. Following Young’s death in 1852, a string of successors took the helm, beginning with astronomer Samuel Hart Wright.\n\nIn 1933 Ray Geiger took over as the sixth editor of the \"Farmers’ Almanac\" and began what became the longest-running editorship in \"Farmers’ Almanac\" history. \n\nIn 1994, upon completion of his 60th consecutive edition, Ray passed the editorial reins onto his son, Peter, who had been serving as Associate Editor for 15 years. Peter, who also serves as Executive Vice President of Geiger, hired Sandi Duncan to serve as Managing Editor with him. Sandi was the first woman editor in 178 years to hold an editorial position.\n\nPredictions for each edition are made as far as two years in advance. The U.S. retail edition of the \"Farmers' Almanac\" contains weather predictions for 7 U.S. climatic zones, defined by the publishers, in the continental United States, broken into 3-day intervals. Seasonal maps and summaries for each season are also shared in each new edition, as are forecasts for annual sporting events. Predictions cover 16 months, from the previous September (through December of the publication year).\n\nThe \"Farmers' Almanac\" will only state publicly that their method is an “exclusive mathematical and astronomical formula, that relies on sunspot activity, tidal action, planetary position and many other factors.\" The Almanac's forecaster is referred to by the pseudonym Caleb Weatherbee. According to the publishers, the true identity of the forecaster is kept secret to prevent him or her from being \"badgered.\"\n\nPublishers point to \"many longtime Almanac followers claim that their forecasts are 80% to 85% accurate\" on their website. Their website also contains a list of the many more “famous” weather predictions they have accurately forewarned of and like to point out that they’ve been predicting the weather longer than the National Weather Service. \n\nIn addition to the popular U.S. version, there is also the Canadian \"Farmers' Almanac\" and a branded promotional version that businesses can personalize and distribute to customers. The total annual distribution of all \"Farmers' Almanac\" editions is more than 2 million copies.\n\nBringing the wisdom of the ages into the digital age, in 1997 FarmersAlmanac.com was created as a way to share the Almanac’s content digitally. Today it is one of the most popular sites for people of all ages to access long-range weather predictions, and  learn when the best days are to plant your garden, go fishing, find the date of the full moon, or quit a habit. \n\nThe \"Farmers’ Almanac’s\" popularity continues to grow digitally. The Almanac has over 1.2 million followers on Facebook, and a strong following on Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and other social media sites.    \n\nMost editions of the \"Farmers' Almanac\" include a \"human crusade,\" advocating for a change in some accepted social practice or custom. Previous crusades have included: \"How Much Daylight Are We Really Saving,\" a recommendation for a revised Daylight Saving Time schedule (2007); \"Why is Good Service So Hard to Schedule,\" recommending that service providers offer more specific timeframes when scheduling home visits (2006); \"A Kinder, Gentler Nation,\" urging readers to exercise more common courtesy (2003); \"Saturday: The Trick to Making Halloween a Real Treat,\" advocating that the observance of Halloween be moved to the last Saturday in October (1999); \"A Cure for Doctors' Office Delays,\" demanding more prompt medical service and calling for a \"Patients' Bill of Rights\" (1996); and \"Pennies Make No Sense,\" which sought to eliminate the penny, and to permanently replace the dollar bill with less costly-to-produce dollar coins (1989).\n\nOther pieces that have attracted attention over the years include:\n\nA \"farmer's almanac\" has been referenced in numerous television shows and movies, including \"The Office\", \"MASH\", \"Twin Peaks\", \"The Dukes of Hazzard\", \"Wings\", \"Cold Case\", \"The Last Starfighter\", and \"Father of the Bride\". Popular culture does not always distinguish between the \"Farmers' Almanac\" and the older \"Old Farmer's Almanac\", so it is not always clear to which publication a particular reference is meant to allude.\n\nCountry singer Randy Travis has a song titled \"The Family Bible and \"The Farmer's Almanac\"\" on his CD \"A Man Ain't Made of Stone\". The song is about his farmer grandfather and what a wise man he was, yet the only two books he owned were the ones told in the title. He got all the life advice he needed from those two books.\n"}

The first was published in August 1996 and the second in February 1998. At the time, bin Laden was not a wanted man in any country except his native Saudi Arabia, and was not yet known as the leader of the international terrorist organization al-Qaeda. Therefore, these fatāwā received relatively little attention until after the August 1998 United States embassy bombings, for which bin Laden was indicted. The indictment mentions the first fatwā, and claims that Khalid al-Fawwaz, of bin Laden's Advice and Reformation Committee in London, participated in its communication to the press.\n\nBin Laden's 1996 fatwā is entitled \"Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places\". This document is sometimes called the \"Ladenese epistle\", a term derived from bin Laden's surname. It is a long piece, and complains of American activities in numerous countries. It was faxed to supporters across the world. It first appeared in the London-based Arabic paper \"Al-Quds Al-Arabi\".\n\nThe 1998 fatwā reached \"Al Quds Al Arabi\" by fax, and was signed by five people, four of whom represented specific Islamist groups:\n\nThe signatories as a group were identified as the \"World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders\". This fatwā complains of American military presence in the Arabian Peninsula, the blockade of Iraq and American support for Israel. It purports to provide religious authorization for indiscriminate killing of Americans and Jews everywhere. It appeared in February 1998 and the embassy bombings followed in August.\n\nThe World Islamic Front is the organization that issued the World Islamic Front Statement of 23 February 1998, \"Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders\", listing the actions of Americans that they claim conflict with \"God's order\", and stating that the Front's \"ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.\" Terrorism experts consider the \"World Islamic Front\" synonymous with al-Qaeda.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission uses the text of the 23 February 1998 fatwa as evidence that linked Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and al-Qaeda to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe 23 February 1998 fatwa is the first known official order of the World Islamic Front. The fatwa calls upon each individual member of the existing Ummah to, \"in accordance with the words of Almighty God, 'fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,' and 'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God.'\" The fatwa is widely regarded by terrorism experts as the founding document of the World Islamic Front.\n\n"}

Born of first generation Ukrainian and Cossack-Canadian parents in North Winnipeg, Manitoba, by age 17 Gordienko had received numerous awards for his physical prowess. He wrestled from 1946 to 1976 and was, according to Lou Thesz and other experts, one of the top legitimate wrestlers in the world. He was rated the best heavyweight wrestler in the UK in 1963, and in 1970, won the annual Royal Albert Hall tournament in London. After his retirement he became a successful artist.\n\nHe wrestled professionally from 1946 to 1976. He started as a weightlifter as a teenager. Joe Pazandak was his training partner in wrestling early in his career and Tony Stecher of Minneapolis was his manager in the very beginning. He mostly wrestled as Stu Hart's tag team partner after returning to wrestling in 1953. He fought Lou Thesz for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s NWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1953 in Canada and wrestled Thesz again to a 90-minute draw in Edmonton in 1955.\n\nGeorge Gordienko won the Alberta Golden Jubilee tournament in 1955, defeating Adrien Baillargeon in the final. He then settled in UK. He was ranked the top heavyweight wrestler in the Great Britain in 1963. In 1970, George won the annual Royal Albert Hall tournament in London. He then triumphed in winning the British Commonwealth heavyweight title. He also won New Zealand's version of the British Commonwealth Heavyweight Championship in 1968. The majority of Gordienko's title wins took place in Western Canada, as he won several NWA titles in British Columbia and Alberta. Competing in Calgary in 1956, he won the city's version of the NWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship.

In 1954, Shelburne Museum was the first museum to exhibit quilts as works of art; prior to this exhibition quilts were only shown as accessories in historic houses.\n\nCaptain Benjamin Harrington built this structure about 1800 in Shelburne, Vermont. Harrington, who owned and operated a nearby inn, used the building as a distillery to produce spirits to serve at his inn. The building later served as the Shelburne town barn but, after a period of disuse, the town gave the building to the Museum in 1947 when the Museum moved it to its present site.\n\nConstructed of hand-hewn timbers and rough planks, the Museum used the building as a storage and workshop space for several years while deciding how to renovate it as a textile gallery. Adopting the name “Hat and Fragrance,” which refers to the Museum’s collection of hatboxes and herbal sachets used to preserve early textiles, the Museum paneled the interior walls with maple, birch, and beech veneers in decorative patterns. The original structure still maintains this decorative paneling. The museum later built four additional rooms to provide further exhibition space.\n\nHatboxes and their smaller relation the bandbox were made of thin sheets of bent wood or pasteboard and covered with decorative printed papers. Serving as an inexpensive form of luggage for men and women, the boxes carried and stored hats, collars, cuffs, and other finery. Their use increased in the 19th century as new roads, steamboats, and steam locomotives encouraged more people to travel.\n\nShelburne Museum’s collection of over two hundred hatboxes and bandboxes is one of the largest and most comprehensive on public display in the country. The collection represents the wide variety of box sizes and forms, paper colors, and designs and is particularly rich in rare, early papers.\n\nMost hat-and-bandbox factories were located in larger cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, or Hartford. However, many individuals operated small companies to make and sell hatboxes to local markets. One of the best known of these craftspeople is Hannah Davis (1784–1863) of Jaffrey, New Hampshire, whose work is well represented in the Museum’s collection.\n\nEarly boxes were covered with printed and handpainted paper imported from England and Europe. Wallpaper from American printers became available in the 19th century and was quickly adopted by hat and bandbox makers.\n\nPatterns and colors for the papers were influenced by current decorating styles. The images of classical architecture, griffins, and chariots pulled by birds were inspired by the mid-19th century interest in Greek and Roman history. Common and exotic creatures such as cows, beavers, anacondas, and giraffes were inspired by zoos, traveling animal exhibitions, illustrated bestiaries, and geography books. Finally, hatbox makers often copied illustrations of American city and rural scenes, historic landmarks, new modes of transportation, or important people and events published in popular books and magazines. Popular papers include the New York City Deaf and Dumb Asylum, a duck hunt, a sidewheel steamboat, President Harrison’s log cabin and a balloon ascension.\n\nEmbroidered bed-rugs and blankets, coverlets, and quilts were a critical necessity in poorly heated early American homes. The making of bedcovers provided women with an important creative outlet and often served as the primary source of decoration in sparsely furnished 17th- and 18th-century homes. As America’s economy grew in the 19th century, the increase in leisure time and the availability of inexpensive factory-woven cloth encouraged thousands of women to embroider, sew, and quilt bedcovers for their families and friends.\n\nShelburne Museum was one of the first institutions to collect and exhibit American textiles which possess bold graphic patterns, clarity of line, intense colors, and the imaginative combinations of human figures, animals and vegetation which is often whimsical and out of scale.\n\nThe still-growing collection at the Museum is remarkable in its size and quality. Over seven hundred quilts, coverlets, blankets, and bed-rugs from the 18th and 19th century illustrate the different types of bedcovers, the diversity of designs and fabrics, and the many methods of manufacture used by creative men and women. Although the collection predominantly represents New England and the northern states, it also includes examples from the southern and mid-western regions as well as from such distinctive groups as the Amish, Pennsylvania Dutch, and native Hawaiians.\n\nBed-rugs, a traditional northern European bedcover, were brought to America from northern England and widely used until the early 19th century. Now quite rare, these thick, heavy bedcovers were embroidered with handspun and dyed yarns on wool fabric to create a dense pile surface similar to that of an Oriental rug.\n\nHand-woven blankets, treasured for their warmth and durability, often were embroidered with colorful handspun wool yarns. Women embroidered swirling vine, floral and shell patterns on plain blankets and filled squares of window-pane-checked blankets with stars and flowers.\n\nSingle and double coverlets, hand-woven in bold, geometric patterns from the mid-eighteenth to mid-19th centuries were considered more decorative than plain or plaid blankets. While most were woven in blue and white, some weavers chose to emphasize the patterns by combining two or more colors. Jacquard coverlets, introduced in the early 19th century became immediately popular because of their elaborate floral, mosaic, figural, and patriotic patterns. Professional weavers advertised them as fancy coverlets to differentiate them from hand-woven coverlets with geometric patterns.\n\nQuilts are made by joining layers of cloth – usually a decorative top, warm filling of either raw wool or cotton, and plain backing – and sewing or “quilting” them together. The method by which the quilt top is made, pieced, appliquéd, or plain, determines the nature of the design.\n\nThe first quilts made in America followed English and European traditions. Early plain whole-cloth quilts were made from lengths of imported, highly glazed, richly colored wool fabric. The stitches used to secure the layers followed decorative swirling vine and floral patterns similar to those used in embroidery or in painted decorations on furniture and walls.\n\nThe earliest pieced quilts were made by sewing or “piecing” small geometric pieces of fabric together in simple honeycomb or triangle patterns. As American women perfected the art of quilt making in the early 19th century, they developed more complex patterns often requiring hundreds of thousands of tiny pieces. Geometric star, flower, and figural patterns were pieced together in small blocks and then sewn together to make a quilt top.\n\nThe first American appliquéd quilts, made in the 18th century, used the \"broderie perse\", French for Persian embroidery, technique of cutting entire motifs from imported printed fabric, then sewing them on a plain fabric background. 19th-century quilters continued this tradition adding their own twists, they followed patterns printed in ladies’ magazines, copied from a friend, or designed their own.\n\nOccasionally women also stenciled, painted and embroidered fabrics to imitate elaborate quilt of coverlet patterns. Other bedcovers were knitted or crocheted in elegant patterns.\n\n\n"}

Highland Village is located in Iona, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 43 acres of natural landscape overlooking the Bras d'Or Lake in Central Cape Breton.\n\nThe roots of Gaelic Nova Scotia are found in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland where significant socio-economic changes in the 18th century disrupted a pastoral life-style. These changes prompted many to emigrate to Nova Scotia.\n\nThroughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, thousands of Scots settled in eastern Nova Scotia. Through a pattern of chain emigration, settlers often chose to create new communities based on family connections, religious or political beliefs. The settlers faced new hardships such as a vastly different climate, however they persevered and began clearing land, building homes and outbuildings, cultivating their land and establishing new lives and communities.\n\nHighland Village Museum depicts 4 distinct eras in the history of Nova Scotia’s Gaelic settlers. Gàidhealtachd na h-Albann, Gaelic Scotland 1770-1830s is depicted in the Black House (an Taigh dubh). Coille Mhór na h-Albann Nuaih, The Forests of Nova Scotia 1770-1850s is depicted in the Log House (an Taigh Logaichean), the Centre Chimney House (Taigh an t-Similer), and the Barn (an Sabal). A’ Stéidheachadh Gàidhealtachd Ùireadh, Building New Communities 1850s – 1880s, is depicted by the Church (an Eaglais) and the Centre Hallway House (Taigh na Tranna). Gàidhealtachd na h-Albann Nuaidh, Gaelic Nova Scotia 1880s – 1920s, is depicted and interpreted through the School House (an Taigh-sgoil), the General Store (an Taigh-marsantachd), the Forge (a’Cheàrdach), the Carding Mill (am Muileann-càrdaidh) and the Turn of the Century house (Taigh tùs na Ficheadamh Lìn).\n\nVisitors to Highland Village explore these 4 distinct eras of Nova Scotia’s Gaelic history while interacting with costumed animators throughout the historic buildings. The interpretation of this aspect of Nova Scotia’s history is enhanced by the inclusion of farm animals, traditional gardening and farming techniques, and other aspects of the life of the Gaels in this part of the world. The artifacts that make up the collection of the Highland Village Museum are carefully chosen to best represent the specific era they are reflecting. All artifacts at Highland Village are part of the Nova Scotia Museum Collection.\n\nA virtual museum site entitled \"Cape Breton Céilidh\" has been created which provides a brief look at the history of the Gaels in Nova Scotia and the cultural legacy they created.\n\nHighland Village Museum / An Clachan Gàidhealach offers programs and events designed to promote Gaelic language, culture and heritage. Through partnerships with other like-minded community groups, and government agencies, the Highland Village Museum and Nova Scotia highland Village Society is able to host educational programs such as Stòras a’ Bhaile, a four-day Gaelic immersion folk-life school for advanced Nova Scotia Gaelic learners, among others learning opportunities.\n\nHighland Village Museum hosts an annual Highland Village Day outdoor Scottish Concert each August. Highland Village day began in 1962 as both a celebration of the beginnings of creating the Highland Village Museum, and as a fundraiser for further development.Opening day included an exhibit of Boxing put on by the New Waterford Boxing Club .This annual tradition showcases local musicians who are continuing the musical traditions passed down through their ancestors.\n\nOther programs and events held annually include Pioneer Day, a traditional cod-fish supper, educational programs for youth, as well as the regular interpretive programming available on site daily. Highland Village offers an in-class visitation program to local schools entitled Sgadan’s Buntata which provides opportunities for students to see, and interact with, demonstrations of crafts performed by staff in period dress. In addition to being made aware of the material culture of Gaelic Nova Scotia, students experience an introduction to the Gaels’ language and customs.\n\nRoots Cape Breton is a computer-assisted service for those researching people from the area. It contains data extracted from census, cemetery, birth, marriage and death records, as well as other sources of information.\n\nThe Highland Village Museum has developed an interactive website, \"An Drochaid Eadarainn\" (The Bridge Between Us), to emulate the social transmission of Gaelic language and culture through technology. Its purpose is to contribute to Gaelic renewal initiatives in Nova Scotia and other Canadian locales. The official launch took place on 2 May 2012 at a ceremony in the foyer of the Nova Scotia Legislature Province House in Halifax.\n\nCommunicating recorded expressions of Nova Scotia Gaelic culture, the site exposes visitors to native speakers through storytelling, music and dance, dialectal samples, kinship, belief, traditional foods, home remedies and cures. Participants can meet, share and exchange Nova Scotia Gaelic traditions on \"An Drochaid Bheò\" (The Living Bridge), an interactive feature of the website.

A common political charter for the group was signed on 9 January 2007, and the group was formally recognized by Parliamentary president Josep Borrell at the start of the EP plenary session on 15 January. Following remarks made by ITS member Alessandra Mussolini that Romanian ITS members found insulting, the Greater Romania Party (PRM) withdrew from the group, thus disqualifying it as an official group. Hence, it formally ceased to exist on 14 November 2007.\n\nTo form a political group in the European Parliament, there needed to be 20 MEPs from six different states (subsequently increased to 25 MEPs from seven states, for the 2009 session). The accession of Bulgaria and Romania brought into the European Parliament a number of new far-right MEPs providing sufficient numbers to form a far right group. Incentives for forming a group are approximately €1 million in public funds and guaranteed seats on the committees of the European Parliament. There were concerns in other parties about public funds and influence going towards a group with such an ideology. Despite attempts to block the group's formation, it was formed on 15 January 2007. However other MEPs successfully blocked ITS from gaining positions on Parliamentary committees, including two vice-presidencies, despite normally being entitled to them.\n\nThe largest component was France's National Front and its chairman in the Parliament, Bruno Gollnisch, was chair of the ITS group. The National Front had previous allied with other far right groups in the 1980s. Following the Bulgarian European Parliament elections, the group gained two more Ataka MEPs, Slavcho Binev and Desislav Chukolov.\n\nThe PRM announced on 8 November 2007 that it would withdraw its five members from the group on 12 November 2007 over comments made by Alessandra Mussolini over the expulsion of Romanian criminals from Italy in early November 2007, thus dooming the parliamentary group to falter less than a year after its creation. Andreas Mölzer stated in an interview with \"Die Presse\" that the group was searching for other MEPs who might join their group to save it. Other MEPs have already welcomed the prospect of the group's demise with Alyn Smith MEP stating that it \"warms the heart\" to watch them arguing amongst themselves. During the previous months, the group had failed to act as a coherent political faction.\n\nIt was announced that the group had been dissolved on 14 November 2007 after four of the five PRM members left the group.\n\nThe group's founding charter has been described as \"broadly anti-immigration, anti-EU constitution and anti-Turkish EU membership,\" while participants have emphasised that the group will function relatively loosely. Alessandra Mussolini described it as \"more a technical than a political group [...] We are mainly getting together out of necessity. Survival is only possible in a political group.\"\n\nThe Romanian PRM leader stated that he favours a strong association and eventual EU membership for Turkey provided it settles the dispute regarding Cyprus and that the common ground for the new group is based exactly on the values the group's name suggests.\n\nThe membership of ITS while it existed between January and November 2007;\n\n"}

{"id": "7765366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7765366", "title": "India Office Records", "text": "India Office Records\n\nThe India Office Records are a very large collection of documents relating to the administration of India from 1600 to 1947, the period spanning Company and British rule in India. The archive is held in London by the British Library and is publicly accessible.\n\nThe records come from four main sources: the English and later British East India Company (1600–1858), the Board of Control (1784–1858), the India Office (1858–1947), and the Burma Office (1937–48). The collection also includes records from many smaller related institutions. Overall, the collection is made up of approximately 175,000 items, including official publications and records, manuscripts, photographs, printed maps and private papers. These items take up approximately nine miles of shelving units.\n\nThe historical scope of the records begins in 1600, when the East India Company was granted exclusive rights to trade in much of Asia, including the entire Indian subcontinent. During its first 100 years, much of the East India Company's energy was involved in maintaining its trade privileges, as it faced competition from domestic and international companies.\n\nAlthough the East India Company was established as a trading company, it became more and more involved in local affairs in India during the early 18th century, and eventually came to hold large swaths of land in the subcontinent. In the mid-18th century, the Company began to undertake a governmental role in large parts of India, in order to organize the nascent colony to better facilitate trade.\n\nIn an effort to increase its own involvement in the administration of India, the British Government passed Pitt's India Act in 1784, which established the Board of Control to direct the East India Company in its governing role.\n\nIn 1858, in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British government abolished the East India Company's right to govern India, and brought the subcontinent directly under the control of the British Empire. The India Office, under the direction of the Secretary of State for India, was established to maintain administrative control over the increasingly important colony. In 1937, a separate Burma Office was established to alleviate some of the India Office's administrative burden.\n\nThe India Office Records themselves have a very interesting history. There were different levels of care for the records over the years, but interest in preserving them was established very early. A “Keeper” of East India Company records was appointed in 1771, with a mission to arrange current records and to preserve historical records.\n\nToward the end of the East India Company's governance in India, an increasing number of documents were sent to London and incorporated into the records. In fact, it was one of the most documented administrations ever. However, when the control of India was transferred to the India Office, they set up a committee to review the records provided by the East India Company. On the committee's recommendation, more than 300 tons of records were sold as wastepaper. Although this was certainly a great loss to the collection, there is evidence that many of these records were duplications, or contained very little relevant information.\n\nThe first attempt to arrange and describe the records occurred in 1879, when George Birdwood published his \"Report on the old records of the India Office\".\n\nIn 1947, the year of Indian independence, ownership of the records transferred to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the British government. In 1967, the Office decided to move the records to a new facility on Blackfriars Road, where they were merged with the India Office Library. It was during this transition that the records were transformed into a modern archival collection. A classification system for the records was determined, most of which is still being used.\n\nIn 1982, the entire collection was moved to the British Library. They are currently a part of the British Library Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections, and they are administered as Public Records, which means that they are available for public consultation in the British Library Reading Rooms.\n\nThe classification system for the records was created with two goals: to preserve the original order of the records as much as was possible, and to clarify the administrative history of the records. Each series of records was assigned a letter, from A to Z, and certain series also have descriptive subclasses. The classes are as follows:\n\nThe collection is useful for genealogical and family history research, particularly for those who have ancestors who were Anglo-Indian or who were born or lived in British India. Recognising this, the British Library has developed resources to facilitate this process, including biographical indexes, professional research services and close links with the Families In British India Society.\n\nThe East India Company, the Board of Control and the India Office kept extensive ecclesiastical records concerning British people in India. These records, including documentation of births, baptisms, marriages, and burials are all contained in the “N” series of the collection. For those who know the occupation of their ancestor in India, the British Library provides a guide to records produced by various positions, facilitating the discovery of material that an ancestor created in the course of his work for the British administration in India. Most of these records can be found in the “L” series.\n\nThe collection can be used to bolster research on almost any topic involving the history of India from 1600-1947 by providing unique information relating to the British administration's understanding of events. Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the collection is the set of records pertaining to Mohandas Gandhi. Much is known about Gandhi's life and ideas through many sources, but these records provide interesting insight into the development of his ideas, as well as his personal life. Information on the Indian administration's feelings and frustrations concerning Gandhi is also in the records.\n\nThe material relating to Gandhi can be found in folders R/3/1/289-334. There are two particularly interesting sets of documents in this series. The first of these are administrative records containing reactions to Gandhi and plans concerning his activities. Most of these were originally classified as “Most Secret,” “Very Secret,” or “Top Secret.” (This detail in itself gives insight into the administration's increasing concern with secrecy, as well as their fear of Gandhi and the threat he posed to British authority.) Many of these records are proposals for responses to Gandhi's actions, including plans to prepare for riots in the event of his death during one of his fasts.\n\nThe second set of documents consists of correspondence to and from Gandhi. Gandhi wrote extensively to various British government officials, and there are 93 letters from Gandhi, as well as 48 letters to Gandhi from the administration personnel. Many of the letters currently held in the collection are copies from originals, but as the records have been so well-kept in the 20th century, their authenticity is not in question. The time period of the correspondence is 1922 to 1945.\n\nMany of the letters from Gandhi express criticism of British policies in India and reveal Gandhi's sophisticated analysis of world politics, as well as his commitment to peace. In many, he appeals to the British to work with him to end the oppression of the Indians.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual of Gandhi's letters in the collection is a copy of a letter sent to Adolf Hitler, in which Gandhi expresses admiration for Hitler's passion for his nation, but urges him to seek non-violent means to address Germany's concerns. He also refers to some of Hitler's writings as “monstrous,” and makes it clear that he has no interest in seeking German aid for the end of British rule in India.\n\nThe most personal of letters from Gandhi in the collection relate to the illness and death of his wife in 1944. In these letters, one can see Gandhi's frustration at watching Kasturba Gandhi's condition worsen as he was powerless to help her. He repeatedly appealed to the British to send medical aid, including an Ayurvedic physician, and when it became clear that she would not survive, he lashed out at them, complaining that her treatment was inadequate.\n\nMost of the letters written to Gandhi contained in the collection are accusatory, complaining that Gandhi did not live up to his rhetoric about non-violence. The letters reflect a belief that Gandhi's fasts and other dramatic forms of protest stirred up violence among the Indian population. Many of the letters also deny Gandhi's accusations that the British government was involved in systematic repression of the Indian people and failed to live up to its role as a steward of India and the Indian people.\n\nThere is also one letter in the collection from Franklin Roosevelt, who was the President of the United States at the time. In the letter, he acknowledges Gandhi's concerns about India, but suggests that World War II and the defeat of the Axis powers should take precedence. He asks Gandhi to support the British regime so that they will not be forced to divide their attention.\n\n\n\n"}

He was chief executive officer until 1999. Today, Estée Lauder operates several brands in the cosmetic industry, including Estée Lauder, Clinique, MAC Cosmetics, Aveda, Bobbi Brown, Smashbox and La Mer.\n\nIn April 2013, he promised his collection of 81 Cubist paintings, works on paper, and sculptures, consisting of 34 pieces by Pablo Picasso, 17 by Georges Braque, 15 by Fernand Léger, and 15 by Juan Gris, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. \nLauder's net worth as of 2017 is estimated to be $10.1 billion.\n\nLeonard Lauder is the elder son of Joseph and Estée Lauder and the elder brother of Ronald Lauder. His family is Jewish. He married Evelyn Hausner in July 1959. They had two sons: William, executive chairman of the Estée Lauder Companies, and Gary, managing director of Lauder Partners LLC.\n\nHe is a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and he also studied at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business before serving as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. He formally joined Estée Lauder in 1958 when he was 25.\n\nLauder gained notoriety in 2001 for creating the Lipstick index, a since discredited economic indicator.[6]\n\nOn January 1, 2015, he married photographer Judy Ellis Glickman.\n\nFor many years, he has lived in an Upper East Side penthouse in Manhattan.\n\nLauder is a major art collector (he began by buying Art Deco postcards when he was six), but his particular focus, rather than on American artists, is on works by the Cubist masters Picasso, Braque, Gris, and Léger. He also collects Klimt. Much of his art comes from some of the world's most celebrated collections, including those of Gertrude Stein, the Swiss banker Raoul La Roche, and the British art historian Douglas Cooper.\n\nIn autumn, 2012, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston opened an exhibition of 700 of his postcards, a tiny part of the promised gift he has made to the museum of 120,000 postcards: \"The Postcard Age: Selections from the Leonard A. Lauder Collection\". In an interview in \"The New Yorker\", Lauder explained how postcards turned him into a collector, and how these \"mini-masterpieces\" remained his lifelong pursuit to the point where his late wife, Evelyn, called the collection his \"mistress\".\n\nLauder's interest in postcards led him to be acquainted with one of the owners of the Gotham Book Mart, a Manhattan bookstore, and he sought to help the Gotham re-establish its presence in the city when the owner had sold its long-time building and needed a new space. Lauder bought a building at 16 East 46th Street along with a partner, letting the building's storefront space to the Gotham. Later, the Gotham fell behind on rents, eventually resulting in Lauder and his partner to file for eviction. In a much-publicized closure of the bookstore, the New York City Marshal later auctioned the store's inventory, which was bought in a lot by Lauder and his partner to some protest from many other independent book sellers and collectors who were present at the proceedings and hoping to purchase some of the bibliophilic treasures.\nLauder has long been a major benefactor of the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1971, he joined the museum's acquisitions board and in 1977, by then president of his family's business, he became a Whitney trustee. He became president in 1990 and has been chairman since 1994. He has donated both money and many works of art to the Whitney, and is the museum's most prolific fundraiser. His 2008 donation to it of $131 million is the largest in the museum's history. Through the Leonard and Evelyn Lauder Fund, he and his wife have also sponsored several exhibitions at the Whitney. The fifth-floor permanent collection galleries are named for the couple. In 1998, he told a reporter for \"The New York Times\" that his \"dream job\" was to be the Whitney Museum's director. Most recently, Lauder gave $131 million for the Whitney's endowment.\n\nA long-time supporter of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Lauder led the creation of a research center for Modern art at the museum, which he helped support through a $22 million endowment made alongside museum trustees and other benefactors. In April 2013, he promised his collection of 81 pieces of Cubist art, consisting of 34 pieces by Pablo Picasso, 17 by Georges Braque, 15 by Fernand Léger, and 15 by Juan Gris to the museum; together, they are valued at more than one billion dollars. It has been described by William Acquavella, of Acquavella Galleries, as \"without doubt the most important collection any private person has put together in many, many years,\"\n\nLauder is co-founder and chairman of the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a trustee of the Aspen Institute, chairman of The Aspen Institute International Committee, and a member of the President's Council of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital.

The brother of Mehmed V, he became heir to the throne after the 1916 suicide of Abdülaziz's son Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin as the eldest male member of the House of Osman. He acceded to the throne after the death of Mehmed V. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth \"padishah\". His father was Sultan Abdulmejid I and mother was Gülüstü Hanım (1830 – 1865), an ethnic Abkhazian, daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afişe Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba.

On 10 August 1920, Mehmed's representatives signed the Treaty of Sèvres, which recognised the mandates and recognised Hejaz as an independent state.\n\nTurkish nationalists rejected the settlement by the Sultan's four signatories. A new government, the Turkish Grand National Assembly, under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) was formed on 23 April 1920, in Ankara (then known as Angora). The new government denounced the rule of Mehmed VI and the command of Süleyman Şefik Pasha who was in charge of the army commissioned to fight the civil war for the empire (the Kuvâ-i İnzibâtiyye), as a result a temporary constitution was drafted.\n\nThe Grand National Assembly of Turkey abolished the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, and Mehmed VI was expelled from Constantinople.

It was the last film to feature all six Python members before Graham Chapman's death in 1989.\n\nUnlike \"Holy Grail\" and \"Life of Brian\", the film's two predecessors, which each told a single, more-or-less coherent story, \"The Meaning of Life\" returned to the sketch format of the troupe's original television series and their first film from twelve years earlier, \"And Now for Something Completely Different\", loosely structured as a series of comic sketches about the various stages of life. It was accompanied by the short film \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\".\n\nReleased on 23 June 1983 in the United Kingdom, \"The Meaning of Life\", although not as acclaimed as its predecessors, was still well received critically and was a minor box office success, grossing almost $15 million on a $9 million budget. It also screened at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix. The film appears in a 2010 list of the top 20 cult films published by \"The Boston Globe\".\n\nA group of fish in a posh restaurant's tank swim together casually, until they look at the customers outside of the tank and see their friend Howard being eaten. This leads them to question the meaning of life. The question is explored in the first sketch, \"The Miracle of Birth\", which features a woman in labour being ignored by the doctors in favour of impressing the hospital's administrator. In Yorkshire, a Roman Catholic man loses his job and returns home to tell his numerous children that he will have to sell them off for scientific experiments due to the Catholic church's opposition to contraception; this leads to the musical number \"Every Sperm is Sacred\". Meanwhile, a Protestant man and his wife discuss having non-reproductive sex.\n\nIn \"Growth and Learning\", a class of boys are taught school etiquette and then watch their teacher have sex with his wife as part of their sex education. One boy laughs, and is forced into a violent rugby match against the higher grades as punishment. \"Fighting Each Other\" first focuses on a World War I officer trying to rally his men to find cover during an attack, but they insist on throwing him a going away party; then, an army RSM attempts to drill his platoon but ends up excusing them all to pursue leisure activities. In 1879, during the Anglo-Zulu War, a soldier finds his leg has been bitten off. Suspecting a tiger, despite being in Africa, the soldiers hunt for it and find two men suspiciously wearing two halves of a tiger costume.\n\n\"The Middle of the Film\" briefly introduces a segment called \"Find the Fish\", a surreal scene where bizarre characters ask the audience to find a fish hidden in the sequence. \"Middle Age\" involves a middle-aged American couple visiting a dungeon-themed Hawaiian restaurant, where, to the interest of the fish, the waiter offers a conversation about philosophy and the meaning of life. The customers are unable to make sense of it and move on to a discussion of \"live organ transplants\". \"Live Organ Transplants\" involves two paramedics visiting Mr. Brown, a card-carrying organ donor, forcefully removing his liver whilst he is still alive. Brown's wife speaks with a musician who performs \"Galaxy Song\" while discussing man's insignificance in the universe. The Crimson Permanent Assurance pirates invade a corporate boardroom where executives are discussing the meaning of life, but a tumbling skyscraper ends their assault.\n\nIn \"The Autumn Years\", the horribly obese Mr. Creosote visits a French restaurant, to the horror of the fish tank. He vomits continuously and devours an enormous meal. When the maître d' gives him a wafer-thin mint, Creosote's stomach begins to rapidly expand until it explodes, the maître d' then giving him the bill. Two staff members clean up Creosote's remains while discussing the meaning of life. One leads the audience to his house, spouts some philosophy, and then angrily dismisses them.\n\n\"Death\" features a condemned man choosing the manner of his own execution: being chased off a cliff by topless women and falling into his own grave below. The Grim Reaper thereupon enters an isolated country house and invites himself to dinner. The guests try to guess who he is until the Reaper tells them they all died from food poisoning. They accompany the Grim Reaper to Heaven, depicted as a Las Vegas-style hotel in perpetual Christmas, where a Tony Bennett-lookalike performs \"Christmas in Heaven\" to the cast.\n\n\"The End of the Film\" epilogue features the host of \"The Middle of the Film\" being handed an envelope containing the meaning of life. She reads it out: \"Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations\".\n\nAccording to Palin, \"the writing process was quite cumbersome. An awful lot of material didn't get used. \"Holy Grail\" had a structure, a loose one: the search for the grail. Same with \"Life of Brian\". With this, it wasn't so clear. In the end, we just said: 'Well, what the heck. We have got lots of good material, let's give it the loosest structure, which will be the meaning of life'\".\n\nAfter the film's title was chosen, Douglas Adams called Jones to tell him he had just finished a new book, to be called \"The Meaning of Liff\"; Jones was initially concerned about the similarity in titles, which led to the scene in the title sequence of a tombstone which, when hit by a flash of lightning, changes from \"The Meaning of Liff\" to \"The Meaning of Life\".\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 12, 1982 and was completed about two months later, on September 11. A wide variety of locations were used, such as Porchester Hall in Queensway for the Mr. Creosote sketch, where hundreds of pounds of fake vomit had to be cleaned up on the last day due to a wedding being scheduled hours later. The Malham Moors were chosen for the Grim Reaper segment; the countryside near Strathblane was used for the Zulu War; and \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" was shot in Colne, Lancashire with interiors done at Elstree Studios.\n\nThe film was produced on a budget of less than US$10 million, which was still bigger than that of the earlier films. This allowed for large-scale choreography and crowd sequences, a more lavishly produced soundtrack that included new original songs, and much more time able to be spent on each sketch, especially \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\". Palin later said that the larger budget, and not making the film for the BBC (i.e., television), allowed the film to be more daring and dark.\n\nThe idea for the hospital sketch came from Chapman, himself a physician, who had noticed that hospitals were changing, with \"lots and lots of machinery\". According to Palin, the organ transplant scene harked back to Python's love of bureaucracy, and sketches with lots of people coming round from the council with different bits of paper.\n\nDuring the filming of the scene where Palin's character explains Catholicism to his children, his line was \"that rubber thing at the end of my \"sock\"\", which was later overdubbed with \"cock\".\n\nThe short film \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\" introduces the feature. It is about a group of elderly office clerks working in a small accounting firm. They rebel against yuppie corporate masters, transform their office building into a pirate ship, and raid a large financial district. One of the boardrooms raided reappears later in the film, from shortly before the attack begins until the narrator apologises and a skyscraper falls and crushes the marauders.\n\nThe short was intended as an animated sequence in the feature, for placement at the end of Part V. Gilliam convinced the other members of Monty Python to allow him to produce and direct it as a live action piece instead.\n\nThe original tagline read \"It took God six days to create the Heavens and the Earth, and Monty Python just 90 minutes to screw it up\" (the length of \"The Meaning of Life\" proper is 90 minutes, but becomes 107 minutes as released with the \"Short Subject Presentation\", \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\"). In an April 2012 re-release held by the American Film Institute, the tagline is altered to read \"It took God six days to create the Heavens and the Earth, and Monty Python just 1 hour and 48 minutes to screw it up\".\n\nIreland banned the film on its original release as it had previously done with \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\", but later rated it 15 when it was released on video. In the United Kingdom the film was rated 18 when released in the cinema and on its first release on video, but was re-rated 15 in 2000. In the United States the film is rated R.\n\nThe film opened in North America on 31 March 1983. At 257 theatres, it ranked number six in the domestic box office, grossing US$1,987,853 ($7,734 per screen) in its opening weekend. It played at 554 theatres at its widest point, and its total North American gross was $14,929,552.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 2 and a half stars out of four, calling it a \"a barbed, uncompromising attack on generally observed community standards\". In \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby declared it \"the \"Ben Hur\" of sketch films, which is to say that it's a tiny bit out of proportion\", concluding it was amusing, but he wished it were consistently amusing. \"Variety\" staff assessed it as disgusting, ridiculous, tactless, but above all, amusing. Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" awarded 3 stars out of 4, calling it \"fresh and original and delightfully offensive. What more can you ask of a comedy?\" Sheila Benson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that the film was full of \"raunchy talk, blasphemy (well, sacrilege) and one example of what kids call a totally \"gnarly,\" gross-out scene. The problem for the reviewer (to be specific, this reviewer) is when you are laughing this much it makes logging all the fast-flying offenses almost impossible.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" was negative, writing that \"The strongest impressions left by this picture have less to do with its largely tedious attempts to burlesque human weakness and pomposity than with the group's failure to evolve a coherent satiric outlook.\" A review by Steve Jenkins in \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" was also negative, writing that the return to a sketch format constituted a \"great leap backwards\" for the troupe and that the film's outrageous moments \"cannot disguise the overall air of \"déjà vu\" and playing it safe.\"\n\nIn 2007, \"Empire\"s Ian Nathan rated it three of five stars, describing it as \"too piecemeal and unfocused, but it possesses some of their most iconic musings and inspired madness\". In 2014, \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the film four stars out of five. In his \"2015 Movie Guide\", Leonard Maltin awarded it three stars, calling it \"A barrel of bellylaughs\", identifying the Mr. Creosote and \"Every Sperm is Sacred\" sketches as the most memorable. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 85%, based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10.\n\n\"The Meaning of Life\" was awarded the Grand Jury Prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. While the Cannes jury, led by William Styron, were fiercely split on their opinions on several films in competition, \"The Meaning of Life\" had general support, securing it the second-highest honour after the Palme d'Or for \"The Ballad of Narayama\". \n\nAt the 37th British Academy Film Awards, Andre Jacquemin, Dave Howman, Michael Palin and Terry Jones were also nominated for Original Song for \"Every Sperm is Sacred.\" The award went to \"Up Where We Belong\" in \"An Officer and a Gentleman\".\n\nA two-disc DVD release in 2003 features a documentary on production and a director's cut, which adds deleted scenes into the film, making it 116 minutes. The first is \"The Adventures of Martin Luther\", inserted after the scene with the Protestant couple talking about condoms. The second is a promotional video about the British army, which comes between the marching around the square scene and the Zulu army scene. The third and last is an extension of the American characters performed by Idle and Palin; they are shown their room and talk about tampons. In Region 1, it was released on Blu-ray to mark its 30th anniversary.\n\n"}

It was previously located in the former theatre building by Carl Ferdinand Langhans, next to Schloss Charlottenburg, and encompasses six exhibition halls on three floors. Since October 2009, the museum's exhibitions are now displayed in the Neues Museum on Museum Island.\n\nApart from a permanent exhibition, it regularly houses temporary exhibits. Attached to the museum is a specialised library on prehistoric archaeology with over 50,000 volumes. Furthermore, the museum houses the \"Commission for the exploration of archaeological collections and documents from northeast Central Europe\", a project for the study of ancient Egyptian calendars, and a number of other bodies.\n\nThe collection goes back to the Cabinet of curiosities and later art collection of the Hohenzollern who assembled an initial collection of ancient finds from 1830 onwards in Schloss Monbijou under the name \"Museum Vaterländischer Altertümer\" (\"Museum of National Antiquities\"). Later, the collection moved first to the Neues Museum, then, in 1886, to the Ethnographic Museum (Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse) and in 1921 into the Martin-Gropius-Bau, where it was renamed \"Staatliches Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte\" in 1931. The museum's financial supporters and contributors of material included Rudolf Virchow and Heinrich Schliemann. \n\nAfter World War II, parts of the collections were confiscated by the Soviet Union.\nThe Museum moved to Schloss Charlottenburg (then West Berlin) in 1960. After German reunification, the collection of the East Berlin \"Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte \" was incorporated.\n\nThe museum visit takes the form of a circuit walk. It includes the following rooms:\n\nThe Rudolf-Virchow-Studio (Room 1) contains an overview of the technological history of the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age.It also contains PCs with interactive displays and a lecture hall.\n\nDer Schliemann-Saal (Room 2) houses bronze and Iron Age finds from the Mediterranean, West and Central Asia and China. It also contains a collection of Cypriot antiquities of international rank.\n\nThe Stone Age and Bronze Age room (Room 3) shows European finds from those periods. The displays include finds from the Palaeolithic sites of Combe-Capelle and Le Moustier, Ice Age art and the development of Palaeolithic and Mesolithic tools. It also presents the Neolithic cultures of Europe from Linear Pottery to Bell beaker. The Bronze Age collection includes material illustrating the development of metallurgy, of cult and of funerarary habits. The geographic range extends from Western Europe to Northern Germany and Scandinavia, but also to East Central Europe, the Alps and Danube region and even Northern Italy.\n\nThe Gold Room (Room 4) contains precious individual finds of Bronze Age metal (the Berlin Gold Hat, though, is now part of the Neues Museum, which was reopened in 2009).\n\nRoom 5 is devoted to the period from the early Iron Age to the Middle Ages. It begins with finds from the Hallstatt culture of the Alps and the Sticna cuirass, followed by Celtic, Germanic and Roman material. The Middle Ages are documented through the exhibition of coins, clothing, weaponry, and other finds.\n\n"}

It is not related to the National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections (NUCMC). The National Union Catalog of Pre-1956 Imprints, a set of 754 volumes, largely superseded the older Library of Congress Catalog of printed books, and included printed works published before 1956 which are held by major American and Canadian libraries. It is sometimes referred to as \"the Mansell\", after its publisher. This set is a massive bibliography compiled during the period from 1968 to 1981. It contains photocopies of printed catalog cards from major American and Canadian libraries, arranged alphabetically by author's last name, or by title for books that have no author, such as the Bible.\n\nThe NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints was an important resource for verifying bibliographic information and finding copies of books before the advent of large electronic bibliographic databases, such as WorldCat; the massive size and weight of the set make it less useful now. However, given that approximately 27% of the books listed in the NUC Pre-1956 Imprints were not in listed WorldCat as of 2005 (25% in 2008), it remains an extremely valuable tool for researchers.\n\nThe complete title of this work describes its purpose and scope:\n\nThe Library of Congress began its union catalog project in 1901 in an attempt to locate and note the location of a copy of every important book in the United States. With financial assistance from John D. Rockefeller Jr., the collection grew to over 11 million cards. Copies of these cards were distributed to a number of libraries around the country. Eventually the cards for all materials catalogued by the cooperating libraries were reproduced and issued serially in printed volumes as the National Union Catalog, supplementing the Library of Congress Catalog of Printed Books. Monthly NUC catalogs were cumulated quarterly, annually, and multi-annually.\n\nIn an effort to simplify research, it was decided in the 1960s to collect and publish all of the references to pre-1956 imprints in a single alphabetical listing. Mansell Information/Publishing Ltd., the company which created the British Museum library catalog, won the contract to publish the proposed union catalog. Over the next 14 years, about five 600-page volumes were published each month until the NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints was completed, largely superseding the older Library of Congress Catalog of Printed Books.\n\nThe NUC of Pre-1956 Imprints is published in 754 volumes, containing over 528,000 pages. The set takes up approximately of shelf space. It weighs three tons.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1904505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1904505", "title": "Partwork", "text": "Partwork\n\nA partwork is a written publication released as a series of planned magazine-like issues over a period of time. Issues are typically released on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, and often a completed set is designed to form a reference work on a particular topic.\n\nPartwork series run for a determined length and have a finite life. Generally, partworks cover specific areas of interest, such as sports, hobbies, or children's interest and stories such as \"PC Ace\" and the successful \"The Ancestral Trail\" series by Marshall Cavendish Ltd. They are generally sold at newsagents and are mostly supported by massive television advertising campaigns for the launch. In the United Kingdom, partworks are usually launched by heavy television advertising each January.\nPartworks often include cover-mounted items with each issue that build into a complete set over time. For example, a partwork about art might include a small number of paints or pencils that build into a complete art-set; a partwork about dinosaurs might include a few replica bones that build a complete model skeleton at the end of the series; a partwork about films may include a DVD with each issue. In Europe, partworks with collectable models are extremely popular; there are a number of different publications that come with character figurines or diecast model vehicles, for example: The James Bond Car Collection.\n\nIn addition, completed partworks have sometimes been used to create case-bound reference works and encyclopedias. An example is the multi-volume \"Illustrated Science and Invention Encyclopedia\" which was created with material first published in the \"How It Works\" partwork.\n\nIn the UK, partworks are the fourth-best selling magazine sector, after TV listing guides, women's weeklies and women's monthlies. A common inducement is a heavy discount for the first one or two issues. The same series can be sold worldwide in different languages and even in different variations.\n\nPrior to the invention of printing, the Pecia System was used in European university cities. Books were divided into sections known as \"Pecia\". Students or other individuals could rent the individual pieces and copy them by hand. In this way, several individuals could work on copying one book at the same time.\n\nWith the advent of printing, \"serialized publication\" came into use by printers and publishers. Between 1728 and 1732, Nicolas Tindal's English translation of Paul de Rapin's \"L'Histoire d'Angleterre\" (The History of England) was issued by a London printer in monthly parts. A rival printer then tried to compete by selling another translation of de Rapin's work in weekly, six-penny installments. An edition of \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\" was issued in three-penny installments in 1732. At the time, printing a book was a lengthy process, copies of each section of the book being printed in turn until the work was complete; the sections would then be collated and the print–run of books could then be sold. The alternative of selling individual sections as soon as they were printed would enable the printer could gain a steady income while the book was being produced, and potentially increase sales by selling to people who could not afford the upfront cost of a copy of the complete book.\n\nIn the 19th century, many of Charles Dickens' novels were first published as partworks. For example, \"The Pickwick Papers\" was first published in 19 parts, between 1836 and 1837. \"The Old Curiosity Shop\" was first published in 88 weekly parts between April 1840 and November 1841.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, partwork serialized encyclopedias were issued. Publishers soon branching out to topics, including cookery books and series on gardening and car maintenance.\n\nPartworks, particularly those that contain parts for the production of a model or similar collectable items that are individually of little value, often draw criticism for the extremely high prices of their finished product. One example, released in the UK in 2009, required the purchase of 125 issues to collect the parts for a static, model aircraft; the total would be £620.25. Examples of other models that cost over £400 to produce are cited, and some subscribers complain they have parts missing that they are unable to replace.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23273", "title": "Patent", "text": "Patent\n\nA patent is a form of intellectual property. A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, and importing an invention for a limited period of time, usually twenty years. The patent rights are granted in exchange for an enabling public disclosure of the invention. People who are employed to do research are often obligated by their employment contracts to assign inventions to their employer. In most countries patent rights fall under civil law and the patent holder needs to sue someone infringing the patent in order to enforce their rights. In some industries patents are an essential form of competitive advantage; in others they are irrelevant.\n\nThe procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness.\n\nUnder the World Trade Organization's (WTO) TRIPS Agreement, patents should be available in WTO member states for any invention, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. Nevertheless, there are variations on what is patentable subject matter from country to country, also among WTO member states. TRIPS also provides that the term of protection available should be a minimum of twenty years.\n\nThe word \"patent\" originates from the Latin \"patere\", which means \"to lay open\" (i.e., to make available for public inspection). It is a shortened version of the term \"letters patent\", which was an open document or instrument issued by a monarch or government granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system. Similar grants included land patents, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and printing patents, a precursor of modern copyright.\n\nIn modern usage, the term \"patent\" usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents something new, useful and non-obvious. Some other types of intellectual property rights are also called \"patents\" in some jurisdictions: industrial design rights are called \"design patents\" in the US, plant breeders' rights are sometimes called \"plant patents\", and utility models and \"Gebrauchsmuster\" are sometimes called \"petty patents\" or \"innovation patents\".\n\nThe additional qualification \"utility patent\" is sometimes used (primarily in the US) to distinguish the primary meaning from these other types of patents. Particular species of patents for inventions include biological patents, business method patents, chemical patents and software patents.\n\nAlthough there is some evidence that some form of patent rights was recognized in Ancient Greece in the Greek city of Sybaris, The first statutory patent system is generally regarded to be the Venetian Patent Statute of 1474. Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1474, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers. The period of protection was 10 years.. As Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in their new homes. This led to the diffusion of patent systems to other countries.\n\nThe English patent system evolved from its early medieval origins into the first modern patent system that recognised intellectual property in order to stimulate invention; this was the crucial legal foundation upon which the Industrial Revolution could emerge and flourish. By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually abuse the granting of letters patent for monopolies. After public outcry, King James I of England (VI of Scotland) was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for \"projects of new invention\". This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies (1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown's power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. The Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere.\nImportant developments in patent law emerged during the 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the principles of operation of the invention for public access. Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented. Influenced by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege.\n\nThe English legal system became the foundation for patent law in countries with a common law heritage, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia. In the Thirteen Colonies, inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given colony's legislature. In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court for a new process for making salt.\nThe modern French patent system was created during the Revolution in 1791. Patents were granted without examination since inventor's right was considered as a natural one. Patent costs were very high (from 500 to 1,500 francs). Importation patents protected new devices coming from foreign countries. The patent law was revised in 1844 - patent cost was lowered and importation patents were abolished.\n\nThe first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10, 1790, titled \"An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts\". The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790 to Samuel Hopkins for a method of producing potash (potassium carbonate). A revised patent law was passed in 1793, and in 1836 a major revision to the patent law was passed. The 1836 law instituted a significantly more rigorous application process, including the establishment of an examination system. Between 1790 and 1836 about ten thousand patents were granted. By the Civil War about 80,000 patents had been granted.\n\nA patent does not give a right to make or use or sell an invention. Rather, a patent provides, from a legal standpoint, the right to \"exclude others\" from making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the patented invention for the term of the patent, which is usually 20 years from the filing date subject to the payment of maintenance fees. From an economic and practical standpoint however, a patent is better and perhaps more precisely regarded as conferring upon its proprietor \"a right to \"try\" to exclude by asserting the patent in court\", for many granted patents turn out to be invalid once their proprietors attempt to assert them in court. A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.\n\nA patent, being an exclusionary right, does not necessarily give the patent owner the right to exploit the invention subject to the patent. For example, many inventions are improvements of prior inventions that may still be covered by someone else's patent. If an inventor obtains a patent on improvements to an existing invention which is still under patent, they can only legally use the improved invention if the patent holder of the original invention gives permission, which they may refuse.\n\nSome countries have \"working provisions\" that require the invention be exploited in the jurisdiction it covers. Consequences of not working an invention vary from one country to another, ranging from revocation of the patent rights to the awarding of a compulsory license awarded by the courts to a party wishing to exploit a patented invention. The patentee has the opportunity to challenge the revocation or license, but is usually required to provide evidence that the reasonable requirements of the public have been met by the working of invention.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, there are ways for third parties to challenge the validity of an allowed or issued patent at the national patent office; these are called opposition proceedings. It is also possible to challenge the validity of a patent in court. In either case, the challenging party tries to prove that the patent should never have been granted. There are several grounds for challenges: the claimed subject matter is not patentable subject matter at all; the claimed subject matter was actually not new, or was obvious to experts in the field, at the time the application was filed; or that some kind of fraud was committed during prosecution with regard to listing of inventors, representations about when discoveries were made, etc. Patents can be found to be invalid in whole or in part for any of these reasons.\n\nPatent infringement occurs when a third party, without authorization from the patentee, makes, uses, or sells a patented invention. Patents, however, are enforced on a nation by nation basis. The making of an item in China, for example, that would infringe a U.S. patent, would not constitute infringement under US patent law unless the item were imported into the US.\n\nPatents can generally only be enforced through civil lawsuits (for example, for a U.S. patent, by an action for patent infringement in a United States federal court), although some countries (such as France and Austria) have criminal penalties for wanton infringement. Typically, the patent owner seeks monetary compensation for past infringement, and seeks an injunction that prohibits the defendant from engaging in future acts of infringement. To prove infringement, the patent owner must establish that the accused infringer practises all the requirements of at least one of the claims of the patent. (In many jurisdictions the scope of the patent may not be limited to what is literally stated in the claims, for example due to the \"doctrine of equivalents\").\n\nAn accused infringer has the right to challenge the validity of the patent allegedly being infringed in a counterclaim. A patent can be found invalid on grounds described in the relevant patent laws, which vary between countries. Often, the grounds are a subset of requirements for patentability in the relevant country. Although an infringer is generally free to rely on any available ground of invalidity (such as a prior publication, for example), some countries have sanctions to prevent the same validity questions being relitigated. An example is the UK Certificate of contested validity.\n\nPatent licensing agreements are contracts in which the patent owner (the licensor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the claimed invention, usually in return for a royalty or other compensation. It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under cross-licensing agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.\n\nIn most countries, both natural persons and corporate entities may apply for a patent. In the United States, however, only the inventor(s) may apply for a patent although it may be assigned to a corporate entity subsequently and inventors may be required to assign inventions to their employers under an employment contract. In most European countries, ownership of an invention may pass from the inventor to their employer by rule of law if the invention was made in the course of the inventor's normal or specifically assigned employment duties, where an invention might reasonably be expected to result from carrying out those duties, or if the inventor had a special obligation to further the interests of the employer's company.\nThe inventors, their successors or their assignees become the proprietors of the patent when and if it is granted. If a patent is granted to more than one proprietor, the laws of the country in question and any agreement between the proprietors may affect the extent to which each proprietor can exploit the patent. For example, in some countries, each proprietor may freely license or assign their rights in the patent to another person while the law in other countries prohibits such actions without the permission of the other proprietor(s).\n\nThe ability to assign ownership rights increases the liquidity of a patent as property. Inventors can obtain patents and then sell them to third parties. The third parties then own the patents and have the same rights to prevent others from exploiting the claimed inventions, as if they had originally made the inventions themselves.\n\nThe grant and enforcement of patents are governed by national laws, and also by international treaties, where those treaties have been given effect in national laws. Patents are granted by national or regional patent offices. A given patent is therefore only useful for protecting an invention in the country in which that patent is granted. In other words, patent law is territorial in nature. When a patent application is published, the invention disclosed in the application becomes prior art and enters the public domain (if not protected by other patents) in countries where a patent applicant does not seek protection, the application thus generally becoming prior art against anyone (including the applicant) who might seek patent protection for the invention in those countries.\n\nCommonly, a nation or a group of nations forms a patent office with responsibility for operating that nation's patent system, within the relevant patent laws. The patent office generally has responsibility for the grant of patents, with infringement being the remit of national courts. \n\nThe authority for patent statutes in different countries varies. In the UK, substantive patent law is contained in the Patents Act 1977 as amended. In the United States, the Constitution empowers Congress to make laws to \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts...\" The laws Congress passed are codified in Title 35 of the United States Code and created the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nThere is a trend towards global harmonization of patent laws, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) being particularly active in this area. The TRIPS Agreement has been largely successful in providing a forum for nations to agree on an aligned set of patent laws. Conformity with the TRIPS agreement is a requirement of admission to the WTO and so compliance is seen by many nations as important. This has also led to many developing nations, which may historically have developed different laws to aid their development, enforcing patents laws in line with global practice.\n\nInternationally, there are international treaty procedures, such as the procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) [constituting the European Patent Organisation (EPOrg)], that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, the principles of the convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 150 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.\n\nA patent is requested by filing a written application at the relevant patent office. The person or company filing the application is referred to as \"the applicant\". The applicant may be the inventor or its assignee. The application contains a description of how to make and use the invention that must provide sufficient detail for a person skilled in the art (i.e., the relevant area of technology) to make and use the invention. In some countries there are requirements for providing specific information such as the usefulness of the invention, the best mode of performing the invention known to the inventor, or the technical problem or problems solved by the invention. Drawings illustrating the invention may also be provided.\n\nThe application also includes one or more claims that define what a patent covers or the \"scope of protection\".\n\nAfter filing, an application is often referred to as \"patent pending\". While this term does not confer legal protection, and a patent cannot be enforced until granted, it serves to provide warning to potential infringers that if the patent is issued, they may be liable for damages.\n\nOnce filed, a patent application is \"prosecuted\". A patent examiner reviews the patent application to determine if it meets the patentability requirements of that country. If the application does not comply, objections are communicated to the applicant or their patent agent or attorney through an Office action, to which the applicant may respond. The number of Office actions and responses that may occur vary from country to country, but eventually a final rejection is sent by the patent office, or the patent application is granted, which after the payment of additional fees, leads to an issued, enforceable patent. In some jurisdictions, there are opportunities for third parties to bring an opposition proceeding between grant and issuance, or post-issuance.\n\nOnce granted the patent is subject in most countries to renewal fees to keep the patent in force. These fees are generally payable on a yearly basis. Some countries or regional patent offices (e.g. the European Patent Office) also require annual renewal fees to be paid for a patent application before it is granted.\n\nThe costs of preparing and filing a patent application, prosecuting it until grant and maintaining the patent vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may also be dependent upon the type and complexity of the invention, and on the type of patent.\n\nThe European Patent Office estimated in 2005 that the average cost of obtaining a European patent (via a Euro-direct application, i.e. not based on a PCT application) and maintaining the patent for a 10-year term was around €32,000. Since the London Agreement entered into force on May 1, 2008, this estimation is however no longer up-to-date, since fewer translations are required.\n\nIn the United States, in 2000 the cost of obtaining a patent (patent prosecution) was estimated to be from $10,000 to $30,000 per patent. When patent litigation is involved (which in year 1999 happened in about 1,600 cases compared to 153,000 patents issued in the same year), costs increase significantly: although 95% of patent litigation cases are settled out of court, those that reach the courts have legal costs on the order of a million dollars per case, not including associated business costs.\n\nA defensive publication is the act of publishing a detailed description of a new invention without patenting it, so as to establish prior art and public identification as the creator/originator of an invention, although a defensive publication can also be anonymous. A defensive publication prevents others from later being able to patent the invention.\n\nA trade secret is information that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are that the value of a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.\n\nPrimary incentives embodied in the patent system include incentives to invent in the first place; to disclose the invention once made; to invest the sums necessary to experiment, produce and market the invention; and to design around and improve upon earlier patents.\n\n\nOne effect of modern patent usage is that a small-time inventor, who can afford both the patenting process and the defense of the patent, can use the exclusive right status to become a licensor. This allows the inventor to accumulate capital from licensing the invention and may allow innovation to occur because he or she may choose not to manage a manufacturing buildup for the invention. Thus the inventor's time and energy can be spent on pure innovation, allowing others to concentrate on manufacturability.\n\nAnother effect of modern patent usage is to both enable and incentivize competitors to design around (or to \"invent around\" according to R S Praveen Raj) the patented invention. This may promote healthy competition among manufacturers, resulting in gradual improvements of the technology base. This may help augment national economies and confer better living standards to the citizens. The 1970 Indian Patent Act allowed the Indian pharmaceutical industry to develop local technological capabilities in this industry. This act coincided with the transformation of India from a bulk importer of pharmaceutical drugs to a leading exporter. The rapid evolution of Indian pharmaceutical industry since the mid-1970s highlights the fact that the design of the patent act was instrumental in building local capabilities even in a developing country like India.\n\nLegal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject. Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of free trade. Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources (e.g. with patent-related overheads) that could otherwise be used productively to improve technology. These and other research findings that patents decreased innovation because of the following mechanisms:\n\nBoldrin and Levine conclude \"Our preferred policy solution is to abolish patents entirely and to find other legislative instruments, less open to lobbying and rent seeking, to foster innovation when there is clear evidence that laissez-faire undersupplies it.\" Abolishing patents may be politically challenging in some countries, however, as the primary economic theories supporting patent law hold that inventors and innovators need patents to recoup the costs associated with research, inventing, and commercializing; this reasoning is weakened if the new technologies decrease these costs. A 2016 paper argued for substantial weakening of patents because current technologies (e.g. 3D printing, cloud computing, synthetic biology, etc.) have reduced the cost of innovation.\n\nDebates over the usefulness of patents for their primary objective are part of a larger discourse on intellectual property protection, which also reflects differing perspectives on copyright.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1162268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1162268", "title": "Pennyroyal Tea", "text": "Pennyroyal Tea\n\n\"Pennyroyal Tea\" is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It is the ninth track on the band's third and final studio album, \"In Utero\", released in September, 1993. The song was due to be released as the third single from \"In Utero\" in April 1994, but the single was recalled following Cobain's death the same month. The single was re-released, on limited edition 7 inch vinyl, for Record Store Day in April 2014, and charted at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Singles Sales chart.\n\nAccording to Michael Azerrad's 1993 Nirvana biography, \"\", \"Pennyroyal Tea\" was written by Cobain in 1990 in an Olympia, Washington apartment he shared with Nirvana drummer, Dave Grohl. \"Dave and I were screwing around on a 4-track,\" Cobain explained, \"and I wrote that song in about thirty seconds. And I sat down for like half-an-hour and wrote the lyrics and then we recorded it.\" It was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington, the show at which Nirvana also debuted their breakthrough single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\" Two unfinished takes, both lacking vocals, were recorded by Jack Endino on October 26, 1992, at Word of Mouth in Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe final version was recorded by Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota in February, 1993, and officially released on \"In Utero\" in September, 1993. Cobain was unsatisfied with the recording, telling David Fricke in a 1993 \"Rolling Stone\" interview that the song \"was not recorded right. There is something wrong with that. That should have been recorded like \"Nevermind\", because I know that's a strong song, a hit single. We're toying with the idea of re-recording it or remixing it.\" The song was remixed by Scott Litt, who had remixed the \"In Utero\" songs \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\" prior to the album's release, on November 22, 1993 at Bad Animals in Seattle, Washington. This version appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of \"In Utero\", released in March 1994, and is the mix that was released as a single. It also appears on the band's two greatest hits albums, \"Nirvana\" (2002) and \"Icon\" (2010).\n\nThe song's title refers to the tea made from boiling the leaves of the plant \"Mentha pulegium\", or pennyroyal, which is used as an abortifacient, among other things, in traditional medicine. In Cobain's unused liner notes for \"In Utero\", published posthumously in \"Journals\" in 2002, the entry for \"Pennyroyal Tea\" simply reads: \"herbal abortive... it doesn't work, you hippie.\"\n\nIn an interview in the October 1993 issue of \"Impact\", Cobain gave greater insight into the song, saying that it was about a person suffering from severe depression: \n\nIn a 1995 interview, Cohen told \"Addicted to Noise\" correspondent Peter Howell, \"I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man. I see a lot of people at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school. There are always alternatives, and I might have been able to lay something on him. Or maybe not.\"\n\nThe \"Pennyroyal Tea\" single was recalled shortly after Cobain's death in April 1994. The single's cancellation may have in part be due to the title of one of the b-sides, \"I Hate Myself and Want to Die,\", although it may have been cancelled regardless of this, so as not to capitalize on Cobain's death.\n\nAt the time, only retail versions of the CD single made in Germany had been manufactured and distributed. The singles were recalled and destroyed by the record label or retailers, but some copies were put aside, which is apparently the source of surviving copies. Some copies may have been sold by retailers, despite the recall. A promotional CD single manufactured in the United Kingdom survived in even smaller numbers than the German retail CD. Sleeves for the single's release in the UK, on 7 inch vinyl and cassette, were manufactured, but the single itself was not pressed in the UK prior to the recall. As with all Nirvana artwork, it had been produced in the United States, although there were no plans to release the single in the US.\n\nA planned promotional performance on the UK TV show \"Top of the Pops\" is evident as a Digital Audio Tape has been discovered containing three different mixes of \"Pennyroyal Tea\" all without vocals for the show which was strictly live vocal to track performances.\n\nReviewing \"In Utero\" for \"Rolling Stone\", Fricke wrote, \"In the sepulchral folk intro of 'Penny Royal Tea,' Cobain almost sounds like Michael Stipe at the beginning of R.E.M.’s Drive' — before the heaving, fuzz-burnt chorus comes lashing down with a vengeance.\" In his review of the album for the \"NME\", John Mulvey wrote that \"Pennyroyal Tea\" was \"a terrific song – straightforward, insidious, oddly moving,\" but that \"the guitars don’t scream enough, the chorus doesn’t tower like it should, and overall it’s the one real ‘Call Butch Vig’ moment.\"\n\nIn 2004, the \"NME\" ranked it at number six on their list of the \"20 Greatest Nirvana Songs Ever.\" The same year, \"Q\" erroneously included the song on their list of \"12 Album Tracks That Should Have Been Singles, But Weren't,\" at number two. In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" placed it at number 11 on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.\n\nOn April 19, 2014, the \"Pennyroyal Tea\" single was re-released on 7-inch vinyl for Record Store Day 2014, limited to only 6000 copies. It was the top-selling vinyl single of Record Store Day in the US, reaching number 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles Sales Chart.\n\nUnlike the artwork for the previous \"In Utero\" singles, \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\"/ \"Rape Me\", the artwork for the \"Pennyroyal Tea\" single featured no input from Cobain. \"We got it done and I don't know that Kurt was around to approve it or not,\" recalls designer Robert Fisher. \"I think it might just have been shot to management to approve or something.\" The single's cover features a teacup on a table next to a used ashtray, a cream pitcher and animal crackers.\n\nA live, acoustic version was recorded during the band's \"MTV Unplugged\" performance on November 18, 1993 at Sony Music Studios in New York City. The band had tried different approaches to the song during the rehearsal earlier that day, performing it in a different key and with guitarist Pat Smear on backing vocals. However, during the show Cobain decided to attempt the song on his own and in the regular key, asking, \"Am I going to do this by myself?\" to which Grohl replied, \"Do it by yourself,\" and Cobain joking that \"if it sounds bad, these people are just going to have to wait.\" The song was performed in the same arrangement as the \"In Utero\" version but without the guitar solo, and Cobain paused before the third verse, as if briefly forgetting what lyric to sing next, then regained himself and completed the song. Cobain's biographer, Charles Cross, called this version Cobain's \"single greatest moment onstage,\" writing that \"like all the high-water marks of his career, it came at a time when he seemed destined to fail.\"\n\nThis version was officially released on the album \"MTV Unplugged in New York\" in November, 1994. Footage of the performance, as well as from the rehearsals, were released on the \"MTV Unplugged in New York\" DVD in November, 2007.\n\nDutch director Anton Corbijn was asked to direct a music video for \"Pennyroyal Tea\", but he refused, saying he did not believe he could make a video better than the one he had made for \"Heart-Shaped Box\", the first single from \"In Utero\". American director Jeffery Plansker was enlisted as the director instead, but the planned video was abandoned after Cobain's death in April 1994.\n\nAll songs written and composed by Kurt Cobain unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll personnel credits adapted from \"In Utero\"s liner notes except design personnel adapted from \"Pennyroyal Tea\"'s liner notes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unreleased version was known to be in existence prior to 2015 but was leaked onto the internet in August 2015 via the Nirvana subreddit.\n\n"}

Berry (November 20, 1906 – July 21, 1973), better known by the ring name \"Wild\" Red Berry, was an American professional wrestler.\n\nBerry was a nine-time NWA World Light Heavyweight Champion and an important smaller wrestler of the 1930s to the 1950s, as well as a famous professional wrestling manager in his later years.\n\nStanding only 5'8\", Berry had to find creative ways to win his matches, which is why he oftentimes turned to rule breaking. His defiant in-ring actions made him one of the most hated professional wrestlers of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Berry did not care, as his disregard for authority eventually lead him to more than fifteen professional wrestling championship reigns over the course of his lengthy career.\n\nBerry continued his deviant behavior long after his in-ring career came to a close. As manager to such top stars as Gorilla Monsoon, The Fabulous Kangaroos and Bull Ramos, Berry was not above using his signature cane as a weapon.\n\nBerry started off as a boxer in 1923, eventually winning the Kansas State Middleweight Championship. After breaking both of his hands, he decided to change his sport to professional wrestling. His first recorded match was in 1926 but wrestled at carnivals prior to that date. By 1937, he had won his first title, the National Wrestling Association's World Light Heavyweight Championship. Berry held the World Light Heavyweight Championship nine times between 1937 and 1947, trading it often with Danny McShain. Berry and McShain feuded for years in Southern California.\n\nIn 1947, Berry suffered an arm injury and infection that made him sit out for a year. After the advent of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 1948, he held several regional championships for NWA member promotions, including the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship twice in 1949, the NWA Arkansas Junior Heavyweight Championship in 1954, and the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship in 1952 and 1957. In his feuds, Berry usually played the heel, or villain, except in his hometown of Pittsburg, where he was well-beloved.\n\nBerry began managing wrestlers in 1958, including The Fabulous Kangaroos (Al Costello and Roy Heffernan). He also managed Hans \"The Great\" Mortier. He was often seen at ringside wearing a warm up jacket with the phrase, \"I am Right\" emblazoned on the back. When The Fabulous Kangaroos were feuding with The Scufflin' Hillbillies in the northeast, Hillbillies manager \"Cousin alfred\" appeared with a jacket that said \"He's Wrong!\" on the back.\n\nBerry was also the manager of Gorilla Monsoon from 1963 to 1969 during Monsoon's heel days. He would speak for Monsoon in promos, because Monsoon's character was a mute from Manchuria (kayfabe) and took Monsoon and Killer Kowalski to the World Wide Wrestling Federation's (WWWF, now WWE) United States Tag Team Championship. Berry also managed Monsoon in a series of matches against WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino during the Monsoon-Sammartino feud. In 1969, when Monsoon turned into a fan favorite, he dropped Berry as his manager.\n\nBerry was inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1972. In 1996, Berry was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.\n\nBerry dropped out of school at age 12 to work in a coal mine to support his family. He had two younger siblings.\n\nOutside the ring, Berry was active in Pittsburg political circles. He was elected Parks Commissioner once. He also twice served as acting mayor. He also tried acting on at least one occasion, appearing in the 1953 film \"My Wife's Best Friend\". He was also in the episode \"Well Oiled\" of \"The Abbott and Costello Show\" as \"Wild\" Red Berry, but is credited as Red Barry. In his later life, he was both an active Mason and Shriner.\n\nA year and a half before he died, Berry suffered a stroke which inhibited his ability to speak. In 1973, he died of a heart attack. A species of \"Echinopsis\", developed by Bob Schick, was named after Berry. In addition, a softball field in Pittsburg is named after Berry.\n\nBerry also appeared on an episode of \"You Bet Your Life\" with Groucho Marx as a contestant where he and his partner won $1000.\n\n"}

Primarily, the book comprises 100 short essays on the selected works, covered in order of publication, without any ranking. It is considered an important critical summary of the science fiction field.\n\nPringle followed \"Science Fiction\" with \"\" (1988). Xanadu followed \"Science Fiction\" with at least three more \"100 Best\" books (below).\n\nIn the introduction Pringle offers the working definition, \"Science fiction is a form of fantastic fiction which exploits the imaginative perspectives of modern science.\" In turn, modern science is the \"scientific world-view ... as it has come to be accepted by the intelligent layperson\", which arguably \"first became common property in the mid to late 19th century.\"\n\nWithin fantastic fiction he distinguishes science fiction from \"Supernatural Horror\" and \"Heroic Fantasy\". They may be represented by \"Dracula\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", featuring \"the irruption of some supernatural force into the everyday world\" and \"set in completely imaginary worlds\" respectively. He also names the subclass \"Fabulations\", which do not belong in this book \"unless they have a significant scientific or technological content\".\n\nIn contrast, science fiction has a real world setting and \"fantastic developments which are explicable in terms of the scientific world-view.\" World-view does not mean accepted theory or fact: \"many sf writers cheat: they use sleight-of-hand rather than genuine scientific knowledge.\" \"The skilful use of pseudo-science and gobbledygook\" may be good enough to exploit the world-view.\n\nThe time period covered is approximately that for science fiction as a category of book publication, although the selected books were not all published in that category.\n\nPringle admits that fewer than thirty selections may generously be called even \"masterpieces \"of their sort\"\". On the whole,Some of them are old favourites of my own ... Some are other people's favourites, novels which have been outstandingly popular or influential, or which seem to be especially good representatives of their type. A small minority, perhaps as many as ten, are books for which I have little or no personal enthusiasm: they have been included for the sake of balance and variety.\n\nXanadu Publications of London published at least four \"100 Best\" books. Transatlantic editions or simply jacket and cover designs may variably use \"the\" and \"hundred\" in the subtitles. Carroll & Graf published the books in the U.S.\n\n\nXanadu commissioned Moorcock to write \"Fantasy\". When it became \"clear that I would not be able to deliver it for a long time, the publishers and I agreed that James Cawthorn was the person to take it over.\" Cawthorn was the primary author of the selections \"mainly\", according to Cawthorn, and of the text \"by far\", according to Moorcock. (\"Fantasy\", \"Introduction\", p. 9. The introduction, pp. 8–10, comprises a long section signed by Cawthorn, a short one signed by Moorcock, and joint unsigned \"Notes and Acknowledgments\".)\n\n\"Science Fiction\" is a collection of 100 reviews, nearly uniform in length (all one to two pages), with a moderately long introduction by the author.\n\n\"Horror\" comprises essays on 100 different books by 100(?) horror writers, apparently more-than-one- to less-than-six pages in length.\n\n\"Fantasy\" is a collection of 100 reviews, nearly uniform in length (little short of two pages), with a short introduction by the authors separately and jointly.\n\n"}
