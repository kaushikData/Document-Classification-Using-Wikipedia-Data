Maximum weight of individuals probably exceeds , with the all-tackle angling record standing at . They are large, deep-bodied, streamlined fish with large heads and eyes. The pectoral fins are very long, reaching back beyond the start of the second dorsal fin in juveniles and the space between the first and second dorsal fin in adults. They have 13 or 14 dorsal spines.\n\nBigeye tuna have a unique physiology which allows them to forage in deeper colder waters and tolerate oxygen-poor waters. Bigeye tuna are reported to tolerate ambient oxygen levels of 1.0 ml/L and routinely reach depths where ambient oxygen content is below 1.5 ml/L, largely due to the presence of blood with a high oxygen affinity. Vascular counter-current heat exchangers maintain body temperatures above ambient water temperature. These heat exchangers are engaged to conserve heat in deeper colder waters and are disengaged to allow rapid warming as the tuna ascend from cold water into warmer surface waters, providing short-latency, physiological thermoregulation. The eyes of bigeye tuna are well developed and with a large spherical lens allowing their vision to function well in low light conditions.\n\nConventional tagging data and counts of growth increments in otoliths (ear bones) of bigeye tuna have recorded a maximum age of 16 years. Recorded lengths at which sexual maturity is attained varies geographically with a length at which 50% of fishes sampled are mature of 135 cm in the eastern Pacific Ocean and 102–105 cm in the western Pacific Ocean. This translates to an age of maturity of 2 – 4 years. Differences in methods of studies may contribute to this variability. Spawning takes place across most months of the year in tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, becoming seasonal at higher latitudes when sea surface temperatures are above 24 °C. In the northwestern tropical Atlantic spawning occurs in June and July, and in January and February in the Gulf of Guinea, which is the only known Atlantic nursery area.\n\nBigeye tuna undertake a distinct diel shift in vertical behaviour, generally descending at dawn to deeper, cooler waters and returning to shallower, warmer waters at dusk. During the day they can undertake vertical movements into waters of 300–500 m depth that can be as low as 20 °C than surface temperatures. Individuals undertake thermoregulatory behaviour whilst at depth, periodically returning from deeper, cooler waters to shallower, warmer waters to re-warm. Across the Pacific Ocean the depths at which bigeye tuna spend the majority of their time during the day vary: in the eastern Pacific the majority of time is spent at 200–350 m; around Hawaii the majority of time is spent at 300–400 m and in the Coral Sea the majority of time is spent at 300–500 m. These suggest that bigeye tuna (or their prey) are tracking an optimum temperature (10-15 °C) which is shallower in the eastern Pacific Ocean than in the western Pacific Ocean. The diel shift in the vertical behaviour of bigeye tuna has been suggested to be associated with the diel migration of their prey. This is supported by the identification of a number of diurnally migrating species from the stomachs of bigeye tuna and observations of close associations between bigeye tuna and the sound scattering layer both during the day and at night.\n\nTypical vertical behaviour of bigeye tuna shifts when fish associate with seamounts, buoys and fish aggregating devices, with individuals remaining in surface waters. Association with objects has been observed to occur over periods of approximately 10–30 days. This associative behaviour of bigeye tuna (and also other species of tuna) is taken advantage of by fisheries with approximately 27% of all catches of tunas by purse seine vessels in the western and central Pacific Ocean derived from fish aggregating devices.\n\nResults from tagging studies show that bigeye tuna are capable of traversing ocean basins, but can also show a high degree of site fidelity to some regions. One study suggested an annual migration influenced by water temperature, specifically that near the surface. Central Pacific bigeye migrate from subtropical waters in September to tropical waters in March. The fish also briefly travel outside these thermal ranges. Other data indicate similar Pacific-wide variations.\n\nBigeye tuna primarily feed on epipelagic and mesopelagic fish, crustaceans and cephalopods.\n\nGlobally, approximately 450,500 metric tonnes of bigeye tuna were caught by commercial vessels in 2012. Commercial fisheries for bigeye tuna are regionally managed within the Pacific Ocean by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). In the Indian Ocean catches are managed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and in the Atlantic Ocean by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Regular stock assessments are carried out for bigeye tuna by each of the regional fisheries management organisations with bigeye tuna currently regarded as overfished in the western and central Pacific Ocean and eastern Pacific Ocean, close to or being overfished in the Atlantic Ocean and not overfished in the Indian Ocean. The majority of commercial catches across the Pacific Ocean is by purse seine fleets, while catches are dominated by longline fleets in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Various conservation measures have been introduced by the regional fisheries management organisations which apply to particular sized vessels and fleets and include measures such as spatial and temporal closures, trip duration limits, observer requirements and limits on catches \n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added bigeye tuna to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\" Most seafood sustainability guides encourage consumption of other types of tuna.\n\nResearch indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the tuna in the Indian Ocean, where rapid warming of the ocean has resulted in a reduction of marine phytoplankton. The bigeye tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.\n\n"}

Credited with breaking down barriers of racial segregation in professional wrestling, Harris is considered one of the first successful African American professional wrestlers.\n\nHouston Harris was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, but later lived in East St. Louis, Illinois, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. He played baseball in the Negro Leagues for The House of David, where he was discovered to become a wrestler at a steel mill.\n\nHarris was trained by Joe Savoldi after meeting him at matches at the Naval Armory. Savoldi originally named Harris, BuBu Brasil, \"The South American Giant,\" but a promoter misprinted his first name as \"Bobo\" in an advertisement and it stuck.\n\nEarly in his career, some wrestling promoters would match Brazil against fellow African American wrestlers, including Ernie Ladd and Abdullah the Butcher. Fans clamored to see Brazil face opponents of any type and Brazil would have many matches with competitors such as Killer Kowalski, Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, and The Sheik, who feuded with Brazil over the course of several decades. These and other rivals would all fall victim to Brazil's finishing maneuver, the Coco Butt. Brazil also once wrestled Bill Miller to a draw, and challenged Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF World Heavywight Championship in a battle of two top babyface competitors. On October 18, 1962, Brazil made history by becoming the first African American to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship by defeating \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers (this distinction is usually given to Ron Simmons, the first recognized African American world champion after winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship). Although Brazil initially refused the title (because of an \"injury\" that Rogers had claimed to have), Brazil was awarded the title the next day after doctors had found nothing wrong with Rogers. However, this title change is not recognized by the NWA.\n\nOn October 9, 1970, Brazil and El Mongol defeated Mr. Ito and The Great Ota in the first racially mixed match in Atlanta history.\n\nBrazil served as a mentor to wrestler \"Soulman\" Rocky Johnson. Brazil's manager was James Dudley, the first African American to be in charge of a major arena in the United States. Dudley would run to the ring waving a towel, as Brazil followed behind.\n\nBrazil retired in 1993 after a four decade career. His last official match was in Chicago, Illinois against Kelly Kiniski, son of rival Gene Kiniski. Brazil was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Ernie Ladd. The following year, Brazil inducted Ladd into the WWF Hall of Fame.\n\nHarris had a wife and six children. After retiring from wrestling, he ran a restaurant called Bobo's Grill.\n\nHarris died on January 20, 1998, at the Lakeland Medical Center in St. Joseph, Michigan. He had been admitted to the hospital on January 14, after suffering a series of strokes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "219119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219119", "title": "Donation of Constantine", "text": "Donation of Constantine\n\nThe Donation of Constantine () is a forged Roman imperial decree by which the 4th-century emperor Constantine the Great supposedly transferred authority over Rome and the western part of the Roman Empire to the Pope. Composed probably in the 8th century, it was used, especially in the 13th century, in support of claims of political authority by the papacy. Lorenzo Valla, an Italian Catholic priest and Renaissance humanist, is credited with first exposing the forgery with solid philological arguments in 1439–1440, although the document's authenticity had been repeatedly contested since 1001.\n\nIn many of the existing manuscripts (handwritten copies of the document), including the oldest one, the document bears the title \"Constitutum domini Constantini imperatoris\". The \"Donation of Constantine\" was included in the 9th-century \"Pseudo-Isidorean Decretals\" collection.\n\nThe text, purportedly a decree of Roman Emperor Constantine I dated 30 March, in a year mistakenly said to be both that of his fourth consulate (315) and that of the consulate of Gallicanus (317), contains a detailed profession of Christian faith and a recounting of how the emperor, seeking a cure for his leprosy, was converted and baptized by Pope Sylvester I. In gratitude, he determined to bestow on the seat of Peter \"power, and dignity of glory, and vigour, and honour imperial\", and \"supremacy as well over the four principal sees, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Constantinople, as also over all the churches of God in the whole earth\". For the upkeep of the church of Saint Peter and that of Saint Paul, he gave landed estates \"in Judea, Greece, Asia, Thrace, Africa, Italy and the various islands\". To Sylvester and his successors he also granted imperial insignia, the tiara, and \"the city of Rome, and all the provinces, places and cities of Italy and the western regions\".\n\nWhat may perhaps be the earliest known allusion to the \"Donation\" is in a letter of 778, in which Pope Hadrian I exhorts Charlemagne, whose father, Pepin the Younger, had made the Donation of Pepin granting the Popes sovereignty over the Papal States, to follow Constantine's example and endow the Roman Catholic church.\n\nThe first pope to directly invoke the decree was Pope Leo IX, in a letter sent in 1054 to Michael I Cerularius, Patriarch of Constantinople. He cited a large portion of the document, believing it genuine, furthering the debate that would ultimately lead to the East–West Schism. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the \"Donation\" was often cited in the investiture conflicts between the papacy and the secular powers in the West.\n\nIn his Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century, the poet Dante Alighieri wrote: \"Ahi, Costantin, di quanto mal fu matre, / non la tua conversion, ma quella dote / che da te prese il primo ricco patre!\" (\"Ah, Constantine, how much evil was born, / not from your conversion, but from that donation / that the first wealthy Pope received from you!\").\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the \"Donation\" was widely accepted as authentic, although the Emperor Otto III did possibly raise suspicions of the document \"in letters of gold\" as a forgery, in making a gift to the See of Rome. It was not until the mid-15th century, with the revival of Classical scholarship and textual criticism, that humanists, and eventually the papal bureaucracy, began to realize that the document could not possibly be genuine. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa declared it to be a forgery and spoke of it as an apocryphal work. \n\nLater, the Catholic priest Lorenzo Valla argued in his philological study of the text that the language used in manuscript could not be dated to the 4th century. The language of the text suggests that the manuscript can most likely be dated to the 8th century. Valla believed the forgery to be so obvious that he leaned toward believing that the Church had knowledge that the document was inauthentic. Valla further argued that papal usurpation of temporal power had corrupted the church, caused the wars of Italy, and reinforced the \"overbearing, barbarous, tyrannical priestly domination.\"\n\nThis was the first instance of modern, scientific diplomatics. Independently of both Cusa and Valla, Reginald Pecocke, Bishop of Chichester (1450–57), reached a similar conclusion. Among the indications that the Donation must be a fake are its language and the fact that, while certain imperial-era formulas are used in the text, some of the Latin in the document could not have been written in the 4th century; anachronistic terms such as \"fief\" were used. Also, the purported date of the document is inconsistent with the content of the document itself, as it refers both to the fourth consulate of Constantine (315) as well as the consulate of Gallicanus (317).\n\nPope Pius II wrote a tract in 1453, five years before becoming Pope, to show that, though the \"Donation\" was a forgery, the papacy owed its lands to Charlemagne and its powers of the keys to Peter; he did not publish it, however.\n\nContemporary opponents of papal powers in Italy emphasized the primacy of civil law and civil jurisdiction, now firmly embodied once again in the Justinian \"Corpus Juris Civilis\". The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Cavalcanti reported that, in the very year of Valla's treatise, Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, made diplomatic overtures toward Cosimo de' Medici in Florence, proposing an alliance against the Pope. In reference to the \"Donation\", Visconti wrote: \"It so happens that even if Constantine consigned to Sylvester so many and such rich gifts — which is doubtful, because such a privilege can nowhere be found — he could only have granted them for his lifetime: the Empire takes precedence over any lordship.\"\n\nLater, scholars further demonstrated that other elements, such as Sylvester's curing of Constantine, are legends which originated at a later time. Wolfram Setz, a recent editor of Valla's work, has affirmed that at the time of Valla's refutation, Constantine's alleged \"donation\" was no longer a matter of contemporary relevance in political theory and that it simply provided an opportunity for an exercise in legal rhetoric.\n\nThe bulls of Nicholas V and his successors made no further mention of the \"Donation\", even when partitioning the New World. Valla's treatise was taken up vehemently by writers of the Protestant Reformation, such as Ulrich von Hutten and Martin Luther, causing the treatise to be placed on the index of banned books in the mid-16th century. The \"Donation\" continued to be tacitly accepted as authentic until Caesar Baronius in his \"Annales Ecclesiastici\" (published 1588–1607) admitted that it was a forgery, after which it was almost universally accepted as such. Some continued to argue for its authenticity; nearly a century after \"Annales Ecclesiastici\", Christian Wolff still alluded to the \"Donation\" as undisputed fact.\n\nIt has been suggested that an early draft of the \"Donation of Constantine\" was made shortly after the middle of the 8th century, in order to assist Pope Stephen II in his negotiations with Pepin the Short, who then held the position of Mayor of the Palace (i.e., the manager of the household of the Frankish king). In 754, Pope Stephen II crossed the Alps to anoint Pepin king, thereby enabling the Carolingian family to supplant the old Merovingian royal line. In return for Stephen's support, Pepin gave the Pope the lands in Italy which the Lombards had taken from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. These lands would become the Papal States and would be the basis of the Papacy's temporal power for the next eleven centuries.\n\nIn one study, an attempt was made at dating the forgery to the 9th century, and placing its composition at Corbie Abbey, in northern France.\n\nMediaevalist Johannes Fried draws a distinction between the \"Donation of Constantine\" and an earlier, equally forged version, the \"Constitutum Constantini\", which was included in the collection of forged documents, the False Decretals, compiled in the later half of the ninth century. Fried argues the \"Donation\" is a later expansion of the much shorter \"Constitutum\". Christopher B. Coleman understands the mention in the \"Constitutum\" of a donation of \"the western regions\" to refer to Lombardy, Venetia, and Istria.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10268", "title": "Editor war", "text": "Editor war\n\nEditor war is the common name for the rivalry between users of the Emacs and vi (usually Vim) text editors. The rivalry has become a lasting part of hacker culture and the free software community.\n\nThe Emacs vs vi debate was one of the original \"holy wars\" conducted on Usenet groups, with many flame wars fought between those insisting that their editor of choice is the of editing perfection, and insulting the other, since at least 1985. Related battles have been fought over operating systems, programming languages, version control systems, and even source code indent style.\n\nThe most important differences between vi and Emacs are presented in the following table:\n\n\nIn the past, many small editors modeled after or derived from vi flourished. This was due to the importance of conserving memory with the comparatively minuscule amount available at the time. As computers have become more powerful, many vi clones, Vim in particular, have grown in size and code complexity. These vi variants of today, as with the old lightweight Emacs variants, tend to have many of the perceived benefits and drawbacks of the opposing side. For example, Vim without any extensions requires about ten times the disk space required by vi, and recent versions of Vim can have more extensions and run slower than Emacs. In \"The Art of Unix Programming\", Eric S. Raymond called Vim's supposed light weight when compared with Emacs \"a shared myth\". Moreover, with the large amounts of RAM in modern computers, both Emacs and vi are lightweight compared to large integrated development environments such as Eclipse, which tend to draw derision from Emacs and vi users alike.\n\nTim O'Reilly said, in 1999, that O'Reilly Media's tutorial on vi sells twice as many copies as that on Emacs (but noted that Emacs came with a free manual). Many programmers use either Emacs and vi or their various offshoots, including Linus Torvalds who uses MicroEMACS. Also in 1999, vi creator Bill Joy said that vi was \"written for a world that doesn't exist anymore\" and stated that Emacs was written on much more capable machines with faster displays so they could have \"funny commands with the screen shimmering and all that, and meanwhile, I'm sitting at home in sort of World War II surplus housing at Berkeley with a modem and a terminal that can just barely get the cursor off the bottom line\".\n\nIn addition to Emacs and vi workalikes, pico and its free and open-source clone nano and other text editors such as ne often have their own third-party advocates in the editor wars, though not to the extent of Emacs and vi.\n\nAs of 2014, both Emacs and vi can lay claim to being among the longest-lived application programs of all time, as well as being the two most commonly used text editors on Linux and Unix. Many operating systems, especially Linux and BSD derivatives, bundle multiple text editors with the operating system to cater to user demand. For example, a default installation of macOS contains Emacs, ed, nano, TextEdit, and Vim.\n\nFrequently, at some point in the discussion, someone will point out that ed is the \"standard text editor\".\n\nThe Church of Emacs, formed by Emacs and the GNU Project's creator Richard Stallman, is a parody religion. While it refers to vi as the \"editor of the beast\" (vi-vi-vi being 6-6-6 in Roman numerals), it does not oppose the use of vi; rather, it calls proprietary software anathema. (\"Using a free version of vi is not a sin but a penance.\") The Church of Emacs has its own newsgroup, alt.religion.emacs, that has posts purporting to support this belief system.\n\nStallman has referred to himself as St IGNU−cius, a saint in the Church of Emacs.\n\nSupporters of vi have created an opposing Cult of vi, argued by the more hardline Emacs users to be an attempt to \"ape their betters\".\n\nRegarding vi's modal nature (a point of extreme frustration for new users) some Emacs users joke that vi has two modes – \"beep repeatedly\" and \"break everything\". vi users enjoy joking that Emacs's key-sequences induce carpal tunnel syndrome, or mentioning one of many satirical expansions of the acronym EMACS, such as \"Escape Meta Alt Control Shift\" (a jab at Emacs's reliance on modifier keys). or \"Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping\" (in a time when that was a great amount of memory) or \"EMACS Makes Any Computer Slow\" (a recursive acronym like those Stallman uses) or \"Eventually Munches All Computer Storage\", in reference to Emacs's high system resource requirements. GNU EMACS has been expanded to \"Generally Not Used, Except by Middle-Aged Computer Scientists\" referencing its most ardent fans, and its declining usage among younger programmers compared to more graphically-oriented editors such as TextMate or Sublime Text. The Emacs distribution includes the full list.\n\nAs a poke at Emacs' creeping featurism, vi advocates have been known to describe Emacs as \"a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor\". Emacs advocates have been known to respond that the editor is actually very good, but the operating system could use improvement (referring to Emacs' famous lack of concurrency).\n\nA game among UNIX users, either to test the depth of an Emacs user's understanding of the editor or to poke fun at the complexity of Emacs, involved predicting what would happen if a user held down a modifier key (such as or ) and typed their own name. A similar \"game\" was reportedly played among users of the old TECO editor, in which lay the roots of Emacs.\n\nDue to the unintuitive character sequence to exit vi (\":q!\"), hackers joke that there is a proposed method of creating a pseudorandom character sequence by having a user unfamiliar with vi seated in front of an open editor and asking them to exit the program.\n\n\n"}

It involved a testator who had set aside three of the shares into which he had divided his estate.

In the event of a surplus of interest over and above the amount required for the said purposes, they were to apply the surplus in augmentation of the trust fund.

It was founded on 14 October 1905, and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland. It maintains world records for aeronautical activities including ballooning, aeromodeling, and unmanned aerial vehicles; and also for human spaceflight.\n\nThe FAI was founded at a conference held in Paris 12–14 October 1905, which was organised following a resolution passed by the Olympic Congress held in Brussels on 10 June 1905 calling for the creation of an Association \"to regulate the sport of flying, ... the various aviation meetings and advance the science and sport of Aeronautics.\" The conference was attended by representatives from 8 countries: Belgium (\"Aero Club Royal de Belgique\", founded 1901), France (\"Aéro-Club de France\", 1898), Germany ( e.V.\"), Great Britain (Royal Aero Club, 1901), Italy (\"\", 1904), Spain (\"\", 1905), Switzerland (\"Aero-Club der Schweiz\", 1900) and the United States (Aero Club of America, 1905).\n\nOn 2 February 2017 the FAI announced its new strategic partnership with international asset management firm Noosphere Ventures. FAI Secretary General Susanne Schödel, FAI President Frits Brink and Noosphere Ventures Managing Partner Max Polyakov signed the agreement, making Noosphere Ventures FAI’s Global Technical Partner.\n\nThe FAI is the international governing body for the following activities: \n\nThe FAI establishes the standards for records in the activities. Where these are air sports, the FAI also oversees international competitions at world and continental levels, and also organizes the World Air Games and FAI World Grand Prix.\n\nThe FAI keeps records set in human spaceflight, through the FAI Astronautic Records Commission (\"International Astronautic Records Commission – ICARE)\n\nThe FAI also organises the FAI International Drones Conference and Expo in Lausanne, Switzerland, which offers a platform for organisations, businesses and individuals to discuss how drones are used today and to create a framework for how they will be used and impact on our lives in the future.\n\nAmong the FAI's responsibilities are the verification of record-breaking flights. For a flight to be registered as a \"World Record,\" it has to comply with the FAI's strict rules, which include a proviso that the record must exceed the previous record by a certain percentage. Since the late 1930s, military aircraft have dominated some classes of record for powered aircraft such as speed, distance, payload, and height, though other classes are regularly claimed by civilians.\n\nSome records are claimed by countries as their own, even though their achievements fail to meet FAI standards. These claims are not typically granted the status of official records. For example, Yuri Gagarin earned recognition for the first manned spaceflight, despite failing to meet FAI requirements. The FAI initially did not recognize the achievement because he did not land in his Vostok spacecraft (he ejected from it), but later it recognized that Gagarin was the first human to fly into space. The FAI then established \"The Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal\", which has been awarded since 1968.\n\nThe following types of craft have records:\n\nThe FAI Gold Air Medal was established in 1924 and was first awarded in 1925. It is reserved for those who have contributed greatly to the development of aeronautics by their activities, work, achievements, initiative or devotion to the cause of Aviation. The FAI has also awarded the Paul Tissandier Diploma since 1952 to those who have served the cause of aviation in general and sporting aviation in particular.\n\nThe FAI also makes awards for each of the following air sports.\n\n\nThe FAI Young Artists Contest is an international painting competition for youngsters between the ages of 6 and 17.

{"id": "22243256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22243256", "title": "Hemming's Cartulary", "text": "Hemming's Cartulary\n\nHemming's Cartulary is a manuscript cartulary, or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming around the time of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; it is in the British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the \"Liber Wigorniensis\", is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, \"Hemming's Cartulary\" proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.\n\nThe two works are bound together in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester at the hands of royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror, and nobles such as Eadric Streona and Urse d'Abetot. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.\n\nAlthough the monk Hemming has traditionally been credited with all the works in the manuscript, the cartulary contains two works that were collected together, only one of which is by Hemming. The two works were bound together to form the manuscript (abbreviated MS) Cotton Tiberius A xiii, now held in the Cotton Library, a collection in the British Library. Together, the two works form the first surviving cartulary from medieval England. The first part is the so-called \"Liber Wigorniensis\", or \"Book of Worcester\", which takes up folios 1–118 of the manuscript. The second is Hemming's work, and takes up folios 119–142, 144–152 and 154–200. MS Cotton Nero E i and British Library MS Add 46204 may also contain charters collected as part of Hemming's work, as they have been identified by some scholars as having been produced during Hemming's lifetime, although others identify them as a copy of the \"Liber Wigorniensis\".\n\nThe original manuscript containing the cartulary was damaged in a fire in 1733, but the damage was not serious. The edges of the manuscript were burned, which resulted in a few words being lost on the margins. Because of the fire damage, the manuscript was rebound in the 19th century, and each leaf was mounted separately. In addition to the two main sections, there are three smaller parchment pages bound in with the manuscript: folios 110, 143, and 153. The first of them, folio 110, measures high by wide and lists eight names, probably witnesses to a lease. The second inserted folio, 143, measures high by wide and gives a list of jurors in a late 11th-century hand. The last inserted folio, 153, measures high by wide and gives the boundaries of a manor in Old English, rather than Latin; it is written in a 12th-century hand.\n\nThe first part of the work is an early 11th-century collection of older charters, arranged geographically, with a section on late 10th-century land leases tacked on the end. The historian gave this section of the work the title \"Liber Wigorniensis\" in 1961 to distinguish it from the later section actually assembled by Hemming. Dates for the compilation of the work include the suggestion by historian Neil Ker that it dates from between 1002 and 1016, when Wulfstan (the earlier Wulfstan – later a saint – who is not the Wulfstan who encouraged Hemming to compile the cartulary) held both the archbishopric of York and the bishopric of Worcester. Another historian, V. H. Galbraith, suggests that instead of being compiled in Wulfstan's episcopate, it was created during the episcopate of Ealdwulf, Wulfstan's predecessor in both sees. A third historian, David Dumville, argues that because no leases later than 996 are mentioned, it must date to a time-frame between 996 and 1016. There are 155 charters in the \"Liber\", of which 10 are later insertions; the date of their incorporation ranges from the early to the late 11th century. Ker, who studied the original manuscript, has identified five main scribes involved in the manuscript in the first section. The scribal hands used are small and not very rounded, and resemble the type of writing prevalent in England during the early part of the 11th century. This section consists of 117 leaves in the original manuscript, each page with 26 lines of text. The written area is approximately tall by wide. A few blank areas in the original manuscript copy have been filled with information in the later 11th and 12th centuries, mainly related to properties owned by the cathedral.\n\nHemming was the author of the second and later part, a collection of lands and rights belonging to the cathedral chapter of Worcester, as well as a narrative of the deeds of Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester who died in 1095, and Archbishop Ealdred of York. In this part of the work is a preface known as the \"Enucleatio libelli\", where Hemming names himself as the person responsible for compiling the work, and names Wulfstan as the inspiration for his work. Another section, known as the \"Prefatio istius libelli\", now much later in the manuscript but possibly meant as an introduction to the \"Codicellus\", is a shorter introduction that gives the purpose of the collection. Historians usually take the two prefaces to mean that Wulfstan commissioned the work, but it is unclear whether it was created before or after Wulfstan's death. It may have been produced during the vacancy after Wulfstan's death, and before the appointment of the next bishop, Samson. Historian Nicholas Brooks, along with Vivian Galbraith, argues that Hemming's work was a response to the problems encountered by the diocese during the vacancy, when royal officials administered the lands of the bishopric. According to Brooks, the claim that Wulfstan ordered the composition of the cartulary was inaccurate, and was made to appeal to the authority of the bishop. The historian Julia Barrow believes that the inspiration for the work was the creation of the \"Domesday Book\" in 1086, although she agrees that the work was completed after Wulfstan's death. Hemming's work contains over 50 charters, some of which are duplicates of ones in the \"Liber\".\n\nThe second section of the work is not just a collection of deeds and charters but includes other historical information of importance, especially for Hemming's monastery. The documents are connected by a narrative explaining why and how the cartulary was created; the narrative is usually given the title of \"Codicellus possessionum\". This section of the work also includes the \"Life\" of the later Wulfstan, one of two contemporary records of Wulfstan's life. The organization is broadly geographical, with some information grouped by topic. In two sections, which are sometimes entitled \"Indiculum Libertatis\" and \"Oswald's Indiculum\", the work not only draws on charters but also incorporates regional information from a different type of source recording the holdings of tenants-in-chief. This has been identified as the documentation assembled at the shire-courts for the so-called Domesday survey, commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085. More famously, the same records were later used for the compilation of Domesday Book. Some of the documents are in Latin, others are in Old English. Ker has identified the second part of the manuscript as being created by three scribes, describing their writing as \"round and fairly large\", in a style belonging to a period of transition between the late 11th and early 12th century. There are 80 leaves in the original manuscript. Most pages in this section of the manuscript have 28 lines of writing, and the written area is approximately high by wide. A few blank areas in the original manuscript were filled with information ranging from contemporary notes on landholdings of the cathedral to notes on the dissolution of Worcester Priory in the 16th century.\n\nBoth the \"Liber Wigorniensis\" and Hemming's work contain a number of forged charters. The historian Julia Barrow has determined that at least 25 of the 155 charters in the \"Liber\" are forged, but cautions that this is the minimum estimate. Barrow identifies more than 30 of the charters in Hemming's work as forgeries, including some that are duplicates from the \"Liber\". Some of the stories that form Hemming's narrative do not always agree with other sources, and Ker says \"it is safer to trust to the main facts than to the details of his [Hemming's] stories\".\n\nThe main goal of the \"Liber\" was to document the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to the property of the church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the \"Liber\" should be seen as a working document, compiled for the use of the bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The \"Liber\" was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.\n\nThe charters constitute valuable evidence for prosopographical research and the study of land tenure in late Anglo-Saxon England. According to Donald A. Bullough, they also offer a window on the kind of social bonds which could be created by \"neighbourhood\". In the 10th century, the Bishop of Worcester leased out various small estates attached to the Church in the three counties (Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Warwickshire) to several high-ranking men and women, usually for three lifespans. The pattern may be taken to suggest that this way of association served to \"create a network, an inter-meshing, of high-status 'neighbours' ... with its central knot in Worcester and the \"domus\" of the bishop\". In the bishop's residence or at home, the lessees may have come together to participate in convivial drinking, just as the Norman successors to these lands are envisaged as doing in William of Malmesbury's \"Life\" of St Wulfstan. Further, some of the thegns served in the royal army (\"fyrd\") under the command of Bishop Oswald or his successors, which presupposes the creation of a personal warband and possibly one with the secondary purpose of protecting the bishop's properties.\n\nHemming's introduction to his work (\"Prefatio\") claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, by the violence of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.\n\nThe historian Richard Southern argues that, notwithstanding the stated aim of the work, it was not produced to be used in lawsuits, but rather as a kind of utopian picture of what was in the past. The goal was to depict those things that were beyond human recovery but that were \"laid up in heaven\". Because of its narrative structure, it should be seen not only as a documentation of the various landholdings of the diocese, but as a historical work as well. Unlike the \"Liber\", it was not revised as the property changed hands, and this lack of revision has been seen as emphasizing the commemorative nature of the work. The historian John Reuben Davies sees a close parallel between Hemming's work and the Welsh medieval document \"The Book of Llandaf\". Other similar works were the Norman \"pancartes\", which were compilations of gifts to a monastery, connected by a narrative which was then presented to the dukes to secure confirmation of the gifts. These Norman works date from the early 11th century, and like Hemming's work, they are of great interest to the historian as sources for the study of medieval history. Also noting that Hemming's part of the compilation does not appear to have been revised or updated to meet new circumstances, Patrick Geary describes it as \"a commemorative, historical volume, not a working administrative tool\" and associates the work with counterparts produced in the continental West, such as Folcuin's chronicle cartulary \"Gesta abbatum S. Bertini Sithiensium\".\n\nMore recently, Francesca Tinti has arrived at a different conclusion, arguing instead that Hemming's work, more so than the \"Liber Wigorniensis\", came to serve very real needs, and that these specifically concerned the monastic community at Worcester. Although the \"Prefatio\" is silent about monks, the \"Enucleatio\" is explicit that Bishop Wulfstan had commissioned the work to defend the estates assigned for the sustenance of the monks (\"ad victum monachorum\"). She relates these concerns to the rapid growth of the community during Bishop Wulfstan's episcopate in the second half of the 11th century. The coming of the Norman newcomer, Samson, who had been involved in the dissolution of Westbury-on-Trym, would have given the enlarged community a particular incentive to safeguard its property and rights.\n\nOne of the themes of Hemming's work is the depredations suffered by his monastery at the hands of royal officials. One such notorious official from the last decade of King Æthelred's reign is Eadric \"Streona\" (\"Grasper\"), ealdorman of Mercia, blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the ancient county of Winchcombeshire into Gloucestershire. Hemming may have invented Eadric's byname of \"Streona\", as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.\n\nHemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror as being especially damaging. He claims that the work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in \"Domesday Book\" as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of amounts paid to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and other members of his family.\n\nThe historian Ted Johnson Smith points out that the \"Codicellus\" has strong parallels to the \"Historia de Sancto Cuthberto\". The \"Historia\" was written in Durham in the mid-10th century, and is a history of the monastery of St. Cuthbert from foundation until about 945. Like the \"Codicellus\", it is a narrative concerned mainly to defend the patrimony of the monks against depredations.\n\nAlso contained in Hemming's work is a description of the lawsuit between the diocese of Worcester and Evesham Abbey, which took place between 1078 and 1085. Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings, the \"Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham\", or \"Evesham Chronicle\", also gives background information on the dispute. The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire, but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric's manors. Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig, when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese. After Æthelwig's death, most of these lands passed to Odo of Bayeux, but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth, which became the basis of the dispute. The lawsuit was complicated because part of the land had been granted by an earlier bishop, Beorhtheah, to a kinsman, Azur. After the Conquest, Azur's lands were given to Urse d'Abetot, the Sheriff of Worcester. Following Æthelwig's death, Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig's successor Walter. The settlement, which was concluded in 1086, granted the lands to the abbey, but the diocese was the overlord of the lands, for which the abbey owed military service.\n\nA brief overview of the contents of the manuscript follows, with the main sectioning and a general idea of the contents of each section.\n\nThe only other 11th-century cartulary surviving from England is the Oswald cartulary, also compiled at Worcester. Historian M. T. Clanchy has suggested that the form English cartularies took may have originated at Worcester, although fellow historian Robin Fleming has argued that Christ Church Canterbury's surviving cartulary is also an 11th-century compilation. Who owned the manuscript after it left Worcester Cathedral Priory, presumably with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1540s, is unknown, but the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton by 1612, when it is recorded as being loaned by Cotton to Arthur Agarde. There are annotations in the manuscript by John Joscelyn, who was secretary to Matthew Parker (d. 1575), the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, but whether Parker owned the manuscript is uncertain. The manuscript thus became part of the Cotton library, which passed into public ownership in 1702 on the death of Cotton's grandson on the basis of an act of Parliament of 1701. The manuscript itself is now part of the British Library's holdings.\n\nThe manuscript was originally published in 1723 as \"Hemingi chartularium ecclesiæ Wigorniensis\", in two volumes edited by Thomas Hearne. This was part of the \"Chronica Anglia\" series put out between 1709 and 1735, which included many chronicles and records in 20 volumes. Hearne printed his edition from a transcription made for the antiquary Richard Graves. This transcript, known as MS Rawlinson B.445, is not a completely accurate transcription of the Cotton Tiberius manuscript, as some items were omitted, and marginalia were not always transcribed. There were also some additions of decorations.\n\nThe entire manuscript of Cotton Tiberius A xiii is catalogued as number 366 in Helmut Gneuss's work \"Handlist of Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts\". A new critical edition by David Dumville is forthcoming as of 2010.\n\n\n"}

It was a group of Washington, D.C.-based scientists who were attracted to that city by the Smithsonian Institution's rapidly growing collection, from 1857 to 1866.\n\nMany of the members had no formal education, but came by their expertise through extensive direct observation. They spent their weekdays in the rigorous and exacting work of describing and classifying species. But their nights were spent in revelry. They particularly enjoyed partaking in ale, oysters, eggnog, and whatever other fineries their meager budgets could afford. On Sundays, however, they recuperated from the week's stresses and excesses with long nature hikes.\n\nThe club was named for the \"Megatherium\", an extinct genus of giant ground sloth.\n\nThe leading spirit of the club was marine biologist William Stimpson, who hosted its earliest meetings in his home. Members dubbed the place \"The Stimpsonian.\" By 1863, though, Stimpson and others had taken up residence in the castle of the actual Smithsonian. \n\nClub members were encouraged by Spencer Fullerton Baird, the institution's assistant secretary. And they attracted a variety of learned speakers to their meetings, including Louis Agassiz, John Torrey, and John Cassin. But they were eventually thrown out of their castle suites by the institution's secretary, Joseph Henry, who disapproved of the way members held sack races in the Great Hall and periodically serenaded his daughters. \n\nMembership was transitory as individuals undertook independent studies abroad, sometimes for years at a time. Formal meetings ceased about the year 1866 when Stimpson moved to Chicago to oversee that city's Academy of Sciences.\n\nSeveral other \"Megatherium Clubs\" exist; one formed of overseas Smithsonian researchers, yet another only in fiction, supposedly located in London, United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "475098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=475098", "title": "Qieyun", "text": "Qieyun\n\nThe Qieyun () is a Chinese rime dictionary, published in 601 CE during the Sui dynasty. The book was a guide to proper reading of classical texts, using the \"fanqie\" method to indicate the pronunciation of Chinese characters.\nThe \"Qieyun\" and later redactions, notably the \"Guangyun\", are important documentary sources used in the reconstruction of historical Chinese phonology.\n\nThe book was created by Lu Fayan (Lu Fa-yen; 陸法言) in 601. The preface of the \"Qieyun\" describes how the plan of the book originated from a discussion with eight of his friends 20 years earlier at his home in Chang'an, the capital of Sui China.\nNone of these scholars was originally from Chang'an; they were native speakers of differing dialects – five northern and three southern. According to Lu, Yan Zhitui (顏之推) and Xiao Gai (蕭該), both men originally from the south, were the most influential in setting up the norms on which the \"Qieyun\" was based.\nHowever, the dictionary was compiled by Lu alone, consulting several earlier dictionaries, none of which have survived.\n\nWhen classical Chinese poetry flowered during the Tang dynasty, the \"Qieyun\" became the authoritative source for literary pronunciations and it repeatedly underwent revisions and enlargements. It was annotated in 677 by Zhǎngsūn Nèyán (長孫訥言), revised and published in 706 by Wáng Renxu (王仁煦) as the \"Kanmiu Buque Qieyun\" (刊謬補缺切韻; \"Corrected and supplemented \"Qieyun\"\"), collated and republished in 751 by Sun Mian (孫愐) as the \"Tángyùn\" (唐韻; \"Tang rimes\"), and eventually incorporated into the still-extant \"Guangyun\" and \"Jiyun\" rime dictionaries from the Song dynasty. Although most of these Tang dictionary redactions were believed lost, some fragments were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts and manuscripts discovered at Turpan.\n\nThe Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho used a version of the \"Qieyun\".\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, several copyists were engaged in producing manuscripts to meet the great demand for revisions of the work.\nParticularly prized were copies of Wáng Rénxū's edition made in the early 9th century by Wú Cǎiluán (呉彩鸞), a woman famed for her calligraphy.\nOne of these copies was acquired by Emperor Huizong (1100–1126), himself a keen calligrapher. It remained in the palace library until 1926, when part of the library followed the deposed emperor Puyi to Tianjin and then to Changchun, capital of the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, it passed to a book dealer in Changchun, and in 1947 two scholars discovered it in a book market in Liulichang, Beijing.\n\nStudies of this almost complete copy have been published by the Chinese linguists Dong Tonghe (1948 and 1952) and Li Rong (1956).\n\nThe \"Qieyun\" contains 12,158 character entries.\nThese were divided into five volumes, two for the many words of the \"level\" tone, and one volume for each of the other four tones.\nThe entries were divided into 193 final rhyme groups (each named by its first character, called the \"yùnmù\" 韻目, or \"rhyme eye\").\nEach rhyme group was subdivided into homophone groups (\"xiǎoyùn\" 小韻 \"small rhyme\").\nThe first entry in each homophone group gives the pronunciation as a \"fanqie\" formula.\n\nFor example, the first entry in the \"Qieyun\", shown at right, describes the character 東 \"dōng\" \"east\". The three characters on the right are a \"fanqie\" pronunciation key, marked by the character 反 \"fǎn\" \"turn back\". This indicates that the word is pronounced with the initial of 德 [tək] and the final of 紅 [ɣuŋ], i.e. [tuŋ]. The word is glossed as 木方 \"mù fāng\", i.e. the direction of wood (one of the Five Elements), while the numeral 二 \"two\" indicates that this is the first of two entries in a homophone group.\n\nLater rime dictionaries had many more entries, with full definitions and a few additional rhyme groups, but kept the same structure.\n\nThe \"Qieyun\" did not directly record Middle Chinese as a spoken language, but rather how characters \"should\" be pronounced when reading the classics. Since this rime dictionary's spellings are the primary source for reconstructing Middle Chinese, linguists have disagreed over what variety of Chinese it recorded. \"Much ink has been spilled concerning the nature of the language underlying the \"Qieyun\",\" says Norman (1988: 24), who lists three points of view. Some scholars, like Bernhard Karlgren, \"held to the view that the \"Qieyun\" represented the language of Chang'an\"; some \"others have supposed that it represented an amalgam of regional pronunciations,\" technically known as a diasystem. \"At the present time most people in the field accept the views of the Chinese scholar Zhou Zumo\" (周祖謨; 1914–1995) that \"Qieyun\" spellings were a north-south regional compromise between literary pronunciations from the Northern and Southern dynasties.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12598514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12598514", "title": "Spotback skate", "text": "Spotback skate\n\nThe spotback skate (\"Atlantoraja castelnaui\") is a species of fish in the Rajidae family. It is found off the Atlantic coasts of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay where its natural habitat is over the continental shelf in the open sea. It is a large fish, growing to over a metre in length. It feeds mainly on other fish according to availability, with shrimps, octopuses and other invertebrates also being eaten. Reproduction takes place throughout most of the year, with the eggs being laid in capsules that adhere to the seabed. The spotback skate is the subject of a fishery and is thought to be overfished, resulting in Greenpeace adding the fish to its red list of fish to be avoided, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature listing it as an \"endangered species\".\n\nThe \"Atlantoraja castelnaui\" are found in the Southwest South Atlantic Ocean from Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil to Argentina. They prefer warm-temperate waters at depths ranging from 20 to 220 m. In Argentina, they can be found as natives to the Argentinian Zoogeographic Province. They seek warm water climates, and are often reported to have a more southern distribution than normal in correlation with higher water temperatures. Spotback skates may migrate only slightly or perform slight periodic backwards and forwards movement depending on ocean water temperatures. However, there is no notable seasonal variation for the species as they populate southern waters year round.\n\nAlthough the location of their distribution has not been affected, the quantity of the spotback's distribution has lowered in many places and continues to be threatened by humans fishing in its habitats.\n\nThe length of maturity for males and females differ with males ranging from 185 to 1250 mm in total length and females ranging from 243 to 1368 mm in total length. Males have a continuous production of mature spermatozoa suggests they can reproduce throughout the year but studies have shown higher values in certain months but they are not significant. Females also reproduce year-round with peaks of reproductive activity as well.\n\nFemale spotback skates lay their eggs on the ocean floor and leave them there. There is not parental care so the eggs have a capsule that protects the embryo's development once the mother leaves. Collected egg capsules typically are rectangular and have horny process in each corner. They are also shiny and are medium brown in color. The capsules on the eggs are covered by adhesion fibrils that allow the egg to attach itself to the sea floor immediately after the mother releases them. These adhesion fibrils are also seen in other species of skates. The surface of the capsule is striated and presents a rough surface though it is relatively smooth. \"Atlantoraja castelnaui\" capsule's are also the largest egg capsule in its genus and compared to other co-occurring species in the same area and depth of the ocean.\n\nIn the cities of Santos and Guarujá, specimens of the spotback skate which are deemed large enough to have commercial value are commonly landed and marketed. From 1999 to present, the market for the meat of the spotback skate has expanded to Asia, particularly South Korea. As a result, commercial fishing has led to an overexploitation of the species and its consequent listing as an endangered species.\n\nSpotback skates are particularly vulnerable to extinction due to their large body size relative to other skate species. According to Dulvy & Reynolds (2002), skate species considered to be locally extinct have larger body sizes compared to all other skates. Large body size is in turn correlated with higher mortality rates and with life-history parameters such as late age at maturity. Another study by García et al. (2007) also corroborated the notion that a large body size increased the extinction risk in elasmobranchs. Spotback skates are also especially vulnerable to trawl fisheries because they inhabit the soft bottom substrates of the ocean (Ebert; Sulikowski, 2007). Consequently, the biomass of spotback skates has decreased by 75% from 1994 to 1999.\n\nThe spotback skate is found across most of the continental shelf year round. The spotback skate's diet is a versatile and mainly piscivorous consumer. Their diet shifts with increasing body size and as a response to seasonal and regional changes in prey abundance and distribution. They prey mostly on teleost, cephalopods, elasmobranchs, and decapods. Smaller spotback skate tend to consume decapods and the larger skates ate elasmobranchs and cephalopods. The consumption of teleosts differed between seasons depending on whether the teleost were demersal- benthic or benthic. The more demersal- benthic teleosts were consumed during the cold season while the benthic teleosts were eaten during the warm season. The decapods, cephalopods and elasmobranchs were predominantly shrimps, octopuses, and skates. The main cephalopod consumed in the warm season was the octopus.\n\nLike all fish species, spotback skates have a variety of parasites; these include copepods , nematodes and Myxozoans.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International has added the spotback skate to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n"}
{"id": "738307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738307", "title": "Stephanus pagination", "text": "Stephanus pagination\n\nStephanus pagination is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of Plato (and less famously, Plutarch) based on the three volume 1578 edition of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus (Jean de Serres) and published by Henricus Stephanus (Henri Estienne) in Geneva.\n\nIn the case of Plato's works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition's three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e. This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato. For Plato's works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work's name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage. For example, \"\"Symposium\" 172a\" cites \"Symposium\", Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which \"Symposium\" occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a. To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, \"page 50\" might refer to any of the \"pages 50\" across Stephanus' three volumes. Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato's works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.\n\nMore specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. \"Symposium\" 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in John Burnet's Oxford Classical Text, not to Estienne's line divisions.\n\nThere are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato's \"Republic\" and \"Laws\". The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each 'book' of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato's dialogues. \n\nThe spurious dialogue \"Halcyon\" was included in the corpus of Lucian's works and does not have Stephanus numbers.\n\nBekker numbering is the comparable system for the works of Aristotle, and Diels–Kranz numbering is the comparable system for Pre-Socratic philosophy. Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle's works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition. Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each publication, released in English, French, German and Polish between 1940 and 1941, consisted of official documents and affidavits, supplemented with an overview by the Ministry. Notably the \"Polish White Book\" was released parallel with \"The Black Book of Poland\" series by G.P. Putnam's Sons of New York, published in London by Hutchinson & Co under a differing title in 1942.\n\nThe first volume of the \"White Book\" publication series, released in spring 1940, was titled \"Official Documents Concerning Polish-German and Polish-Soviet Relations 1933–1939 – Polish White Book.\" The book described and documented the Polish-German negotiations in the lead-up to World War II. The second volume of the \"White Book\" – sometimes considered to be the first volume of \"The Black Book of Poland\" – was titled \"German Invasion of Poland\" (\"L'Invasion Allemande en Pologne\", Paris: Flammarion, 1940). \n\nThe third volume of \"The Polish White Book\" was titled the \"German Occupation of Poland. Extract of Note Addressed to The Allied and Neutral Powers.\" It is a 240-page report published in 1941 during World War II by the Ministry of Information of the Polish government-in-exile, describing atrocities committed by Germany in occupied Poland. It contains 180 appendixes with lists, names, dates and the circumstances of Nazi brutality toward Polish civilians including men, women and children. Most of the book consists of appendixes, documenting the locations of Nazi ghettos where thousands of Jews perished; and the shift in extermination tactics from shootings to poisoning by gas. The affidavits confirm Heinrich Himmler’s personal involvement in the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the final transports to death camps. The \"Polish White Book\" was written as a plea for help to the world community. At the time of its compilation, there were two million Polish Jews still alive in occupied Poland and hoping for an international rescue effort.\n\nAs the reports of Nazi war crimes in occupied Poland increased dramatically, new volumes of \"The Polish White Book\" series were released. The \"German Occupation of Poland\" (1941) – also known as the second volume of \"The German Invasion of Poland\" (1940) – is sometimes considered a preamble to \"The Black Book of Poland\" (1942) by the Polish government-in-exile. The \"White Books\" by the Polish Ministry were released over the course of two years. The original \"Polish White Book\", along with its subsequent volumes were published in both Paris by \"Flammarion\" and in London by Hutchinson & Co.\n\nThe final \"White Book\" titled \"German Occupation of Poland. Extract of Note Addressed to the Allied and Neutral Powers\" was released by Greystone Press of New York in 1941. The book contained 55-page overview, signed by Auguste Zaleski in London on May 3, 1941, and 180 Appendixes with evidence of forced expulsions and deportations of Jews to overcrowded ghettos where starvation and disease were commonplace, along with evidence of deliberate destruction of the Polish nationhood; for the total of 243 printed pages.\n\nThe \"White Book\" was followed by \"The Black Book of Poland\" printed by G.P. Putnam's Sons of New York in 1942. It was a collection of authenticated documents, depositions, eye-witness accounts, and Ministerial summaries, describing and illustrating with photographs, the Nazi crimes against the Polish nation and War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II committed in mere two years: including massacres, tortures, expulsions, forced colonization, persecution, destruction of culture, and humiliation of a nation. \n\n\n\n"}

The panel participants were former \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Dan Rather, historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, then–Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice, publisher Irving Kristol, and \"Time\" managing editor Walter Isaacson.\n\nIn a separate issue on December 31, 1999, \"Time\" recognized Albert Einstein as the Person of the Century.\n\n\"Time\"s article cites twenty persons in each of five broad categories: Leaders and Revolutionaries, Scientists and Thinkers, Builders and Titans, Artists and Entertainers, and Heroes and Icons.\n\nOf the 100 chosen, Albert Einstein was chosen as the Person of the Century, on the grounds that he was the preeminent scientist in a century dominated by science. The editors of \"Time\" believed the 20th century \"will be remembered foremost for its science and technology\", and Einstein \"serves as a symbol of all the scientists—such as Fermi, Heisenberg, Bohr, Richard Feynman, ...who built upon his work\".\n\nThe cover of the magazine featured the famous image of Einstein taken in 1947 by American portrait photographer Philippe Halsman.\n\nRunners-up:\n\nIt was debated whether Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, responsible for World War II, The Holocaust, and the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, should have been made Persons of the Century for their influence in politics.\nThe argument was based on \"Time\"'s explicit criterion that the persons chosen should have the greatest impact on this century, for better or worse. In the same 31 December 1999 issue of \"Time\", essayist Nancy Gibbs addressed the topic with the article \"The Necessary Evil?\" In the article, she argues that Hitler and Mussolini \"were simply the latest in a long line of murderous figures, stretching back to before Genghis Khan. The only difference was technology: Both Hitler and Mussolini went about their cynical carnage with all the efficiency that modern industry had perfected\" and present several rhetorical questions such as \"Evil may be a powerful force, a seductive idea, but is it more powerful than genius, creativity, courage or generosity?\"\n\nThe list of the top 20 Artists and Entertainers, in particular, was criticized for not including Elvis Presley, a decision Handy initially defended in the following way:\n\nOne of the most important, innovative things about rock is the whole notion of songwriters singing their own works, of the immediacy of expression. Since Elvis didn't write his own material, unlike The Beatles or Bob Dylan or Robert Johnson, who's also someone who could have been included, maybe that cut against him… I think the Beatles pushed the envelope a lot further. Elvis' most original recordings were his first. The Beatles started out as imitators, then continued to grow throughout their years together.\n\nHandy was also asked to defend \"Time\"s decision to include the fictional character Bart Simpson from \"The Simpsons\" television series among the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, and he did so as follows:\n\nI don't see how you can look at this century and not include cartoons. They're one of our great contributions, along with jazz and film. (I know, I know. The movies were a 19th-century invention. But we 20th century folks really put them to good use.)… To some extent, too, we wanted people who also represented important 20th century trends or developments. That would help account for the Barts and Oprahs... What Bart, or really the Simpsons, have done is merge social satire with popular animation in a way that hasn't really been done before.\nThe list also received criticism for its inclusion of Lucky Luciano, who was chosen in part because \"he modernized the Mafia, shaping it into a smoothly run national crime syndicate focused on the bottom line\". New York mayor Rudy Giuliani accused \"Time\" of \"romanticizing\" gangsters, and he stated: \"The idea that he civilized the Mafia is absurd. He murdered in order to get the position that he had, and then he authorized hundreds and hundreds of murders.\" The selection was called an \"outrage\" by Philip Cannistraro, a Queens College professor of Italian-American studies, and Thomas Vitale, the New York State vice president of Fieri, an Italian-American charitable organization, criticized \"Time\" for \"perpetuating myths\" about Italian-Americans. However, \"Time\" business editor Bill Saporito defended the selection by describing Luciano as \"kind of an evil genius\" who had a deep impact on the underground economy. \"We're not out there to heap glory on these people\", he explained. \"We're out to say these are people who influenced our lives.\" Saporito further noted that \"every piece of merchandise that came out of the Garment District had a little extra cost in it because of organized crime.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "418880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=418880", "title": "Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum", "text": "Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum\n\nThe Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum () is a museum in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, chronicling the Cambodian genocide. The site is a former secondary school which was used as Security Prison 21 (S-21) by the Khmer Rouge regime from its rise to power in 1975 to its fall in 1979. From 1976 to 1979, an estimated 20,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng (the real number is unknown). Tuol Sleng ( ) means \"Hill of the Poisonous Trees\" or \"Strychnine Hill\". Tuol Sleng was just one of at least 150 torture and execution centers established by the Khmer Rouge, though other sources put the figure at 196 prison centers. On July 26, 2010, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia convicted the chief of Tuol Sleng Prison, Kaing kek Iew, (alias Duch) for crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and sentenced him to life imprisonment.\n\nFormerly the Chao Ponhea Yat High School, named after a royal ancestor of King Norodom Sihanouk, the five buildings of the complex were converted in March/April 1976 into a prison and interrogation center. Before other buildings in town were used already as prison S-21. The Khmer Rouge renamed the complex \"Security Prison 21\" (S-21) and construction began to adapt the prison to the inmates: the buildings were enclosed in electrified barbed wire, the classrooms converted into tiny prison and torture chambers, and all windows were covered with iron bars and barbed wire to prevent escapes and suicides.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, an estimated 20,000 people were imprisoned at Tuol Sleng (the real number is unknown). At any one time, the prison held between 1,000–1,500 prisoners. They were repeatedly tortured and coerced into naming family members and close associates, who were in turn arrested, tortured and killed. In the early months of S-21's existence, most of the victims were from the previous Lon Nol regime and included soldiers, government officials, as well as academics, doctors, teachers, students, factory workers, monks, engineers, etc. Later, the party leadership's paranoia turned on its own ranks and purges throughout the country saw thousands of party activists and their families brought to Tuol Sleng and murdered. Those arrested included some of the highest ranking communist politicians such as Khoy Thoun, Vorn Vet and Hu Nim. Although the official reason for their arrest was \"espionage\", these men may have been viewed by Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot as potential leaders of a coup against him. Prisoners' families were sometimes brought \"en masse\" to be interrogated and later executed at the Choeung Ek extermination center.\n\nIn 1979, the prison was uncovered by the invading Vietnamese army. In 1979/80, the prison was reopened by the government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea as a historical museum memorializing the actions of the Khmer Rouge regime.\n\nUpon arrival at the prison, prisoners were photographed and required to give detailed autobiographies, beginning with their childhood and ending with their arrest. After that, they were forced to strip to their underwear, and their possessions were confiscated. The prisoners were then taken to their cells. Those taken to the smaller cells were shackled to the walls or the concrete floor. Those who were held in the large mass cells were collectively shackled to long pieces of iron bar. The shackles were fixed to alternating bars; the prisoners slept with their heads in opposite directions. They slept on the floor without mats, mosquito nets, or blankets. They were forbidden to talk to each other.\n\nThe day in the prison began at 4:30 a.m. when prisoners were ordered to strip for inspection. The guards checked to see if the shackles were loose or if the prisoners had hidden objects they could use to commit suicide. Over the years, several prisoners managed to kill themselves, so the guards were very careful in checking the shackles and cells. The prisoners received four small spoonfuls of rice porridge and watery soup of leaves twice a day. Drinking water without asking the guards for permission resulted in serious beatings. The inmates were hosed down every four days.\n\nThe prison had very strict regulations, and severe beatings were inflicted upon any prisoner who tried to disobey. Almost every action had to be approved by one of the prison's guards. They were sometimes forced to eat human feces and drink human urine. The unhygienic living conditions in the prison caused skin diseases, lice, rashes, ringworm and other ailments. The prison's medical staff were untrained and offered treatment only to sustain prisoners' lives after they had been injured during interrogation. When prisoners were taken from one place to another for interrogation, they were blindfolded. Guards and prisoners were not allowed to converse. Moreover, within the prison, people who were in different groups were not allowed to have contact with one another.\n\nMost prisoners at S-21 were held there for two to three months. However, several high-ranking Khmer Rouge cadres were held longer. Within two or three days after they were brought to S-21, all prisoners were taken for interrogation. The torture system at Tuol Sleng was designed to make prisoners confess to whatever crimes they were charged with by their captors. Prisoners were routinely beaten and tortured with electric shocks, searing hot metal instruments and hanging, as well as through the use of various other devices. Some prisoners were cut with knives or suffocated with plastic bags. Other methods for generating confessions included pulling out fingernails while pouring alcohol on the wounds, holding prisoners' heads under water, and the use of the waterboarding technique (see picture). Women were sometimes raped by the interrogators, even though sexual abuse was against Democratic Kampuchea (DK) policy. The perpetrators who were found out were executed. Although many prisoners died from this kind of abuse, killing them outright was discouraged, since the Khmer Rouge needed their confessions. The \"Medical Unit\" at Tuol Sleng, however, did kill at least 100 prisoners by bleeding them to death. It is proved that medical experiments were performed on certain prisoners. There is clear evidence that patients in Cambodia were sliced open and had organs removed with no anesthetic. In addition, there is also some evidence that inmates were drained of blood in order to study how long they would survive.\n\nIn their confessions, the prisoners were asked to describe their personal background. If they were party members, they had to say when they joined the revolution and describe their work assignments in DK. Then the prisoners would relate their supposed treasonous activities in chronological order. The third section of the confession text described prisoners' thwarted conspiracies and supposed treasonous conversations. At the end, the confessions would list a string of traitors who were the prisoners' friends, colleagues, or acquaintances. Some lists contained over a hundred names. People whose names were in the confession list were often called in for interrogation.\n\nTypical confessions ran into thousands of words in which the prisoner would interweave true events in their lives with imaginary accounts of their espionage activities for the CIA, the KGB, or Vietnam. Physical torture was combined with sleep deprivation and deliberate neglect of the prisoners. The torture implements are on display in the museum. It is believed that the vast majority of prisoners were innocent of the charges against them and that the torture produced false confessions. Not all prisoners were tortured.\n\nFor the first year of S-21's existence, corpses were buried near the prison. However, by the end of 1976, cadres ran out of burial spaces, the prisoner and family members were taken to the Boeung Choeung Ek (\"Crow's Feet Pond\") extermination centre, fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh. There, they were killed by a group of teenagers led by a Comrade Teng being battered with iron bars, pickaxes, machetes and many other makeshift weapons owing to the scarcity, and subsequent price of ammunition. After the prisoners were executed, the soldiers who had accompanied them from S-21 buried them in graves that held as few as 6 and as many as 100 bodies.\n\nEven though the vast majority of the victims were Cambodian, some foreigners, including 488 Vietnamese, 31 Thai, one Laotian, one Arab, one British, four French, two Americans, one Canadian, one New Zealander, two Australians, one Indonesian, many Indians and Pakistanis were also imprisoned.\n\nAlmost all non-Cambodians had left the country by early May 1975, following an overland evacuation of the French Embassy in trucks. The few who remained were seen as a security risk. Though most of the foreign victims were either Vietnamese or Thai, a number of Western prisoners, many picked up at sea by Khmer Rouge patrol boats, also passed through S-21 between April 1976 and December 1978. No foreign prisoners survived captivity in S-21.\n\nTwo Franco-Vietnamese brothers named Rovin and Harad Bernard were detained in April 1976 after they were transferred from Siem Reap where they had worked tending cattle. Another Frenchman named Andre Gaston Courtigne, a 30-year-old clerk and typist at the French embassy, was arrested the same month along with his Khmer wife in Siem Reap.\n\nIt is possible that a handful of French nationals who went missing after the 1975 evacuation of Phnom Penh also passed through S-21. \nTwo Americans were captured under similar circumstances. James Clark and Lance McNamara in April 1978 were sailing when their boat drifted off course and sailed into Cambodian waters. They were arrested by Khmer patrol boats, taken ashore, where they were blindfolded, placed on trucks, and taken to the then-deserted Phnom Penh.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old John D. Dewhirst, a British tourist, was one of the youngest foreigners to die in the prison. He was sailing with his New Zealand companion, Kerry Hamill, and their Canadian friend Stuart Glass when their boat drifted into Cambodian territory and was intercepted by Khmer patrol boats on August 13, 1978. Glass was killed during the arrest, while Dewhirst and Hamill were captured, blindfolded, and taken to shore. Both were executed, with Dewhirst possibly having been burned alive, after having been tortured for several months at Tuol Sleng.\n\nOne of the last foreign prisoners to die was twenty-nine-year-old American Michael S. Deeds, who was captured with his friend Christopher E. DeLance on November 24, 1978 while sailing from Singapore to Hawaii. His confession was signed a week before the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge. In 1989, Deeds' brother, Karl Deeds, traveled to Cambodia in attempts to find his brother's remains, but was unsuccessful. On September 3, 2012, DeLance's photograph was identified among the caches of inmate portraits.\n\nAs of 1999, there were a total of 79 foreign victims on record, but former Tuol Sleng Khmer Rouge photographer Nim Im claims that the records are not complete. On top of that, there is also an eyewitness account of a Cuban and a Swiss who passed through the prison, though no official records of either are shown.\n\nOut of an estimated 20,000 people imprisoned at Tuol Sleng, there were only twelve known survivors: seven adults and five children. One child died shortly after the liberation. As of mid-September 2011, only three of the adults and the children are thought to be still alive: Chum Mey, Bou Meng, and Chim Meth. All three said they were kept alive because they had skills their captors judged to be useful. Bou Meng, whose wife was killed in the prison, is an artist. Chum Mey was kept alive because of his skills in repairing machinery. Chim Meth was held in S-21 for 2 weeks and transferred to the nearby Prey Sar prison. She may have been spared because she was from Stoeung district in Kampong Thom where Comrade Duch was born. She intentionally distinguished herself by emphasising her provincial accent during her interrogations. Vann Nath, who was spared because of his ability to paint, died on September 5, 2011. Norng Chan Phal, one of the surviving children has just published his story.\n\nThe Documentation Center of Cambodia has recently estimated that, in fact, at least 179 prisoners were freed from S-21 between 1975 and 1979 and approximately 23 prisoners (including 5 children, two of them siblings Norng Chanphal and Norng Chanly) survived when the prison was liberated in January 1979. One child died short after. Of the 179 prisoners who were released most disappeared and only a few are known to have survived after 1979. Further research needs to be done. It was found that at least 60 persons (out of the DC Cam list) who are listed as having survived, were first released, but later rearrested and executed.\n\nThe prison had a staff of 1,720 people throughout the whole period. Of those, approximately 300 were office staff, internal workforce and interrogators. The other 1,400 were general workers, including people who grew food for the prison. Several of these workers were children taken from the prisoner families. The chief of the prison was Khang Khek Ieu (also known as Comrade Duch), a former mathematics teacher who worked closely with Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot. Other leading figures of S-21 were Kim Vat aka Ho (deputy chief of S-21), Peng (chief of guards), Mam Nai aka Chan (chief of the Interrogation Unit), and Tang Sin Hean aka Pon (interrogator). Pon was the person who interrogated important people such as Keo Meas, Nay Sarann, Ho Nim, Tiv Ol, and Phok Chhay.\n\nThe documentation unit was responsible for transcribing tape-recorded confessions, typing the handwritten notes from prisoners' confessions, preparing summaries of confessions, and maintaining files. In the photography sub-unit, workers took mug shots of prisoners when they arrived, pictures of prisoners who had died while in detention, and pictures of important prisoners after they were executed. Thousands of photographs have survived, but thousands are still missing.\n\nThe defense unit was the largest unit in S-21. The guards in this unit were mostly teenagers. Many guards found the unit's strict rules hard to obey. Guards were not allowed to talk to prisoners, to learn their names, or to beat them. They were also forbidden to observe or eavesdrop on interrogations, and they were expected to obey 30 regulations, which barred them from such things as taking naps, sitting down or leaning against a wall while on duty. They had to walk, guard, and examine everything carefully. Guards who made serious mistakes were arrested, interrogated, jailed and put to death. Most of the people employed at S-21 were terrified of making mistakes and feared being tortured and killed.\n\nThe interrogation unit was split into three separate groups: \"Krom Noyobai\" or the political unit, \"Krom Kdao\" or the \"hot\" unit and \"Krom Angkiem\", or the \"chewing\" unit. The hot unit (sometimes called the cruel unit) was allowed to use torture. In contrast, the cold unit (sometimes called the gentle unit) was prohibited from using torture to obtain confessions. If they could not make prisoners confess, they would transfer them to the hot unit. The chewing unit dealt with tough and important cases. Those who worked as interrogators were literate and usually in their 20s.\n\nSome of the staff who worked in Tuol Sleng also ended up as prisoners. They confessed to being lazy in preparing documents, to having damaged machines and various equipment, and to having beaten prisoners to death without permission when assisting with interrogations.\n\nWhen prisoners were first brought to Tuol Sleng, they were made aware of ten rules that they were to follow during their incarceration. What follows is what is posted today at the Tuol Sleng Museum; the imperfect grammar is a result of faulty translation from the original Khmer:\n\nDuring testimony at the Khmer Rouge Tribunal on April 27, 2009, Duch claimed the 10 security regulations were a fabrication of the Vietnamese officials that first set up the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum.\n\nIn 1979, Hồ Văn Tây, a Vietnamese combat photographer, was the first journalist to document Tuol Sleng to the world. Ho and his colleagues followed the stench of rotting corpses to the gates of Tuol Sleng. The photos of Hồ documenting what he saw when he entered the site are exhibited in Tuol Sleng today.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge required that the prison staff make a detailed dossier for each prisoner. Included in the documentation was a photograph. Since the original negatives and photographs were separated from the dossiers in the 1979–1980 period, most of the photographs remain anonymous today.\n\nThe buildings at Tuol Sleng are preserved, some rooms as they were left when the Khmer Rouge were driven out in 1979. The regime kept extensive records, including thousands of photographs. Several rooms of the museum are now lined, floor to ceiling, with black and white photographs of some of the estimated 20,000 prisoners who passed through the prison.\n\nThe site has four main buildings, known as Building A, B, C, and D. Building A holds the large cells in which the bodies of the last victims were discovered. Building B holds galleries of photographs. Building C holds the rooms sub-divided into small cells for prisoners. Building D holds other memorabilia including instruments of torture.\n\nOther rooms contain only a rusting iron bedframe, beneath a black and white photograph showing the room as it was found by the Vietnamese. In each photograph, the mutilated body of a prisoner is chained to the bed, killed by his fleeing captors only hours before the prison was captured. Other rooms preserve leg-irons and instruments of torture. They are accompanied by paintings by former inmate Vann Nath showing people being tortured, which were added by the post-Khmer Rouge regime installed by the Vietnamese in 1979.\n\nThe museum is open to the public from 8 am to 5 pm. Visitors have the opportunity of viewing a 'survivor testimony' from 2:30-3pm (Monday - Friday). Along with the Choeung Ek Memorial (The Killing Fields), the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum is included as a point of interest for those visiting Cambodia. Tuol Sleng also remains an important educational site as well as memorial for Cambodians. Since 2010, the ECCC brings Cambodians on a 'study tour' to the Tuol Sleng, Choeung Ek and finishing at the ECCC complex. During 2010, around 27,000 Cambodians visited the museum through this tour. (See ECCC Court Report January 2011) Some believed that ghosts of the victims continue to haunt the place.\n\nA number of images from Tuol Sleng are featured in the 1992 Ron Fricke film \"Baraka\".\n\nSurvivors Chum Mey and Bou Meng can both frequently be seen near the administration office of the museum for a 'meet and greet' as well as the opportunity to buy their biographies.\n\n\"S-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine\" is a 2003 film by Rithy Panh, a Cambodian-born, French-trained filmmaker who lost his family when he was 11. The film features two Tuol Sleng survivors, Vann Nath and Chum Mey, confronting their former Khmer Rouge captors, including guards, interrogators, a doctor and a photographer. The focus of the film is the difference between the feelings of the survivors, who want to understand what happened at Tuol Sleng to warn future generations, and the former jailers, who cannot escape the horror of the genocide they helped create.\n\n\n\n"}

UnifiedPOS is an abstraction standard that contains appendices which provide specific platform implementation information for Microsoft OLE and .NET Windows OS and Java for other OS (Linux) environments. \n\nDeveloped by a team of joint retailer and industry technical experts following published policies and procedures, UnifiedPOS provides a consistent and exact framework for programming point of sales devices that is platform-independent and vendor-neutral.\n\nRecent efforts (2010-2011) by the UnifiedPOS committee include provisions for local and remote POS peripheral support through a supplemental Web Services for point of service (WS-POS 1.1) standard. In addition, an increasing focus on using XML language commands to control the POS devices can be seen in the XML-POS Appendix in UnifiedPOS Version 1.13 standard.\n\nThe UnifiedPOS standard is managed by Association for Retail Technology Standards (ARTS) through two committees. The ARTS board is composed of international retailers and vendors from all industry segments. The principal responsibilities of this committee are to ensure that the standards it manages continues to expand in accordance with retailer requirements. The committee will specify changes to the standards and approve new devices. Membership in NRF-ARTS is required to participate in the administrative committee. Membership in NRF-ARTS is not required to download and use the UnifiedPOS standards.\n\nThe technical committee, composed of both vendors and retailers, modifies the UnifiedPOS specification based on guidance of the Administrative Committee. The technical committee provides support by resolving implementation issues or issues arising from the standard.\n\nOPOS and JavaPOS implementation groups modify or enhance their actual program implementations to conform to the UnifiedPOS specification. The UnifiedPOS technical committee periodically audits the specific implementations to ensure the various groups conform to the UnifiedPOS specification.\n\nIn 2003, a .NET implementation was proposed, to the technical committee and subsequently accepted into the standard. This implementation is known as POS for .NET. . Microsoft has been criticized for not keeping up with the current revisions (1.13) to the UPOS standard. POS for .NET version 1.12 is not compatible with the current .NET Framework 4.0. However, On December 13, 2013, Microsoft released POS for .NET 1.14 CTP via Microsoft Connect. POS for .NET 1.14 is intended to conform to UPOS 1.14. The public release of POS for .NET is expected in Spring 2014.\n\nIn 2011 effort is underway to create an updated UnifiedPOS 2.0 standard which will add many enhanced features and functions to support newer programming paradigms and remote XML POS peripheral installation scenarios.\n\nAlthough UPOS claims support for 36 device types, in practice most retailers will not be able to take advantage of many of these devices. For example, there are few, if any, UPOS service objects that support biometric or RFID types. Instead, most device manufacturers for these devices have created their own proprietary device drivers.\n\n"}
{"id": "42614948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42614948", "title": "Ushi no toki mairi", "text": "Ushi no toki mairi\n\nAlso variously called , , .\n\nSources say that common method of the ritual developed during the Edo period (1603–1868).\n\nThe woman performing the curse is generally portrayed as dressed in white, with disheveled hair, wearing an iron \"crown\" that holds three burning candles, suspending (from her neck) a mirror upon her chest (which lies hidden) and wearring a pair of tall clogs (\"geta\"). She would then nail a straw doll representing her target to a at the Shinto shrine.\n\nThe iron \"crown\" that she wears is actually a (or trivet, a stand for setting cooking pots, etc., above a heat source) which she wears in inverted, slipping the iron ring over her head and sticking candles on its three legs.\nIt was believed that the spot struck on the straw doll corresponded to the area of the body where the target would begin to experience illness or injury. However, this straw doll or other form of effigy was not a definitive requisite in the ritual even relatively late in the Edo Period. For instance, in Toriyama Sekien's \"Konjaku Gazu Zoku Hyakki\" (1779, pictured top right) depicts the woman holding a hammer but no doll, nor is the doll mentioned in the caption. In this case, the nails are driven directly into the branches of the sacred tree.\n\nThe props used are described somewhat differently, depending on the source. Nails of a particular size called are prescribed according to some authorities. She may hold in her mouth a comb, or a \"torch of bamboo and pine roots lighted at both ends\". The \"proper witching hour\" is, strictly speaking, the \"ushi no mitsu doki\" (2:00–2:30 am).\n\nIn Sekien's or Hokusai's print (above), the woman performing the curse ritual is depicted with a black ox by her side. Such a black ox, lying recumbent, is expected to appear on the seventh night of the ritual, and one must stride or straddle over the animal to complete the task to success, but if one betrays fear at the ox's apparition the \"potency of the charm is lost\".\n\nIn earlier times, the term simply referred to worshiping at the shrine during the hours of the ox, and the curse connotation developed later. At the Kibune Shrine in Kyoto, there was a tradition that if one prayed here on the \"ox hour of the ox day of the ox month of the ox year\" the wish was likely to be granted, because it was during this alignment of the hour, day, month, and year that the Kibune deity was believed to have made descent upon the shrine. However, the shrine became known a cursing spot in later development.\n\nThe Kibune Shrine became strongly associated with the ox hour curse following the fame of the medieval legend of the Hashihime of Uji (\"The Princess of the \"). The legend is considered the prime source of the later conception \"Ushi no toki mairi\" curse ritual. According to legend, Hashihime in mortal life was the daughter of a certain nobleman, but consumed by jealousy, made a wish to become a \"kijin\" (an \"oni\" demon) capable of destroying her love rival. After 7 days at Kibune Shrine, she was finally given revelation by the resident deity \"to bathe for thirty seven days in the rapids of the Uji River.\" Note that even though Kibune has later been seen as a mecca for the ritual, Hashihime only learned the recipe here, and enacted it miles away (Kibune is in the north of Kyoto, the Uji River is to the south).\n\nThe earliest written text of the legend occurs in a late Kamakura-period variant text (\"Yashirobon\" codex) of \"The Tale of Heike\", under the \"Tsurugi no maki\" (\"Book of the Sword\") chapter. According to it, Hashihime was originally a mortal during the reign of Emperor Saga (809 to 823), but after turning demon and killing her rival, her man's kinsmen, then indiscriminately other innocent parties, she lived on beyond the normal human life span, to prey on the samurai Watanabe no Tsuna at the bridge, only to have her arm severed by the sword . Tsuna kept the demon's arm, whose power was contained by the Abe no Seimei, via chanting the Ninnō-kyō sutra. In this variant of the \"chapter of the sword\", the ceremony that the woman undergoes at the Uji River to transmogrify into the demon is described as follows:\nSecluding herself in a deserted spot, she divided her long hair into five bunches and fashioned these bunches into horns. She daubed her face with vermilion and her body with cinnabar, set on her head an iron tripod with burning brands [* ] attached to its legs and held in her mouth another brand, burning at both ends. \n\nThus in the \"Tsurugi no maki\" can be seen such elements as the wearing of the tripod (here called ) and propping lit torches (similar to candles in later tradition), but the woman painted her entire face and body red, rather than remain in pure white garb.\n\nLater during the Muromachi period, this legend was adapted by Zeami into the Noh play \"Kanawa\" or \"The Iron Crown\". The Noh play inherits essentially the same outfit for the principal woman, who is commanded by the oracle to \"daub your face with red and wear scarlet clothing,\" and uses neither a straw doll or hammer, but has the yingyang master Seimei creates \"two life-size straw effigies of the man and his new wife [with] their names [placed] inside\" in order to perform the rites to excorcize Hashihime's demon. Therefore, the later form of the \"ushi no mairi\" developed afterwards, .\n\nThe use of dolls in the cursing ritual has been practiced since antiquity, with a reference in the \"Nihon Shoki\" chronicle under the reign of Emperor Yōmei, which relates that in the year 587, Nakatomi no Katsumi no Muraji \"preparede figures of the Imperial  ... and [spellcast] them\", but it did not work. However, this record does not clarify if the dolls were poked by sharp implements.\n\nThere are unearthed archeological relics shaped like human dolls suspected of being used in curses. Called , some have faces realistically drawn and ink, and others with iron nails driven into the breast. One such from the 8th century is held by the Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties. Another from the Tatechō site in Matsue, Shimane, a wooden tag depicts a female figure, apparently a noblewoman deducing from attire, and this doll had three wooden pegs or nails driven into it, aiming at her breasts and her heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The campaign, handled by advertising agency Grey London, comprised photographs of nine female celebrities made-up to appear as though they were the victims of domestic abuse. The campaign received substantial media attention, with commentary appearing in \"The Daily Mail\", \"This Morning\", and \"Marie Claire\", among others. The \"What's it going to take?\" campaign went on to win a number of honours within the advertising industry, including prizes at the 2008 Creative Circle Awards and the Aerial Awards.\n\nWomen's Aid was established in 1974 as an umbrella organisation for several feminist charities aiming to end domestic violence against women and children, including molestation, rape, and sexual harassment. For the next thirty years, the organisation worked with a number of advertising agencies to promote its cause, including Ogilvy & Mather, McCann Erickson, and . However, despite numerous publicity campaigns over the years, by 2005 the charity's own research suggested that less than 16% of the public were aware of the existence of Women's Aid. Through a personal relationship between a pair of employees at the two organisations, Women's Aid were taken on as a pro-bono client by agency Grey London in 2005.\n\nThe first product of this new collaboration was the 2006 \"Valentine's Day\" campaign. With a budget of £500, Grey London made strategic purchases of media space in newspapers and radio with a reach of about 2% of the UK population. Through an effective public relations campaign, this exposure was leveraged to the point where 52% of British adults saw the advertisements at least once. The campaign went on to win a number of awards in the advertising community, including an EFFIE Award for Socially Responsible Advertising and an IPA Effectiveness Award. Moreover, the campaign was financially successful. Women's Aid recorded an increase of 25% in traffic to their website and a substantial increase in the number of donations following \"Valentine's Day\"'s run.\n\nLooking to build upon the success of \"Valentine's Day\", Grey London began planning for a new campaign to run in early 2007. The brief for the campaign was to bring the issue into public view by making use of celebrities. In an interview with \"Creativity\" magazine, a planner for the agency said: \"The amount of column inches and time spent talking about celebrities is phenomenal and if we could own even a small piece of this it would help to raise awareness of domestic violence and also Women's Aid. In this gossip driven world if we thought a celebrity was suffering from a form of domestic abuse EVERYONE would be talking about it.\" From this came the idea of a series of portraits of female celebrities made-up to appear as though they had been the victims of abuse. Grey London recruited fashion photographer Rankin, known for his portraits of politicians and celebrities including Tony Blair, Kylie Minogue, and Queen Elizabeth II, to conduct the shoot.\n\nThe team approached a number of women to star in the campaign but, due to scheduling conflicts and the lack of a campaign budget, securing dates for the photo-shoot proved difficult. In all, nine female celebrities, across a wide range of ages and ethnicities, were chosen: Honor Blackman, veteran actress and former Bond girl; Fern Britton, presenter of daytime television show \"This Morning\"; Fiona Bruce, newsreader for BBC News; Anne-Marie Duff, known for playing Fiona Gallagher on television drama \"Shameless\"; Anna Friel, known for playing Beth Jordache on the soap opera \"Brookside\"; Jemma Kidd, former fashion model; Miquita Oliver, television and radio personality; Fay Ripley, known for playing Jenny Gifford in the comedy drama series \"Cold Feet\"; and Kate Thornton, journalist and television presenter. The head and shoulder prosthetics were created by Nigel Booth, whose previous work includes prosthetic and make-up design on feature films such as \"The English Patient\" and \"Blade II\".\n\nThe launch of the campaign on 1 February 2007 was celebrated with a launch party at 11 Downing Street hosted by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah. All appearances in magazines, newspapers, posters, on television and on radio were donated free of charge, as was the work of the featured celebrities, photographer, and the advertising agency. In all, the campaign received an estimated £30m of media exposure, including an eight-page feature in women's magazine \"Marie Claire\" with an editorial written by Marian Keyes.\n\nThere was mixed reception to the campaign. Some were impressed with the impact of the images, such as Noel Bussey of \"Campaign\" magazine, who said:\n\"Many agencies pull out their best work when it's for charity, but rarely is it this effective, so well shot or so close to the brief. The images of battered female celebrities are bound to pick up coverage outside of the original media, and will not fail in raising awareness about the sickening problem of domestic violence.\" \n\nOthers felt that the use of celebrities diminished the relevance of the message; Roisin Donnelly of Procter & Gamble commented: \"In this print campaign, the celebrities, complete with injuries provided by the make-up artist, do get attention, but it seemed like it was a trick just to get attention, and was focused more on the celebrity and fake make-up rather than the central issue of domestic violence.\" \n\nOthers were confused as to the point of the campaign; Kira Cochrane of \"The Guardian\" commented: \"The images were arresting, but odd. I can't imagine celebrity women posing as other sorts of victim: presenting themselves as trafficked women to highlight forced prostitution, or as rape victims to underline the low conviction rate. And what were the images supposed to tell us: that domestic violence is bad? Painful? Causes serious bruising?\"\n\nIn all, the campaign proved a moderate success. Grey London reported that at the height of publicity for the campaign, more than 67% of the British public were aware of Women's Aid and its goals. The \"What's it going to take?\" campaign went on to win a number of awards from the advertising and charitable communities, including an Aerial Award for the radio component, a Silver Award at the 2008 Creative Circle Awards for the print component, and Women's Aid were honoured as the Campaigning Team of the Year at the Charity Times Gala Awards.\n\nAs of 2010, Grey London continues to produce work for Women's Aid; later in 2007, they collaborated again with Rankin to produce a second series of posters for the \"Valentine's Day\" campaign. In 2009 they continued to make use of celebrity to promote domestic abuse awareness, releasing a promotion starring Keira Knightley, titled \"Cut\". The video, banned by the advertising standards agency Clearcast from appearing on British television, was only shown online, backed by a print campaign pointing people to the website.\n\n"}

His \"Chronica nova Prutenica\" (\"New Prussian Chronicle\") is one of the principal sources of information used for the history of the Prussian lands and parts of the adjoining Grand Duchy of Lithuania, covering the period between 1293 and 1394. Originally written in Middle High German rhymed prose, the work combined actual accounts with legends, folk tales, and myths. Out of an estimated length of 17,000 lines, only about 500 have survived to the present day. However, in 1464, the Polish chronicler Jan Długosz ordered a translation of his work to Latin, which has survived almost intact.\n"}
