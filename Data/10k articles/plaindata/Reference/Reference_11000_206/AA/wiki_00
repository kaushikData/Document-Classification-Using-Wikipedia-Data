Turkey 2000, Nos. 22947 & 8/93, ECHR 2000-X, was a decision by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on the extent of the right to life.\n\nThe case involved the Kurd Zübeyir Akkoç in Turkey who belonged to an outlawed trade union. Both the union member and his wife received death threats, and eventually the man was killed. His widow thus took the case to court, charging that the Turkish government was responsible. The government was not found guilty of murder. However, on the right to life, the ECHR found that the Turkish government knew about the death threats and failed to protect the victim. Thus, the right to life had been violated. In addition, the state's investigation of the murder was found to be so negligent as to also be an infringement of the right to life.\n\nWith respect to international human rights law, it is noted that a government's responsibility regarding the right to life is not \"passive.\" There should be laws against murder. \"Akkoç\" is a case that examined the \"potential grey area\" of the \"extent to which a State can protect an individual against criminal behaviour.\"\n\n"}

(The collection formerly included objects from the Islamic world, but these have recently been merged with the Department of the Ancient Near East to form the Department of the Middle East.)\n\nThe department's collection began with a donation from Sir Hans Sloane, which contained a small number of objects from the Asian continent, including a collection of Japanese material acquired from the family of the German traveller and physician Engelbert Kaempfer (who had led an expedition to Japan). Only a few objects were acquired from Asia between 1753 and the 1820s, but the collection expanded in the early 19th century to become one of the world's largest. This was mainly through a donation of a number of South Asian artifacts, such as the gilded bronze figure of Tara from Sri Lanka in 1830, the Bridge Collection of East and Central Indian sculpture in 1872, and the Amaravati Collection in 1880. The collection of Asian material continued during the tenure of Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks as Keeper of the Department of Antiquities from 1866 to 1896, and in 1921 the Sub-Department of Oriental Antiquities was established. In 1933, the Asian collections of the Prints and Drawings Sub-Department were united with the Department of Oriental Antiquities, forming one of the most significant collections of art and antiquities of Asia in the northern hemisphere. In 2003, the Department of Oriental Antiquities and the Department of Japanese Antiquities merged to become the current Department of Asia. The Keepers of the Department of Asia include Jessica Rawson,\nRobert Knox (1994-2006), Jan Stuart (2006-2014) and Jane Portal (from 2014).\n\nHighlights include:\n\n\nMost of the Department of Asia is located in the northern section of the museum. It is split into several rooms and four main geographic areas:\n\n\nThe China collection is one of the largest collections of Chinese historical artifacts in the Western world. It focuses on porcelain, paintings, scripts and basic tools, with items ranging in date from the Neolithic era to the 20th century. One of the most important items is a collection of rare Buddhist paintings from Dunhuang. China was one of the first countries to use coins, and the museum also has a large collection of Chinese coins (housed in the Department of Coins and Medals).\n\nObjects in the Indian collections of the Department date from some of the earliest civilisations in the Indus valley, about 7000 years ago. It includes an important collection of prehistoric material from the Nilgiri mountains in southern India . As well as ancient artifacts, the Indian collections include excellent examples of pottery, art (including many rare Mughal paintings), traditional scriptwork, and a large display of sculpture, including carvings from the Great Stupa at Amaravati. India is also represented in the money collections, with a large number of coins dating back to the 4th century BC.\nThe John Addis gallery (room 34) houses the museum's collection of Islamic art, which now officially forms part of the Department of Middle East. This includes objects from the earliest centuries of Islam to the 20th century, and geographically from Egypt to Spain to India. The gallery's arrangement is mainly chronological, with western Islam — Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Turkey — on the left of the descending staircase, and eastern Islam — Iran, Afghanistan and India — on the right. Highlights of the collection are a ceramic lamp from the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the unique Jade Terrapin from Allahabad, a Mughal work of art from northern India, and a group of foundation inscriptions from Gaur, West Bengal in eastern India. At the end of the gallery are cases on Islamic Spain, science, arms and armour, coinage and a changing exhibition of contemporary graphics. The British Museum is actively collecting 20th century material from the Islamic world, including calligraphy, popular religious prints, political posters, studio pottery and a rare 11th century Qur'an.\n\nThe Japanese section of the Asian department holds one of the most comprehensive collections of Japanese material culture in Europe. The Japanese galleries, Rooms 92–94 (the Konica-Minolta, Main and Urasenke galleries), were opened on 6 April 1990, and include prints, printed books, paintings, ceramics, swords, decorative arts, and early archaeological material. Part of the collection includes a tea house, sponsored and built by the Urasenke Foundation, which exhibits both modern tea utensils and historic tea ceremony wares.\n\nThe Korea Foundation Gallery houses the museum's collection of Korean art and archaeology. Objects from pre-history to the present day include stone sculpture, paintings, printed books, screens and folk art, as well as ceramics, lacquerware, gold and bronze. Highlights of the exhibition include a reconstruction of a traditional Korean sarangbang (a study in a Korean home) and fine examples of 15th century Korean script.\n\n"}

{"id": "20534924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20534924", "title": "Consumer Electronics Control", "text": "Consumer Electronics Control\n\nConsumer Electronics Control (CEC) is a feature of HDMI designed to allow users to command and control devices connected through HDMI by using only one remote control. For example, by using the remote control of a television set to control a set-top box and/or DVD player. Up to 15 devices can be controlled. CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.\n\nIt is a one-wire bidirectional serial bus that is based on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.\n\nTrade names for CEC are:\n\nThe following is a list of the most commonly used HDMI-CEC commands:\n\nCEC is a separate electrical signal from the other HDMI signals. This allows a device to disable its high-speed HDMI circuitry in sleep mode, but be woken up by CEC. It is a single shared bus, which is directly connected between all HDMI ports on a device, so it can flow through a device which is completely powered off (not just asleep).\n\nThe bus is electrically identical to the AV.link protocol, but CEC adds a detailed higher-level message protocol.\n\nThe bus is an open-collector line, somewhat like I²C, passively pulled up to +3.3 V, and driven low to transmit a bit.\n\nSimilarities to I²C include:\n\nDifferences from I²C:\n\nEach bit begins with the line pulled low (falling edge), a delay indicating the bit value, a rising edge, and further delay until the start of the following bit.\n\nNormal data bits are long. A logic 1 is held low for , while a logic 0 is held low for . The receiver samples the line at after the falling edge, then begins watching for the following bit after the falling edge.\n\nA receiver can convert a transmitted 1 bit to a 0 bit by pulling the line low within 0.35 ms of the falling edge, and holding it until the 0 bit time. The transmitter observes the bus during its own transmissions to detect this condition. This is used to acknowledge a transmission.\n\nEach frame begins with a special start bit, held low for and then allowed to rise, for a total duration of . Any device may send a start bit after observing the bus idle for a suitable number of bit times. (Normally, 5 bit times, but 7 bit times immediately after a successful transmission to facilitate fair sharing of the bus, and 3 bit times between a failed transmission and its retransmission.)\n\nThis is followed by up to 16 bytes. Each byte consists of ten bits: eight data bits (transmitted msbit-first, in big-endian order), an \"end of message\" bit (set to 1 after the last byte of a frame), and an \"acknowledge\" bit.\n\nFor single-recipient messages, the acknowledge bit operates similarly to I²C: it is transmitted as a 1 bit, and the receiver pulls it down to a 0 bit to acknowledge the byte.\n\nFor broadcast messages, the acknowledge bit is inverted: it is still transmitted as a 1 bit, but is pulled down to a 0 bit by any receiver which \"rejects\" the byte.\n\nThe first byte of each CEC frame is a header containing the 4-bit source and destination addresses. If the addressed destination exists, it acknowledges the byte. A frame consisting of nothing but the header is a ping which simply checks for the presence of another device.\n\nThe address 15 (1111) is used for the broadcast address (as a destination) and unregistered devices (as a source) which have not yet chosen a different address. Some devices do not need to receive non-broadcast messages and so may use address 15 permanently, notably remote control receivers and HDMI switches. Devices which need to receive addressed messages need their own address. A device obtains an address by attempting to ping it. If the ping is unacknowledged, the device claims it. If the ping is acknowledged, the device tries another address.\n\nThe second byte is an opcode which specifies the operation to be performed, and the number and meaning of following parameter bytes. For example, a user press on a remote control will generate a 3-byte frame: a header byte, a codice_1 opcode (0x44), and an operand byte identifying the button. Including the initial idle time and extra-long start bit, this takes 88.5 ms (37 bit times). A later codice_2 opcode (0x45) has no operands.\n\n\n"}

The motivation for funds parking is that many countries, before granting permission to enter, consider the applicant's bank account balance as part of assessing whether the traveler will be willing and able to support his or herself for the duration of the trip, and to leave the country when required. Funds parking, therefore, is a deceptive practice. When immigration officers notice unexplained cash deposits in a bank account statement, they may assume that they constitute an attempt at funds parking and refuse the visa application.

She was a prominent social figure and hostess, who was born into the wealthy Vanderbilt family and married into the Whitney family.\n\nGertrude Vanderbilt was born on January 9, 1875 in New York City, the second daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843–1899) and Alice Claypoole Gwynne (1852–1934), and a great-granddaughter of \"Commodore\" Cornelius Vanderbilt. Her older sister died before Gertrude was born, but she grew up with several brothers and a younger sister. The family's New York City home was an opulent mansion at 742–748 Fifth Avenue. As a young girl, Gertrude spent her summers in Newport, Rhode Island, at the family's summer home, The Breakers, where she kept up with the boys in all their rigorous sporting activities. She was educated by private tutors and at the exclusive Brearley School for women students in New York City. She kept small drawings and watercolor paintings in her personal journals which were her first signs of being interested in the arts.\n\nWhile visiting Europe in the early 1900s, Gertrude Whitney discovered the burgeoning art world of Montmartre and Montparnasse in France. What she saw encouraged her to pursue her creativity and become a sculptor.\n\nShe studied at the Art Students League of New York with Hendrik Christian Andersen and James Earle Fraser. Other women students in her classes included Anna Vaughn Hyatt and Malvina Hoffman. In Paris she studied with Andrew O'Connor and also received criticism from Auguste Rodin in Paris. Her training with sculptors of public monuments influenced her later direction. Although her catalogs include numerous smaller sculptures, she is best known today for her monumental works.\n\nHer first public commission was \"Aspiration\", a life-size male nude in plaster, which appeared outside the New York State Building at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, in 1901.\nInitially she worked under an assumed name, fearing that she would be portrayed as a socialite and her work not taken seriously. Neither her family nor (after her marriage) her husband were supportive of her desire to work seriously as an artist. She once told an artist friend, \"Never expect Harry to take your work seriously ... It never has made any difference to him that I feel as I do about art and it never will (except as a source of annoyance).\" She believed that a man would have been taken more seriously as an artist, and that her wealth put her in a lose-lose situation: criticized if she took commissions because other artists were more needy, but blamed for undercutting the market for other artists if she was not paid.\n\nIn 1907, Whitney established an apartment and studio in Greenwich Village. She also set up a studio in Passy, a fashionable Parisian neighborhood in the XVI arrondissement.\n\nBy 1910 she was exhibiting her work publicly under her own name. \"Paganisme Immortel\", a statue of a young girl sitting on a rock, with outstretched arms, next to a male figure, was shown at the 1910 National Academy of Design. \"Spanish Peasant\" was accepted at the Paris Salon in 1911, and \"Aztec Fountain\" was awarded a bronze medal in 1915 at the San Francisco Exhibition. Her first solo show occurred in New York City in 1916. The first charity exhibition she organized was in 1914 called the \"50-50 Art Sale\".\n\nDuring World War I, Gertrude Whitney dedicated a great deal of her time and money to various relief efforts, establishing and maintaining a fully operational hospital for wounded soldiers in Juilly, about northwest of Paris in France.\n\nWhile at this hospital, Gertrude Whitney made drawings of the soldiers which became plans for her memorials in New York City. Her work prior to the war had a much less realistic style, which she strayed away from to give the work a more serious feeling. In 1915, her brother Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt perished in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania.\n\nShe completed a series of smaller pieces realistically depicting soldiers in wartime, but her smaller works were not seen as particularly significant during her lifetime. Since her death critics have recognized the expert craftsmanship of her smaller works.\n\nIn addition to participating in shows with other artists, Whitney held a number of solo exhibitions during her career. These included a show of her wartime sculptures at her Eighth Street Studio in November 1919; a show at the Art Institute of Chicago, March 1 to April 15, 1923; and one in New York City, March 17–28, 1936. The majority of works created in this period of her work were made in her studio in Paris. The Whitney museum of American art held a commemorative show of her works in 1943.\n\nFollowing the end of the War, Whitney was also involved in the creation of a number of commemorative sculptures. During the 1920s her works received critical acclaim both in Europe and the United States, particularly her monumental works. During the 1930s the popularity of monumental pieces declined. Whitney's last pieces of public arts were the \"Spirit of Flight\", created for the New York World's Fair of 1939, and the \"Peter Stuyvesant Monument\" in New York City.\n\nGertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's numerous works in the United States include:\n\nWhitney's \"Titanic Memorial\" is considered by critics as the most important achievement in her artistic career. The statue was built from a $50,000 prize from a competition that she won in 1914.\n\nWhitney also created works which are now in other countries, including the \"A.E.F. Memorial\" in St. Nazaire Harbor in Saint-Nazaire, France, 1924. The Government of France purchased a marble replica of the head of the Titanic memorial which is now housed in the Musée du Luxembourg.\n\nWhitney sculpted the Christopher Columbus memorial, called \"Monumento a la Fe Descubridora\" (Monument to the Discovery Faith), in Huelva, Spain, 1928–33. With a cubist style, it is one of her biggest works.\n\nIn 1931 Whitney presented the \"Caryatid Fountain\" to McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The fountain is also referred to as \"The Good Will Fountain\", \"The Friendship Fountain\", \"The Whitney Fountain\", \" The Three Graces\" and because it consists of three nude males, \"The Three Bares.\". There is also a bronze version of this fountain in the Washington Square in Lima, Peru.\n\nHer great wealth afforded her the opportunity to become a patron of the arts, but she also devoted herself to the advancement of women in art, supporting and exhibiting in women-only shows and ensuring that women were included in mixed shows. She supported exhibition of artwork both locally and around the country, including the 1913 Armory Show in New York. Whitney also donated money to the Society of Independent Artists founded in 1917, which aimed to promote artists who deviated from academic norms. She actively bought works from new artists including the Ashcan School. In 1922, she financed publication of \"The Arts\" magazine, to prevent its closing. She was the primary financial backer for the \"International Composer's Guild,\" an organization created to promote the performance of modern music.\n\nBy 1908, Whitney had opened the \"Whitney Studio Gallery\" in the same buildings as her own studio on West Eighth Street in Greenwich Village. Artists such as Robert Henri and Jo Davidson were invited to showcase their works there. In 1914, Gertrude Whitney also established the \"Whitney Studio Club\" at 147 West 4th Street, as an artists' club where young artists could meet and talk, as well as exhibit their works. She provided nearby housing many of them, as well as stipends for living costs at home and abroad. The Whitney Studio Club expanded again when its headquarters were moved back from West Fourth Street to West Eighth Street in 1923. Thus, the club expanded both in size and scope of programming. These early galleries would evolve to become Whitney's greatest legacy, the Whitney Museum of American Art, on the site of what is now the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture.\n\nIn 1929, Whitney offered the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art the donation of her twenty-five-year collection of nearly 700 American modern art works and full payment for building a wing to accommodate these works. Her offer was declined because the museum would not take American art, and in 1931, Whitney decided to create her own museum by renovating and expanding on one of her own studios. Whitney appointed Juliana Force, who was formerly her assistant since 1914, to be the museum's first director. The museum aimed to embrace modernism, shifting away from the notions that American art was largely rural and narrow in scope.\n\nA colorful recollection of one of her parties celebrating her artist friends was recounted by the artist Jerome Myers:\n\nMatching it in memory is a party at Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's, on her Long Island estate, the artists there a veritable catalog of celebrities, painters and sculptors. I can hardly visualize, let alone describe, the many shifting scenes of our entertainment: sunken pools and gorgeous white peacocks as line decorations spreading into the gardens; in their swinging cages, brilliant macaws nodding their beaks at George Luks as though they remembered posing for his pictures of them; Robert Chanler showing us his exotic sea pictures, blue-green visions in a marine bathroom; and Mrs. Whitney displaying her studio, the only place on earth in which she could find solitude. Here the artists felt at home, the Whitney hospitality always gracious and sincere.\n\nHer Greenwich Village studio has been named a National Treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, giving it landmark status.\n\nWhen Whitney died in 1942, the Whitney Museum of American Art was cleared of the debt it owed her and granted $2.5 million of her money.\n\nAt age 21, on August 25, 1896, Gertrude married the extremely wealthy sportsman Harry Payne Whitney (1872–1930). A banker and investor, Whitney was the son of William Collins Whitney, and his mother, the former Flora Payne, was the daughter of a U.S. Senator and sister of a Standard Oil Company magnate. Harry Whitney inherited a fortune in oil and tobacco as well as interests in banking. In New York, the couple lived in town houses originally belonging to William Whitney, first at 2 East 57th St., across the street from Gertrude's parents, and after William Whitney's death, at 871 Fifth Avenue. They also had a country estate in Westbury, Long Island. Gertrude and Harry Whitney had three children:\n\nHarry Whitney died of pneumonia in 1930, at age 58, leaving his widow an estate valued at $72 million. In 1934, she was at the center of a highly publicized court battle with her sister-in-law, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, for custody of her ten-year-old niece, Gloria Vanderbilt. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney did win custody of her niece at the end of the custody battle.\n\nGertrude Whitney died in 1942, at age 67, and was interred next to her husband in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. The reported cause of her death was from a heart condition. Her daughter Flora Whitney Miller assumed her mother's duties as head of the Whitney Museum, and was succeeded by her daughter, Flora Miller Biddle.\n\n\nIn the 1982 tele-film, \"Little Gloria ... Happy at Last\", Whitney was portrayed by actress Angela Lansbury, who earned an Emmy nomination for her performance.\n\nIn 1999, Gertrude Whitney's granddaughter, Flora Miller Biddle, published a family memoir entitled \"The Whitney Women and the Museum They Made\". She was also the subject of B. H. Friedman's 1978 \"Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney: A Biography\".\n\n\n"}

The decree was issued by the Governor of the Province of Quebec, Frederick Haldimand, on October 25, 1784, three days after the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784) was signed between others of the Six Nations and the American government.\n\nThe text of the proclamation reads:\n\n\"Frederick Haldimand, Captain General and Governor General in Chief of the Province of Quebec and Territories depending thereon, General and Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Forces in said Province and the Frontiers thereof --\n\nWhereas His Majesty having been pleased to direct that in consideration of the early attachment to his cause manifested by the Mohawk Indians, and of the loss of their settlement which they thereby sustained-- that a convenient tract of land under his protection should be chosen as a safe and comfortable retreat for them and others of the Six Nations, who have either lost their settlements within the Territory of the American States, or wish to retire from them to the British -- I have at the earnest desire of many of these His Majesty's faithful Allies purchased a tract of land from the Indians situated between the Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron and I do hereby in His Majesty's name authorize and permit the said Mohawk Nation and such others of the Six Nation Indians as wish to settle in that quarter to take possession of and settle upon the Banks of the River commonly called Ours [Ouse] or Grand River, running into Lake Erie, allotting to them for that purpose six miles deep from each side of the river beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the head of the said river, which them and their posterity are to enjoy for ever.\"\n\nGiven under my hand and seal at arms, at the Castle of St Lewis at Quebec, this twenty-fifth day of October one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four and in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of Our Sovereign Lord George The Third by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith and so forth.\n\nFredk Haldimand<br>\nBy His Excellency's Command<br>\nR. Mathews\n\nJoseph Brant and Guy Johnson, who had been ejected from his post as Superintendent of Indian Affairs a few months before, traveled to London, England in November 1775, on the eve of the American Revolution, to obtain a promise from the Crown that if the Iroquois fought on the British side, they would obtain a land grant in Canada. During and after the American Revolution, American colonists confiscated land and property from those who were Loyalists during the war. The British government compensated both Indian and non-Indian Loyalists with cash payments for their losses.\n\nBy early 1783, Brant had selected the valley of the Grand River as a place of settlement; in 1784 Frederick Haldimand agreed. The land was acquired from the Mississaugas in May 1784, with Lieutenant-Colonel John Butler acting as an agent of purchase on behalf of the government. \n\nLater, the Crown adopted the position that it had failed to obtain title to the entire valley at the time of its purchase from the Mississaugas.\n\nOn April 26, 1784, Frederick Haldimand wrote:\n\n\"The mode of acquiring lands by what is called Deeds of Gift is to be entirely discontinued, for, by the King's instructions, no Private Person, Society, Corporation or colony is capable of acquiring any property in lands belonging to the Indians, either by purchase, or grant or conveyance from the Indians, excepting only where the lands lie within the limits of any colony the soil of which has been vested in Proprietaries or Corporations by grants from the Crown; in which cases such Proprietaries or Corporations only shall be capable of acquiring such property by purchase or grants from the Indians.\" \n\nGovernment officials originally interpreted this grant as prohibiting the Indians from leasing or selling the land to anyone but the government. Joseph Brant countered that Haldimand had promised the Indians freehold land tenure equal to that enjoyed by the colony's Loyalist settlers. As freeholders, the Indians could lease or sell land to the highest bidder. In 1793, Lieutenant Governor Simcoe stated that the Indians could not lease their land since British subjects could only lease land from British subjects. Joseph Brant considered the right to lease or sell land as a litmus test for Indian sovereignty.\n\nThe crown said that the grant was for all members of the Six Nations, but Brant said the land should only be for those members of the Six Nations who were living on the land.\n\nAlthough the overall limits of the lands mentioned in the proclamation were clearly defined,\"extending in that proportion to the head of the said river\", the Crown contended that the grant was limited by the extent of land they had previously purchased and that they could not grant land which they did not already own. In May 1784, Haldimand had purchased a tract of land from the Mississaugas, which was referred to in the grant as generally \"situated between the Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron\". In fact, the head of the Grand River is located some thirty miles beyond the limits of land that the Crown maintained that it had previously purchased from the Mississaugas. \n\nIn 1791 at the request of the Six Nations, an initial survey was completed. It was agreed between Joseph Brant, Henry Tekarihoga, and other chiefs with the Nassau District land board that the middle of the grant should not follow the exact windings of the river, but that it should be drawn from an easterly bend near the river's mouth straight to the Mohawk village. Although the government alleges that the Six Nations agreed to the accuracy of the information gathered during the 1791 survey, the resulting documentation in the form of a map signed by the Land Board and the Six Nation chiefs was subsequently \"believed lost or destroyed\".\n\nThe Crown's position was that the extent of the land was as determined in the subsequent Thomas Ridout survey of 1821, drawing a northern boundary near the present location of Elora, Ontario, referred to at the time of the survey as \"The Falls\". In this survey, the size of the grant was described as As early as July 4, 1819, Six Nations chief John Brant (\"Tekarihoga\"), son of Joseph Brant, in a speech at a council held near present-day Hamilton, Ontario to deal with land issues, stated, \"We are surprised to find that [the] Government says that we own the Lands to the Falls only as we have the Writings to prove otherwise. We have them here and are ready to produce them.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "860010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=860010", "title": "In-group favoritism", "text": "In-group favoritism\n\nIn-group favoritism, sometimes known as in-group–out-group bias, in-group bias, or intergroup bias, is a pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.\n\nThis interaction has been researched by many psychologists and linked to many theories related to group conflict and prejudice. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a social psychology standpoint. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups. These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time, populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behaviour, increasing covariation. This then incentivises in-group bias.\n\nTwo prominent theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of in-group favoritism are realistic conflict theory and social identity theory. Realistic conflict theory proposes that intergroup competition, and sometimes intergroup conflict, arises when two groups have opposing claims to scarce resources. In contrast, social identity theory posits a psychological drive for positively distinct social identities as the general root cause of in-group favoring behavior.\n\nIn 1906, the sociologist William Sumner posited that humans are a species that join together in groups by their very nature. However, he also maintained that humans had an innate tendency to favor their own group over others, proclaiming how \"each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exists in its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders\" (p. 13). This is seen on the group level with ingroup–outgroup bias. When experienced in larger groups such as tribes, ethnic groups, or nations, it is referred to as ethnocentrism.\n\nRealistic conflict theory (or realistic group conflict) posits that competition between groups for resources is the cause of in-group bias and the corresponding negative treatment of members of the out-group. Muzafer Sherif's Robbers Cave Experiment is the most widely known demonstration of realistic conflict theory. In the experiment, 22 eleven-year-old boys with similar backgrounds were studied in a mock summer camp situation, with researchers posing as camp personnel.\n\nThe boys were divided into two equal groups and encouraged to bond, with the aim of fostering an in-group mentality. The researchers then introduced a series of competitive activities which pitted groups against each other for a valuable prize. Hostility and out-group negativity ensued. Lastly, researchers attempted to reverse the hostility by engaging the boys in situations of mutual interdependence, an effort which eventually resulted in relative harmony between the two groups.\n\nSherif concluded from this experiment that negative attitudes toward out-groups arises when groups compete for limited resources. However, he also theorised that inter-group frictions could be reduced and positive relations created, but only in the presence of an all-encompassing goal which could only be achieved with the two groups cooperation.\n\nAccording to social identity theory, one of the key determinants of group biases is the need to improve self-esteem. The desire to view one's self positively is transferred onto the group, creating a tendency to view one's own group in a positive light, and by comparison, outside groups in a negative light. That is, individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their own group is superior. This phenomenon was pioneered and studied most extensively by Henri Tajfel, a British social psychologist who looked at the psychological root of in-group/out-group bias. To study this in the lab, Tajfel and colleagues created what are now known as minimal groups (see minimal group paradigm), which occur when \"complete strangers are formed into groups using the most trivial criteria imaginable\". In Tajfel's studies, participants were split into groups by flipping a coin, and each group then was told to appreciate a certain style of painting none of the participants were familiar with when the experiment began. What Tajfel and his colleagues discovered was that—regardless of the facts that a) participants did not know each other, b) their groups were completely meaningless, and c) none of the participants had any inclination as to which \"style\" they like better—participants almost always \"liked the members of their own group better and they rated the members of their in-group as more likely to have pleasant personalities\". By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in-group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group.\n\nRobert Cialdini and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. They found that the Monday after a win, there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss.\n\nIn another set of studies, done in the 1980s by Jennifer Crocker and colleagues, self-esteem was studied using minimal group processes in which it was shown that individuals with high self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept exhibit greater ingroup biases than people with low self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept. While some studies have supported this notion of a negative correlation between self-esteem and in-group bias, other researchers have found that individuals with low self-esteem have a higher prejudice to both in-group and out-group members. Some studies have even shown that high-self-esteem groups showed a greater prejudice than did lower self-esteem groups. This research may suggest that there is an alternative explanation and additional reasoning as to the relationship between self-esteem and in-group/out-group biases. Alternatively, it is possible that researchers have used the wrong sort of self-esteem measures to test the link between self-esteem and in-group bias (global personal self-esteem rather than specific social self-esteem).\n\nIn a meta-analysis and review of the effect of oxytocin on social behavior done by Carsten De Dreu, the research reviewed shows that oxytocin enables the development of trust, specifically towards individuals with similar characteristics - categorised as 'in-group' members - promoting cooperation with and favoritism towards such individuals. This bias of oxytocin-induced goodwill towards those with features and characteristics perceived to be similar may have evolved as a biological basis for sustaining in-group cooperation and protection, fitting with the Darwinian insight that acts of self-sacrifice and cooperation contribute to the functioning of the group and hence improve the odd of survival for members of said group.\n\nRace can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and empathy found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression. This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races, with individuals of one race potentially biased towards helping individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain.\n\nOxytocin has also been implicated in lying when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of dishonesty in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected. Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit people with which one feels is part of their social group, or in-group.\n\nAs noted in two recent theoretical reviews, the theoretical basis for the inclusion of self-identity in the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior has many similarities to social identity theory and its extension, self-categorization theory. According to social identity theory, an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories. When people define and evaluate themselves in terms of a self-inclusive social category (e.g. a sex, class, team) two processes come into play : (1) categorization, which perceptually accentuates differences between in-group and out-group, and similarities among in-group members (including self) on stereotypical dimensions; and (2) self-enhancement which, because the self-concept is defined in terms of group membership, seeks behaviorally and perceptually to favor the in-group over the out-group. Social identities are cognitively represented as group prototypes that describe and prescribe beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors that optimize a balance between minimization of in-group differences and maximization of intergroup differences.\n\nMore specifically, according to social identity theory, there is a continuum between personal and social identity shifts along this continuum that determine the extent to which group-related or personal characteristics influence a person's feelings and actions. If a particular social identity is a salient basis for self-conception, then the self is assimilated to the perceived in-group prototype which can be thought of as a set of perceived in-group norms such that self-perception, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviours are defined in terms of the group prototype. Thus, social identities should influence behaviour through the mediating role of group norms. People will be more likely to engage in a particular behaviour if it is in accord with the norms of a behaviourally relevant group membership, particularly if the identity is a salient basis for self-definition. If the group membership is not salient, then people's behaviour and feelings should be in accord with their own personal and idiosyncratic characteristics rather than group norms.\n\nOn the other hand, the self-identity theory poses that the self is often a reflection of expected norms and practices in the role that the person places him/herself in. At the center of it is the proposition that the self is made up of multi-faceted and differentiated components that exist in an organized manner for the sake of filling in roles in society. People are able to create an identity for themselves only through talking to others, and often what roles they are taking on differ from one group to another. These differing roles and positions people fill are a result of their interactions with others and are called role identities. Role identities may be self-realized or facts like being a mother, a social worker, or a blood donor. Role identities lead people to act in certain ways due to assumed expectations for the roles. Because there is satisfaction in complying with expectations of the role, there is often distress behind an inability to appear congruent to one's identity as defined by societal norms. There is also an existing hierarchy of importance for roles that individuals take on, and according to the hierarchical standing of roles, people become more representative of roles that stand higher hierarchically, according to them.\n\nIdentity salience, the likelihood of role identities being invoked in different situations, is the result of role identities being placed hierarchically in different orders from person to person. People who hold the same roles may act differently because some roles are valued over others. For example, a working mother may have less time to spend with her child as opposed to a mother that doesn't work. Behaviors are reflective of the identities that are held higher hierarchically by people, so people act out in self-worth and self-meaning according to these hierarchies. Someone who holds the identity of being a psychologist higher than the identity of being a linguist will find that while he/she may become competitive when meeting another person that is better at psychology than he/she, he/she won't care when in contact with someone who is much better at being a linguist than he/she. In a similar way, social relationships are influenced by this salience. Self-identity often places individuals in social contexts and a commitment to the role within that context becomes a big part of perpetrating the idea of self. It also finds people relating more to others that hold similar role identities at the top of their hierarchies.\n\nBecause people have self-concepts that are derived from a role they define for themselves within the context of a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished. In an attempt to assimilate oneself according to the tendencies of a group, often people reconfigure their intragroup representations or identities. Certain prototypes form about these groups that reaffirm rules that members of the group are encouraged to follow. Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the majority views are perpetuated and others silenced. This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the majority views in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.\n\nStudies have shown that in-group favoritism arises endogenously, through the formation of cultural groups. Symbolic markers in certain conditions can result in trivial groupings developing into cultural groups. The formation of such cultural groups then results in a higher degree of in-group favoritism.\n\nEfferson, Lalive and Fehr published such a study in 2008, utilising a series of coordination games to mimic cooperation between individuals. The study found that cultural groups were able to form endogenously through creation of a linkage between a payoff-relevant behaviour and a payoff-irrelevant marker. Subsequently, in-group favouritism occurred in ensuing social interactions.\n\nParticipants were first divided into one of several populations of 10 people, and then further divided into subpopulations of 5. Each group had different payoff for coordinating on one of 2 choices, behaviour A or behaviour B. In group 1, participants were awarded 41 points for coordinating (choosing A themselves and choosing another participant who also chose A) on A and 21 for coordinating on B. The payoffs were switched in the 2nd group. In both groups participants were awarded just 1 point for mis-coordinating. During each turn participants were also allowed to choose a payoff-irrelevant marker (circle or triangle). Players from both subpopulations were mixed to create a coordination problem, and every turn, an unidentified player from each subpopulation would be randomly switched.\n\nThe experiment created a situation in which participants were strongly incentivised to develop a sense of expected behaviours in his or her subpopulation, but occasionally would find themselves in a totally new situation in which their behaviours were not in-line with social norms.\n\nThe results showed that players generally developed an inclination to pair behaviour with a marker, especially if it had resulted in a positive payoff. As linkages at an individual level increase, covariation (of marker and behaviour) at an aggregate level also increases. In the experiment, there was a significant increase in participants requesting for partners with the same-shape choice as it progressed, although the initial choice of shape had no effect on payoffs. Toward the end of the experiment, this number stood at a substantial 87%, indicating the presence of in-group favouritism.\n\nTheir study supported the thesis that the formation of cultural groups alters selective pressure facing individuals, and thus leads to certain behavioural traits being advantageous. Thus, if such selective pressures were present in past civilisations, where membership in a certain group is correlated with a certain behavioural norm, the emergence of in-group biases where it is beneficial to act in differing manners to members of the same group is certainly plausible.\n\n conducted research on gender bias that measured gender preferences without directly asking the participants. Subjects at Purdue and Rutgers participated in computerized tasks that measured automatic attitudes based on how quickly a person categorizes pleasant and unpleasant attributes with each gender. Such a task was done to discover whether people associate pleasant words (good, happy, and sunshine) with women, and unpleasant words (bad, trouble, and pain) with men.\n\nThis research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women's in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger than those of men and only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender.\n\nUsing a publics-goods game, Van Gugt, De Cremer, and P. Janssen (2016) found that men contributed more to their group in the face of outside competition from another group; there was no distinct difference amongst women's contributions.\n\nFershtman and Gneezy (2001) found that men showed in-group biases in a \"trust\" game based on ethnicity whereas this tendency was not present in women. The study aim to identify ethnic discrimination in Israeli Jewish society, and was conducted on 996 Israeli undergraduates. Groups were separated based on whether the participants name was typically ethnically Eastern or Ashkenazic. Similar to a dictator game, subjects were instructed to divide a sum of money (20 NIS) between themselves and another player. Player A was told that any money sent over to Player B would be tripled, and Player B would receive details of the experiment, including the name of Player A and the transferred sum. Subsequently, Player B would have a choice of whether to send any money back.\n\nThe experiment found that despite sharing similar average transfer values (10.63 for women and 11.42 for men), women did not display significant in-group biases when it came to recipients with either Ashkenazic or Eastern sounding names. However, a bias against Eastern sounding names was present amongst men.\n\nFurthermore, men showed more bias for Ashkenazic men compared to women, but the opposite was true for Eastern names. This result may seem counter-intuitive as participants appear to share more in common if they were both male, thus we would expect Eastern females to be more marginalised, but is actually consistent with other studies which studied discrimination against Afro-American women.\n\nFehr, Bernhard, and Rockenbach (2008), in a study conducted on children, found that boys displayed in-group favouritism from ages 3–8 whereas girls did not display such tendencies. The experiment involved usage of an \"envy game\", a modified version of the dictator game. A possible explanation posited by researchers relied on an evolutionary basis.\n\nThey theorised that parochialism and favouring members of the same group may have been particularly advantageous as it strengthened the individuals group position in intergroup conflicts. As males were the ones who were frequently at the forefront of such conflicts in the past, and thus bore the majority of the costs of conflicts in terms of injury or death, evolution may have favoured a greater sensitivity in males in situations which resulted in an advantageous payoff for their in-group. Thus males tended to show in-group biases from a younger age than females, as was evident in the experiment.\n\nA study conducted during the 2008 Presidential elections showcased how group identities were dynamic. The study carried out on 395 Democrats from Cambridge, MA, using an Economics dictator game. Subjects were given $6 to divide between themselves and another person. The recipients remained anonymous apart from which candidate they supported in the Democratic Primaries.\n\nData was collected in three separate periods. June 10 to 18th (after Hillary Clinton's concession speech on June 7); August 9 to 14th, before the Democratic National Convention on the 25th; and September 2 to 5th, in the buildup to the Presidential elections. The results showed that men displayed significant in-group favouritism from June all the way to the DNC in August. This in-group bias however was not present in September. Women displayed no significant in-group favouritism throughout.\n\nThe experiment showed how group identities were flexible and could change over time. Researchers theorised that in-group bias was strong in June as the competition to be the Democratic representative in the elections was still recent and thus salient. A lack of actual electoral conflict (against the Republicans) caused perception of salient groupings to remain throughout August. Only in September did the in-group favouritism subside as a superordinate goal shared between groups was now present.\n\nSocial psychologists have long made the distinction between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, where outgroup negativity is the act of punishing or placing burdens upon the outgroup. Indeed, a significant body of research exists that attempts to identify the relationship between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, as well as conditions that will lead to outgroup negativity. For example, Struch and Schwartz found support for the predictions of belief congruence theory. The belief congruence theory concerns itself with the degree of similarity in beliefs, attitudes, and values \"perceived\" to exist between individuals. This theory also states that dissimilarity increases negative orientations towards others. When applied to racial discrimination, the belief congruence theory argues that the perceived dissimilarity of beliefs has more of an impact on racial discrimination than does race itself.\n\nResearch finds evidence of in-group bias in police investigations and judicial decisions.\n\nOxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals. These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics.\n\nFurther, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners. People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin. It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in xenophobic tendencies secondary to this effect. Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific \"home\" country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.\n\nCross-cultural studies have found that in-group derogation, the tendency to criticize members of one's own group or culture more harshly than members of outside groups, is more common among members of disadvantaged and minority groups than among members of the majority or dominant group. According to psychology professor Christine Ma-Kellams et al. (2011), system justification theory seeks to explain why \"minorities sometimes endorse system-justifying views of their group\". They said their research into in-group favoritism and derogation partially supported this theory, but that the theory failed to address all of the nuances.\n\nMa-Kellams et al. also found that, compared to individualist cultures, people from collectivist cultures, such as East Asian cultures, tended to judge their own group members less favorably than they judged outsiders, whereas people from individualist cultures were inclined to judge members of their own group more favorably than they judged outsiders. Social identity theory and Freudian theorists explain in-group derogation as the result of a negative self-image, which they believe is then extended to the group. Ma-Kellams et al. theorized that \"ingroup derogation may be more culturally normative and less troubling for East Asians\" as evidenced by the fact that East Asians were also likely to report high levels of positive affect (emotion) towards members of their in-group, demonstrating ambivalence towards the unfavorable characteristics they had acknowledged about their in-group. According to Ma-Kellam et al., culturally-ingrained attitudes and beliefs, rather than low self-esteem, may play a role in collectivist cultures' in-group derogation due to their ability to tolerate holding seemingly contradictory views.\n"}

{"id": "203553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203553", "title": "Materia medica", "text": "Materia medica\n\nMateria medica () is a Latin term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing (i.e., medicines). The term derives from the title of a work by the Ancient Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides in the 1st century AD, \"De materia medica\", 'On medical material' (Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, \"Peri hylēs iatrikēs\", in Greek). The term \"materia medica\" was used from the period of the Roman Empire until the 20th century, but has now been generally replaced in medical education contexts by the term pharmacology. The term survives in the title of the \"British Medical Journal\"s \"Materia Non Medica\" column.\n\nThe earliest known writing about medicine was a 110-page Egyptian papyrus. It was supposedly written by the god Thoth in about 16 BC. The Ebers papyrus is an ancient recipe book dated to approximately 1552 BC. It contains a mixture of magic and medicine with invocations to banish disease and a catalogue of useful plants, minerals, magic amulets and spells. The most famous Egyptian physician was Imhotep, who lived in Memphis around 2500 B.C. Imhotep’s materia medica consisted of procedures for treating head and torso injuries, tending of wounds, and prevention and curing of infections, as well as advanced principles of hygiene.\n\nIn India, the Ayurveda is traditional medicine that emphasizes plant-based treatments, hygiene, and balance in the body’s state of being. Indian materia medica included knowledge of plants, where they grow in all season, methods for storage and shelf life of harvested materials. It also included directions for making juice from vegetables, dried powders from herb, cold infusions and extracts.\n\nThe earliest Chinese manual of materia medica, the \"Shennong Bencao Jing\" (\"Shennong Emperor's Classic of Materia Medica\"), was compiled in the 1st century AD during the Han dynasty, attributed to the mythical Shennong. It lists some 365 medicines, of which 252 are herbs. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by the \"Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments\" found in the Mawangdui tomb, which was sealed in 168 BC. Succeeding generations augmented the \"Shennong Bencao Jing\", as in the \"Yaoxing Lun\" (\"Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs\"), a 7th-century Tang Dynasty treatise on herbal medicine.\n\nIn Greece, Hippocrates (born 460 BC) was a philosopher later known as the Father of Medicine. He founded a school of medicine that focused on treating the causes of disease rather than its symptoms. Disease was dictated by natural laws and therefore could be treated through close observation of symptoms. His treatises, \"Aphorisms\" and \"Prognostics\", discuss 265 drugs, the importance of diet and external treatments for diseases.\n\nTheophrastus (390–280 BC) was a disciple of Aristotle and a philosopher of natural history, considered by historians as the Father of Botany. He wrote a treatise entitled \"Historia Plantarium\" about 300 B.C. It was the first attempt to organize and classify plants, plant lore, and botanical morphology in Greece. It provided physicians with a rough taxonomy of plants and details of medicinal herbs and herbal concoctions.\n\nGalen was a philosopher, physician, pharmacist and prolific medical writer. He compiled an extensive record of the medical knowledge of his day and added his own observations. He wrote on the structure of organs, but not their uses; the pulse and its association with respiration; the arteries and the movement of blood; and the uses of theriacs. \"In treatises such as \"On Theriac to Piso\", \"On Theriac to Pamphilius\", and \"On Antidotes\", Galen identified theriac as a sixty-four-ingredient compound, able to cure any ill known\". His work was rediscovered in the 15th century and became the authority on medicine and healing for the next two centuries. His medicine was based on the regulation of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) and their properties (wet, dry, hot, and cold).\n\nThe Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides, of Anazarbus in Asia Minor, wrote a five-volume treatise concerning medical matters, entitled Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς in Greek or \"De Materia Medica\" in Latin. This famous commentary covered about 600 plants along with therapeutically useful animal and mineral products. It documented the effects of drugs made from these substances on patients. \"De Materia Medica\" was the first extensive pharmacopeia, including about a thousand natural product drugs (mostly plant-based), 4,740 medicinal usages for drugs, and 360 medical properties (such as antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, stimulant). The book was heavily translated, and portrayed some of the emblematic actions of physicians and herbalists. One such page is \"Physician Preparing an Elixir\".\n\nDioscorides' plant descriptions use an elementary classification, though he cannot be said to have used botanical taxonomy. Book one describes the uses for aromatic oils, salves and ointments, trees and shrubs, and fleshy fruits, even if not aromatic. Book two included uses for animals, parts of animals, animal products, cereals, leguminous, malvaceous, cruciferous, and other garden herbs. Book three detailed the properties of roots, juices, herbs and seeds used for food or medicine. Book four continued to describe the uses for roots and herbs, specifically narcotic and poisonous medicinal plants. Book five dealt with the medicinal uses for wine and metallic ores. It is a precursor to all modern pharmacopeias, and is considered one of the most influential herbal books in history. It remained in use until about 1600 AD.\n\nThe experimental scientific method was introduced into the field of materia medica in the thirteenth century by the Andalusian-Arab botanist Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, the teacher of Ibn al-Baitar. Al-Nabati introduced empirical techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, and he separated unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the science of pharmacology. Avicenna (980–1037 AD) was a Persian philosopher, physician, and Islamic scholar. He wrote about 40 books on medicine. His two most famous books are \"The Canon of Medicine\" and \"The Book of Healing\", used in medieval universities as medical textbooks. He did much to popularize the connection between Greek and Arabic medicine, translating works by Hippocrates, Aristotle and Galen into Arabic. Avicenna stressed the importance of diet, exercise, and hygiene. He also was the first to describe parasitic infection, to use urine for diagnostic purposes and discouraged physicians from the practice of surgery because it was too base and manual.\n\nIn medieval Europe, medicinal herbs and plants were cultivated in monastery and nunnery gardens beginning about the 8th century. Charlemagne gave orders for the collection of medicinal plants to be grown systematically in his royal garden. This royal garden was an important precedent for botanical gardens and physic gardens that were established in the 16th century. It was also the beginning of the study of botany as a separate discipline. In about the 12th century, medicine and pharmacy began to be taught in universities.\n\nShabbethai Ben Abraham, better known as Shabbethai Donnolo, (913–\"c\".982) was a 10th-century Italian Jew and the author of an early Hebrew text, \"Antidotarium\". It consisted of detailed drug descriptions, medicinal remedies, practical methods for preparing medicine from roots. It was a veritable glossary of herbs and drugs used during the medieval period. Donnollo was widely travelled and collected information from Arabic, Greek and Roman sources.\n\nIn the Dark and Middle Ages Nestorian Christians were banished for their heretical views that they carried to Asia Minor. The Greek text was translated into Syriac when pagan Greek scholars fled east after Constantine’s conquest of Byzantium,\nStephanos (son of Basilios, a Christian living in Baghdad under the Khalif Motawakki) made an Arabic translation of \"De Materia Medica\" from the Greek in 854. In 948 the Byzantine Emperor Romanus II, son and co-regent of Constantine Porphyrogenitos, sent a beautifully illustrated Greek manuscript of \"De Materia Medica\" to the Spanish Khalif, Abd-Arrahman III. In 1250, Syriac scholar Bar Hebraeus prepared an illustrated Syriac version, which was translated into Arabic.\n\nMatthaeus Silvaticus, Avicenna, Galen, Dioscorides, Platearius and Serapio inspired the appearance of three main works printed in Mainz: In 1484 the \"Herbarius\", the following year the \"Gart der Gesundheit\", and in 1491 the \"Ortus Sanistatus\". The works contain 16, 242 and 570 references to Dioscorides, respectively.\n\nThe first appearance of Dioscorides as a printed book was a Latin translation printed at Colle, Italy by Johanemm Allemanun de Mdemblik in 1478. The Greek version appeared in 1499 by Manutius at Venice.\n\nThe most useful books of botany, pharmacy and medicine used by students and scholars were supplemented commentaries on Dioscorides, including the works of Fuchs, Anguillara, Mattioli, Maranta, Cesalpino, Dodoens, Fabius Columna, Gaspard and Johann Bauhin, and De Villanueva/Servetus. In several of these versions, the annotations and comments exceed the Dioscoridean text and have much new botany. Printers were not merely printing the authentic materia medica, but hiring experts on the medical and botanical field for criticism, commentaries, that would raise the stature of the printers and the work.\n\nMost of these authors copied each other, from previous works. It was normal to add previous commentaries and marginalia, to make the text look more enriched or thorough.\n\nThere were several De Materia Medica works noted as \"Anonymous A, B, C and D\" by the expert on Dioscorides-De Materia Medica professor John M. Riddle. The \"Anonymous A\" has to do with authors on translations of handwritting. Riddle proved \"Anonymous C\" to be Bruyerinus Champier.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the most representative among them were Ermolao Barbaro, Jean Ruel, Broyeurinus, Michel de Villeneuva, Pietro Andrea Mattioli, Andres Laguna, Marcello Virgilio, Martin Mathee and Valerius Cordus.\n\nThe work of the Italian physician and humanist Ermolao Barbaro was published in 1516, 23 years after his death. Poliziano wrote to Ermalao Barbaro, forwarding a manuscript of the 1st-century pharmacologist Pedanius Dioscorides, asking him to send it back “annotated by that very learned hand of yours, thus lending the volume additional value and authority.\" Barbaro was professor of the University of Padua in 1477 and translated many texts from Greek to Latin.\nHe sought to avoid mistakes by gathering as many manuscripts as he could for checking the texts. He claimed to have corrected 5000 mistakes between two editions of Pliny the Elder's \"Naturalis historia\", a work he found very similar to \"Materia Medica\", for which he used at least two editions as well.\n\nThe result of Barbaro's effort occupied no fewer than 58 pages printed in three columns of about 50 entries each. The work provides a key to over 9,000 items; all references were to pages. This was the first annotated Latin translation of Dioscorides' \"Materia Medica\", and so Barbaro became the earliest of the Renaissance translators of Dioscorides, a practice that saw its golden age in the 16th century. Barbaro's work was later corrected by Giovanni-Battista.\n\nJean Ruel was the dean of the Faculty of Medicine and physician to King Francis I of France. He perfected the Latin translation of the \"Materia Medica\" directly from the \"princeps\" edition. He tried to develop a translation joining philology, botany and medicine. This work, printed in 1516 by Henri Estienne/Stephano, became very popular, having 20 editions during the 16th century. He published editions until 1537, printed by Simon de Colines.\n\nFrom this point, Latin was the preferred language for presenting De Materia Medica, and Ruel's editions became the basis from which many other important authors would start to create their own Materia Medica. Ruel was also teacher of two great De Materia Medica authors: Michel de Villeneuve and Andres Laguna.\n\nBruyerinus Champier was the nephew of Symphorien Champier, and physician of Henry II of France. He was an Arabist, and translated works of Avicena. In 1550 he published his first Materia Medica, printed by Balthazar Arnoullet in Lyons. This work had a second edition in 1552 printed by Arnoullet in Lyon and Vienne. Both works were illustrated with figures by Fuchs, but in this last edition there were also 30 woodcuts by the botanist and physician Jacob Dalechamp. It seems that the reason that he used his initials, H.B.P., and not his full name in the work; it could be that he practically transcribed commentaries of Mattioli.\n\nAccording to Spanish scholar González Echeverría in several communications in the ISHM, the John M. Riddle \"Anonymous B\" (De Materia Medica of 1543) would be Michael Servetus, and that the \"Anonymous D\" (De Materia Medica of 1554 of Mattioli plus non-signed commentaries) is two commentarians, Servetus and Mattioi, being the last one hired for editing the \"Lyons printers' Tribute to Michel de Villeneuve\" edition.\nMichael Servetus, using the name \"Michel de Villeneuve\", who already had his first death sentence from the University of Paris, anonymously published a Dioscorides-De Materia Medica in 1543, printed by Jean & Francois Frellon in Lyon. It has 277 marginalia and 20 commentaries on a De Materia Medica of Jean Ruel. According to Gonzalez Echeverría, to be associated to an anonymous Pharmacopeia that \"Michel de Villeneuve\" published the same year, meant to be a single unit, which is typical when it comes to De Materia Medica-Pharmacopeia. This work had six later editions, in 1546 and 1547 by Jean Frellon, who considered Michael de Villeneuve \"his friend and brother\", another in 1547 by Thibaut Payen, etc.\n\nThere is another Materia Medica with commentaries on a Ruel edition of 1537, printed by Simon de Colines. This work contains hundreds of manuscript marginaia, all along 420 out of 480 pages. The scholar Gonzalez Echeverria demonstrated in the ISHM with a graphological, historical and linguistic study that this task was carried out by Michel de Villeneuve. It also demonstrated that this document was written by the same hand that wrote the famous \"Manuscript of Paris\", a work also by Michel de Villeneuve, consisting of a draft for his Christianismo Restitutio. “The manuscript of the Complutense” is not just a union of the ideas of the previous works by Michel de Villeneuve, Syropum Ratio, etc., but also of the later works, Enquiridion, De Materia Medica of 1543, sharing with this last many of its 20 big commentaries, for instance.\n\nAccording to this theory, in 1554, after the immolation of Michael de Villeneuve/Servetus, the editors and printers that had worked with him would have decided to make a new De Materia Medica as a tribute to their colleague and friend. All the commentaries that could identify Michel de Villeneuve as the author disappeared, but the rest are copied from his work of 1543. It is a very strange edition because there exist four different kinds of copies with different covers, one per editor: Jean Frellon, Guillaume Rouillé, Antoine Vicent and Balthazar Arnoullet, who was also the printer of this unique edition, in Lyons. For developing a bigger work and to blur the mark of Michel de Villeneuve, they hired the expert on De Materia Medica, Pietro Andrea Mattioli.\n\nPietro Andrea Mattioli was a renowned botanist and physician. He published a translation of De Materia Medica into Italian in 1544 and ten years later published a work in Latin with all the plants of Dioscorides and 562 woodcut illustrations. It appeared in 1554, printed by Vicenzo Valgrisi, in Venice. Mattioli made a massive contribution to the original text of Pedani's Dioscorides. In some sections Mattioli added information that exceeded 15 times the length of the original text. It resulted in a very big extension of the work, in beauty and information. It was later translated into German, French and Bohemian.\n\nMattioli held a post in the Imperial Court as physician to Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, and the Emperor Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. This position granted him an immense influence. He frequently tested the effects of poisonous plants on prisoners in order to popularize his works. He also affirmed that Jean Ruel had declared some information in the licopsis chapter of his Materia Medica. This is false, but still Mattioli used it as a reason for attacking Ruel. He did not tolerate either rivals nor corrections. The naturalists and physicians daring to disagree with him, or who had corrected him, were attacked. The list of important characters that were admonished, rebuked, or pursued by the Inquisition contains Wieland, Anguillara, Gesner, Lusitanus and others. This made editions of Matioli's De Materia Medica omnipresent throughout the continent, especially in northern Europe.\n\nIn 1554 the physician Andres Laguna published his Annotations on Dioscorides of Anazarbus printed by Guillaume Rouillé in Lyons. Laguna was the first to translate De Materia Medica into Castilian. His translation was made from one of the Latin editions of Jean Ruel. It was also based on classes Laguna took from Ruel as his pupil in Paris. Laguna points out some of his teacher's erroneous translations, and adds many commentaries, which make up more than half of the total work.\n\nLaguna explored many Mediterranean areas and obtained results concerning many new herbs; he also added these prescriptions and commentaries to the recipes and teachings of Pedanius' Dioscorides. He also includes some animal and mineral products but only those related to simple medicines, that is, animal and mineral products that are medicine or are parts of a medical compound. This was not an illustrated work. In 1555 he re-edited this work with woodcuts.\nIt was reprinted twenty-two times by the end of the 18th century; Laguna wrote very well, with explanations and practical commentaries. He refers to anecdotes, adds commentaries on the plants, provides their synonyms in different languages, and explains their uses in the 16th century. These qualities and the number of woodcuts made this work very popular and appreciated in medicine far beyond the 16th century. He had problems with Mattioli for using some of his commentaries without mentioning him.\n\nLaguna had problems with the Inquisition, just like Michel de Villeneuve, for both were jewish-converso, a fact that could have made them limit their commentaries to avoid risks. Nevertheless, he was the physician of Charles V and the Pope Julius III, and that helped to establish his work as the last word in Materia Medica, and as the basis of Spanish botany.\n\nThe physician Valerius Cordus, son of the famous botanist Euricius Cordus, went through many woods and mountains discovering hundreds of new herbs. He gave lectures on Dioscorides at the University of Wittenberg, which experts from the University attended. Cordus had no intention of publishing his work. Five years after his death, a Materia Medica with commentaries was published. It contained the index of the \"Botanologicon\", the outstanding work of his father Euricius, who developed a scientific classification of the plants. The following pages are on Gesner's Nomenclature, relating the different synonyms used for referring to the same plants of the Dioscorides work.\n\nThe abstracts of the lectures of Valerius Cordus go from page 449 to 553 as commentaries. This section consisted of a very refined explanation of Dioscorides' teachings with more specifics on the variety of plants and habitats, and corrections of errors. Cordus refers to both his and his father's observations. Eucharius Rösslin's herbal illustrations are prominent in this work, followed by 200 of Fuchs. This work and the model of botanical description and, many consider it the boldest innovation that was made by any botanist of the 16th century.\n\nThe French physician Martin Mathee published in 1553 the French translation of De Materia Medica, printed by Balthazar Arnoullet, in Lyons. This granted much more access for the students of medicine to the teachings.\n\nThe Greek version was reprinted in 1518, 1523 and 1529, and reprinted in 1518, 1523 and 1529. Between 1555 and 1752 there were at least 12 Spanish editions; and as many in Italian from 1542. French editions appeared from 1553; and German editions from 1546.\n\nThe ancient phrase survives in modified form in the \"British Medical Journal\"s long-established \"Materia Non Medica\" column, the title indicating non-medical material that doctors wished to report from their travels and other experiences. For example, in June 1977, the journal contained \"Materia Non Medica\" reports on an exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery by a London physician, the making of matches by hand in an Indian village by a missionary general practitioner, and a cruise to Jamaica by a University of the West Indies lecturer in medicine.\n\n\n"}

Letters\" were a pair of anonymous letters (dated 28 January and 7 February 1834) which were meant to incite the people of Texas to insurrection against Mexico. The grounds for insurrection were the arrest and imprisonment of Stephen F. Austin. The letters received their name because both were signed \"O. P. Q.\"\n\nAlthough the letters were anonymous, their source is known: both were written by Anthony Butler, who was at the time the American minister to Mexico.\n\nButler was attempting to effect the purchase of Texas by the United States, and felt that rebellion might persuade Mexico to sell. The first of the two, addressed to \"Don B.T.A\", was sent to Branch Tanner Archer; whether or not the second was meant for the same address is unknown. They characterized the arrest of Austin as cowardly, and claimed it was done by \"an ignorant, fanatical and arrogant race.\" In addition, the forthcoming inspection trip to be made by Colonel Juan Altamonte was called no more than a cynical attempt to please white Texan settlers.\n\nBoth letters soon were copied, and these copies were given to Colonel Altamonte in the summer of 1834, during his trip. Both the originals and these copies have since been lost. For his part, Altamonte forwarded translations of the letters to the Mexican government.\n\nTheir tone and the worsening of Texas politics notwithstanding, apparently the letters had little effect. Many leading colonists distrusted Butler; furthermore, Austin had himself written letters urging the settlers to remain calm. Altamonte was initially skeptical of the possibility that Butler had been involved in sending the letters; once he was convinced, he began suspecting the United States government as well. Consequently, in July the colonel wrote a letter to the secretary of foreign relations in Mexico City recommending that Butler's recall be requested. But the Mexican authorities did nothing, and Butler was not recalled until the following year, and then only because President Andrew Jackson was displeased with his work.\n"}

The building was originally built for the Tao Nan School to serve the local Hokkien community, but the school has since been relocated to its current location in Marine Parade. The building was then used as a wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum, and now houses the Peranakan Museum. It was gazetted as a national monument on 27 February 1998.\n\nTao Nan School was set up by the Singapore Hokkien Association (Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan) on 18 November 1906 to provide modern education for Hokkien Chinese children. It was the first Chinese school in Singapore to adopt modern subjects in its syllabus such as such as geography, history and physical education, in addition to traditional Chinese subjects such as Confucian classics that would help promote and preserve Chinese culture and values. Although it was originally set up to serve the Hokkien community, it began to accept speakers of other Chinese dialects in 1909, the first Chinese school to operate such inclusive policy. Lessons were initially conducted in Hokkien with some Mandarin classes, but English lessons were also introduced in 1914. In 1916, the school became the first Chinese school in Singapore switched its medium of education from Hokkien to Mandarin.\n\nThe idea for the school was first mooted by Tan Boo Liat, and it gained the support of the Hokkien community. Funds for the school were raised, and the Siam House on North Bridge Road was chosen as the premise for the school. The Singapore Hokkien Association also provided an annual subsity for the school. The school was initially named Tao Nan Study Hall (道南學堂, \"Daonan Xuetang\"), the name Tao Nan being short for \"wu dao qi nan\" (吾道其南), meaning 'My code of behaviour is promulgated in Southeast Asia'. It had 90 students in its first year. As the number of pupils grew, Tan Kah Kee proposed that a new building be constructed, and $40,000 was raised by the Hokkien community for the building fund, to which Tan contributed $2,000. The sugar tycoon \"Majoor\" Oei Tiong Ham also gave $10,000 for the purchase of the land on Armenian Street on which Tao Nan School was built. Construction began 1910, and the school relocated to the new school building when it was completed in 1912. The school was then renamed Tao Nan School (Daonan Xuexiao).\n\nTan Kah Kee served for 12 years as the school's president. When the school switched to Mandarin as the medium of instruction, the Mandarin syllabus was implemented by its first non-Hokkien principal, Xiong Shangfu, a native of Hunan province.\n\nThe school was closed during the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945 when the Japanese took over the school and said to have used it as a military headquarters. After the war, the student population increased rapidly and classes were held in two separate sessions. In 1958, the school then became a government-aided school and also began to emphasize Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English languages in its syllabus in the 1950s and 60s. However, the school's population had declined by the mid-1970s as families moved out of the city center to the newly established housing estates in the suburbs, and in 1976, it was decided that the school should be re-located to Marine Parade to cater for the suburban population there. In 1982, Tao Nan School moved to its new campus in Marine Parade, where it remains today. Also in 1982, English became its main medium of instruction. Throughout its history, the school has produced many prominent Chinese leaders among its alumni, among them Lee Kong Chian.\n\nThe school was refurbished and became a wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum in 1994, and was officially opened on 21 April 1997. The Old Tao Nan School building was gazetted as a national monument on 27 February 1998. When the Asian Civilisations Museum was established in Empress Place Building in 2006 after its renovation, the Old Tao Nan School was repurposed as the Peranakan Museum which opened on 25 April 2008.\n\nThe Old Tao Nan School building was designed by the Municipal Engineer's Office of Singapore in an eclectic classical style with elements of the French Renaissance. The front facade features Corinthian fluted pilasters, with large wide verandahs designed to accommodate the tropical climate of Singapore. It also has large windows and high ceilings for better ventilation in a hot climate. A pair of black cast-iron eagles, said to ward off evil, guard the entrance to the school.\n\nThe building is three-storey high, with a square central atrium topped with a skylight. The classrooms, now converted into galleries, were located on all three floors, and can be accessed via symmetrical staircases on either side of the atrium leading up to the corridors on the upper floors.\n\nToday, the Old Tao Nan School building houses the Peranakan Museum which was opened in April 2008 by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The Museum explores the main themes of Peranakan life in ten permanent galleries. Displays include the twelve-day Peranakan wedding and the role of the Nyonyas (female Peranakans).\n\n\n"}

Regarded as one of the premier workers of his era, O'Connor held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship and NWA World Heavyweight Championship simultaneously, the latter of which he held for approximately two years. He was also the inaugural AWA World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nPatrick John O'Connor was born on 22 August 1924 in Raetihi, New Zealand, to parents John Frederick and Isabella. While he attended high school at Feilding Agricultural High School, he also helped tend to the sheep and cattle on his parents' farm. He later attended Massey Agricultural College, and later served for six months in the New Zealand Royal Air Force in 1945.\n\nBefore entering the world of professional wrestling, O'Connor was an amateur wrestler. He trained under Dave Sparrow, and later Don Anderson, while working as a blacksmith to pay the bills. After a tournament in 1947, he joined the Wellington wrestling team and trained under Anton Koolmann. In 1948, he represented New Zealand in the Pan American games. O'Connor won the New Zealand Heavyweight Championship in amateur wrestling in both 1949 and 1950. The 1949 win earned him entry into the 1950 British Empire Games. At the Empire Games, O'Connor, once again representing New Zealand, won a silver medal winner in the (freestyle) heavyweight division. He later trained to be a professional wrestler under Len Levy.\n\nOn 19 March 1955, O'Connor won the NWA World Tag Team Championship (Chicago version) with tag team partner Roy McClarity, and they held the title until February 1956. Later in the year, he worked for Maple Leaf Wrestling. In March, he won the NWA British Empire Heavyweight Championship (Toronto version), but lost it on 2 May 1957 to Gene Kiniski. That same month, O'Connor and Whipper Billy Watson won the NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship, but lost it to Gene Kiniski and Fritz Von Erich on 31 October of that year.\n\nO'Connor held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from 1959 to 1961. He first won the title on 9 January 1959 from Dick Hutton, who had held the title for thirteen months. O'Connor's reign was recognized by both the National Wrestling Alliance and the National Wrestling Association. The title change was part of the rivalry between bookers Sam Muchnick and Fred Kohler, the latter of whom did not want to waste any money announcing O'Connor as the new champion. Kohler also wanted O'Connor to pay him $10,000 to wrestle at shows in Chicago, while being paid less than champions usually earned. O'Connor was so angry at the suggestion that he walked out of their meeting and later told Muchnick not to book him for events in Chicago. The men later worked out a deal of sorts, and on 19 February 1960, O'Connor wrestled in Chicago against Bruno Sammartino and Johnny Valentine, among others.\n\nOn 29 July at one of Fred Kohler's events, O'Connor defeated Yukon Eric at an event with an attendance of 30,275. During this time, television also became a factor in the burgeoning market for professional wrestling, and as a result, the demand to trade wrestlers, including O'Connor, throughout the territories, was eased due to Vincent McMahon's Capitol Wrestling. In December, he worked for McMahon in the Northeast. In March 1961, he was suspended for sixteen days when he missed a match in New York. On 30 June 1961, O'Connor dropped the title to Buddy Rogers in front of 38,622 fans at Comiskey Park, a North American professional wrestling attendance record that lasted until Toronto's The Big Event in 1986. The ticket sells of $148,000 was a professional wrestling record for almost twenty years. The match, a two out of three falls match, was billed as the \"Match of the Century\". During the match, both men had gained a pinfall, when O'Connor missed a dropkick and suffered a legit groin injury on the ropes, after which Rogers pinned him to win the match.\n\nIn May 1960, while still the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the American Wrestling Association (AWA) named O'Connor as the first holder of the AWA World Heavyweight Championship when they seceded from the NWA. Therefore, he held both the AWA and NWA World Heavyweight Championships simultaneously. However, he never defended the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, and was stripped of it in August, after ninety days, when Verne Gagne was recognized as the new champion.\n\nOn 10 November 1967, the team of O'Connor and Wilbur Snyder defeated Larry Hennig and Harley Race to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship. They lost the title on 2 December to Mitsu Arakawa and Dr. Moto. O'Connor and Snyder also defeated Arakawa and Moto for the World Wrestling Association's WWA World Tag Team Championship on 24 September 1968. They lost the title on 26 October to the same team.\n\nOn 13 October 1970, O'Connor was introduced as Jim Crockett Promotions's first NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Champion as part of a storyline to introduce the title. The title was later awarded to the Missouri Mauler with the announcement that Mauler won it in New York.\n\nOn 1 January 1982, O'Connor was part of the card that comprised promoter Sam Muchnick's last professional wrestling show, located in St. Louis. O'Connor was also one of the owners of the St. Louis Wrestling Club. O'Connor, along with Verne Gagne, Harley Race, and Bob Geigel purchased the territory from Sam Muchnick the day after Muchnick's retirement. On 18 September 1963, O'Connor was named as a co-conspirator in the monopoly that controlled professional wrestling in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa. O'Connor filed a counterclaim.\n\nOn 16 November 1987, O'Connor participated in a World Wrestling Federation \"old-timers\" battle royal, which was won by Lou Thesz.\n\nO'Connor died of cancer on 16 August 1990. \n\nIn December 1990, World Championship Wrestling held the Pat O'Connor Memorial International Cup Tag Team Tournament, an eight-team international tag team memorial tournament at Starrcade in honor of O'Connor. In 1996, he was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. In 2007, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted O'Connor. He is also a member of the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2016, O'Connor became a \"Legacy\" member of the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27155", "title": "Svenska Akademiens ordlista", "text": "Svenska Akademiens ordlista\n\nSvenska Akademiens ordlista (), abbreviated SAOL, is a glossary published every few years by the Swedish Academy. It is a single volume that is considered the final arbiter of Swedish spelling. Traditionally it carries the motto of the Swedish Academy, \"Snille och Smak\" (\"Talent and Taste\"), on its blue cloth cover.\n\nWhenever a new edition comes out lively discussions about new and changed entries erupt around the country. In some instances the Academy has been ahead of its times and has later had to change entries back to older spellings. \"Jos\" – \"juice\" is probably the most well-known instance. In 2015, the fourteenth edition (containing entries) was published.\n\nThe history of SAOL is the history of orthography of the Swedish language. While Swedish spelling was an entirely personal business in the Catholic Middle Ages, its gradual standardization (known as Modern Swedish) started in 1526 with the translation of the New testament of the Bible (\"Gustav Vasa Bible\"), as part of the Lutheran reformation. The edition was revised in 1703, known as the Swedish Bible of Carolus XII. The Swedish Academy was founded in 1786 with the task of caring for Swedish literature and language, including the publication of a grand dictionary. Spelling evolved slowly in the 18th century and was largely based on etymology: for instance, because of its historic relationship to English \"heart\" and German \"Herz\", \"hjärta\" was spelled \"hjerta\" in Swedish even though it's pronounced ; the word for \"woman\" (now \"kvinna\") was spelled \"qvinna\", similar to English \"queen\"; the question words \"hvad\", \"hvar\", \"hvilken\" had a silent H, like English \"what\", \"where\", \"which\" still have in most accents. In 1801 the Academy published an official orthography (Carl Gustaf af Leopold, \"Afhandling om svenska stafsättet\", 266 pages). A shorter version for schools was published by Carl Jonas Love Almqvist, \"Svensk Rättstafnings-Lära\" in 1829.\n\nAlready in the 1750s, voices had been raised to adopt spelling to pronunciation, but this didn't resonate with the conservatively minded Academy. Public schools were made mandatory in Sweden by law in 1842 and the influence of school teachers increased, as did the pressure to reform Swedish spelling. The most radical reformists wanted to do away with all silent letters and change the remaining ones to a smaller subset of the alphabet. A similar reform movement for Danish, which at this time was the written language also in Norway, was led by Rasmus Rask (1787–1832) and his follower Niels Matthias Petersen (1791–1862). In 1869 a pan-Scandinavian orthography congress (\"Nordiska rättstavningsmötet\") gathered in Stockholm. Secretary for the Swedish section was Artur Hazelius, who in 1871 published the proceedings of the conference. The Academy was not pleased, and as a countermeasure Johan Erik Rydqvist (1800–1877) published the first edition of SAOL in 1874, based on the orthography in Leopold's work of 1801. A second edition followed in the same year and new ones in 1875, 1880 and the 5th edition in 1883, without much change.\n\nTo further reform, a Swedish orthographic society (\"Svenska rättstavningssällskapet\") was formed on November 28, 1885, chaired by linguist Adolf Noreen (1854–1925), and published a journal \"Nystavaren. Tidskrift för rättskrivningsfrågor\" (4 volumes, 1886–1898, edited by Otto Hoppe). There was continued opposition, not least from Academy member Esaias Tegnér Jr. (1843–1928). However, many of the proposed changes, albeit far from all, were introduced in the 6th edition of SAOL in 1889. Many words spelled with E were changed to Ä (\"elf\" → \"älf\", \"hjerta\" → \"hjärta\", \"jern\" → \"järn\"), and under Q it was stated that Q may at will be replaced with K. By a government resolution on November 16, 1889, the spelling used in this edition of SAOL was to be used for teaching in Swedish high schools (\"allmänna läroverk\") and teacher colleges (\"seminarier\"). This was a direct blow against the society's own dictionary published in 1886, and reform movement lost much of its momentum. In the 7th edition of SAOL in 1900, many of the old optional forms with Q were dropped.\n\nIn 1898, school teachers started to sign mass petitions for further reform. In 1903, the association of Swedish public school teachers (\"Sveriges allmänna folkskollärarförening\") requested a government ruling that it \"would no longer be considered wrong\" (\"ej måtte betraktas som fel\") to write TT instead of DT and V instead of F, FV and HV. More associations joined this petition in 1905. A government proposal to this effect was signed on April 7, 1906, by education minister Fridtjuv Berg (1851–1916), and put before the parliament of 1907. A protest against the reform signed by 40,000 concerned citizens was handed to the government in 1908, but had no effect. The liberal Fridtjuv Berg was a former school teacher and one of the founding members of the orthographic society.\n\nThe reform of 1906 was the most radical in the history of Swedish orthography. Spelling with dt, fv and hv is now commonly known as \"old spelling\" (\"gammalstavning\"). The new spelling was adopted in schools starting in 1907. It was used from the first edition of Selma Lagerlöf's geography textbook \"Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige\" (1906, \"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\"). The proceedings of the Swedish parliament adopted the new spelling from the year 1913. After endless discussions through the 19th century, a new Swedish Bible translation was finally adopted in 1917, using the new spelling. Sweden's largest printed encyclopedia of all times, the 2nd edition of \"Nordisk familjebok\" was started in 1904 and used the old spelling through all 38 volumes until 1926. The Academy introduced the new spelling in the 8th edition of SAOL in 1923. The 9th edition appeared in 1950.\n\nIn the 10th edition in 1973, the Academy tried to launch new alternative spellings such as \"jos\" (\"juice\"), without attracting any significant number of followers. The 11th edition of SAOL appeared in 1986 and the 12th edition in 1998. While the letter Q in the 8th edition only listed the letter Q itself, the 11th edition also listed \"quantum satis\", \"quenell\", \"quilt\" and \"quisling\".\n\nFrom the beginning of times, W had in Swedish been considered as a mere decoration of V. In Swedish typography, blackletter (\"fraktur\") used W where antiqua used V. With orthographic standardization and spelling reform, W was abandoned except for some proper names and a few loan words such as \"whisky\", \"wobbler\" (also spelled \"visky\" and \"vobbler\"), \"whist\" and \"wienerbröd\". In Swedish dictionaries and telephone books, V and W have been sorted as one letter. In the 13th edition of SAOL in 2006, the Academy broke with this tradition, listing W as a letter of its own. This change was sparked by a new influx of loan words such as \"webb\" (\"World Wide Web\").\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2127650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2127650", "title": "Tabula Peutingeriana", "text": "Tabula Peutingeriana\n\nThe map is a 13th-century parchment copy of a possible Roman original. It covers Europe (without the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles), North Africa, and parts of Asia, including the Middle East, Persia, and India. According to one hypothesis, the existing map is based on a document of the 4th or 5th century that contained a copy of the world map originally prepared by Agrippa during the reign of the emperor Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). However, Emily Albu has suggested that the existing map could instead be based on an original from the Carolingian period.\n\nNamed after the 16th-century German antiquarian Konrad Peutinger, the map is now conserved at the Austrian National Library in Vienna.\n\nThe \"Tabula\" is thought to be a distant descendant of the map prepared under the direction of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a Roman general, architect, and friend of emperor Augustus. After Agrippa's death in 12 BC, that map was engraved in marble and put on display in the \"Porticus Vipsania\" in the \"Campus Agrippae\" area in Rome, close to the \"Ara Pacis\" building. \n\nThe early imperial dating for the archetype of the map is supported by American historian Glen Bowersock, and is based on numerous details of Roman Arabia that look entirely anachronistic for a 4th-century map. Bowersock concluded that the original source is likely the map made by Vipsanius Agrippa. This dating is also consistent with the map's inclusion of the Roman town of Pompeii near modern-day Naples, which was never rebuilt after it had been destroyed in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.\n\nThe original Roman map, of which this may be the only surviving copy, was last revised in the 4th or early 5th century. It shows the city of Constantinople, founded in 328, and the prominence of Ravenna, seat of the Western Roman Empire from 402 to 476, which suggests a fifth-century revision according to Levi and Levi. The presence of certain cities of Germania Inferior that were destroyed in the mid-fifth century also provides a \"terminus ante quem\", i.e. the map's latest creation date, though Emily Albu suggests that this information could have been preserved in textual, not cartographic, form.\n\nThe \"Tabula Peutingeriana\" is thought to be the only known surviving map of the Roman \"cursus publicus\", the state-run road network. The surviving map itself was created by a monk in Colmar in modern-day eastern France in 1265. It is a parchment scroll, high and long, assembled from eleven sections, a medieval reproduction of the original scroll.\nIt is a very schematic map, designed to give a practical overview of the road network, as opposed to an accurate representation of geographic features: the land masses shown are distorted, especially in the east-west direction. The map shows many Roman settlements and the roads connecting them, as well as other features such as rivers, mountains, forests and seas. The distances between settlements are also given. In total no fewer than 555 cities and 3,500 other place names are shown on the map. The three most important cities of the Roman Empire at the time – Rome, Constantinople and Antioch – are represented with special iconic decoration.\n\nBesides the totality of the empire, the map also shows areas in the Near East, India and the Ganges, Sri Lanka (\"Insula Taprobane\"), and even an indication of China. It even shows a \"Temple to Augustus\" at Muziris on the modern-day Malabar Coast, one of the main ports for trade with the Roman Empire on the southwest coast of India. On the western end of the scroll, the absence of Morocco, the Iberian Peninsula, and the British Isles indicates that a twelfth original section has been lost in the surviving copy; the missing section was reconstructed in 1898 by Konrad Miller.\n\nThe map appears to be based on \"itineraries\", lists of destinations along Roman roads, as the distances between points along the routes are indicated. Travelers would not have possessed anything so sophisticated as a modern map, but they needed to know what lay ahead of them on the road and how far. The Peutinger Table represents these roads as a series of stepped lines along which destinations have been marked in order of travel. The shape of the parchment pages accounts for the conventional rectangular layout. However, a rough similarity to the coordinates of Ptolemy's earth-mapping gives some writers hope that some terrestrial representation was intended by the unknown original compilers.\n\nThe stages and cities are represented by hundreds of functional place symbols, used with discrimination from the simplest icon of a building with two towers to the elaborate individualized \"portraits\" of the three great cities. The editors Annalina and Mario Levi concluded that the semi-schematic, semi-pictorial symbols reproduce Roman cartographic conventions of the \"itineraria picta\" described by 4th-century writer Vegetius, of which this is the sole known testimony.\n\nThe map was discovered in a library in the city of Worms by German scholar Conrad Celtes in 1494, who was unable to publish his find before his death and bequeathed the map in 1508 to Konrad Peutinger, a German humanist and antiquarian in Augsburg, after whom the map is named. The Peutinger family kept possession of the map for more than two hundred years until it was sold in 1714. It then bounced between several royal and elite families until it was purchased by Prince Eugene of Savoy for 100 ducats; upon his death in 1737, it was purchased for the Habsburg Imperial Court Library in Vienna (\"\"). It is today conserved at the Austrian National Library at the Hofburg palace in Vienna.\n\nIn 2007, the map was placed on the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, and in recognition of this, it was displayed to the public for a single day on 26 November 2007. Because of its fragile condition, it is not usually on public display.\n\nThe map was copied for Dutch cartographer Abraham Ortelius and published shortly after his death in 1598. A partial first edition was printed at Antwerp in 1591 (titled \"Fragmenta tabulæ antiquæ\") by Johannes Moretus, who would print the full \"Tabula\" in December 1598, also at Antwerp. Johannes Janssonius published another version in Amsterdam, c. 1652.\n\nIn 1753 Franz Christoph von Scheyb published a copy, and in 1872 Konrad Miller, a German professor, was allowed to copy the map. Several publishing houses in Europe then made copies. In 1892 publishers Williams and Norgate published a copy in London, and in 1911 a sheet was added showing the reconstructed sections of the British Isles and the Iberian peninsula missing in the original.\n\n\n"}

In 1952 it was moved to the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont. It now serves as an exhibit building on the museum grounds.\n\nThe building was originally erected by the Charlotte Methodist Church in 1840, after their original wooden structure was destroyed in a fire in 1837.\n\nBy 1899 it had ceased to function as a church and was taken over by a group of thirteen young women who had formed an amateur theatrical group and used the building as a playhouse. In 1902, the group incorporated as the Breezy Point Library Association and bought the building to serve as the town library. Charles W. Henry, Vermont's foremost painted theater curtain artist, often painted backdrops for the association's productions.\n\nAfter a windstorm damaged the building in 1950, the association voted to sell it to the Shelburne Museum so that it could be preserved. In 1952, the Shelburne Museum dismantled the building and moved it to the grounds finding replacements for missing or damaged elements, including the belfry, pews, and pulpit, in an abandoned church in Milton, Vermont. The interior plaster walls were painted in tones of white and grey to resemble paneled woodwork(\"see Trompe-l'œil\").\n\nThe structure reflects the stylistic tendencies established in the last decade of 18th century when the church plan became the standard on which meeting houses were designed. The church plan refers to a rectangular structure with a pitched roof and incorporated bell tower with its entrance located along the structure’s short axis and the pulpit positioned opposite. Since the church plan and the word church connoted Anglicanism, Puritan communities used the term meeting house to refer to the building they used for both secular and religious meetings. \n\nPuritans, and later Congregationalists, traditionally constructed their meeting houses on a square or rectangular plan with hipped roofs, a separate bell tower, and the entrance and pulpit situated on the long sides of the building. By the late eighteenth century, as communities began to distinguish between meeting houses and churches, Protestant communities adopted both the title “church” and the associated plan in designing their religious buildings.\n\nThe Meeting House’s triangular pediment, accented with cornice moldings, reflects the pervasiveness of Greek Revival Architecture in the mid-nineteenth century. The lack of other adornment, typical of the Greek Revival style, lent itself well to New England Protestant architecture.\n\n"}

The \"Daily Telegraph\" in 2006 said of \"The Good Hotel Guide\": ‘The clear leader in recommending hotels of quality and character while not accepting payment for inclusion or free hospitality.’\n\nThe hotels which are included within the book are recommended by readers, and are often supported by an anonymous professional inspection to affirm that the hotel meets the high standard that is claimed.\n\nThe books are usually divided into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland and list the hotels which are included by place name alphabetical order rather than hotel order. The book shows a strong bias to small country house hotels and old buildings which have a higher degree of eccentricity or originality and character rather than city skyscraper type hotels.\nThe book also annually offers considerable voucher incentives to readers; the 2011 edition contained £150 worth of discount vouchers for hotels included in the book. The most prolific editor of the book is Hilary Rubenstein who edited the books in the 1980s and 1990s. Caroline Raphael has been the most prolific editor since the late 1990s, often with her husband, award-winning journalist Adam Raphael, although very recent editions (2010 and 2011) are edited by Adam not Caroline, with D.

{"id": "2775463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2775463", "title": "Zone file", "text": "Zone file\n\nA Domain Name System (DNS) zone file is a text file that describes a DNS zone. A DNS zone is a subset, often a single domain, of the hierarchical domain name structure of the DNS. The zone file contains mappings between domain names and IP addresses and other resources, organized in the form of text representations of resource records (RR). A zone file may be either a DNS master file, authoritatively describing a zone, or it may be used to list the contents of a DNS cache.\n\nThe format of a zone file is defined in RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1). This format was originally used by the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software package, but has been widely adopted by other DNS server software – though some of them (e.g. NSD, PowerDNS) are using the zone files only as a starting point to compile them into database format, see also Microsoft DNS with Active Directory-database integration.\n\nA zone file is a sequence of entries for \"resource records\". Each line is a text description that defines a single resource record (\"RR\"). The description consists of several fields separated by white space (spaces or tabs) as follows:\n\nThe \"name\" field may be left blank. If so, the record inherits the field from the previous record.\n\nThe field \"ttl (time-to-live)\" specifies the time after which a domain name client must discard the record and perform a new resolution operation to obtain fresh information. If ttl is not specified, the global TTL specified at the top of the zone file is used.\n\nThe field \"record class\" indicates the namespace of the record information. The most commonly used namespace is that of the Internet, indicated by parameter \"IN\", but others exist and are in use, e.g., \"CHAOS\".\n\nThe field \"record type\" is an abbreviation for the type of information stored in the last field, \"record data\". For example: an \"address record\" (type \"A\" for IPv4, or type \"AAAA\" for IPv6,) maps the domain name from the first field to an IP address in the record data; a \"mail exchanger\" record (type \"MX\") specifies the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) mail host for a domain.\n\nThe field \"record data\" may consist of one or more information elements, depending on the requirements of each record type. For example, an address record only requires an address, while a mail exchanger record requires a priority and a domain name. Such information elements are separated by white space.\n\nResource records may occur in any order in a zone file, with some exceptions. For formatting convenience, resource records may span several lines by enclosing in parentheses a set of parameters that spans several lines, but belongs to the same record. The file may contain comment text by preceding such text with a semicolon, either at the beginning of a line, or after the last field on any line, or on a blank line. Comments end at the end of a line. The zone file may contain any number of blank lines with or without comments.\n\nThe zone file may also contain various directives that are marked with a keyword starting with the dollar sign character. The most notable is the \"$ORIGIN\" keyword, which specifies the starting point for the zone in the DNS hierarchy. If this keyword is omitted from a zone file, the origin is inferred by the server software from the reference to the zone file in its server configuration.\n\nAn example of a zone file for the domain \"example.com\" is the following:\nAs a minimum, the zone file must specify the \"Start of Authority\" (SOA) record with the name of the authoritative master name server for the zone and the email address of someone responsible for management of the name server. The parameters of the SOA record also specify a list of timing and expiration parameters (serial number, slave refresh period, slave retry time, slave expiration time, and the maximum time to cache the record).\nSome DNS server software, such as BIND, also requires at least one additional name server record. The email address in the SOA RR has the @ symbol replaced by a period. In the zone file, host names that do not end in a period are relative to the origin. For example, in the example above, \"www\" refers to \"www.example.com\", and \"example.com.\" is \"example.com\", and not \"example.com.example.com\". Names ending with a full stop (or point) are said to be fully qualified domain names.\n\nA zone file is referenced by the configuration file of the name server software such as bind, typically by a statement such as:\nThe zone files for the DNS root zone and for the set of top-level domains contain resource records only for the authoritative domain name servers for each domain name.\n\nSome server software automatically configures resource records for specially recognized domains or hostnames, such as localhost, but a customized zone master file may be used.\n\nAn example for manual configuration of the forward zone for \"localhost\" is the following:\nThe corresponding reverse zone definition is:\n\nThis file does not specify the origin so that it may be used for both IPv4 and IPv6 with this configuration:\nSimilar zone master files may be created for the reverse resolution of the broadcast address and the null address. Such zone files prevent a DNS server from referring to other, possibly external DNS servers.\n\n\n"}
