{"id": "1452241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1452241", "title": "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations", "text": "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations\n\nBartlett's Familiar Quotations, often simply called Bartlett's, is an American reference work that is the longest-lived and most widely distributed collection of quotations. The book was first issued in 1855 and is currently in its eighteenth edition, published in 2012.\n\nThe book arranges its entries by author, rather than by subject, as many other quotation collections, and enters the authors chronologically by date of birth rather than alphabetically. Within years, authors are arranged alphabetically and quotations are arranged chronologically within each author's entry, followed by \"attributed\" remarks whose source in the author's writings has not been confirmed. The book contains a thorough keyword index and details the source of each quotation.\n\nJohn Bartlett, who ran the University Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was frequently asked for information on quotations and he began a commonplace book of them for reference. In 1855, he privately printed his compilation as \"A Collection of Familiar Quotations\". This first edition contained 258 pages of quotations by 169 authors, chiefly the Bible, William Shakespeare, and the great English poets. Bartlett wrote in the fourth edition that \"it is not easy to determine in all cases the degree of familiarity that may belong to phrases and sentences which present themselves for admission; for what is familiar to one class of readers may be quite new to another.\"\n\nThe book was a great success, and Bartlett issued three more editions before joining the Boston publishing firm of Little, Brown, and Company. Bartlett rose to be the senior partner of the firm and supervised nine editions of the work before his death in 1905, the work selling over 300,000 copies. The seventh edition had appeared in 1875, the eighth edition in 1882, and the ninth in 1891. The tenth edition, however, would not appear for more than twenty years.\n\nEdited by Nathan Haskell Dole, the tenth edition (1914) was much like its predecessors. The book began with quotations originally in English, arranging them chronologically by author (Geoffrey Chaucer was the first entry, Mary Frances Butts the last). These quotes were chiefly from literary sources. A \"miscellaneous\" section follows of quotations in English from politicians and scientists (such as \"fifty-four forty or fight!\"). A section of \"translations\" follows, consisting mainly of lines from the ancient Greeks and Romans. The last section was devoted to the Bible and the \"Book of Common Prayer\". Quotations were arranged in a single column.\n\nThe eleventh edition (1937), edited by Christopher Morley (1890–1957) and Louella D. Everett, expanded the page size and created a two-column format, making it the first edition that is recognizable to users of the modern work. A twelfth edition (1948) was also edited by Morley and Everett.\n\nThe thirteenth edition (1955) was billed by the publisher as the \"Centennial Edition.\" While the work was credited to the editors of Little, Brown, the preface gives special thanks to Morley and Everett as well as Emily Morison Beck (1915–2004). The volume continued to add more recent material, the two youngest authors being cartoonist Bill Mauldin and Queen Elizabeth II. Beck also edited the fourteenth edition (1968) and the fifteenth (1980). Aram Bakshian said Beck's work on the fifteenth edition was the start of the work's downfall: \"Donning the intellectual bell-bottoms and platform shoes of its era, \"Bartlett's\" began spouting third-rate Third World, youth-culture, and feminist quotes,\" part of \"a middle-aged obsession with staying trendy.\"\n\nFollowing Beck's retirement, Little, Brown entrusted the editorship to Justin Kaplan, whose life of Mark Twain \"Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain\" had won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. Kaplan brought out the sixteenth edition (1993) to criticism in part because he included only three minor Ronald Reagan quotations and commented publicly he despised Reagan. (Franklin D. Roosevelt had 35 entries and John F. Kennedy had 28.) Jonathan Siegel, who edited the \"Macmillan Book of Political Quotations\", said Kaplan was \"an insult to the memory of John Bartlett and the ideologically inclusive spirit of the first fifteen editions.\" Kaplan was also criticized for including pop culture material that was considered neither \"familiar\" nor durable. Similar criticisms were leveled against his editing of the seventeenth edition (2003) which included entries for the first time from J.K. Rowling, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David. Classics were cut: eleven quotations by Alexander Pope were dropped, as were what Kaplan considered high-sounding sentimental quotes. Kaplan did include six Reagan quotations, and Kaplan told \"USA Today\" \"I admit I was carried away by prejudice. Mischievously I did him dirty.\"\n\nThe eighteenth edition, which came out in 2012, was edited by poet, critic, and editor Geoffrey O'Brien (O'Brien is also the editor-in-chief of the Library of America).\n\n\n\"In addition to the prefaces of various editions of\" Bartlett's, \"the following sources were useful\":\n\n"}

It is normally used when there is a recurring need for expendable goods. Blanket orders are often used when a customer buys large quantities and has obtained special discounts. Based on the blanket order, sales orders ('blanket releases' or 'release orders') and invoice items can be created as needed until the contract is fulfilled, the end of the order period is reached or a pre-determined maximum order value is reached.\n\nIssuing a blanket order allows a customer not to hold more stock than necessary at any time, and avoids the administrative expense of processing frequent purchase orders, while favoring discount pricing through volume commitments or price breaks. On the supplier's side, a blanket order may provide the benefit of guaranteeing ongoing business and also help suppliers better predict future cash flows and orders.\n\nA blanket order is set at a fixed priced contract for a period of time. The buyer looks for the best pricing among competing supplier bids. After the best one is chosen, the prices of goods are fixed, and also quantities of each products are given to the supplier to prepare stock for on requested delivery.\n\nForecasted quantity is provided by the buyer as full usage quantity recorded historically few years or as needed for quantitative analysis. The supplier may give a condition of quantity to supply for this [contract]. For example, 80% of the forecast quantity must be bought at the end of the contract, which may be one or two years.\n\nThe blanket order will charge the delay delivery if the supplier could not supply the products in the contract on time. Anyway, since the supplier has already kept the stock for ready delivery for the first year or agreed period, if the buyer could not fulfill the contract's conditions, such as \"must buy 80% of forecast quantity within a year,\" the contract may be extended, or the delay charge could be no more, or no other charges requested by the buyer.\n\nRealistically, at the end of the blanket order contract, the buyer would not buy at forecasted quantity as agreed in the contract say, 80% of the demand sent to the supplier. The buyer will also allow the supplier to sell the products in the contract to reduce the quantity. The supplier also has to talk and inform the buyer the quantities of goods kept in order that the buyer could know the status of the stock. Before the buyer issuing the purchase order to supplier, the buyer must ask the supplier first about stock availability to avoid the problem from no stock availability.\n\nBlanket orders or call-off orders may also be used for ordering services, for example for maintenance and repair services. In these cases the benefits associated with stock-holding do not arise but the call-off order may allow emergency repairs or on-call maintenance to be arranged easily at guaranteed rates.\n\nThe most difficult part of having a contract is determining the forecast quantity arranged by the user of the product. As the forecast quantity can be difficult to get, the supplier must be aware of the quantity to keep in stock. An easy way to do this is to discuss with the buyer what quantity to keep in stock. For example, they might keep only 20% in stock in the first 6 months, so that the supplier and the buyer are able to review the quantity and adjust it appropriately. This reduces the stock burden of the supplier during the contract period and might help the buyer at the end of the contract if the stock does not move as quickly as anticipated. The contract might be extended year after year, but it can be adjusted each time as more relevant forecasting history will predicate the need to decrease or increase stock requirements. Alternatively, some companies may utilize forecasted information via a material requirements planning system to determine appropriate stock quantities throughout the product's life cycle.\n\nThe United States' Federal Acquisition Regulation uses the term \"blanket purchase agreements\" or BPAs.\n\nAccording to the U.S. General Services Administration, BPAs:\n\n"}

It covers the years from the first Norman \"invasion\" of Apulia in 1041 to the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085. Though once treated as an important source, its reliability and authenticity have been called into question by André Jacob, who showed that it is probably an eighteenth-century forgery by Pietro Polidori. According to John France, who seems unaware of Jacob's argument, it was based mainly on an oral tradition and was subsequently used as a source for both the \"Chronicon Amalfitanum\" and Romuald Guarna. \n\nThe first edition of the \"Chronicon\" was published by Ludovico Antonio Muratori in the fifth volume of his \"Rerum italicarum scriptores\" (1724) under the long title \"Breve chronicon Northmannicum de rebus in Iapygia et Apulia gestis contra Graecos\". The text he used was preserved in a twelfth- or thirteenth-century codex borrowed from Pietro Polidori, as well as a copy of \"c\".1530, both now lost. Only one authentic copy remains, though a forgery of G. Guerrieri also exists.

{"id": "18934361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18934361", "title": "British Library", "text": "British Library\n\nThe British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom and the largest national library in the world by number of items catalogued. It is estimated to contain 150–200 million+ items from many countries. As a legal deposit library, the British Library receives copies of all books produced in the United Kingdom and Ireland, including a significant proportion of overseas titles distributed in the UK. The Library is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nThe British Library is a major research library, with items in many languages and in many formats, both print and digital: books, manuscripts, journals, newspapers, magazines, sound and music recordings, videos, play-scripts, patents, databases, maps, stamps, prints, drawings. The Library's collections include around 14 million books, along with substantial holdings of manuscripts and historical items dating back as far as 2000 BC. In addition to receiving a copy of every publication produced in the UK and Ireland (approximately 8,000 per day), the Library has a programme for content acquisitions. The Library adds some three million items every year occupying of new shelf space. There is space in the library for over 1,200 readers.\n\nPrior to 1973, the Library was part of the British Museum. The British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997. The Library is now located in a purpose-built building on the north side of Euston Road in St Pancras, London (between Euston railway station and St Pancras railway station), and has a document storage centre and reading room near Boston Spa, near Wetherby in West Yorkshire. The Euston Road building is classified as a Grade I listed building \"of exceptional interest\" for its architecture and history.\n\nThe British Library was created on 1 July 1973 as a result of the British Library Act 1972. Prior to this, the national library was part of the British Museum, which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library, alongside smaller organisations which were folded in (such as the National Central Library, the National Lending Library for Science and Technology and the British National Bibliography). In 1974 functions previously exercised by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information were taken over; in 1982 the India Office Library and Records and the HMSO Binderies became British Library responsibilities. In 1983, the Library absorbed the National Sound Archive, which holds many sound and video recordings, with over a million discs and thousands of tapes.\n\nThe core of the Library's historical collections is based on a series of donations and acquisitions from the 18th century, known as the \"foundation collections\". These include the books and manuscripts of Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Hans Sloane, Robert Harley and the King's Library of King George III, as well as the Old Royal Library donated by King George II.\n\nFor many years its collections were dispersed in various buildings around central London, in places such as Bloomsbury (within the British Museum), Chancery Lane, Bayswater, and Holborn, with an interlibrary lending centre at Boston Spa, east of Wetherby in West Yorkshire (situated on Thorp Arch Trading Estate), and the newspaper library at Colindale, north-west London.\n\nInitial plans for the British Library required demolition of an integral part of Bloomsbury – a seven-acre swathe of streets immediately in front of the Museum, so that the Library could be situated directly opposite. After a long and hard-fought campaign led by Dr George Wagner, this decision was overturned and the library was instead constructed by John Laing plc on a site at Euston Road next to St Pancras railway station.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2009 the main collection was housed in this single new building and the collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library announced that it would be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site. From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200 km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service. Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013. The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) and the Library's Document Supply Collection is based on the same site in Boston Spa. Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds. The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich, south-east London, which is no longer in use.\n\nThe new library was designed specially for the purpose by the architect Colin St John Wilson in collaboration with his wife MJ Long. Facing Euston Road is a large piazza that includes pieces of public art, such as large sculptures by Eduardo Paolozzi (a bronze statue based on William Blake's study of Isaac Newton) and Antony Gormley. It is the largest public building constructed in the United Kingdom in the 20th century.\nIn the middle of the building is a six-storey glass tower inspired by a similar structure in the Beinecke Library, containing the King's Library with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820. In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by Rosie Winterton. The new facility, costing £26 million, has a capacity for seven million items, stored in more than 140,000 bar-coded containers and which are retrieved by robots from the 162.7 miles of temperature and humidity-controlled storage space.\n\nOn Friday, 5 April 2013, the Library announced that it would begin saving all sites with the suffix .uk (every British website, e-book, online newsletter, and blog) in a bid to preserve the nation's \"digital memory\" (which as of then amounted to about 4.8 million sites containing 1 billion web pages). The Library would make all the material publicly available to users by the end of 2013, and would ensure that, through technological advancements, all the material is preserved for future generations, despite the fluidity of the Internet.\n\nThe building was Grade I listed on 1 August 2015.\n\nIn England, legal deposit can be traced back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 established the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.\n\nFurther, under the terms of Irish copyright law (most recently the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000), the British Library is entitled to automatically receive a free copy of every book published in Ireland, alongside the National Library of Ireland, the Trinity College Library at Dublin, the library of the University of Limerick, the library of Dublin City University and the libraries of the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. The Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales are also entitled to copies of material published in Ireland, but again must formally make requests.\n\nIn 2003 the Ipswich MP Chris Mole introduced a Private Member's Bill which became the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003. The Act extends United Kingdom legal deposit requirements to electronic documents, such as CD-ROMs and selected websites.\n\nThe Library also holds the Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections (APAC) which include the India Office Records and materials in the languages of Asia and of north and north-east Africa.\n\nThe Library is open to everyone who has a genuine need to use its collections. Anyone with a permanent address who wishes to carry out research can apply for a Reader Pass; they are required to provide proof of signature and address.\n\nHistorically, only those wishing to use specialised material unavailable in other public or academic libraries would be given a Reader Pass. The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, who have access to their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that it has always admitted undergraduates as long as they have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.\n\nThe majority of catalogue entries can be found on Explore the British Library, the Library's main catalogue, which is based on Primo. Other collections have their own catalogues, such as western manuscripts. The large reading rooms offer hundreds of seats which are often filled with researchers, especially during the Easter and summer holidays.\n\nBritish Library Reader Pass holders are also able to view the Document Supply Collection in the Reading Room at the Library's site in Boston Spa in Yorkshire as well as the hard copy newspaper collection from 29 September 2014. Now that access is available to legal deposit collection material, it is necessary for visitors to register as a Reader to use the Boston Spa Reading Room.\n\nThe British Library makes a number of images of items within its collections available online. Its \"Online Gallery\" gives access to 30,000 images from various medieval books, together with a handful of exhibition-style items in a proprietary format, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels. This includes the facility to \"turn the virtual pages\" of a few documents, such as Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks. Catalogue entries for many of the illuminated manuscript collections are available online, with selected images of pages or miniatures from a growing number of them, and there is a database of significant bookbindings. British Library Sounds provides free online access to over 60,000 sound recordings.\n\nThe British Library's commercial secure electronic delivery service was started in 2003 at a cost of £6 million. This offers more than 100 million items (including 280,000 journal titles, 50 million patents, 5 million reports, 476,000 US dissertations and 433,000 conference proceedings) for researchers and library patrons worldwide which were previously unavailable outside the Library because of copyright restrictions. In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs, a fee is charged to the user. However, this service is no longer profitable and has led to a series of restructures to try to prevent further losses.\nWhen Google Books started, the British Library signed an agreement with Microsoft to digitise a number of books from the British Library for its Live Search Books project. This material was only available to readers in the US, and closed in May 2008. The scanned books are currently available via the British Library catalogue or Amazon.\n\nIn October 2010 the British Library launched its \"Management and business studies portal\". This website is designed to allow digital access to management research reports, consulting reports, working papers and articles.\n\nIn November 2011, four million newspaper pages from the 18th and 19th centuries were made available online. The project will scan up to 40 million pages over the next 10 years. The archive is free to search, but there is a charge for accessing the pages themselves.\n\n\"Explore the British Library\" is the latest iteration of the online catalogue. It contains nearly 57 million records and may be used to search, view and order items from the collections or search the contents of the Library's website. The Library's electronic collections include over 40,000 ejournals, 800 databases and other electronic resources. A number of these are available for remote access to registered St Pancras Reader Pass holders.\n\nPhD theses are available via the E-Theses Online Service (EThOS).\n\nIn 2012, the UK legal deposit libraries signed a memorandum of understanding to create a shared technical infrastructure implementing the Digital Library System developed by the British Library. The DLS was in anticipation of the Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013, an extension of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 to include non-print electronic publications from 6 April 2013. Four storage nodes, located in London, Boston Spa, Aberystwyth, and Edinburgh, linked via a secure network in constant communication automatically replicate, self-check, and repair data. A complete crawl of every .uk domain (and other TLDs with UK based server GeoIP) has been added annually to the DLS since 2013, which also contains all of the Internet Archive's 1996-2013 .uk collection. The policy and system is based on that of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, which has crawled (via IA until 2010) the .fr domain annually (62 TBs in 2015) since 2006.\n\nA number of books and manuscripts are on display to the public in the Sir John Ritblat Gallery which is open seven days a week at no charge. Some manuscripts in the exhibition include \"Beowulf\", the Lindisfarne Gospels and St Cuthbert Gospel, a Gutenberg Bible, Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\" (King Arthur), Captain Cook's journal, Jane Austen's \"History of England\", Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\", Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures Under Ground\", Rudyard Kipling's \"Just So Stories\", Charles Dickens's \"Nicholas Nickleby\", Virginia Woolf's \"Mrs Dalloway\" and a room devoted solely to \"Magna Carta\", as well as several Qur'ans and Asian items.\n\nIn addition to the permanent exhibition, there are frequent thematic exhibitions which have covered maps, sacred texts, history of the English language, and law, including a celebration of the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.\n\nIn May 2005, the British Library received a grant of £1 million from the London Development Agency to change two of its reading rooms into the Business & IP Centre. The Centre was opened in March 2006. It holds arguably the most comprehensive collection of business and intellectual property (IP) material in the United Kingdom and is the official library of the UK Intellectual Property Office.\n\nThe collection is divided up into four main information areas: market research, company information, trade directories, and journals. It is free of charge in hard copy and online via approximately 30 subscription databases. Registered readers can access the collection and the databases.\n\nThere are over 50 million patent specifications from 40 countries in a collection dating back to 1855. The collection also includes official gazettes on patents, trade marks and Registered Design; law reports and other material on litigation; and information on copyright. This is available in hard copy and via online databases.\n\nStaff are trained to guide small and medium enterprises (SME) and entrepreneurs to use the full range of resources.\n\nStephen Fear was the British Library's Entrepreneur in Residence and Ambassador from 2012 to 2016.\n\nAs part of its establishment in 1973, the British Library absorbed the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL), based near Boston Spa in Yorkshire, which had been established in 1961. Before this, the site had housed a World War II Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Thorp Arch, which closed in 1957. When the NLL became part of the British Library in 1973 it changed its name to the British Library Lending Division, in 1985 it was renamed as the British Library Document Supply Centre and is now known as the British Library Document Supply Service, often abbreviated as BLDSS.\n\nBLDSS now holds 87.5 million items, including 296,000 international journal titles, 400,000 conference proceedings, 3 million monographs, 5 million official publications, and 500,000 UK and North American theses and dissertations. 12.5 million articles in the Document Supply Collection are held electronically and can be downloaded immediately.\n\nThe collection supports research and development in UK, overseas and international industry, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. BLDSS also provides material to Higher Education institutions, students and staff and members of the public, who can order items through their Public Library or through the Library's BL Document Supply Service (BLDSS). The Document Supply Service also offers Find it For Me and Get it For Me services which assist researchers in accessing hard-to-find material.\n\nIn April 2013, BLDSS launched its new online ordering and tracking system, which enables customers to search available items, view detailed availability, pricing and delivery time information, place and track orders, and manage account preferences online.\n\nThe British Library Sound Archive holds more than a million discs and 185,000 tapes. The collections come from all over the world and cover the entire range of recorded sound from music, drama and literature to oral history and wildlife sounds, stretching back over more than 100 years. The Sound Archive's online catalogue is updated daily.\n\nIt is possible to listen to recordings from the collection in selected Reading Rooms in the Library through their \"SoundServer\" and \"Listening and Viewing Service\", which is based in the Rare Books & Music Reading Room.\n\nIn 2006 the Library launched a new online resource British Library Sounds which makes 50,000 of the Sound Archive's recordings available online.\n\nThe Library holds an almost complete collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. This is partly because of the legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total, the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of microfilm containing tens of millions of newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45 km of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the Thomason Tracts, comprising 7,200 17th-century newspapers, and the Burney Collection, featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.\n\nThe Newspapers section was based in Colindale in North London until 2013, when the buildings, which were considered to provide inadequate storage conditions and to be beyond improvement, were closed and sold for redevelopment. The physical holdings are now divided between the sites at St Pancras (some high-use periodicals, and rare items such as the Thomason Tracts and Burney collections) and Boston Spa (the bulk of the collections, stored in a new purpose-built facility).\n\nA significant and growing proportion of the collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.\n\nLaunched in October 2012, the British Library's moving image services provide access to nearly a million sound and moving image items onsite, supported by data for over 20 million sound and moving image recordings. The three services, which for copyright reasons can only be accessed from terminals within the Reading Rooms at St Pancras or Boston Spa, are:\n\n\nThe British Library Philatelic Collections are held at St Pancras. The collections were established in 1891 with the donation of the Tapling collection; they steadily developed and now comprise over 25 major collections and a number of smaller ones, encompassing a wide range of disciplines. The collections include postage and revenue stamps, postal stationery, essays, proofs, covers and entries, \"cinderella stamp\" material, specimen issues, airmails, some postal history materials, official and private posts, etc., for almost all countries and periods.\n\nAn extensive display of material from the collections is on exhibit, which may be the best permanent display of diverse classic stamps and philatelic material in the world. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 sheets are from the Tapling Collection. All other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers. As well as these collections, the library actively acquires literature on the subject. This makes the British Library one of the world's prime philatelic research centres. The Head Curator of the Philatelic Collections is Paul Skinner.\n\nThe British Library sponsors or co-sponsors many projects of national and international significance. These include:\n\nHighlights, some of which were selected by the British Library, include:\n\nThe three foundation collections are those which were brought together to form the initial manuscript holdings of the British Museum in 1753:\n\nOther \"named\" collections of manuscripts include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\nOther collections, not necessarily manuscripts:\n\nThe Additional Manuscripts series covers manuscripts that are not part of the named collections, and contains all other manuscripts donated, purchased or bequeathed to the Library since 1756. The numbering begins at 4101, as the series was initially regarded as a continuation of the collection of Sloane manuscripts, which are numbered 1 to 4100.\n\nBritish library employees undertake a wide variety of roles including curatorial, business and technology.

{"id": "265447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265447", "title": "Comparative anatomy", "text": "Comparative anatomy\n\nComparative anatomy is the study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different species. It is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny (the evolution of species). \n\nThe science began in the classical era, continuing in Early Modern times with work by Pierre Belon who noted the similarities of the skeletons of birds and humans.\n\nComparative anatomy has provided evidence of common descent, and has assisted in the classification of animals.\n\nThe first specifically anatomical investigation separate from a surgical or medical procedure is associated by early commentators with Alcmaeon of Croton. Pierre Belon, a French naturalist born in 1517, conducted research and held discussions on dolphin embryos as well as the comparisons between the skeletons of birds to the skeletons of humans. His research led to modern comparative anatomy.\n\nAround the same time, Andreas Vesalius was also making some strides of his own. A young anatomist of Flemish descent made famous by a penchant for amazing charts, he was systematically investigating and correcting the anatomical knowledge of the Greek physician Galen. He noticed that many of Galen's observations were not even based on actual humans. Instead, they were based on animals such as oxen. Up until that point, Galen and his teachings had been the authority on human anatomy. The irony is that Galen himself had emphasized the fact that one should make one's own observations instead of using those of another, but this advice was lost during the numerous translations of his work. As Vesalius began to uncover these mistakes, other physicians of the time began to trust their own observations more than those of Galen. An interesting observation made by some of these physicians was the presence of homologous structures in a wide variety of animals which included humans. These observations were later used by Darwin as he formed his theory of Natural Selection.\n\nEdward Tyson is regarded as the founder of modern comparative anatomy. He is credited with determining that whales and dolphins are, in fact, mammals. Also, he concluded that chimpanzees are more similar to humans than to monkeys because of their arms. Marco Aurelio Severino also compared various animals, including birds, in his \"Zootomia democritaea\", one of the first works of comparative anatomy. In the 18th and 19th century, great anatomists like George Cuvier, Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley revolutionized our understanding of the basic build and systematics of vertebrates, laying the foundation for Charles Darwin's work on evolution. An example of a 20th-century comparative anatomist is Victor Negus, who worked on the structure and evolution of the larynx. Until the advent of genetic techniques like DNA sequencing, comparative anatomy together with embryology were the primary tools for understanding phylogeny, as exemplified by the work of Alfred Romer.\n\nTwo major concepts of comparative anatomy are:\n\nComparative anatomy has long served as evidence for evolution, now joined in that role by comparative genomics; it indicates that organisms share a common ancestor.\n\nIt also assists scientists in classifying organisms based on similar characteristics of their anatomical structures. A common example of comparative anatomy is the similar bone structures in forelimbs of cats, whales, bats, and humans. All of these appendages consist of the same basic parts; yet, they serve completely different functions. The skeletal parts which form a structure used for swimming, such as a fin, would not be ideal to form a wing, which is better-suited for flight. One explanation for the forelimbs' similar composition is descent with modification. Through random mutations and natural selection, each organism's anatomical structures gradually adapted to suit their respective habitats. The rules for development of \"special\" characteristics which differ significantly from general homology were listed by Karl Ernst von Baer as the laws now named after him.\n\n\n"}

However, the first use for the building is more controversial. While some people think the building was erected as a private house or a pagan meeting place, most believe that it was a synagogue even in its earliest form.\n\nLocated on the eastern side of the city of Delos, the synagogue was far from the central areas of the city. Instead, the synagogue was built in a section of Delos called the Quartier du stade. In this part of the city, in contrast to the religious and commercial focus at Delos’ center, residences dominated the scene (there was also a small, easily accessible port).\n\nThe synagogue itself consisted of two large rooms containing a throne and multiple marble benches as well as many smaller rooms which allowed for access to a reservoir.\n\nThe synagogue was discovered in 1912 by a team led by archaeologist André Plassart. The synagogue is understood to have remained in use until the end of the second century AD. The dominating feature of the building is the large hall, which was presumably used in a flexible way, with moveable furniture, since there is no evidence for benches built along the walls. The hall is oriented towards the east, with a series of secondary rooms at the southern end.\n\nThe identification of the building as a Jewish synagogue at any point in its history has been a matter of debate. The original identification of the building as a synagogue by Plassart was based in large part on dedicatory inscriptions referring to \"Theos Hypsistos,\" or \"God Most High,\" often considered an appellation for the Jewish God in antiquity, though not exclusively. The identification of the building as a synagogue was originally challenged by Belle Mazur in 1935, though this argument has gone largely unnoticed by more recent scholarship. The evidence of \"synagogue's\" architecture and inscriptions is complicated by the apparent presence of a contemporary Samaritan community not far. More recent studies have concluded that the evidence suggesting that this building was indeed a synagogue is tenuous at best and will no doubt remain an open question.\n\n"}

Dream dictionaries tend to include specific images which are attached to specific interpretations. However, dream dictionaries are generally not considered scientifically viable by those within the psychology community.\nSince the 19th century, the art of dream interpretation has been transferred to a scientific ground, making it a distinct part of psychology. However, the dream symbols of the \"unscientific\" days—the outcome of hearsay interpretations that differ around the world among different cultures—continued to mark the day of an average human-being, who is most likely unfamiliar with Freudian analysis of dreams.\n\nThe dream dictionary includes interpretations of dreams, giving each symbol in a dream a specific meaning. The argument of what dreams represent has greatly changed over time. With this changing, so have the interpretation of dreams. Dream dictionaries have changed in content since they were first published. The Greeks and Romans saw dreams as having a religious meaning. This made them believe that their dreams were an insight into the future and held the key to the solutions of their problems. Aristotle's view on dreams were that they were merely a function of our physiological make up. He did not believe dreams have a greater meaning, solely that it is a result of how we sleep. In the Middle Ages, dreams were seen as an interpretation of good or evil.\n\nAlthough the dream dictionary is not recognized in the psychology world, Freud is said to have revolutionized the interpretation and study of dreams. Freud came to the conclusion that dreams were a form of wish fulfillment. Dream dictionaries were first based upon Freudian thoughts and ancient interpretations of dreams.\n\nSome examples of dream interpretation are: dreaming you are on a beach means you are facing negativity in your life, or a lion may represent a need to control others. Dream dictionaries typically hold interpretations ranging from A-Z. Dream dictionaries can be found in book form or on the internet.\n\n\n\n"}

The Council is a largely self-selected body, composed of Islamic clerics and scholars, presided over by Yusuf al-Qaradawi.\n\nThe ECFR aims \"to present to the Muslim World and the Muslim minorities in the West particularly\" its interpretation of \"the manifestation of Allah's infinite mercy, knowledge and wisdom\". For the ECFR, the shariah clearly embodies the superior rules in life: \"the Shari'ah cannot be amended to conform to changing human values and standards, rather, it is the absolute norm to which all human values and conduct must conform; it is the frame to which they must be referred; it is the scale on which they must be weighed\".\n\nIt wants to achieve these through:\n\nThe ECFR is one of the main channels for the publications of fatwa's by Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a Muslim scholar affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, and his main English-language channel.\n\nAmong others, it wants to promote, and control, the local education of native imam's for the Muslim minorities in European countries. Amongst others, it participates in such initiatives in France (in cooperation with the European Institute for Humanitarian and Islamic Studies) and the United Kingdom.\n\nIt also strives to become an approved religious authority before local governments and private establishments in all countries where Muslims are a minority.\n\nAccording to its Mission Statement the ECFR wants to assume a leading role in all dogmatic and accordingly also in all worldly issues in the worldwide Islamic community, the Ummah. Among others, it wants to address the younger Muslim generations living in outside Islamic countries, especially those in Europe and the United States. It wants to project a relatively contemporary position, all through it is heavily criticized for very undemocratic and non-contemporary positions:\n\n\nOn the other hand, it regularly pleads for mutual respect for non-Muslims, and for respect for civil procedures; e.g. marriage is considered valid only if the rights of both spouses are respected and if the civil procedure is followed to (any marriage which is conducted purely in the mosque is not considered Islamic).\n\nAside from the exclusion of non-Sunni Muslims, and more importantly, other people criticize the ECFR for its fierce refusal to accept separation of church and state as an element of democracy, as well as several principles of democracy. The fatwas of the ECFR's chairmain, Yussuf al-Qaradawi, are clear on how this tendency in Islam sees democracy and universal human rights:\n\n\nAlso, in August 2005, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that the Council had used the infamous anti-Semitic forgery known as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in its theological deliberations. They also reported that \"the council is part of a web of organizations that spread ideology close to the Muslim Brotherhood throughout Europe\".\n\n\nHalf of the members are from the European continent and half are from the Arabian Peninsula, Northern Africa or Northern America.

{"id": "151807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151807", "title": "Film (film)", "text": "Film (film)\n\nFilm is a 1965 short film written by Samuel Beckett, his only screenplay. It was commissioned by Barney Rosset of Grove Press. Writing began on 5 April 1963 with a first draft completed within four days. A second draft was produced by 22 May and a 40-leaf shooting script followed thereafter. It was filmed in New York City in July 1964.\n\nBeckett's original choice for the lead – referred to only as “O” – was Charlie Chaplin, but his script never reached him. Both Beckett and the director Alan Schneider were interested in Zero Mostel and Jack MacGowran. However, the former was unavailable and the latter, who accepted at first, became unavailable due to his role in a \"Hollywood epic.\" Beckett then suggested Buster Keaton. Schneider promptly flew to Los Angeles and persuaded Keaton to accept the role along with \"a handsome fee for less than three weeks' work.\" James Karen, who was to have a small part in the film, also encouraged Schneider to contact Keaton.\n\nThe filmed version differs from Beckett's original script but with his approval since he was on set all the time, this being his only visit to the United States. The script printed in \"Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett\" (Faber and Faber, 1984) states:\n\nIt was remade by the British Film Institute (1979, 16 mm, 26 minutes) without Beckett's supervision, as Film: a screenplay by Samuel Beckett. David Rayner Clark directed Max Wall.\n\nIt first appeared in print in \"Eh Joe and Other Writings\" (Faber and Faber, 1967).\n\nThroughout the first two parts, almost everything is seen through the eye of the camera (designated in the script as E), although there are occasional moments when O's perception is seen. In the third part, much more of O's perception of the room and its contents is given. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a lens-gauze, blurring his perception while E's perception was shot without gauze or filters, keeping the images sharp.\n\nThe film opens onto a rippled image that fills the entire screen. Without colour, it is difficult to discern what is being shown, but it is alive. As it moves, it is shown to be an extreme close-up of an eyelid; it fills the entire screen. The eye opens, slowly, closes, opens again, blinks and then fades into a different rippled image, still somewhat organic but changed, still. As the camera begins to pan right and up, it is discernable as a wall; we are outside a building (an old factory situated in Lower Manhattan). It is summer, though it is hard to tell. The camera's movement is not smooth. It is as if it is looking for something. Eventually, it loses interest and pans left and down back to the wall.\n\nSuddenly, the camera (E) shifts violently to the left. A man (O) is hurrying along the wall from left to right. He pauses, hugging the wall, and E gets a chance to focus on him. He has on a long dark overcoat, the collar of which is turned up and his hat is pulled down over his face. Keaton asked Beckett what O was wearing underneath. “I hadn't thought of that,” the author admitted and then proposed, “the same coat,” which appealed to both men. He is hanging onto a briefcase with his left hand whilst trying to shield the exposed side of his face with the other. He realises he's been seen and cowers against the wall; E quickly shifts behind him.\n\nNo longer conscious of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle and stumbling over a railway sleeper—anything to stay as close as possible to the wall. He charges into a man and woman, knocking the man's hat off. E looks from the man's face to the woman's and back again. The man has a moustache and is wearing a pince-nez. They have been consulting a newspaper, which the woman keeps hold of. They both look appalled at what has happened.\n\nE moves back to a long shot and watches O barge through and on his way. The man replaces his hat, takes off his pince-nez. and looks after the fleeing figure. The couple look at each other and the man “opens his mouth to vituperate” but the woman shushes him, uttering the only sound in the whole play. Together they turn to stare directly at E as an open-mouthed expression takes over their faces; they can’t bear to look at what they’ve seen and turn their faces away.\n\nThe action shifts back to O just as he reaches and turns a corner. He heads off down the street until he realises he is at the right doorway. He enters.\n\nThe camera cuts to the vestibule. The viewer is directly behind O. Stairs lead up on the left, but O veers right and pauses, pulling himself together. He takes his pulse and E moves in. As soon as he becomes aware of E's presence he rushes down a couple of steps and cowers beside the wall until the camera retreats a little. When it does he reverses back up to street-level and then begins up the stairs.\n\nA frail old woman is coming down. The camera gives us a brief close-up. “She carries a tray of flowers slung from her neck by a strap. She descends slowly and with fumbling feet.” O backs up and hurries down the steps to the right again where he sits down on a step and presses his face against the balusters. He glances up briefly to see where she is, then hides his head from view.\n\nAs the woman reaches the bottom of the stairs, she looks straight into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. She closes her eyes and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. His coat tails are seen flying up the stairs.\n\nE chases after him and finds him at the top of the first flight. He looks around to see if there is anyone about. Satisfied, he turns left and, not without some difficulty, opens the door to a room and enters. E slips in unnoticed as O locks the door behind him and then takes his pulse once more.\n\nWe find ourselves in a “small barely furnished room. The man—and the camera following him from behind—survey its contents: a dog and a cat share a basket, a caged parrot and a goldfish in its bowl sit atop a small table; the walls are bare, apart from a mirror and an unframed picture of “the face of God the Father” pinned to the wall; there is a couch with a pillow, some blankets and a rug on it, a rocking chair with a “curiously carved headrest” and there is a window with a tattered roller blind with full-length net curtains to either side.\n\nSystematically, O takes each object or creature in the room and disables its ability to ‘see’ him: he closes the blind and pulls the net curtains across, he covers the mirror with the rug, the cat and dog (“a shy and uncooperative, little Chihuahua”) are – with some difficulty – ejected from the room and the picture is torn up. Although stated simply, the mechanics needed to execute these tasks are laborious (e.g., as he passes the window, he hides behind the blanket which he holds in front of himself to cover the mirror and he carries the cat and dog facing away from him as he tries to put them out the door).\n\nAfter all the above, he goes to sit in the chair. There are two holes in the headrest that suggest eyes. He ignores them and sits. O takes the folder from his case and goes to open it, but there are “two eyelets, well proportioned”; he turns the folder through 90° but he's disturbed by the parrot's eye and has to get up and cover the cage with his coat. He sits again, repeats the same process with his folder and then has to get up and cover the goldfish bowl, too.\n\n\"Beckett initially contemplated setting \"Film\" in the evening, but had to decide against it for a practical reason: 'to remove all possibility of his putting off light in room.'\"\n\nFinally O sits down opposite the denuded wall, opens the folder, and takes out seven photographs of himself, which he examines in sequence:\n\n\nHe spends twice as long on pictures 5 and 6. After he looks at each one he places them at the back of the pile so the viewing order is reversed. He does not need to do anything with the seventh photograph since it is now on the top of the pile. After a few seconds, he rips it up and drops it on the floor and then works his way one after another through the rest of the photos, looking at each one briefly again and then tearing it up. The photograph of him as an infant must be on a tougher mount and he has some difficulty with that one. “[I]n Beckett the distant past is always more tenacious than recent events.” Afterwards he rocks slightly, hands holding the armrests and then checks his pulse once more.\n\nO is now in a similar situation to the man in \"A Piece of Monologue,\" who has also destroyed all his old photographs and now stands facing a similarly blank wall.\n\nAs O begins to doze off, E begins to move round to his left. Suddenly, O realises he is being watched and turns his head violently to the right. E moves behind him again. He resumes rocking and dozes off. This time E whirls round to the right, passing the window, the mirror, the birdcage and fishbowl and finally stops in front of the space on the wall where the picture was.\n\nE turns around and, for the first time, we are face-to-face with O, asleep in his rocking chair. All of a sudden he wakes and stares straight into the camera lens. He looks very much like the man in the seventh photograph only much older. He still has the eye patch.\n\nHe half starts from the chair, then stiffens. Gradually, the horrified look we have seen before on the couple and the old woman's faces appears on his. He is looking at himself, but not the scruffy, wearish man we have been watching. The man before him, standing with a big nail beside his head, has a look of “acute \"intentness\"” on his face. O slumps back into the chair and starts rocking. He closes his eye and the expression fades. He covers his face with his hands briefly and then looks again. This time we see the face of E in close-up, just the eyes.\n\nO covers his eyes again, bows his head. The rocking dies down and then stops. The screen goes black. We then see the opening image of the eye, which is frozen, and the credits are presented over it. Once finished, the eye closes and the film is over.\n\nThe work is studied by and has been the subject of criticism from both film and theatre scholars, with the former tending to study the film as shot, the latter tending to study the script as written. Critical opinion is mixed, but it is generally held in higher regard by film scholars than it is by theatre or Beckett scholars. The views above represent extremes. A ‘middle-ground’ review would probably be “a poor attempt by a genuine writer to move into a medium that he simply hadn’t the flair or understanding of to make a success.” Beckett's own opinion was that it was an “interesting failure.”\n\nThe film opens and closes with close-ups of a sightless eye. This inevitably evokes the notorious opening sequence of \"Un Chien Andalou\" in which a human eye is sliced open with a razor blade. In fact, \"The Eye\" was an early title for \"Film\", though admittedly, at that time, he had not thought of the need for the opening close-up. As a student of French literature, Beckett would have been familiar with Victor Hugo’s poem \"La Conscience\". ‘\"Conscience\"’ in French can mean either ‘conscience’ in the English sense or ‘consciousness’ and the double meaning is important. Hugo's poem concerns a man haunted by an eye that stares at him unceasingly from the sky. He runs away from it, ever further, even to the grave, where, in the tomb, the eye awaits him. The man is Cain. He has been trying to escape consciousness of himself, the self that killed his brother, but his conscience will not let him rest. The eye/I is always present and, when he can run no further, must be faced in the tomb.\n\n\"Film\" takes its inspiration from the 18th century Idealist Irish philosopher Berkeley. At the beginning of the work, Beckett uses the famous quotation: \"esse est percipi\" (to be is to be perceived). Notably, Beckett leaves off a portion of Berkeley's edict, which reads in full: “\"esse est percipi aut percipere\"” (to be is to be perceived or to perceive). Beckett was once asked if he could provide an explanation that ‘the man in the street’ could understand:\n\nIn between takes on the set near the Brooklyn Bridge, Keaton told a reporter something similar, summarizing the theme as \"a man may keep away from everybody but he can't get away from himself.\"\n\nIn Beckett's original script, the two main characters, the camera and the man it is pursuing are referred to as E (the Eye) and O (the Object). This simplistic division might lead one to assume that the Eye is only interested in the man it is pursuing. This may be true, but it does not mean it will not have the same effect on anyone who comes in contact with it. “E is both part of O and not part of O; E is also the camera and, through the camera, the eye of the spectator as well. But E is also self, not merely O’s self but the self of any person or people, specifically that of the other characters — the elderly couple and the flower-lady — who respond to its stare with that look of horror.” E is, so to speak, O's blind eye. \"He has the function of making all with whom he comes into contact self-aware.”\n\nO does everything physically possible to avoid being seen by others, but the only thing he can do to avoid perception by an “all seeing god” is to tear up his picture, a symbolic act, as if saying, “If I don’t believe you exist you can’t see me.” There is no one there to see him for what he really is other than himself and so, in this godless world, it is only fitting that E, representing O's self-perception, would appear standing where the picture has been torn from the wall. O also destroys the photographs of his past, his ‘memories’ of who he was. Now all that remains for O is to escape from himself - which he achieves by falling asleep until woken by E's intense gaze. The room is more figurative than literal, like many of Beckett's rooms, “as much psychological as physical, ‘rooms of the mind,’ as one ... actor called them.”\n\nIf Beckett were Shakespeare he might well have written: “To be seen or not to be seen, that is the question.” It is an issue that concerns many of Beckett's characters. At the end of the first act of \"Waiting for Godot\", when the boy wants to know what to tell Mr Godot, Vladimir tells him: “Tell him … (\"he hesitates\") … tell him you saw us. (\"Pause.\") You did see us, didn’t you?” But what happens when you are alone? The narrator of \"The Unnamable\" answers: “They depart, one by one, and the voices go on, it’s not theirs, they were never there, there was never anyone but you, talking to you about you…” The old woman in \"Rockaby\" appears to be the exact opposite of O but although she actively seeks to be seen by someone while O does everything to avoid perceivedness, the irony is that both characters are alone with only themselves for company.\n\nBeckett's script has been interpreted in various ways. R. C. Lamont writes that \"\"Film\" deals with the apprenticeship to death, the process of detaching oneself from life. Like the Tibetan \"Book of the Dead\", it teaches the gradual dissolution of self. The veiling of the windows and mirrors, the covering of the birdcage – the extinction of light, reflection and light – are so many ritualistic steps to be taken before final immobility, the resignation of the end.” At the end of \"Film\", O is seated in his rocker with his face buried in his hands; at the end of \"Rockaby\", the old woman's head inclines forward as if, finally, she had died. The final scene in \"Film\" is also comparable to the moment in the library when the old man in \"That Time\" sees his own reflection in the glass covering a painting.\n\nIt could be tempting to think of O and E as a Beckettian \"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" – indeed in notes for the first draft Beckett did toy “with the idea of making ‘E tall’ and ‘O short (and) fat’ which corresponds with the dual physique of Jekyll and Hyde” – but \"Film\" is not concerned with representations of good and evil, only with the concept of the second self, of pursuer and pursued.” The special relationship existing between O and E - an atypical case of Doppelgänger - constitutes what has been called \"palindromic identity.\" \n\nFor Linda Ben-Zvi, “Beckett does not merely reproduce the modernist critique of and anxiety over technology and the reproduction of art; he attaches 'no truth value' to his critique of technology and the reproduction of the gaze. Instead, he creates a dialogue that awakens and revitalises the uncritical perception of his audience... The work not only is predicated on the form but invariably becomes a critique of its form.\" Having written a play titled \"Play\" and a song called \"Song\", it comes as no surprise that Beckett would entitle his first foray into cinema as \"Film\". The title supports Ben-Zvi's interpretation in that it is a film about cinematic technology: how the movie camera and photographic images are used in \"Film\" are essential to understanding it. When he writes, “No truth value attaches to above, regarded as of merely structural and dramatic convenience”, Beckett takes the emphasis away from Berkeley's maxim thus stressing the dramatic structure of the work. The viewers are being asked to consider the work structurally and dramatically rather than emotionally or philosophically.\n\nFilm critic and film historian Andrew Sarris briefly mentions \"Film\" in his book, \"The American cinema: directors and directions, 1929-1968\". Sarris discusses \"Film\" in the context of his section on the film career of Buster Keaton, writing that: \"Even Samuel Beckett contributed to the desecration of the Keaton mask by involving the actor of absurdity before its time in a dreary exercise called \"Film\", the most pretentious title in all cinema.\"\n\nBeckett had never seen Schneider direct any of his plays and yet continued to entrust him with the work. However, for this particular project, Beckett became personally involved. Schneider has speculated that it may simply have been the opportunity to work directly with Keaton. “It has even been suggested that the inspiration for \"Waiting for Godot\" might have come from a minor Keaton film called \"The Lovable Cheat\" in which Keaton plays a man who waits endlessly for the return of his partner - whose name was Godot.”\n\n“When Schneider managed to hunt up Keaton, he found that genius of the silent screen — old, broke, ill, and alone — some $2 million ahead in a four-handed poker game with an imaginary Louis B. Mayer of MGM and two other invisible Hollywood moguls.\n\n“‘Yes, I accept the offer,’ were silent Keaton's unexpected first words to Schneider. Keaton was dying even as they made the film. ‘We didn’t know that,’ Rosset told interviewer Patsy Southgate in 1990, ‘but looking back at it, the signs were there. Couldn’t speak — he was not so much difficult, he just wasn’t there.’ Keaton would in fact die 18 months after the shooting of Film.”\n\nFrom this one might think that Keaton jumped at the chance but this is not the case. James Karen remembers:\n\nBeckett had wanted to work with Keaton several years earlier, when he offered him the role of Lucky in the American stage premiere of \"Waiting for Godot,\" but Buster turned it down. It's said that Buster didn't understand \"Godot\" and had misgivings about this script as well. Presumably this went a long way to make him think twice about this new project.\n\nDuring a meeting with documentary filmmaker Kevin Brownlow, Beckett was quite forthcoming:\n\nSchneider's recollection of that awkward first meeting confirms all of this and more: “They simply had nothing to say to each other, no worlds of any kind to share. And all of Sam's good will and my own failing efforts to get something started failed to bring them together on any level. It was a disaster.”\n\nBut not entirely. Although the role called for Beckett's seemingly ubiquitous bowler hat, Keaton had brought along some of his trademark flattened-down Stetsons and it was quickly agreed that he should wear one of those. On the Monday morning they “traipsed down in Joe Coffey's ancient Morgan to just beneath the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge and began the shooting.” Beckett continues:\n\nBoth Beckett and Schneider were novices, Keaton a seasoned veteran. That said, “Keaton's behaviour on the set was … steady and cooperative … He was indefatigable if not exactly loquacious. To all intents and purposes, we were shooting a silent film, and he was in his best form. He encouraged [Schneider] to give him vocal directions during the shot, sometimes starting over again without stopping the camera if he felt he hadn't done something well the first time. (Nor did he believe much in rehearsal, preferring the spontaneity of performance.) Often when [the crew was] stumped over a technical problem with the camera, he came through with suggestions, inevitably prefacing his comments by explaining that he had solved such problems many times at the Keaton Studios back in 1927.”\n\nBoth Beckett and Schneider pronounced themselves more than pleased with Keaton's performance; the latter called him \"magnificent.\"\n\nKeaton's negative comments about the film are often reported but this final recollection by Schneider may redress the balance: “[W]hatever he may have subsequently said to interviewers or reporters about not understanding a moment of what he was doing or what the film was about, what I remember best of our final farewell on the set was that he smiled and half-admitted those six pages were worth doing after all.”\n\nIn February 1965, when on a trip to West Berlin, “in deference to his recent work with Buster Keaton, he went to see Keaton again in his 1927 film \"The General\", finding it, however, disappointing.”\n\nCanadian playwright Sherry MacDonald wrote a play, \"The Stone Face\", based on the encounter between Beckett, Keaton and Schneider.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52495", "title": "Gor", "text": "Gor\n\nGor is the Counter-Earth setting for an extended series of sword and planet novels by author and philosophy professor John Norman. The series is inspired particularly by the \"Barsoom\" series and \"Almuric\", but is also known for its content combining philosophy, erotica and science fantasy. The series is known for its repeated depiction of sexual fantasies involving men abducting and physically and sexually brutalizing women, who grow to enjoy their submissive state. According to \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,\" Norman's \"sexual philosophy\" is \"widely detested\", but the books have inspired a Gorean subculture.\n\nThe series has been variably referred to by publishers with several names including The Chronicles of Counter-Earth (Ballantine Books), The Saga of Tarl Cabot (DAW Books), Gorean Cycle (Tandem Books), Gorean Chronicles (Masquerade Books), Gorean Saga (Open Road Media) and The Counter-Earth Saga (DAW Books, for novels with a protagonist other than Tarl Cabot).\n\nIn an interview with the speculative fiction anthology \"Polygraff\", John Norman spoke at length about the creation of the Gor universe and his influences.\n\n\"The Counter-Earth, or \"Antichthon,\" is from Greek cosmology. Speculation on such a world, you see, is ancient. One of the premises of the Gorean series is that a race of aliens, whom we might speak of as the Priest-Kings, have a technology at their disposal compared to which ours would be something like that in the Bronze Age.\" \n\"I think, pretty clearly, the three major influences on my work are Homer, Freud, and Nietzsche. Interestingly, however obvious this influence might be, few, if any, critics, commentators, or such, have called attention to it.\"\n\nIn the same interview, he said \"one of the pleasures of writing science fiction is the development of, and characterization of, alien life forms\".\n\nGor is described as a habitable planet in the Solar System that shares the same orbit as Earth, but it is linearly opposed to Earth and consequently always hidden by the Sun, making direct observation of it from Earth impossible. The flora, fauna and customs of Gor are intricately detailed. Norman populates his planet with the equivalents of Roman, Greek, Native American, Viking and other cultures. In the novels, these various population groups are transplants from Earth brought there by space-craft through the behind-the-scenes rulers of Gor, the Priest-Kings, an extraterrestrial species of insectoid appearance. The Gorean humans are permitted advanced architectural, agricultural and medical skills (including life extension), but are forced to remain primitive in the fields of transportation, communication and weaponry (at approximately the level of Classical Mediterranean civilization) due to restrictions on technology imposed by the Priest-Kings. The most advanced form of transportation is the riding of large predatory birds called \"tarns\" by masterful men known as \"tarnsmen\". The limitation of technology is imposed to ensure the safety of both the Priest-Kings and the other indigenous and transplanted beings on Gor, who would otherwise possibly come to harm due to humans' belligerent tendencies.\n\nThe planet Gor has lower gravity than the Earth (which allows for the existence of large flying creatures, and tall towers connected by aerial bridges in the cities) and would have an even lower gravity if not for the technology of the Priest-Kings. The known geography of Gor consists mainly of the western seaboard of a continent that runs from the Arctic in the north to south of the equator, with the Thassa ocean to the west, and the Voltai mountain range forming an eastern boundary at many latitudes. There are also offshore islands in the ocean and some relatively sparsely settled plains to the east of the Voltai. The word \"Gor\" itself means \"home stone\" in the Gorean language, the native language of the \"northern civilized cities of known Gor\" (which resemble ancient Greco-Roman city-states in many respects), and a widely spoken lingua franca in many other areas).\nMost of the novels in the series are action and sexual adventures, with many of the military engagements borrowing liberally from historic ones, such as the trireme battles of ancient Greece and the castle sieges of medieval Europe. Ar, the largest city in known Gor, has resemblances to the ancient city of Rome, and its land empire is opposed by the sea-power of the island of Cos.\n\nThe series is an overlapping of planetary romance and sword and planet. The first book, \"Tarnsman of Gor\", opens with scenes reminiscent of scenes in the first book of the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs; both feature the protagonist narrating his adventures after being transported to another world. These parallels end after the first few books, when the stories of the books begin to be structured along a loose plot arc involving the struggles of the city-state of Ar and the island of Cos to control the Vosk river area, as well as the struggles at a higher level between the non-human Priest-Kings and Kurii (another alien race) to control the solar system.\nMost of the books are narrated by transplanted British professor Tarl Cabot, master swordsman, as he engages in adventures involving Priest-Kings, Kurii, and humans. Books 7, 11, 19, 22, 26, 27, 31, 34 and parts of 32 are narrated by abducted Earth women who are made slaves. Books 14, 15, and 16 are narrated by male abductee Jason Marshall. Book 28 is narrated by an unknown Kur, but features Tarl Cabot. Book 30 and parts of 32 are narrated by three Gorean men: a mariner, a scribe and a merchant/slaver.\n\nThe series features several sentient alien races. The most important to the books are the insectoid Priest-Kings and the huge sharp-clawed predatory Kurii, both space-farers from foreign star systems. The Priest-Kings rule Gor as disinterested custodians, leaving humans to their own affairs as long as they abide by certain restrictions on technology. The Kurii are an aggressive, invasive race with advanced technology (but less so than that of the Priest-Kings) who wish to colonize both Gor and Earth. The power of the Priest-Kings is diminished after the \"Nest War\" described in the third book and the Priest-Kings and Kurii struggle against each other via their respective human agents and spies.\n\nEarly entries in the series were plot-driven space opera adventures, but later entries grew more philosophical and sexual. Many subplots run the course of several books and tie back to the main plot in later books. Some of these plots begin in the first book, but most are underway in the first ten books.\n\nDAW Books, which published the Gor series from the 8th volume (\"Hunters of Gor\") through the 25th volume (\"Magicians of Gor\"), subsequently decided to cease publication of the books, citing low sales; Norman attributes the decision to feminist influences, saying in 1996:\n\n\"Tarnsman of Gor\" was published in late 1966. It has been reprinted 22 times... I have recently signed contracts for fresh French and German sales, and have recently been published for the first time in Czechoslovakia. There have been recent Spanish and Italian sales. There's no evidence that my books no longer sell... After DAW refused to buy any more Gor books, I sold a three-part Telnarian series to Brian Thomsen of Warner Books. The first book, \"The Chieftain\", had a 67 percent sell-through. The second, \"The Captain\", had a 91 percent sell-through, which is the sort of thing that would make Stephen King rush over to shake your hand... Brian Thomsen, my Warner editor for the Telnarian series... was replaced by an editor from one of the blacklisting presses, one that \"explicitly\" informed my agent they would not consider anything by John Norman. That new editor canceled the series despite its success and without waiting to see how the third book, \"The King\", would do. That way things are made nicely clear...\n\n\"Unfortunately for me, only about seven or eight publishing houses maintain a mass-market paperback line in science fiction and fantasy; this small, knit group effectively controls the market. With such a group, a blacklist need not be an explicit, formal written or oral agreement subscribed to by a gathered cabal pledged to secrecy. It is an understanding that a certain individual is to be ostracized, excluded, methodologically overlooked or such.\"\n\nAll of John Norman's books are now published by E-Reads as ebooks and print copies. According to their website, \"they are among E-Reads’ biggest sellers\".\n\nA list of Gor books' first editions. Narrators other than Tarl Cabot are named after the publisher. \n\nTwo films have been made, \"Gor\" and \"Outlaw of Gor\" (also known as \"Outlaw\").\n\nWhile not officially connected to John Norman's work, \"Fencer of Minerva\" is a Japanese animated series containing many of the elements and ideas discussed in Gorean Philosophy.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, an attempt was made to publish an authorized graphic novel adaptation of the Gor series under Vision Entertainment. The project collapsed under a combination of financial issues and the nature of the imagery, which violated Canadian law, where the printer was located.\n\nIn 2017 the Gor series was adapted into a role-playing game for Postmortem Studios, written by James Desborough.\n\nThe \"Gor\" novels have been criticized for their focus on relationships between dominant men and submissive women, the latter often in positions of slavery. \"The Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" has stated that the first several books are \"passable exercises\" of Edgar Rice Burroughs style fiction while \"later volumes degenerate into extremely sexist, sadomasochistic pornography involving the ritual humiliation of women, and as a result have caused widespread offence\". Science fiction/fantasy author Michael Moorcock has suggested that the \"Gor\" novels should be placed on the top shelves of bookstores, saying, \"I’m not for censorship but I am for strategies which marginalize stuff that works to objectify women and suggests women enjoy being beaten.\"\n\n\n"}

Since the occupation of the Palestinian territories following the Six-Day War in 1967 down to 2015, it has been estimated by the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions that Israel has razed 48,488 Palestinian structures.\n\nDemolition may be done to enforce building codes and regulations, which in the occupied Palestinian territories are set by the Israeli military. IDF explanations for other house demolitions include use as a counter-insurgency security measure to impede or halt militant operations. Claims it functions as a potent deterrent against terrorism, in significantly decreasing Palestinian terrorists attacks, have been met with counter-claims, some from the Israeli Defense Forces, that the measure has no proven deterrent effectiveness and is counter-productive.\n\nHuman rights organizations and the United Nations criticize the ongoing demolitions of Palestinian homes as violating international law, and Amnesty International has contended that the Israeli government actually uses demolitions to collectively punish Palestinians and to seize property for the expansion of Israeli settlements.Theodor Meron advised the Israeli government in 1968, soon after the occupation of the Palestinian territories in the Six-Day War, that the practice contravened international law, in particular the Geneva Conventions.\n\nHouse demolitions have occasionally been used to remove illegal Israeli outposts, and in 2005 to dismantle the settlements in Gaza.\n\nThe practice originated under the British Mandate, when the government gave authority to military commanders to confiscate and raze “any house, structure or land... the inhabitants of which he is satisfied have committed… any offence against these Regulations involving violence.” During the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the British military frequently demolished homes in villages implicated in rebel activity, with entire villages sometimes being destroyed. Some 2,000 Arab homes were demolished during the Arab revolt. In 1945 the authorities passed the \"Defence (Emergency) Regulations\" and Regulation 119 made this practice available to the local Military Commander without limit or appeal. During the Jewish insurgency against the British in the 1940s, the British only employed this tactic one time against the Jews. In August 1947, after failing to quell the Jewish insurgency, the British military received clearance from the High Commissioner to demolish Jewish homes. Subsequently, a Jewish home in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Givat Shaul where arms were discovered during a routine search was destroyed.\n\nIn 1968, after Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza, Theodor Meron, then legal adviser to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, advised the Prime Minister's office in a top secret memorandum that house demolitions, even of suspected terrorists's residences, violated the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in war. Undertaking such measures, as though they were in continuity with British mandatory emergency regulations, might be useful as hasbara but were 'legally unconvincing'. The advice was ignored. His view, according to Gershom Gorenberg, is shared by nearly all scholars of international law, prominent Israeli experts included.\n\nIn a 1987 letter, the British said this regulation had been repealed in 1948. However, the repeal was not published in the Palestine Gazette, as required in law at that time, and Israel still operates the contentious policy of punitive military house demolition under the 1945 British DER 119.\n\nDuring the Second Intifada, the IDF adopted a policy of house demolition following a wave of suicide bombings. Israel justified the policy on the basis of deterrence against terrorism, and providing an incentive for families of potential suicide bombers to dissuade the bomber from attacking. Demolitions can also occur in the course of fighting. During Operation Defensive Shield, several IDF soldiers were killed early in the conflict while searching houses containing militants. In response, the IDF started employing a tactic of surrounding such houses, calling on the occupants (civilian and militant) to exit, and demolishing the house on top of the militants that do not surrender. This tactic, called \"Nohal Sir Lachatz\" \"Pressure Pot\", is now used whenever feasible (i.e., non multi-rise building that is separated from other houses). In some heavy fighting incidents, especially in the 2002 Battle of Jenin and Operation Rainbow in Rafah 2004, heavily armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozers were used to demolish houses to widen alleyways, uncover tunnels or to secure locations for IDF troops. The result was an indiscriminate use of demolitions against civilian housing unconnected to terrorism that left 1,000 people homeless in the Rafah Refugee Camp.\nAccording to a report by Amnesty International in 1999, house demolitions are usually done without prior warning and the home's inhabitants are given little time to evacuate. According to a 2004 HRW report, many families in Rafah own a \"cluster of homes\". For example, the family may own a \"small house from earlier days in the camp, often with nothing more than an asbestos roof\". Later, sons will build homes nearby when they start their own families. \n\nIn February 2005, the Ministry of Defense (Israel) ordered an end to the demolition of houses for the purpose of punishing the families of suicide bombers unless there is \"an extreme change in circumstances\". However, house demolitions continue for other reasons. In 2010 (to 9 Nov) 315 Palestinian-owned structures have been demolished in East Jerusalem and Area C (including 17 structures demolished by their owners following demolition orders). 402 people have been displaced and about 1,296 people have been otherwise affected.\n\nIn 2009, after a string of fatal attacks by Palestinian against Israelis in Jerusalem, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled in favor of the Israeli Defense Forces to seal with cement the family homes of Palestinian terrorists as a deterrent against terrorism.\n\nA January 2015 efficacy study by Benmelech, Berrebi and Klor distinguishes between “punitive demolitions”, in which homes belonging to the families of terror operatives are demolished, and “precautionary demolitions”, such as the demolition of a house well-positioned for use by Palestinian snipers. Their results, which The New Republic calls \"politically explosive\" indicate that \"precautionary demolitions\" have caused suicide attacks to increase, a “48.7 percent increase in the number of suicide terrorists from an average district,” while in the months immediately following a demolition, punitive demolitions caused terror attacks to decline by between 11.7 and 14.9 percent. However, Klor later described the effect of punitive demolitions as \"small, localized and diminish[ing] over time\" and suggested that the real reason they were carried out was \"to placate the Israeli public\".\n\nHouse demolition is typically justified by the IDF on the basis of:\n\nThe United Nations (UN) and human rights groups such as Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross who oppose the house demolitions reject the IDF's claims, and document numerous instances where they argue the IDF's claims do not apply. They accuse the Israeli government and IDF of other motives:\n\nAccording to the United Nations, about 1,500 homes were demolished by the IDF just in the Rafah area in the period 2000-2004.\n\nIn 2004, Human Rights Watch published the report 'Razing Rafah: Mass Home Demolitions in the Gaza Strip'. The report documented what it described as a \"pattern of illegal demolitions\" by the IDF in Rafah, a refugee camp and city at the southern end of the Gaza Strip on the border with Egypt where sixteen thousand people lost their homes after the Israeli government approved a plan to expand the de facto \"buffer zone\" in May 2004. The IDF’s main stated rationales for the demolitions were responding to and preventing attacks on its forces and the suppression of weapons smuggling through tunnels from Egypt\n\nDemolitions are carried out by the Israeli Army Combat Engineering Corps using armored bulldozers, usually Caterpillar D9, but also with excavators (for high multi-story buildings) and wheel loaders (for small houses with low risk) modified by the IDF. The heavily armored IDF Caterpillar D9 is often used when there is a risk demolishing the building (such as when armed insurgents are barricaded inside or the structure is rigged with explosive and booby traps). Multi-story buildings, flats, and explosive labs are demolished by explosive devices, set by IDF demolition experts of Yaalom's \"Sayeret Yael\". Amnesty International has also described house demolitions that were carried out by the IDF using \"powerful explosive charges\".\n\nThe use of house demolition under international law is today governed by the Fourth Geneva Convention, enacted in 1949, which protects non-combatants in occupied territories. Article 53 provides that \"Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons ... is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.\"\n\nHowever, Israel, which is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention, asserts that the terms of the Convention are not applicable to the Palestinian territories on the grounds that the territories do not constitute a state which is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention. This position is rejected by human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, which notes that \"it is a basic principle of human rights law that international human rights treaties are applicable in all areas in which states parties exercise effective control, regardless of whether or not they exercise sovereignty in that area.\"\n\nAs a punitive measure, one study by a Northwestern and Hebrew University group concluded that prompt demolitions brought about a lowering of suicide attacks for a month and that they are an effective deterrent against terrorism. They are related to the identity of the house’s owner, and result in a 'significant decrease' of Palestinian terrorists attacks. Conversely, an internal IDF report of 2005, analyzing the effectiveness of the policy during the Al-Aqsa Intifada in which 3,000 civilian homes were demolished, found that terror attacks increased after house demolitions, only stimulated hatred of Israel, the damage caused outweighed any benefits, and recommended the practice be dropped.\n\nAmnesty International has criticised the lack of due process in the use of house demolitions by Israel. Many demolitions are carried out with no warning or opportunity for the householder to appeal. In 2002, a proposed demolition case was appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court who ruled that there must be a right to appeal unless doing so would \"endanger the lives of Israelis or if there are combat activities in the vicinity.\" In a later ruling the Supreme Court decided that demolitions without advanced warning or due process can be carried out if advance notice would hinder demolition. Amnesty describes this as \"a virtual green light\" to demolition with no warning.\nThe effectiveness of house demolitions as a deterrence has been questioned. In 2005 an Israeli Army commission to study house demolitions found no proof of effective deterrence and concluded that the damage caused by the demolitions overrides its effectiveness. As a result, the IDF approved the commission's recommendations to end punitive demolitions of Palestinian houses.\n\nA number of human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, oppose the practice. Human Rights Watch has argued that the practice violates international laws against collective punishment, the destruction of private property, and the use of force against civilians.\n\nIsraeli historian Yaacov Lozowick, however, implied that there is a moral basis for demolishing the houses of families of suicide bombers, stating:\n\"Demolishing the homes of civilians merely because a family member has committed a crime is immoral. If, however... potential suicide murderers... will refrain from killing out of fear that their mothers will become homeless, it would be immoral to leave the Palestinian mothers untouched in their homes while Israeli children die on their school buses.\"\n\nIn May 2004, The Israeli Foreign Ministry publicly stated:\n\"...other means employed by Israel against terrorists is the demolition of homes of those who have carried out suicide attacks or other grave attacks, or those who are responsible for sending suicide bombers on their deadly missions. Israel has few available and effective means in its war against terrorism. This measure is employed to provide effective deterrence of the perpetrators and their dispatchers, not as a punitive measure. This practice has been reviewed and upheld by the High Court of Justice\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticised the Israeli government's plans to demolish Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem calling the action a violation of international obligations.\n\nHouse demolition has been used in an on-again-off-again fashion by the Israeli government during the Second Intifada. More than 3,000 homes have been destroyed in this way. House demolition was used to destroy the family homes of Saleh Abdel Rahim al-Souwi, perpetrator of the Tel Aviv bus 5 massacre, and Yahya Ayyash, Hamas's chief bomb maker, known as \"the engineer\", as well as the perpetrators of the First and second Jerusalem bus 18 massacres, and the Ashkelon bus station bombing.\n\nAccording to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem:\n\nIn November 2008 B'Tselem filmed an armed Israeli Policeman wearing a riot helmet headbutt a Palestinian women. The confrontation occurred during a protest, after the Jerusalem municipality destroyed two houses because it said they were built without permission.\n\nSome house demolitions are allegedly performed because the houses may have been built without permits, or are in violation of various building codes, ordinances or regulations. Some International human rights groups and community figures claim that Israeli authorities are in fact systematically denying building permit requests in Arab areas as a means of appropriating land. This is disputed by Israeli sources, who claim that both Arabs and Jews enjoy a similar rate of application approvals.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, \"The destruction of Palestinian homes, agricultural land and other property in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is inextricably linked with Israel’s long-standing policy of appropriating as much as possible of the land it occupies, notably by establishing Israeli settlements.\" In October 1999, during the \"Peace Process\" and before the start of the Al Aqsa Intefada, Amnesty International wrote that: \"well over one third of the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem live under threat of having their house demolished. ... Threatened houses exist in almost every street and it is probable that the great majority of Palestinians live in or next to a house due for demolition.\"\n\n\"House demolitions ostensibly occur because the homes are built 'illegally' - i.e. without a permit. Officials and spokespersons of the Israeli government have consistently maintained that the demolition of Palestinian houses is based on planning considerations and is carried out according to the law. ... But the Israeli policy has been based on discrimination. Palestinians are targeted for no other reasons than that they are Palestinians. ... [Israel has] discriminated in the application of the law, strictly enforcing planning prohibitions where Palestinian houses are built and freely allowing amendments to the plans to promote development where Israelis are setting up settlements.\"\n\nDr. Meir Margalit of Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions writes:\n\"The thinking is that a national threat calls for a national response, invariably aggressive. Accordingly, a Jewish house without a permit is an urban problem; but a Palestinian home without a permit is a strategic threat. A Jew building without a permit is ‘cocking a snook at the law’; a Palestinian doing the same is defying Jewish sovereignty over Jerusalem.\"\n\nThe Palestinian village Aqabah, located in the northeastern West Bank, is currently being threatened by demolition orders issued by the Israeli Civil Administration against the entire village. The Civil Administration had previously expropriated large areas of privately registered land in the village, and as of May 2008 it has threatened to demolish the following structures: the mosque, the British government-funded medical clinic, the internationally funded kindergarten, the Rural Women's Association building, the roads, the water tank, and nearly all private homes. According to the Rebuilding Alliance, a California-based organization that opposes house demolitions, Haj Sami Sadek, the mayor of the village, has circulated an open letter asking for assistance. Gush Shalom, the Israeli Peace Bloc, and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions are said to be supporting the campaign.\n\nIn May 2008, a UN agency said that thousands of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank risk being displaced as the Israeli authorities threaten to tear down their homes and in some cases entire communities. \"To date, more than 3,000 Palestinian-owned structures in the West Bank have pending demolition orders, which can be immediately executed without prior warning,\" the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report.\n\nStatistics have been compiled by ICAHD recording the number of demolitions of existing houses in the two parts of Jerusalem. According to ICAHD, there are many more building violations in the western (Jewish) parts of Jerusalem, but the great majority of actual demolitions are carried out in the eastern (Palestinian) parts. ICAHD statistics on house demolitions in Jerusalem were cited in the \"2005 County Reports on Human Rights Practices\" by the United States Department of State. For 2004 and 2005 ICAHD's figures are as follows:\nICAHD's report further claims that building inspectors record only a small proportion of the infractions in West Jerusalem (usually illegal extensions or porches), and say that no entire residential building in the Western section has ever received demolition orders or been demolished. ICAHD claims that: \"The Jerusalem Municipality expropriates land, prevents preparation of a town planning scheme for Palestinian neighborhoods, and refuses to grant building permits, causing a severe housing shortage, forcing residents to build without a permit, after which the Ministry of Interior and the Municipality demolish the houses, so the residents move into homes outside the city, and then the Ministry of Interior revokes their residency and banishes them from the city forever\".\n\nICAHD's conclusions have been disputed by the Israeli Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, who argue on their website that the larger number of Palestinian demolitions is simply because many more Palestinian homes have been built illegally. They claim to have \"document[ed] a pattern of motivated behavior and criminal profiteering that characterizes much of the construction in the Arab sector of the Holy City\", notwithstanding the punitive house demolitions, which have been effective as a deterrent against terrorism by means of a 'significant decrease' Palestinian terrorists attacks.\n\nStatistics quoted by CAMERA and FMEP:\n\nThough the statistics do not show the nationality of the permit requestee nor the nationality of the land owner, CAMERA argues that these figures show that the denial of permits to Arabs and Jews is not based on the ethnicity of the applicant, but instead is generally meant to uphold Israeli master plans and building codes.\n\nIn contrast, Amnesty International highlight in these figures the small number of Palestinian permit requests (only about 10 percent of the Israeli requests), and argue that this is indicative of the tiny (and ever-shrinking) percentage of land that the Palestinians have available for their use. In 2008 Nicoletta Dimova wrote in the Palestine-Israel Journal that \"today, the city's Palestinians are only allowed to build on about 9% of the 17,600 acres of land comprising East Jerusalem\", the remainder having been expropriated by Israeli authorities for use by Israeli settlers or as land where Israel currently permits no construction.\n\nAccording to B'tselem, since the 1993 Oslo Accords Israel has issued over 14,600 demolition orders for Palestinian infrastructure, of which it has destroyed roughly 2,925. In the period 2000-2012, Palestinian were given only 211 permits to build, from 2009-2012, only 27 permits were given. In 2014, according to Ma'an News Agency, citing Bimkom, only one such permit was issued.\n\nIn 2005, the Israeli government demolished many houses of Israeli settlers who were transferred in accordance with the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said this was done by request of the Palestinian Authorities. Houses have also been demolished in several Jewish outposts such as Amona.\n\nIn February 2017, Israeli forces began an operation to evacuate settlers from the West Bank outpost of Amona after the Supreme Court stated that it must be demolished by 8 February.\n\n\n"}

A large number of pertinent artifacts were gathered to be displayed at Louisiana's exhibition at this fair. After the Exposition, it was decided that this collection should be stored, expanded, and displayed. The Louisiana State Museum was established in 1906 to fulfill this role. The Presbytere and the Cabildo buildings, located on either side of the St. Louis Cathedral on Jackson Square, were some of the first properties that the Louisiana State Museum was lodged in. The Louisiana State Museum now has thirteen properties around the state: historic structures, museums open to the public, and modern purpose-built buildings.\n\nOver the past 100-plus years, the Louisiana State Museum has not only operated museums and maintained buildings, but it has served as the repository for all things historic from the state’s past. As Louisiana has been part of a French colony, a Spanish colony, Napoleon’s short-lived property, the United States' Louisiana Purchase territory, and finally the state of Louisiana; the Louisiana State Museum’s collections of artifacts and documents are an important asset for understanding state, national, and even global history.\n\nIn addition to protecting and preserving Louisiana’s historic artifacts and buildings, the Louisiana State Museum is proactive in many areas concerning the state’s unique culture and history. Several new museum sites have opened in the last ten years or so, including the Wedell-Williams Aviation & Cypress Sawmill Museum - Patterson location, the Performing Arts Center at the New Orleans Mint, the Capitol Park Museum - Baton Rouge, and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame & Northwest Louisiana History Museum – Natchitoches. In addition to opening new facilities, the State Museum is continually creating new temporary and permanent exhibits, bringing to light intriguing topics from Louisiana’s culture and history. The Museum hosts an array of programs such as lecture series, school group educational tours, walking tours of historic districts, and musical performances.\n\nNumerous organizations exist throughout Louisiana to support the Museum including the Louisiana Museum Foundation, Friends of the Cabildo, Friends of the Capitol Park Museum, Wedell-Williams and Cypress Sawmill Foundation, Friends of Louisiana Sports and History, and Friends of the E.D. White Historic Site.\n\n\n\n\nThe Capitol Park Museum - Baton Rouge features thematic exhibits on the diverse aspects of Louisiana history, industry, and culture. The museum includes two permanent exhibitions, entitled \"Grounds for Greatness: Louisiana and the Nation,\" and \"Experiencing Louisiana: Discovering the Soul of America.\"\n\nOfficial website\n\nThe Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame & Northwest Louisiana History Museum – Natchitoches is the Louisiana State Museum's newest facility. The Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame exhibit is a collection of portraits and memorabilia celebrating the achievements of more than 300 legendary Louisiana athletes, coaches, and other sports figures.\nThe Northwest Louisiana History Museum explores the evolution of unique cultural traditions from early native-American civilizations to the present.\n\nOfficial website\n\nThe Wedell-Williams Aviation & Cypress Sawmill Museum - Patterson is a modern purpose-built facility located in Acadiana. The Wedell-Williams Aviation Collection focuses on the legacy of Louisiana aviation pioneers Jimmie Wedell and Harry Williams, who formed an air service in Patterson in 1928, while the Patterson Cypress Sawmill Collection documents the history of the cypress lumber industry in Louisiana.\n\nOfficial website\n\nThe E. D. White Historic Site, located in Thibodaux, is the 1800s plantation home of Edward Douglass White, Sr., who was governor from 1835 to 1839, and his son, Edward Douglass White, who was appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1894 and served as chief justice from 1910 to 1921. The E.D. White House exhibits trace the region's history with sections about the Chitimacha Natives, early Acadian settlers, sugar cane agriculture, slavery, and the White family.\n\nOfficial website\n\nThe Louisiana State Museum has two main collections facilities in New Orleans. The main collections facility is located within the French Quarter. This facility houses Visual Arts, Costumes & Textiles, Science & Technology, and the Decorative Arts Collection.\n\nThe second facility is the Old U.S. Mint on Esplanade Avenue, which houses the Document Archives and Jazz & Music Archives. The Mint houses the Louisiana Historical Center, which gives amateur and professional researchers the opportunity to access the Document Archives. In addition to maps and manuscripts, the Center houses sheet music, microfilm, scrapbooks, pamphlets, and newspapers.\n\nBoth collections facilities are accessible by appointment only.\n\nOfficial website\n\n\n\n\n"}

The United States with Ellis Island, Australia, Canada, and more recently several European countries — e.g., France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — have been creating such venues to facilitate transmission between generations as well as encounters between migrants and the host populations, by telling their personal story.\n\nWhile these initiatives also serve the duty to remember, they seem to have three main objectives: \"Acknowledge, integrate and build awareness\"\n\n\nGiven the international scene and the latest events, from the Van Gogh affair in the Netherlands in 2004 to the so-called ‘crise des banlieues’ in France in 2005there is an urgent need to give the migrant generations (the youth as well as their parents) a voice, in order to foster inclusion, integration and the right to difference. Listening to individual stories may help to deconstruct stereotypes. Memory, History and Narration may also allow to take a step back and to consider the complete picture.\n\nMigration museums also face common challenges, in that they intend to be not only a venue for conservation and exhibition, but also and above all a lively meeting place. The challenge is not so much to bring in the intellectuals, academics, researchers, historians, traditional visitors of museums (the converted) but to attract the general public, those with preconceived ideas on immigration and the migrants themselves.\n\nIn addition to the following list, there are many local heritage initiatives and smaller museums which have increasingly focused on migration as a part of the narrative they portray.\n\nArgentina \n\nAustralia \nMigration Museum, Adelaide - Australia's oldest migration museum\n\nBrazil \n\nCanada \n\nDenmark\nFrance \n\nGermany \n\nIreland \n\nIsrael \n\nItaly \n\nNorway \n\nPoland\nPortugal \n\nSan Marino \n\nSerbia \n\nSouth Africa \n\nSpain \n\nSweden \n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nUnited States \n\nUruguay \n\nOther countries such as Switzerland and Belgium have support for national museums of migration but both of these have been put on hold because of lack of funding.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14264841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14264841", "title": "Moberly–Jourdain incident", "text": "Moberly–Jourdain incident\n\nThe Moberly–Jourdain incident (also the Ghosts of Petit Trianon or Versailles, / \"les fantômes de Versailles\") is a claim of time travel and hauntings made by Charlotte Anne Moberly (1846–1937) and Eleanor Jourdain (1863–1924).\n\nIn 1911, Moberly and Jourdain published a book entitled \"An Adventure\" under the names of \"Elizabeth Morison\" and \"Frances Lamont\". Their book describes a visit they made to the \"Petit Trianon\", a small \"château\" in the grounds of the Palace of Versailles where they claimed to have seen the gardens as they had been in the late eighteenth century as well as ghosts, including Marie Antoinette and others. Their story caused a sensation and was subject to much ridicule.\n\nMoberly, born in 1846, was the tenth of fifteen children. She came from a professional background; her father, George Moberly, was the headmaster of Winchester College and later Bishop of Salisbury. In 1886 Moberly became the first Principal of a hall of residence for young women, St. Hugh's College in Oxford. It became apparent that Moberly needed someone to help run the college, and Jourdain was asked to become Moberly's assistant.\nJourdain, born in 1863, was the eldest of ten children. Her father, the Reverend Francis Jourdain, was the vicar of Ashbourne in Derbyshire. She was the sister of art historian Margaret Jourdain and mathematician Philip Jourdain. She went to school in Manchester, unlike most girls of the time who were educated at home.\n\nJourdain was also the author of several textbooks, ran a school of her own, and after the incident became the vice-Principal of St. Hugh's College. Before Jourdain was appointed, it was decided that the two women should get to know one another better; Jourdain owned an apartment in Paris where she tutored English children, and so Moberly went to stay with her.\n\nAccording to Moberly and Jourdain, the two women decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they travelled by train to Versailles. They did not think much of the palace after touring it, so they decided to walk through the gardens to the \"Petit Trianon\". On the way, they reached the \"Grand Trianon\" and found it was closed to the public.\n\nThey travelled with a Baedeker guidebook, but the two women soon became lost after missing the turn for the main avenue, \"Allée des Deux Trianons\". They passed this road, and entered a lane, where unknown to them they passed their destination. Moberly noticed a woman shaking a white cloth out of a window and Jourdain noticed an old deserted farmhouse, outside of which was an old plough.\n\nAt this point they claimed that a feeling of oppression and dreariness came over them. They then saw some men who looked like palace gardeners, who told them to go straight on. Moberly later described the men as \"very dignified officials, dressed in long greyish green coats with small three-cornered hats.\" Jourdain noticed a cottage with a woman and a girl in the doorway. The woman was holding out a jug to the girl. Jourdain described it as a \"tableau vivant\", a living picture, much like Madame Tussauds waxworks. Moberly did not observe the cottage, but felt the atmosphere change. She wrote: \"Everything suddenly looked unnatural, therefore unpleasant; even the trees seemed to become flat and lifeless, like wood worked in tapestry. There were no effects of light and shade, and no wind stirred the trees.\"\n\nThey reached the edge of a wood, close to the \"Temple de l'Amour\", and came across a man seated beside a garden kiosk, wearing a cloak and large shady hat. According to Moberly, his appearance was \"most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough.\" Jourdain noted \"The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, and though I did not feel that he was looking particularly at us, I felt a repugnance to going past him. A man later described as \"tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat\" came up to them, and showed them the way to the \"Petit Trianon\".\nAfter crossing a bridge, they reached the gardens in front of the palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.\n\nAfter this, they were directed round to the entrance and joined a party of other visitors. After touring the house, they had tea at the \"Hotel des Reservoirs\" before returning to Jourdain's apartment.\n\nAfter leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly mentioned the incident to one another until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister and when she got to the afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the \"Petit Trianon\" was haunted. Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.\n\nThey visited the Trianon gardens again on several occasions, but were unable to trace the path they took. Various landmarks, such as the kiosk and the bridge, were missing, and the grounds were full of people. Trying to come up with an explanation, they wondered if they had stumbled across a private party or an event booked that day. However, they found that nothing had been booked that afternoon. During their research, they thought they recognised the man by the kiosk as the Comte de Vaudreuil, a friend of Marie Antoinette, who herself had been thought to have been seen by Moberly.\n\nConvinced that the grounds were haunted, they decided to publish their findings in a book \"An Adventure\" (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously on the grounds of the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of \"An Adventure\" was not made public until 1931.\n\nBoth women are reported to have had many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure. In one of them, Moberly claimed to have seen in the Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine, a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga; he was not observed by anybody else. During the First World War, Jourdain, the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh's, became convinced that a German spy was hiding in the college. After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour, she died suddenly in 1924 in the middle of an academic scandal over her leadership of the college, her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff. Moberly died in 1937.\n\nThe story of the adventure was made into a TV movie, \"Miss Morison's Ghosts\", in 1981, with Dame Wendy Hiller as Moberly/Morison. The BBC broadcast a 90-minute radio dramatization in 2004 and 2015.\n\nIn addition to the explanation by the women that they had been caught up in what is now called a time slip and had observed ghosts from the past, a non-supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by Philippe Jullian in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet Robert de Montesquiou. At the time of Moberly and Jourdain's excursion to Versailles, Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments. Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party. The Marie-Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross-dresser, the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself. It was suggested that a gathering of the French decadent avant-garde of the time could have made a sinister impression on the two middle-class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company.\n\nIn a review of the history of the Moberly-Jourdain adventure and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women. Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story.\n\nWithout fully endorsing the de Montesquiou explanation, Michael Coleman carefully examined the story and, in particular, the two published versions of the ladies' accounts (the earlier-written of which, from November 1901, had only previously been published in the second, small print-run, edition of \"An Adventure\" in 1913). Coleman concluded that the more widely available texts, as published in the 1911 and later editions, had been considerably embroidered well after the events described and after the ladies had begun their investigations, while the original accounts had little or nothing to suggest a supernatural experience. He also questioned the rigour and reliability of the ladies' subsequent researches, pointing out that few, if any, of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources.\n\nPsychologist Leonard Zusne suggested that incident was a \"hallucinatory experience\" that was embellished over time by information gathered after the fact.\n\nBrian Dunning of Skeptoid researched much of the evidence and concluded that \"Moberly and Jourdain were simply human\" and were mistaken. He notes that in the second edition of \"An Adventure\", it is revealed that Moberly did not mention the sketching woman until three months after their visit to Versailles, while Jourdain did not remember such a thing, and that Moberly did not remember much of what Jourdain described. \"It was only after much discussion, note-sharing, and historical research that Moberly and Jourdain came up with the time period as 1789 and assigned identities to a few of the characters they saw, including Marie Antoinette herself as the lady sketching on the lawn.\"\n\nDame Joan Evans, who owned the copyright to \"An Adventure\", accepted the Jullian explanation and forbade any further editions. However, after the work came out of copyright, it was republished in 1988 as \"The Ghosts of Trianon: The Complete 'An Adventure\"' by Thoth Publication and again in 2008 by CreateSpace, both times crediting Moberly and Jourdain as the authors.\n\nHistorian Roy Strong has noted that although the Moberly-Jourdain story has been debunked it \"retained its hold on the public imagination for half a century.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39270409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39270409", "title": "Palestinian Declaration of Independence", "text": "Palestinian Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Palestinian Declaration of Independence is a statement written by the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish and proclaimed by Yasser Arafat on 15 November 1988 (5 Rabi' al-Thani 1409). It had previously been adopted by the Palestinian National Council, the legislative body of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), by a vote of 253 in favour 46 against and 10 abstentions. It was read at the closing session of the 19th Palestinian National Council to a standing ovation. Upon completing the reading of the declaration, Arafat, as Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization assumed the title of \"President of Palestine.\" In April 1989, the PLO Central Council elected Yasser Arafat the first President of the State of Palestine.\n\nOn 28 October 1974, the 1974 Arab League summit held in Rabat designated the PLO as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and reaffirmed their right to establish an independent state of urgency.\"\n\nLegal justification for the declaration was based on United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947, which provided for the termination and partition of the British Mandate into two states. On 14 May 1948 the British mandate ended, the State of Israel was declared and the Arab Legion of Transjordan (later Jordan) invaded the West Bank (only to annex it in 1950). In September 1948 Egyptian forces captured the Gaza strip and kept it under military rule. Until the Six-Day War in June 1967 these two territories remained under Jordanian and Egyptian rule.\n\nDespite the 1988 proclamation of the State of Palestine, at the time the Palestine Liberation Organization did not exercise control over any territory, and designated Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, which was under Israeli control and claimed by it as Israel's capital. The PLO was hence a government in exile between 1988 and 1994.\n\nThe PLO began to exercise a limited rule in the Areas A and B of the West Bank and part of the Gaza Strip as a consequence of the 1994 Gaza-Jericho Agreement, under the umbrella of the Palestinian National Authority. In 2012, Palestine was upgraded to the status of non-member observer state in the UN.\n\nThe declaration concerned the Palestine region, as defined by the borders of the British Mandate of Palestine, which includes the whole of the State of Israel as well as the West Bank and the Gaza strip (at the time part of the Israeli Civil Administration). It references the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine of 1947 and \"UN resolutions since 1947\" in general as providing legitimacy to Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe Partition Plan served as the basis for Israel's declaration of independence, but was not accepted by the Palestinian Arab leadership at the time. Though, in September 1948, the All-Palestine Government was declared within the Gaza Strip as an Egyptian protectorate and recognized by most members of the Arab League, which is regarded by some as the first attempt to establish an independent Palestinian state; All-Palestine had however been dissolved by Egypt several years later. The 1988 declaration does not explicitly recognize the State of Israel. However, an accompanying document that explicitly mentions UN Security Council Resolution 242, and Yasser Arafat's statements in Geneva a month later were accepted by the United States as sufficient to interpret the declaration as recognizing Israel in its pre-1967 boundaries.\n\nThe declaration's reference to Palestine being the \"land of the three monotheistic faiths\" has been held as recognising the Jewish historical connection to the land, instead of arguing that Jews are colonists and foreigners in the land. Referring to \"the historical injustice inflicted on the Palestinian Arab people resulting in their dispersion and depriving them of their right to self-determination,\" the declaration recalled the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) and UN General Assembly Resolution 181 as supporting the rights of Palestinians and Palestine. The declaration then proclaims a \"State of Palestine on our Palestinian territory with its capital Jerusalem\". The borders of the state are not specified. The population of the state was referred to by the statement: \"The State of Palestine is the state of Palestinians wherever they may be\". The state was defined as an Arab country by the statement: \"The State of Palestine is an Arab state, an integral and indivisible part of the Arab nation\".\n\nThe declaration was accompanied by a PNC call for multilateral negotiations on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 242. This call was later termed \"the Historic Compromise\", as it implied acceptance of the \"two-state solution\", namely that it no longer questioned the legitimacy of the State of Israel. The PNC's political communiqué accompanying the declaration called only for withdrawal from \"Arab Jerusalem\" and the other \"Arab territories occupied.\" Yasser Arafat's statements in Geneva a month later were accepted by the United States as sufficient to remove the ambiguities it saw in the declaration and to fulfill the longheld conditions for open dialogue with the United States.\n\nAs a result of the declaration, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) convened, inviting Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the PLO to give an address. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 43/177 was adopted \"acknowledging the proclamation of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council on 15 November 1988,\" and it was further decided that \"the designation 'Palestine' should be used in place of the designation 'Palestine Liberation Organization' in the United Nations system.\" One hundred and four states voted for this resolution, forty-four abstained, and two - the United States and Israel - voted against. By mid-December, 75 states had recognised Palestine, rising to 93 states by February 1989.\n\nOn 29 November 2012, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 67/19 upgrading Palestine to non-member observer state status in the United Nations. It was adopted by the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly on the date of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and the 65th anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 181(II) on the Future Government of Palestine. The draft resolution was proposed by Palestine's representative at the United Nations. It, however, maintains the status of the Palestinian Liberation Organization as the representative of the Palestinian people within the United Nations system.\n\nOn 31 December 2014, the United Nations Security Council voted down a resolution demanding the end of Israeli occupation and Palestinian statehood by 2017. Eight members voted for the Resolution (Russia, China, France, Argentina, Chad, Chile, Jordan, Luxembourg). However the resolution did not get the minimum of nine votes needed to pass the resolution. Australia and the United States voted against the resolution, with the United Kingdom, Lithuania, Nigeria, South Korea and Rwanda abstaining.\n\n"}

It is housed in a purpose-built Neoclassical building erected between 1902 and 1913 to Vasily Svinyin's design in the proximity of the Old Michael Palace (which accommodates the art collection of the Russian Museum). It occupies the place of the eastern service wing, the stables and the laundry of the palace. \n\nThe museum's first exhibits were the gifts received by the Russian Tsars from peoples of Imperial Russia. These were supplemented by regular expeditions to various parts of the Russian Empire which began in 1901. Further exhibits were purchased by Nicholas II of Russia and other members of his family (as state financing was not enough to purchase new exhibits). A collection of Buddhist religious objects was acquired for the museum by Prince Esper Ukhtomsky. Prince Tenishev, a wealthy industrialist, donated to the museum the archives of his private ethnographic bureau that had been documenting the life of Russian peasants since the 19th century.\n\nThe collection was not officially opened to the general public until 1923 and was not detached from the Russian Museum until 1934. When the Museum of the Peoples of the USSR in Moscow (successor to the Dashkov Museum) was shut down in 1948, its collections were transferred to the Ethnographic Museum in Leningrad. This museum should not be confused with the much older Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, popularly known as the Kunstkamera.\n\n"}
{"id": "40611796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40611796", "title": "Smithsonian Affiliations", "text": "Smithsonian Affiliations\n\nSmithsonian Affiliations is a division of the Smithsonian Institution that establishes long-term partnerships with non-Smithsonian museums and educational and cultural organizations, in order to share collections, exhibitions and educational strategies and conduct joint research.\n\nPartner organizations are known as \"Smithsonian Affiliates\" and are allowed to use the tag line \"In Association with the Smithsonian Institution\" and the approved Smithsonian Affiliations logo on their website, programming, and marketing material. Any 501(c)(3) nonprofit or publicly operated educational entity can apply to become a Smithsonian Affiliate.\n\nThe Smithsonian Affiliations program was established in 1996 by Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman with the approval of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, in response to several challenges the Institution faced at the time: a decrease in federal funding, limited storage space for expanding collections, and the need to make the Institution more reflective of the nation without operating additional museums outside of Washington, D.C. \n\nIn 1993, the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution introduced the first proposal for initiatives promoting strategic, collections-based partnerships at the Institution. The Commission, composed of 22 members appointed by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, was charged with examining the Institution's ability to uphold James Smithson's vision of an organization dedicated to \"the increase and diffusion of knowledge\" despite a changing society and increasing financial hardships. Of the four initiatives proposed by the Commission: Educate More of the Nation's People; Collections, Research and Exhibitions; Governance; and Assure the Future, two directly called for the creation of strategic partnerships and making artifacts in the collections accessible to other museums.\n\nTo Educate More of the Nation's People: \"Build collaborative partnerships with other museums, research centers, and educational institutions throughout the nation.\"\n\nCollections, Research and Exhibitions: \"Shape a master plan for maintenance of the priceless collections, including the sharing of collections through long-term or permanent loans to partner institutions.\"\n\nSignificant emphasis was placed on the benefits that partnerships with outside museums would create for the Institution. By dispersing artifacts to museums in a responsible way, the Commission believed it, \"could make the Institution more reflective of our nation… [as well as] address the problem of storing, curating, studying, and exhibiting the constantly growing collections.\"\n\nIn 1996, during his second year as Secretary, Heyman observed several challenges facing the Institution. Closely aligned with the announcements presented by the \"Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution\" in 1993, Heyman was faced with the challenges of dwindling storage for expanding collections, decreasing funds, and the need to reinforce the Smithsonian's identity as the nation's museum. In addition, the Institution began to see increased interest from outside museums for partnerships and loans of artifacts that extended beyond standing practices. Although collaborative agreements in the form of traveling exhibitions, joint exhibition sponsorship, and loans had been entered in the past by different Smithsonian museums, no infrastructure existed to provide institution-wide oversight and coordination of such partnerships. Heyman responded to these challenges by creating the Smithsonian Affiliations program to oversee and manage collections-based partnerships with other museums. As stated by the minutes from the Smithsonian Board of Regents meeting housed in the Smithsonian Institution Archives, the program was formally approved by the Board of Regents on September 15, 1996.\n\nUsing the occasion of the Smithsonian Institution's 150th Anniversary, Smithsonian Affiliations was one of several outreach initiatives introduced by Heyman to expand the Institution's reach nationally.\n\n\"The Smithsonian of the future must provide access to its collections and its vast resources. There is no value in being just the largest if we do not share the Smithsonian with as many people as possible. It means making sure those who cannot travel to Washington can somehow experience and enjoy the Smithsonian.\" – Secretary I. Michael Heyman \n\nThe program was received by museums across the country. The end of the fiscal year 1997 recognized 21 organizations as Affiliates. As of 2017, there are over 200 Affiliates.\n\nSmithsonian Affiliations considers membership proposals from organizations that will advance the Smithsonian Institution's mission and strategic plan. Successful applicants are non-profit or publicly operated organizations whose missions are directed toward advancing research, knowledge, and education in science, history, and the arts. The guidelines of Smithsonian Affiliations establishes that the Smithsonian Institution maintain appropriate control over all collections loaned and that Affiliates cover all costs associated with borrowing and exhibiting objects. To qualify as an Affiliate, an organization must prove that it is able to properly care for, protect, and exhibit Smithsonian collections on a long-term basis. Strong applicants are organizations that are fiscally sound and capable of developing, installing, and evaluating professional exhibitions.\n\nWhile serving as an Affiliate, organizations are required to grant Smithsonian Institution curators and personnel access to visit borrowed artifacts, provide the Smithsonian with reports and information necessary to monitor the state of the partnership, and uphold the integrity of the Board of Regents. Affiliates are also responsible for maintaining an annual membership fee.\n\nTo become an Affiliate, organizations must submit an application package to Smithsonian Affiliations. Applicants are required to provide documentation that confirms IRS status as a 501(c)3 entity and a narrative detailing how the agreement will be mutually beneficial. Applications must also include a copy of the institution's mission statement, an organizational chart, an annual report, and a facilities report that follows the American Alliance of Museums format. Once approved, Affiliates are required to sign a Smithsonian Affiliations Agreement form and are assigned a National Outreach Manager to oversee loans and projects. All loan agreements are set for defined period of time.\n\nAffiliate organizations participate in a number of professional training, outreach, and programming initiatives coordinated by the Smithsonian Affiliations office.\n\nThe Smithsonian Affiliations program supports, develops, and organizes a number of collaborative programs to promote education in science, art, history, and culture.\n\nAffiliate organizations exchange ideas, professional research, and information about programming and exhibitions through a variety of activities including lecture, traveling exhibitions, workshops and reciprocal membership.\n\nAffiliate organizations share research, exhibitions, and institutional updates through a variety of social media including the Smithsonian Affiliations website, the Affiliate Blog, the quarterly newsletter \"The Affiliate\", the electronic newsletter \"E-Affiliate\", YouTube, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe following are representative samples of loans of artifacts, works of art, and scientific specimens loaned by the Smithsonian Institution to Smithsonian Affiliate organizations.\n\nThe National Museum of American History loaned the Pioneer (locomotive), a Civil War-era locomotive, to the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland for the exhibit \"The War Came by Train\".\n\nThomas Moran's painting \"The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone\", in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, was loaned to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyoming.

In later years the building served first as a school and then as a blacksmith shop. Constructed of limestone, the cottage’s stone exterior was laid in straight courses rather than in the more common scatterstone technique, creating lending the exterior walls an even, harmonious pattern.\n\nWhen the Shelburne Museum purchased the cottage in 1947, only the exterior shell remained. When the Museum moved the structure to the grounds two years later, staff members numbered each stone individually before transporting the cottage piece by piece to reassemble it in its present location. By luck a direct descendant of the original occupants heard about the project. Her recollections of the interior enabled Museum staff to duplicate the original floor plan and furnishings, including the wrought-iron door latch that she had removed years before when the building began to slip into ruin. The restoration of the cottage made use of old beams and materials from local abandoned barns and homes. The furniture, textiles, and household goods exhibited in Stone Cottage evoke the simple lifestyle of agricultural workers in the mid-19th century.\n\nSmokehouses, similar to the one behind Stone Cottage, which was built in Charlotte, Vermont in 1820, were a staple of American farm life and remained in common use until the late 19th century. Typically small stone structures with dirt floors, smokehouses possessed a confined interior chamber that enabled farmers to easily preserve meat. As such, the major structural requirement of a smokehouse was that the building be airtight, although chimneys and small vents were sometimes installed to regulate the density of smoke. Traditionally, farmers would soak butchered cuts in brine and then hang them in their smokehouse above a smoldering fire of corncobs and hickory wood, giving the meat its distinctive flavor. Meats remained in place for several days, or sometimes weeks, to complete the process.\n\n"}
{"id": "54027143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54027143", "title": "The Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis", "text": "The Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis\n\nThe Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis is a 15th-century chronicle which reports the murder of James I of Scotland and its aftermath, including the execution of his killers. The chronicle was, according to a note in one of the manuscripts, originally written in Latin and then translated by John Shirley.\n\nThree manuscripts have the text, two from the 15th century (BL Additional MSS. 38690 and 5467) and one from the 17th century (National Library of Scotland Advocates MS 17.1.22, likely a copy of BL Add. 38690). In BL Add. 38690, originally a roll which was later cut into an 18-page manuscript, it occupies fols. 9–15, written in the same hand as the first three items (one a \"complaint\" by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester read in parliament, the other two documents pertaining to the release of Charles, Duke of Orléans). In BL Add. 5467, a 224-page manuscript that includes texts on horticulture and cooking, it occupies fols. 72v-84v. The third is a late 17th-century manuscript, with \"The Dethe\" on fols. 13–25, copied from BL Add 38690 (also copied was the complaint by Humphrey).\n\nBL Add 5467 claims \"The Dethe\" was translated by John Shirley from an unknown Latin poem, which Lister M. Matheson accepts on evidence of \"numerous spelling peculiarities\" with texts known to be done by Shirley. Shirley (ca.1366 – 1456) was a scribe and translator, and possibly a bookseller, who was an important figure in the literary scene of his day. His ascriptions in manuscripts associated with him, for instance, are proof of Chaucer's authorship of some of his lyrics. He was buried at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.\n\n\"The Dethe\" was published in 1797 (by John Pinkerton), in 1818 (anonymously, in an \"obscure journal\", the \"Miscellanea Scotica\"), and in 1837 (by Joseph Stevenson). All three were based on BL Add 5467, which is defective since \"a page has been ripped out between the leaves now numbered f. 72\" and f. 73'\".\n\nIn 1904, George Neilson printed the contents of the 17th-century manuscript, which does contain the text missing from BL Add. 5467. The existence of a text of \"The Dethe\" in BL Add. 38690 was first noted in 1925. According to Matheson this manuscript is earlier than BL Add. 5467; it was first edited in 1992 by Margaret Connolly. Matheson also notes that \"The Dethe\" entered into popular culture by way of four important works of history/historical fiction from the 19th and 20th centuries: John Galt's \"The Spaewife\" (1823); Sir Walter Scott's \"Tales of a Grandfather\" (1828); Dante Gabriel Rossetti's \"The King's Tragedy\" (in \"Ballads and Sonnets\", 1881); and Nigel Tranter's \"Lion Let Loose\" (1967).\n\nWhile the chronicle covers James I's reign as a king, it focuses on his murder and its aftermath in detail. James was stabbed to death, in a conspiracy led by Sir Robert Graham and the brothers Christopher and Robert Chambers, on the night of February 20–21, 1437, at Blackfriars, Perth. According to \"The Dethe\", he was murdered while hiding in the priory's privy; it is the only 15th-century chronicle that contains this detail. The rest of the account relates how the murderers were tortured and executed.\n\nThe chronicle describes how the king hears the noise of armed men outside the door of his bedchamber; he locks the door and unsuccessfully attempts to break through the windows. With metal tongs from the fireplace he breaks open the wooden floor of the privy and finds himself in the stone passage through which the privy drains. The only way out is the hole through which the privy can be emptied, but this very hole he had ordered closed up three days before to stop his tennis balls from rolling into it. The conspirators break down the door, and one of them threatens to kill the queen, Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots, but is stopped by a son of Sir Robert Graham. When he is discovered, two men go down but the king defeats them, though unarmed; finally Graham descends into the privy and, refusing to let the king have a confessor, stabs him through the body. Graham is overcome by emotion and kills the king, with the help of the other two men, only after being threatened by the other conspirators. They try to find and kill the queen, but she has escaped and alerted the king's retinue, which pursues the conspirators who manage to escape.\n\nThe rest of the account relates in a very detailed fashion how the murderers were tortured and executed. They are found within a month. Robert Stewart, Master of Atholl and Christopher Chambers are tortured in Edinburgh by being bound on crosses, having their flesh pulled from their bodies with tongs, being dragged by horses, hung up for all to see, decapitated with a rusty axe, and finally quartered. Their heads were displayed on a city gate. Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, was given a paper crown with \"TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR, TRAITOUR\" written on it. He was given confession; he denied being part of the assassination, though he said he knew of it. He was also beheaded, and his head, now crowned with an iron crown, was put on a pole in the centre of Edinburgh.\n\nThe torture and death of Graham in Stirling takes up six pages in the manuscript. \"A mane of grete hart and manhode\", he is defiant until the end and denounces his accusers. He is then hoisted onto a cart on which a tree is placed, and his hand is nailed to the tree with the very knife he used to kill the king. The executioner is ordered to cut off that hand with the same knife, and then he is drawn through the streets naked and tortured with iron instruments. He continues to defy his tormentors; they take pity on him and throw him back in jail, while more conspirators are drawn and quartered. Graham is retrieved from jail and taken to the execution site, where his son is disemboweled and beheaded before his eyes, after which he himself has his heart and then his bowels torn out.\n\nShirley operated mostly in literary circles, perhaps an unlikely audience for the non-literary chronicle. Archibald Duncan thought it was clearly a \"sadistic handbill, since it dwells so lovingly on the details of the executions of James's murderers\", but Matheson identifies Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and Henry VI of England as possible recipients of BL Add. 5467 and thinks, considering the context of BL Add. 38690 and its political and historical texts, that there were more precise political purposes at play.\n\nThe possible owner of BL Add. 38690, according to Matheson, was likely a member of the Privy Council, and singles out two possibilities, both men who were active participants in the Wars of the Roses. First of all, the Council's interest in MS Add. 38690 is suggested by the two texts that pertain to the release, after 25 years of captivity, of Charles, Duke of Orléans in 1440. The arguments presented for and against his release are similar to those brought up during the captivity of James I of Scotland. Matheson finds two members of the Council who may have had great interests in the documentation of those cases, as well as the two documents later in the manuscript, written in a different hand: the first a defense by Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, for his claim to the throne (also entered in the Rolls of Parliament), the second the agreement between York and Henry VI of October 1460 that made York's descendants heirs to the English throne. These two possible owners of BL Add. 38690 are John Stourton, 1st Baron Stourton, and Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury.\n\n\n"}

The people are popularly described as having been suspected of spying for the Eastern Bloc. The list is named after Seppo Tiitinen, who was the head of Supo in 1990.\n\nA copy of the list has been requested by journalist Susanna Reinboth and, in 2008, Supo was ordered to disclose the list by the Helsinki administrative court. In 2010, the ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Finland.\n\nOne major argument in keeping the list classified has been that it only specifies individuals who have allegedly been in contact with Stasi, but not the nature of the contact. Therefore being on the list would not constitute proof of or even indicate breaking any Finnish laws. Consequently it was chosen not to shame potentially innocent persons in the media.\n\nIn October 2010, Julian Assange said in an interview that WikiLeaks had received a set of eight documents making up the Tiitinen list, and that it was to be published by the website pending a factual review.

{"id": "3781758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3781758", "title": "Triple deity", "text": "Triple deity\n\nA triple deity (sometimes referred to as threefold, tripled, triplicate, tripartite, triune or triadic, or as a trinity) is three deities that are worshipped as one. Such deities are common throughout world mythology; the number three has a long history of mythical associations. Carl Jung considered the arrangement of deities into triplets an archetype in the history of religion.\n\nIn religious iconography or mythological art, three separate beings may represent either a triad who always appear as a group (Greek Moirai, Charites, Erinyes; Norse Norns; or the Irish Morrígan) or a single deity known from literary sources as having three aspects (Greek Hecate, Diana Nemorensis). In the case of the Irish Brigid it can be ambiguous whether she is a single goddess or three sisters, all named Brigid. The Morrígan also appears sometimes as one being, and at other times as three sisters, as do the three Irish goddesses of sovereignty, Ériu, Fódla and Banba.\nThe Matres or Matronae are usually represented as a group of three but sometimes with as many as 27 (3 × 3 × 3) inscriptions. They were associated with motherhood and fertility. Inscriptions to these deities have been found in Gaul, Spain, Italy, the Rhineland and Britain, as their worship was carried by Roman soldiery dating from the mid 1st century to the 3rd century AD. Miranda Green observes that \"triplism\" reflects a way of \"expressing the divine rather than presentation of specific god-types. Triads or triple beings are ubiquitous in the Welsh and Irish mythic imagery\" (she gives examples including the Irish battle-furies, Macha, and Brigit). \"The religious iconographic repertoire of Gaul and Britain during the Roman period includes a wide range of triple forms: the most common triadic depiction is that of the triple mother goddess\" (she lists numerous examples).\n\nPeter H. Goodrich interprets the literary figure of Morgan le Fay as a manifestation of a British triple goddess in the medieval romance \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". A modern idea of a Triple Goddess is central to the new religious movement of Wicca. \n\nGeorges Dumézil's trifunctional hypothesis proposed that ancient Indo-European society conceived itself as structured around three activities: worship, war, and toil. In later times, when slave labor became common, the three functions came to be seen as separate \"classes\", represented each by its own god. Dumézil understood this mythology as reflecting and validating social structures in its content: such a tripartite class system is found in ancient Indian, Iranian, Greek and Celtic texts. In 1970 Dumézil proposed that some goddesses represented these three qualities as different aspects or epithets and identified examples in his interpretation of various deities including the Iranian Anāhitā, the Vedic Sarasvatī and the Roman Juno.\n\nVesna Petreska posits that myths including trinities of female mythical beings from Central and Eastern European cultures may be evidence for an Indo-European belief in trimutive female \"spinners\" of destiny. But according to the linguist M. L. West, various female deities and mythological figures in Europe show the influence of pre-Indo-European goddess-worship, and triple female fate divinities, typically \"spinners\" of destiny, are attested all over Europe and in Bronze Age Anatolia.\n\nAt her sacred grove at Aricia, on the shores of Lake Nemi a triplefold Diana was venerated from the late sixth century BCE as Diana Nemorensis. Andreas Alföldi interpreted a late Republican numismatic image as the Latin Diana \"conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess and the goddess of the nether world, Hekate\". This coin shows that the triple goddess cult image still stood in the \"lucus\" of Nemi in 43 BCE. The Lake of Nemi was \"Triviae lacus\" for Virgil (\"Aeneid\" 7.516), while Horace called Diana \"montium custos nemoremque virgo\" (\"keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi\") and \"diva triformis\" (\"three-form goddess\"). Diana is commonly addressed as Trivia by Virgil and Catullus.\n\nSpells and hymns in Greek magical papyri refer to the goddess (called Hecate, Persephone, and Selene, among other names) as \"triple-sounding, triple-headed, triple-voiced..., triple-pointed, triple-faced, triple-necked\". In one hymn, for instance, the \"Three-faced Selene\" is simultaneously identified as the three Charites, the three Moirai, and the three Erinyes; she is further addressed by the titles of several goddesses. Translation editor Hans Dieter Betz notes: \"The goddess Hekate, identical with Persephone, Selene, Artemis, and the old Babylonian goddess Ereschigal, is one of the deities most often invoked in the papyri.\"\n\nE. Cobham Brewer's 1894 \"Dictionary of Phrase & Fable\" contained the entry, \"Hecate: A triple deity, called Phoebe or the Moon in heaven, Diana on the earth, and Hecate or Proserpine in hell,\" and noted that \"Chinese have the triple goddess Pussa\". The Roman poet Ovid, through the character of the Greek woman Medea, refers to Hecate as \"the triple Goddess\"; the earlier Greek poet Hesiod represents her as a threefold goddess, with a share in earth, sea, and starry heavens. Hecate was depicted variously as a single womanly form; as three women back-to-back; as a three-headed woman, sometimes with the heads of animals; or as three upper bodies of women springing from a single lower body (\"we see three heads and shoulders and six hands, but the lower part of her body is single, and closely resembles that of the Ephesian Artemis\").\n\nThe trinity of Asia, Panthea (\"All-Goddess\") and the Nereid Ione have been seen to be contrasted ironically with the triad of the Furies in Shelley's \"Prometheus Unbound\" making a careful separation between the Jungian figures of the Terrible and Good Mother.\n\nIn the mythology of the Sámi (an important source of modern evidence concerning the Finno-Ugric language group and the cultures in which it evolved), a triad of goddesses are responsible for childbirth and protecting children. Sáhráhkka, who lives in the fireplace, is responsible for pregnancy and the particular protector of girls. Juksáhkká, who lives in the area of the back doors, is responsible for turning some children into boys while they are in the womb (there was a belief that all children are female at the outset). Uksáhkká guards the main doors, and is responsible for protecting all young children.\n\nA pagan god was worshipped in pre-Islamic Arabia and Nabataea with a family of deities around him among which was a triad of goddesses called \"the three daughters of God\": al-Lat (\"Mother Goddess of prosperity\") Al-Uzza (\"Mighty one\") the youngest, and Manat (\"Fate\") \"the third, the other\". They were known collectively as the three cranes. The name al-Lat is known from the time of the histories of Herodotus in which she is named Alilat.\n\nQudshu-Astarte-Anat is a representation of a single goddess who is a combination of three goddesses: Qetesh (Athirat \"Asherah\"), Astarte, and Anat. It was a common practice for Canaanites and Egyptians to merge different deities through a process of syncretization, thereby, turning them into one single entity. This \"Triple Goddess Stone\", once owned by Winchester College, shows the goddess Qetesh with the inscription \"Qudshu-Astarte-Anat\", showing their association as being one goddess, and Qetesh (Qudshu) in place of Athirat.\n\nReligious scholar Saul M. Olyan (author of Asherah and the Cult of Yahweh in Israel), calls the representation on the Qudshu-Astarte-Anat plaque \"a triple-fusion hypostasis\", and considers Qudshu to be an epithet of Athirat by a process of elimination, for Astarte and Anat appear after Qudshu in the inscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristians profess \"one God in three divine persons\" (God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost). This is not necessarily to be understood as a belief in (or worship of) three Gods, nor as a belief that there are three subjectively-perceived \"aspects\" in one God, both of which the Roman Catholic Church condemns as heresy. The Catholic Church also rejects the notions that God is \"composed\" of its three persons and that \"God\" is a genus containing the three persons.\n\nThe Gnostic text Trimorphic Protennoia presents a threefold discourse of the three forms of Divine Thought: The Father, The Son, and The Mother (Sophia).\n\nTriples in legendary beings:\n\n\n"}

Willoughby claimed the pro-evolution curriculum was by extension also promoting secular humanism as the \"official religion of the United States,\" and thus violated the Establishment clause of the US Constitution. Willoughby accused scientists of \"intellectual snobbery\", and opposed tax revenues going to support education offensive to his religious views. He argued that creationist education should be given the same tax payer funding as evolution education. \n\nThe lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the grounds that the textbooks disseminated science, not religion.
