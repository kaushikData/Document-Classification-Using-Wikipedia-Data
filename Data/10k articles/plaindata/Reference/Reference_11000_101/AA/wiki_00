It was named after Al-Muthanna ibn Haritha, an Iraqi Muslim Arab general who led forces that helped to defeat the Persian Sassanids at the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. Later known as the \"National Democratic Party\", Nadi al-Muthanna was influenced by European fascism and controlled by radical Arab nationalists who, according to 2005's \"Memories of State\", \"formed the core of new radicals\" for a combined Pan-Arab civilian and military coalition.\n\nIn 1938, as fascism in Iraq grew, Sami Shawkat, a known fascist and a pan-Arab nationalist, was appointed director-general of education.\n\nThe al-Muthanna club, under German ambassador Fritz Grobba's influence, developed a youth organization, the al-Futuwwa, modeled on European fascist lines and on Hitler Youth, it was founded in 1939 by then director-general of Iraq's education (al-Muthanna's co-founder) pan-Arab activist Sami Shawkat, and was under his guidance.\n\nHe is also famous for his 1933 speech \"The Manufacture of Death\", in which he preached for the highest calling of accepting death for the pan-Arabism cause, he argued that the ability to cause and accept death in pursuit of pan-Arab ideals was the highest calling.

{"id": "85039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85039", "title": "Aradia", "text": "Aradia\n\nAradia is one of the principal figures in the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland's 1899 work \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", which he believed to be a genuine religious text used by a group of pagan witches in Tuscany, a claim that has subsequently been disputed by other folklorists and historians. In Leland's \"Gospel\", Aradia is portrayed as a Messiah who was sent to Earth in order to teach the oppressed peasants how to perform witchcraft to use against the Roman Catholic Church and the upper classes.\n\nThe folklorist Sabina Magliocco has theorised that prior to being used in Leland's \"Gospel\", Aradia was originally a supernatural figure in Italian folklore, who was later merged with other folkloric figures such as the \"sa Rejusta\" of Sardinia.\n\nSince the publication of Leland's \"Gospel\", Aradia has become \"arguably one of the central figures of the modern pagan witchcraft revival\" and as such has featured in various forms of Neopaganism, including Wicca and Stregheria, as an actual deity.\nRaven Grimassi, founder of the Wiccan-inspired tradition of Stregheria, claims that Aradia was a historical figure named \"Aradia di Toscano\", who led a group of \"Diana-worshipping witches\" in 14th-century Tuscany.\n\nThe Italian form of the name \"Herodias\" is \"Erodiade\". It appears that Herodias, the wife of Herod Antipas, in Christian mythology of the Early Middle Ages, came to be seen as a spirit condemned to wander the sky forever due to her part in the death of John the Baptist, permitted only to rest in treetops between midnight and dawn.\n\nBy the High Middle Ages, this figure seems to have become attached to the train of nymphs of Diana, now also seen as a host of spirits flying through the night across the Italian countryside. Other names attached to the night flight of Herodias included \"Minerva\" and \"Noctiluca\".\n\nThe canon \"Episcopi\" is a passage from the work \"De ecclesiasticis disciplinis\" by Regino of Prüm (written ca. 906). It became notable as a paragraph of canon law dealing with witchcraft by the 12th century. Regino reports that there were groups of women who believed that they could go on night journeys where they would fly across the sky to meet Diana and her train. The name of Herodias is not present in the text as attributed to Regino, but in the version by Burchard of Worms, written ca. 1012, the reference to Diana (\"cum Diana paganorum dea\") was augmented by \"or with Herodias\" (\"vel cum Herodiade\").\n\nMagliocco (2002) suggests that the legends surrounding this figure, known as \"Aradia\", \"Arada\" or \"Araja\", spread throughout various areas of Italy, and she traced records that showed that two beings known as \"s'Araja dimoniu\" (Araja the demon) and \"s'Araja justa\" (Araja the just) were found in Sardinia. Magliocco believed that the latter of these two figures, \"s'Araja justa\", was the antecedent of a supernatural witch-like figure known as \"sa Rejusta\" in Sardinian folklore.\n\nThe Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade also noted that \"Arada\", along with \"Irodiada\", was a name used for a Romanian folkloric Queen of the Fairies (\"Doamna Zînelor\"), who he believed was a \"metamorphosis of Diana\". She was viewed as the patroness of a secretive group of dancers known as the calusari who operated up until at least the 19th century.\n\nJudika Illes, in her \"Encyclopedia of Spirits\", noted: \"Although venerated elsewhere in Europe, Herodias was especially beloved in Italy. She and Diana are the goddesses most frequently mentioned in witch-trial transcripts and were apparently worshipped together\".\n\nIn 1899, the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland published \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\", a book which he claimed was the religious text belonging to a group of Tuscan witches who venerated Diana as the Queen of the Witches. He also claimed that he had been given the book by a Tuscan woman named Maddalena, although historians such as Ronald Hutton have disputed the truth of these such claims.\n\n\"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\" begins with the tale of Aradia's birth to Diana and Lucifer, who is described as \"the god of the Sun and of the Moon, the god of Light (Splendour), who was so proud of his beauty, and who for his pride was driven from Paradise\". Diana instructs Aradia to \"go to earth below / To be a teacher unto women and men / Who fain would study witchcraft.\" When Aradia descends, she becomes the first of all witches, and promises her students that \"ye shall all be freed from slavery, / And so ye shall be free in everything.\"\n\nAradia is described as having continuing power to affect the world after she returns to the sphere of Diana. For example, in \"A Spell to Win Love\", the \"Invocation to Diana\" asks Diana to send her daughter Aradia to perform the magic. Leland's \"Aradia\" has a chapter containing folklore about the night assembly or banquet, titled \"The Sabbat: Tregunda or Witch Meeting\", which involves Diana. Leland comments in the Appendix, \"I also believe that in this Gospel of the Witches we have a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at these meetings [the witches' Sabbat]. They adored forbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds, inspired as much by rebellion against Society as by their own passions.\"\n\nLeland speculates that this folklore ultimately has roots in ancient Etruscan mythology.\n\nLeland also equates Aradia with Herodias, explaining his speculation that Herodias was actually Lilith: \"This was not ... derived from the Herodias of the New Testament, but from an earlier replica of Lilith, bearing the same name ... So far back as the sixth century the worship of Herodias and Diana by witches was condemned by a Church Council at Ancyra.\" Pipernus and other writers have noted the evident identification of Herodias with Lilith. Historian Ronald Hutton suggests in \"Triumph of the Moon\" that this identification with Herodias was inspired by the work of Jules Michelet in \"Satanism and Witchcraft\". Anthropologist and field folklorist Sabina Magliocco, on the other hand, is willing to consider a connection between the Italian Erodiade (Herodias), the Cult of Herodias, the night assembly, and Aradia.\n\nAradia has become an important figure in Wicca as well as some other forms of Neo-Paganism. Some Wiccan traditions use the name \"Aradia\" as one of the names of the Great Goddess, Moon Goddess, or \"Queen of the Witches\".\n\nPortions of Leland's text influenced the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, especially the Charge of the Goddess. Alex Sanders invoked Aradia as a moon goddess in the 1960s. Janet and Stewart Farrar used the name in their \"Eight Sabbats for Witches\" and \"The Witches' Way\". Aradia was invoked in spellcraft in Z. Budapest's \"The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries\". An entire website, the \"Goddess Aradia and Related Subjects\", is devoted to Aradia as a Wiccan goddess and a powerful spirit in Italian folklore.\n\nAradia is a central figure in Stregheria, an \"ethnic Italian\" form of Wicca introduced by Raven Grimassi in the 1980s. Grimassi claims that there was a historical figure called \"Aradia di Toscano\", whom he portrays as the founder of a revivalist religion of Italian witchcraft in the 14th century. Grimassi claims that Leland's \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\" is a \"distorted Christianized version\" of the story of Aradia.\n\nNeo-Pagan narratives of Aradia include \"The Book of the Holy Strega\" (1981), by Raven Grimassi; \"The Gospel of Diana\" (1993), by Aidan Kelly; and \"Secret Story of Aradia\", by Myth Woodling (2001).\n\nIn 1992, Aidan Kelly, co-founder of the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn, distributed a document titled \"The Gospel of Diana\" (a reference to \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\"). The text contained a list of mother and daughter priestesses who had taught religious witchcraft through the centuries. Instead of Leland's goddess Diana and her messianical daughter Aradia, Kelly's text described mortal human beings. The priestesses' names alternated between \"Aradia\" and \"Diana\". Magliocco describes the character of Aradia in Kelly's accompanying narrative as \"a notably erotic character; according to her teachings, the sexual act becomes not only an expression of the divine life force, but an act of resistance against all forms of oppression and the primary focus of ritual\". Magliocco also notes that the text \"has not achieved broad diffusion in contemporary Pagan circles\".\n\n\n"}

It was usually made of an albumen print, which was a thin paper photograph mounted on a thicker paper card. The size of a \"carte de visite\" is × mounted on a card sized × . In 1854, Disdéri had also patented a method of taking eight separate negatives on a single plate, which reduced production costs. The \"carte de visite\" was slow to gain widespread use until 1859, when Disdéri published Emperor Napoleon III's photos in this format. This made the format an overnight success. The new invention was so popular it was known as \"cardomania\" and it spread throughout Europe and then quickly to America and the rest of the world.\n\nEach photograph was the size of a visiting card, and such photograph cards were traded among friends and visitors. Albums for the collection and display of cards became a common fixture in Victorian parlors. The immense popularity of these card photographs led to the publication and collection of photographs of prominent persons.\n\nBy the early 1870s, \"cartes de visite\" were supplanted by \"cabinet cards\", which were also usually albumen prints, but larger, mounted on cardboard backs measuring by . Cabinet cards remained popular into the early 20th century, when Kodak introduced the Brownie camera and home snapshot photography became a mass phenomenon.\n\nThe \"carte de visite\" photograph proved to be a very popular item during the American Civil War. Soldiers, friends and family members would have a means of inexpensively obtaining photographs and sending them to loved ones in small envelopes. Photos of Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S.

{"id": "1020847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1020847", "title": "DNS zone transfer", "text": "DNS zone transfer\n\nDNS zone transfer, also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction. It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers. \n\nA zone transfer uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for transport, and takes the form of a client–server transaction. The client requesting a zone transfer may be a slave server or secondary server, requesting data from a master server, sometimes called a primary server. The portion of the database that is replicated is a zone.\n\nZone transfer comprises a preamble followed by the actual data transfer. The preamble comprises a lookup of the Start of Authority (SOA) resource record for the \"zone apex\", the node of the DNS namespace that is at the top of the \"zone\". The fields of this SOA resource record, in particular the \"serial number\", determine whether the actual data transfer need to occur at all. The client compares the serial number of the SOA resource record with the serial number in the last copy of that resource record that it has. If the serial number of the record being transferred is greater, the data in the zone are deemed to have \"changed\" (in some fashion) and the slave proceeds to request the actual zone data transfer. If the serial numbers are identical, the data in the zone are deemed not to have \"changed\", and the client may continue to use the copy of the database that it already has, if it has one.\n\nThe actual data transfer process begins by the client sending a query (opcode 0) with the special query type AXFR (value 252) over the TCP connection to the server. The server responds with a series of response messages, comprising all of the resource records for every domain name in the \"zone\". The first response comprises the SOA resource record for the zone apex. The other data follows in no specified order. The end of the data is signaled by the server repeating the response containing the SOA resource record for the zone apex.\n\nSome zone transfer clients perform the SOA lookup of the preamble using their system's normal DNS query resolution mechanism. These clients do not open a TCP connection to the server until they have determined that they need to perform the actual data transfer. However, since TCP can be used for normal DNS transactions, as well as for zone transfer, other zone transfer clients perform the SOA lookup preamble over the same TCP connection as they then (may) perform the actual data transfer. These clients open the TCP connection to the server before they even perform the preamble.\n\nThe preceding describes full zone transfer. Incremental zone transfer differs from full zone transfer in the following respects:\n\nZone transfer is entirely client-initiated. Though servers can send a NOTIFY message to clients (that they have been informed about) whenever a change to the zone data has been made, the scheduling of zone transfers is entirely under the control of the clients. Clients schedule zone transfers initially, when their databases are empty, and thereafter at regular intervals, in a pattern controlled by the values in the \"refresh\", \"retry\", and \"expire\" fields in the SOA resource record of the zone apex.\n\nThough it is standardized, full-zone transfer being described as one of the possible database replication mechanisms in RFC 1034 and RFC 5936 (incremental zone transfer described in RFC 1995), zone transfer is the most limited of those database replication mechanisms. Zone transfer operates in terms of \"wire format\" resource records, \"i.e.\" resource records as they are transferred using the DNS protocol. However, the schema of wire format resource records may not be identical to the database schema used by the back ends of the DNS servers themselves.\n\nThe preamble portion of zone transfer relies on the serial number, and \"only\" the serial number, to determine whether a zone's data have changed, and thus whether the actual data transfer is required. For some DNS server packages, the serial numbers of SOA resource records are maintained by administrators by hand. Every edit to the database involves making two changes, one to the record being changed and the other to the zone serial number. This is a laborious process and one that is prone to error, with administrators either forgetting to change a serial number or changing a serial number incorrectly (such as decreasing it or increasing it by a huge amount).\n\nSome DNS server packages have overcome this problem by automatically constructing the serial number from the last modification timestamp of the database file on disk. This is the case for djbdns, for example. The operating system ensures that the last modification timestamp is updated whenever an administrator edits the database file, effectively automatically updating the serial number, and thus relieving administrators of the need to make two edits (in two different places) for every single change.\n\nFurthermore, the paradigm of database replication for which the serial number check (and indeed zone transfer itself) is designed, which involves a single central DNS server holding the master version of the database with all other DNS servers merely holding copies, simply does not match that of many modern DNS server packages. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends such as SQL servers and Active Directory allow administrators to make updates to the database in multiple places (such systems employ Multi-master replication), with the database back end's own replication mechanism handling the replication to all other servers. This paradigm simply does not match that of a single, central, monotonically increasing number to record changes, and thus is incompatible with zone transfer to a large extent. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends often will create a \"shim\" serial number, simulating the existence of a single central place where updates are made, but this is at best imperfect.\n\nFortunately, for this and several reasons outlined later, DNS servers that use such sophisticated database back ends in general rarely use zone transfer as their database replication mechanism in the first place, and usually instead employ the vastly superior distributed database replication mechanisms that the back ends themselves provide.\n\nSerial number comparisons are intended to use Serial Number Arithmetic as defined in RFC 1982. However, this was not clearly specified in RFC 1034, resulting in not all clients perform the serial number check, in the preamble, in the same way. Some clients check merely that the serial number supplied by the server is different from that known by the client, or non-zero. Other clients check that the serial number supplied by the server is within a given range of the serial number already known by the client. Yet other clients still perform the latter check and additionally check that the serial number supplied by the server is not zero.\n\nOriginally, in the actual data transfer each set of resource records for a single domain name and type was transferred in a separate response message from the server to the client.

Several DNS server packages thus have a configuration setting allowing administrators to specify the use of \"single answer format\" responses for those clients that require it.\n\nThe data contained in a DNS zone may be sensitive from an operational security aspect. This is because information such as server hostnames may become public knowledge, which can be used to discover information about an organization and even provide a larger attack surface.

It was described as the first war crimes trial held in Britain at the time.\n\nDering alleged that Uris had libelled him in a footnote in his novel \"Exodus\", which described his participation in medical experiments in Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. The case was tried in the High Court of Justice before Mr Justice Lawton and a jury between April and May 1964. On 6 May, the jury returned a verdict for Dering, but awarded him contemptuous damages of one halfpenny, the smallest coin in the currency. As a result, Dering became liable for the defendants' legal costs.\n\nThe trial attracted wide media coverage. In particular, \"The Times\" provided extensive coverage of the case, printing large portions of the testimony presented in court. The novel \"QB VII\" and its 1974 miniseries adaptation are loosely based on this case.\nDr Wladislaw Alexander Dering was a Polish doctor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz during the Second World War for resistance activities. After the war, he reached Britain, but was detained by the British government as an alleged war criminal, while the Polish government sought his extradition. In 1948, he was released, the Home Secretary having decided that there was insufficent evidence to support a \"prima facie\" case against him. Dering thereupon joined the Colonial Medical Service, running a hospital in Hargeisa, British Somaliland. For his services, he was appointed an OBE in 1960. The same year, he returned to England and established a medical practice in North London.\n\nAfter his return, his family drew his attention to a passage in the novel \"Exodus\" by American author Leon Uris. The passage, on page 155, read:Here in Block X Dr. Wirths used women as guinea pigs and Dr. Schumann sterilized by castration and X-ray and Clauberg removed ovaries and Dr. Dehring performed 17,000 'experiments' in surgery without anaesthetics.Dering issue writs for libel against Uris, his British publishers William Kimber & Co Ltd, and the printers. The printers settled the case before the trial for £500 and an apology. Uris and William Kimber admitted the words at issue were defamatory against Dr Dering, but pleaded that the words were true in substance and in fact, save for some particularized exceptions.\n\nThe trial opened in the High Court of Justice in London on 13 April 1964 before Mr Justice Lawton and a jury. Colin Duncan QC (with Brian Neill) appeared for Dering, while Lord Gardiner (with David Hirst and Louis Blom-Cooper represented for the defendants.\n\nIn court, Dering denied having carried out experimental operations. He claimed he removed prisoners' sexual organs because Schumann had asked Dering to assist him by removing the organs. He did not feel he could refuse, because he thought it was better for him to perform the operations than if they were performed by an untrained person. Furthermore, he claimed the organs he removed were already damaged, and that he removed them for the benefit of the prisoners' health. He also claimed he feared for his life if he did not comply with Schumann's request. Finally, he denied having operation without anaesthetics, and claimed that of the 17,000 operations he performed at Auschwith, only about 130 were not ordinary proper operations.\n\nThe defence admitted that the figure of 17,000 'experiments' was inflated, and that some anaesthetics was administered. However, they disputed Dering's claim that his life would have been in danger if he had not carried out the operations. They also disputed Dering's claim that the anaesthesia was effective. The defence presented a number of witnesses who had been operated upon by Dering, as well as prisoners-doctors who had worked with Dering. The doctors testifoed that they had refused the Nazi doctors' requests to assist them in their experiments, and had not been punished as a consequence.\n\nOne of the trial's most dramatic moments occured during the testimony of Dr Adélaïde Hautval, an imprisoned French psychiatrist who worked in the camp's hospital. She testified that she refused to assist the Nazi doctors in the experiments:\nGardiner: As a result were you shot?Hautval: NoGardiner: Were you punished in any way?\nHautval: No.She then testified that she told Dr Wirths that performing the operations was against her conception of medicine.Hautval: He asked me, \"Cannot you see that these people are different from you?\" and I answered him that there were several people different from me, beginning from him.Gardiner: I shall not ask you again whether you were shot. Did Dr Wirths say anything further?Hautval: He never said anything.The high court action lasted 19 days and cost £50-60,000. Dr Dering's share was said to be £30,000. The jury awarded Dering a halfpenny in damages, the smallest coin of the realm. Since publisher and author had paid a marginally larger token sum of £2 into court, Dering was liable for all the legal costs amounting to £25,000 from that point, due to court rules. Dering died, however, leaving Kimber saddled with the heavy legal costs.\n\nAt a news conference held at the Howard Hotel by Uris and publisher Kimber, Uris is reported to have made a comment that future editions of \"Exodus\" would omit Dr Dering's name. Uris and the publishers, William Kimber and Company, admitted that a paragraph in the book, referring to Auschwitz medical experiments, was defamatory to Dr Dering, but they also contended that it was true in substance, subject to certain qualifications.\n\nThe trial received extensive coverage. Breaking with tradition whereby it only reported judgments, \"The Times\" Law Report sent two reporters to report on the trial. \"The Times\"' reports were later published in book form (\"Auschwitz in England\", 1965). It was said that the newspaper's circulation rose for the first time since the end of the Second World War as a result of its coverage.\n\nUris had copied his data from \"Underground\" by Joseph Tennenbaum when he referred to doctors working in Auschwitz. The complex issue of Dr Dering's role—whether villain or hero—continued to be a subject of debate through 2010.\n"}

The United Nations uses the term migrant worker. The term economic migrant is often confused with the term refugee, but economic migrants leave their country due to bad economic conditions, not due to fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership of a particular social group. Economic migrants are free to apply for asylum and thus refugee status in the country they migrated to. However they will not be given refugee status, unless the economic situation in their home country has led to generalised violence or seriously disturbed public order.\n\nPeople who intend to work in another country can obtain authorization to do so; some migrants may enter under false pretences, such as tourism, or cross the border illegally (illegal immigrant). People who work legally in another country are often described as immigrants or expatriates.\nMany countries have restrictions that prohibit people from entering the country to work unless they have been granted a visa which permits this. Persons who are believed to be trying to enter a country to obtain employment may be refused entry. Illegal immigrants and people who seek paid employment after entering the country without authorization to work may be subject to deportation.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that remittances totaled US$420 billion in 2009, of which $317 billion went to developing countries.\n\nWith economic migration on a large scale, the majority of migrants are often working age people. This places a strain on the country that the migrants leave; as working age people exit the country, the elderly population remains - thus straining the economy. However, the advantage to this country could be a release of pressure on the current job market and resources. Looking at the nation that the migrants enter, the inflow of migrants is a source of cheap labour. In some cases, the immigrants in the country are skilled and looking for specialized jobs. The inflow of migrants could also bring about cultural diversity.\n\nOver the past ten years, migrants accounted for 47% of the increase in the work force in the United States and for over 70% of the increase in Europe, as reported by the OECD in 2012. Migrants fill important niches in the labor market, and contribute significantly to labor market flexibility, especially in Europe. Recent studies from the OECD report that immigrants are playing a crucial role in the labor market: In the U.S. immigrants made up 22% of entries in the fast growing occupations and 15% in Europe (healthcare, STEM, etc.). Immigrants are also highly represented in the slowest growing occupations, making up approximately 28% of new entries in the U.S. and 24% in Europe. In the United States, these occupations are primarily in production and other industries that domestic workers would consider unattractive; in the absence of demand for these occupations, immigrant workers fill these sectors. In regard to [gross domestic product], the OECD finds that in OECD countries, the inflow of migrants has not greatly disrupted GDP: accounting for less than 0.5% change in GDP in negative or positive terms. Exceptions to this are Switzerland and Luxembourg, which have approximated a 2% net benefit in GDP due to migrants.\n\n"}

Since October 2009, the collection is part of the reopened Neues Museum on Berlin's Museum Island.\n\nThe museum originated in the 18th century from the royal art collection of the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia. Alexander von Humboldt had recommended that an Egyptian section be created, and the first objects were brought to Berlin in 1828 under King Friedrich Wilhelm III. Initially housed in Monbijou Palace, the department was headed by the Trieste merchant Giuseppe Passalacqua (1797–1865), whose extensive collections formed the basis. A Prussian expedition to Egypt and Nubia led by Karl Richard Lepsius in 1842–45 brought additional pieces to Berlin.\n\nIn 1850, the collections moved to its present-day home in the Neues Museum, built according to plans designed by Friedrich August Stüler. The Nefertiti Bust, discovered during the excavations by Ludwig Borchardt in Amarna, was donated to the museum by the entrepreneur Henri James Simon in 1920; it quickly became its best-known exhibit. After World War II, during which the Neues Museum was heavily damaged by strategic bombing, the collections were divided between East and West Berlin. The main part remained in East Berlin and was displayed at the Bode Museum, while those artifacts evacuated to West Germany, including the Nefetiti Bust, returned to West Berlin. From 1967 to 2005, these items were housed vis-à-vis Charlottenburg Palace. The whole collection was reunited again after the Reunification of Germany, when it returned to Museum Island.\n\nThe collection contains artefacts dating from between 4000BC (the Predynastic era) to the period of Roman rule, though most date from the rule of Akhenaten (around 1340BC).\n\nThe most famous piece on display is the exceptionally well preserved and vividly coloured bust of Queen Nefertiti. The collection was moved from Charlottenburg to the Altes Museum in 2005 and was rehoused within the newly reconstructed Neues Museum on Berlin's Museum Island in October 2009.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51459657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51459657", "title": "Enfer", "text": "Enfer\n\nThe Enfer (; , literally, \"Inferno\" or \"Hell\") is a special department of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris. It is a special collection of books and manuscripts of an erotic or pornographic character which, because of their rarity and value, may be seen only with authorization. The Enfer was established 1836-1844 and is one of the most famous Private Case collections. In 2013, the Enfer contained about 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century to the present.\n\nThe roots of the Enfer at the Bibliothèque nationale de France date to the end of the 17th century. The catalogue, which was introduced in the then Bibliothèque du Roi (\"Royal Library\"), already separated \"good\" and \"bad\" books. In 1702, orthodox and heterodox theological treatises, literary and entertaining novels, love and adventure stories were given different Library classification press marks (or \"call numbers\"). By the mid-18th century, there were 24 \"ouvrages licencieux\" (\"scandalous works\"), including Pietro Aretino's prostitute dialogue \"Ragionamenti\". These scandalous works were kept mostly in a special \"cabinet\" (a bookcase), and there are likely to have been fewer than 50 before the French Revolution of 1789 — although legal deposit was introduced in 1537 by François I. However, \"ouvrages licencieux\" were banned in France generally; so clandestine editions were printed in Holland or Switzerland and distributed and sold in secret. Such books found their way into the Royal Library only after seizures of banned books or, more rarely, as gifts or purchases. Such books were not made available to the reading public, although they appeared in library catalogues.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the book collections of fleeing aristocrats and secularized monasteries contributed significantly to the growth of public libraries. However, as a result of strict censorship under Napoleon, many banned books were destroyed. In the Bibliothèque nationale particularly notable books were first separated from the general library in 1795, and the foundations of the later Réserve (Rare Books collections) was established. Between 1836 and 1844, the concept (not the press mark) \"Enfer\" appeared for the first time in the library inventories for morally-dubious writings. The library director, Joseph Naudet, characterized these works as follows: \"fort mauvais, mais quelquefois très précieux pour les bibliophiles, et de grande valeur vénale; cet enfer est pour les imprimés ce qu'est le Musée de Naples pour les antiques.\" (\"extremely reprehensible from a book collector’s view but sometimes highly valuable and of great resale value; this hell is for the pamphlets, what the Napels Museum is for ancient art.\"). The exact circumstances under which this closed-collection of books was built up during the reign of Louis Philippe are not known. Howeverm a significant influence was likely to have been the increasing prudery of the bourgeoisie in post-revolutionary France. By establishing a sequestered collection of erotic material, the ordinary reader was screened from works that were considered objectionable and detrimental to the moral health of readers.\n\nThe first collection of books called an Enfer is attributed to the Feuillants convent in Paris, on the Rue Saint-Honoré. These monks reportedly kept in the attic, ironically described as \"hell\", a large number of Protestant writings that had been given to the convent in 1652. The name apparently played on the fate that frequently befell the authors and readers of forbidden and heretical works (i.e., burning). Collections of theological writings of a similar character, not always carrying this title, were widely used, most famously in the Vatican Library.\n\nAt the time of the Second Empire, at the latest, the word \"enfer\" was widely used to refer to a clandestine or sequestered collection. Pierre Larousse’s \"Encyclopedia Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle\" (Paris 1866-1877) defined the word as \"endroit fermé d'une bibliothèque, où l'on tient les livres dont on pense que la lecture est dangereuse; exemple: l'Enfer de la Bibliothèque nationale.\" (\"A closed area in a library, containing books whose reading is considered dangerous, for example: The 'hell' of the Bibliothèque nationale.\"). In 1913, the Bibliothèque nationale received a huge book collection from Auguste Lesouëf and his sister (whose married name was Smith); 34 of these items were given the press mark \"Enfer Smith-Lesouëf\". The prints and photographs of the Bibliothèque nationale also received a special press mark, if they were seen as morally questionable.\n\nOther libraries separated their Erotica from their general collections, in a similar way to the Bibliothèque nationale. These libraries often used obscure collection names and press marks, such as The Private Case at the British Museum, the *** (or \"Triple star\") collection at the New York Public Library, the Δ (Greek Delta) collection in the Library of Congress and the Φ collection (Greek Phi) at the Bodleian Library.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Enfer, the public were curious about which, and how many, works were contained in the collections. It was assumed to be a very impressive collection, as many books had been seized during the French Ancien Régime, at the peak of literary libertinism, during the life of authors such as the Comte de Mirabeau, the Marquis de Sade or Rétif de la Bretonne. From 1848 to 1850, the Enfer was subject to a public attack, accused of the negligent loss of a large numbers of books. Two-thirds of original 600 books were rumoured to have been lost, not least because unsupervised young employees had acted as attendants. In fact, the library then had, at most, 150 books. The first supplementary volume of the \"Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle\" of 1877 discuss the popular opinions about the Enfer:\n\n\"Il existe à la Bibliothèque nationale un dépôt qui n’est jamais ouvert au public; c’est l’Enfer, recueil de tous les dévergondages luxurieux de la plume et du crayon. Toutefois, le chiffre de ce recueil honteux n’est pas aussi élevé qu’on l’imagine généralement, puisque le nombre des ouvrages n'y est que de 340 et celui des volumes de 730. Mais il est bon de noter que cette catégorie ne comprend que les livres d’une obscénité révoltante, ceux qu’il est défendue de communiquer sous quelque prétexte que ce puisse être.\" \n\nThe Enfer experienced renewed growth during the Second Empire, particularly due to the tightened censorship. In 1865 and 1866, the collection grew by more than 330 items; in 1876, there were 620 titles, of which more than half originated from seizures. In 1886, the collection had increased to slightly more than 700, including many cheap reprints of Libertine novels from the Ancien Régime. The Enfer remained virtually inaccessible. To be allowed to consult one of his books a strongly-reasoned application needed to be made to the head office, and the decision of a committee was required.\n\nBetween 1876 and 1886, the original press mark for the Enfer, which had been in use since the late 17th century, was replaced with \"Y2\". This press mark is used in 1896 in the general catalogue of the Bibliothèque nationale. From 1909 to 1913, Guillaume Apollinaire and others prepared, without the support or knowledge of library management, a special bibliographic catalog, which recorded 854 titles and described the works. (The library had managed to stop the first, less well disguised start, made by the linguist Robert Yve-Plessis after 1900.) Apollinaire's catalog was issued in an edition of 1,500 copies, a second edition of 1919 sold 2,000 copies, clearly showing the scale of the public interest in the Enfer. The 1978 catalog of the Enfer by Pascal Pia added around 700 titles.\n\nThe work of Apollinaire and Pias contributed largely to publicising the Enfer and the literature it contains. The stock of the Enfer was enlarged in the 20th century mainly through acquisitions from ordinary bookstores. In the 1980s, the renowned publishing firm Fayard published a seven-volume collection of out-of-copyright novels held in the Enfer, with contemporary photographs and explanatory introductions. Book historians are concerned with the material that is preserved in the Enfer, while new cultural historians study the pre-revolutionary pornography found in it. A prominent example is Robert Darnton, who points to the emancipatory potential of the texts in which social and religious criticism are often embedded in moral transgressions.\n\nThe development of the book market, changing moral standards and the widespread repeal of censorship regulations have changed the character of the Enfer. Through the mass availability of erotic and pornographic works it has lost a sense of purpose. Already in 1909, serial fiction was kept in it to protect it against theft. The further growth of this cheaply-produced literature led, in 1932, to a separate press mark within the collection, replaced between 1960-69 by two more specific signatures of the general catalog, which in turn were abandoned without being replaced.\n\nThe Bibliothèque nationale closed the Enfer press mark in 1969, but opened it again in 1983, for practical reasons; for librarians and library users, it was easier to find all the erotic works under a single press mark. The acquisition policy of the Bibliothèque nationale is, however, no longer based only on genre. While efforts are made to continue collecting erotic material, the decisive factor now is rarity or bibliophilic quality. Besides older works that were missing from the Enfer, contemporary and foreign books are added to the Enfer. By 2013, the collection had grown to 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century. Since 1977, access to the Enfer is no longer stricter than for the rest of the Réserve collections.\n\n\n"}

He originally called the collection \"Epistolarum mearum ad diversos liber\" (\"a book of my letters to different people\") but this was later shortened to the current title.\n\nPetrarch discovered the text of Cicero’s letters in 1345, which gave him the idea to collect his own sets of letters. It wasn't until four or five years later however, that he actually got started. He collected his letter correspondence in two different time periods. They are referred to as \"Epistolae familiares\" and \"Seniles\".\n\n\"Epistolae familiares\" (a.k.a. Familiar Letters) was largely collected during his stay in Provence about 1351 to 1353, however was not ultimately completed until 1359 when he was in Milan. Petrarch had this collection of letters copied onto parchment in 1359 by a certain \"ingeniosus homo et amicus\" with another complete copy done in 1364. He added letters in 1366, bringing his first collection of letters to 350. He broke these down and sorted them into 24 volumes. This first collection of letters called \"Epistolae familiares\" were actually written between the years 1325 and 1366 (the first translation into English was done by historian James Harvey Robinson in 1898 in his book \"The First Modern Scholar and Man of Letters\").\n\nIn January 1350 Petrarch wrote a lengthy letter to his dear friend (\"Socrates\" as Petrarch liked to call him) dedicating the collection to him.

It contains 128 letters written between 1361 and 1373. It is also broken down and sorted into volumes (18 books). The final letter, the first and only of the 18th book is his incomplete Letter to Posterity.

Others he destroyed the originals of for fear they would bring much criticism to his larger collection. There is a collection of 59 of these letters by Giuseppe Fracassetti.\n\nThis special set (\"Book Without A Name\") of letters Petrarch was too fond of to let out of his hands of some nineteen letters was kept out of the main body of \"Familiar Letters\" to give respect to the papacy and the controversial lavish lifestyle practiced at Avignon.

In contemporary usage, it may refer to the perceived imposition of an Islamist social and political system on a society with an indigenously different social and political background.\n\nThe English synonyms, \"muslimization\" and \"arabization\", in use since before 1940 (e.g., \"Waverly Illustrated Dictionary\") convey a similar meaning. Muslimization has recently been used as a term coined to describe the overtly Muslim practices of new converts to the religion who wish to reinforce their newly acquired religious identity.\n\nArabization describes a growing cultural influence on a non-Arab area that gradually changes into one that speaks Arabic and/or incorporates Arab culture. It was most prominently achieved during the 7th-century Arabian Muslim conquests which spread the Arabic language, culture, and—having been carried out by Arabian Muslims as opposed to Arab Christians or Arabic-speaking Jews—the religion of Islam to the lands they conquered. The result: some elements of Arabian origin combined in various forms and degrees with elements taken from conquered civilizations and ultimately denominated \"Arab\", as opposed to \"Arabian\".\n\nModern day Islamization appears to be a return of the individual to Muslim values, communities, and dress codes, and a strengthened community.\n\nAnother development is that of transnational Islam, elaborated upon by the French Islam researchers Gilles Kepel and Olivier Roy. It includes a feeling of a \"growing universalistic Islamic identity\" as often shared by Muslim immigrants and their children who live in non-Muslim countries:\n\nThe increased integration of world societies as a result of enhanced communications, media, travel, and migration makes meaningful the concept of a single Islam practiced everywhere in similar ways, and an Islam which transcends national and ethnic customs.\nThis does not necessarily imply political or social organizations:\nGlobal Muslim identity does not necessarily or even usually imply organized group action. Even though Muslims recognize a global affiliation, the real heart of Muslim religious life remains outside politics—in local associations for worship, discussion, mutual aid, education, charity, and other communal activities.\n\nA third development is the growth and elaboration of transnational military organizations. The 1980s and 90s, with several major conflicts in the Middle East, including the Arab–Israeli conflict, Afghanistan in the 1980s and 2001, and the three Gulf Wars (1980–89, 1990–91, 2003) were catalysts of a growing internationalization of local conflicts. Figures such as Osama Bin Laden and Abdallah Azzam have been crucial in these developments, as much as domestic and world politics.\n\nOn December 2, 1978, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq delivered a nationwide address on the occasion of the first day of the Hijra calendar. He did this in order to usher in an Islamic system to Pakistan. In the speech, he accused politicians of exploiting the name of Islam, saying that \"many a ruler did what they pleased in the name of Islam.\"\n\nAfter assuming power the task that the government set to was its public commitment to enforce \"Nizam-e-Mustafa\" (Islamic System) a 180 degree turn from Pakistan's predominantly Common Law. As a preliminary measure to establish an Islamic society in Pakistan, General Zia announced the establishment of Sharia Benches. Speaking about the jurisdiction of the Sharia Benches, he remarked, \"Every citizen will have the right to present any law enforced by the government before the 'Sharia Bench' and obtain its verdict whether the law is wholly or partly Islamic or un-Islamic.\"\n\nBut General Zia did not mention that the Sharia Benches' jurisdiction was curtailed by the following overriding clause: \"(Any) law does not include the constitution, Muslim personal law, any law relating to the procedure of any court or tribunal or, until the expiration of three years, any fiscal law, or any law relating to the collection of taxes and fees or insurance practice and procedure.\" It meant that all important laws which affect each and every individual directly remained outside the purview of the Sharia Benches. However, he did not have a smooth sailing even with the clipped Sharia Benches. The Federal Sharia Bench declared rajm, or stoning, to be un-Islamic; Ziaul Haq reconstituted the court, which then declared rajm as Islamic.\n\nThe influence of Islamic groups in the Gaza Strip has grown since the 1980s, especially as poverty has risen and fighting with Israel began in 2000. The efforts to impose Islamic law and traditions continued when Hamas forcefully seized control of the area in June 2007 and displaced security forces loyal to the secular President Mahmoud Abbas. After the civil war ended, Hamas declared the \"end of secularism and heresy in the Gaza Strip.\" For the first time since the Sudanese coup of 1989 that brought Omar al-Bashir to power, a Muslim Brotherhood group ruled a significant geographic territory. Gaza human rights groups accuse Hamas of restricting many freedoms in the course of these attempts.\n\nWhile Ismael Haniyeh officially denied accusations that Hamas intended to establish an Islamic emirate, Jonathan Schanzer wrote that in the two years following the 2007 coup, the Gaza Strip has exhibited the characteristics of Talibanization, a process whereby the Islamist organization imposes strict rules on women, discourages or punishes activities commonly associated with Western or Christian culture, oppresses non-Muslim minorities, imposes their own interpretation of sharia law, and deploys religious police to enforce these laws.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the Hamas-controlled government of Gaza stepped up its efforts to \"Islamize\" Gaza in 2010, efforts that included the \"repression\" of civil society and \"severe violations of personal freedom.\" Arab-Israeli journalist Khaled Abu Toameh wrote in 2009 that \"Hamas is gradually turning the Gaza Strip into a Taliban-style Islamic entity.\" According to Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Gaza's al-Azhar University, \"Ruling by itself, Hamas can stamp its ideas on everyone (...) Islamizing society has always been part of Hamas strategy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When rumors of alleged sightings began spreading in 1979 around the Nagasaki Prefecture, it spread throughout Japan and caused panic in many towns. There are even reports of schools allowing children to go home only in groups, escorted by teachers for safety, and of police increasing their patrols. Recent sightings include many reports in South Korea in 2004 about a woman wearing a red mask, who was frequently seen chasing children, and in October 2007, a coroner found some old records from the late 1970s about a woman who was chasing little children. She was then hit by a car, and died shortly after. Her mouth was ripped from ear to ear.\n\nAlthough some stories describe her as a former patient of a mental asylum, a more common story describes that in the Heian period, her husband found out that she was having an affair with another samurai. He used a sword to cut her mouth from ear to ear and asked, \"Who will think you are beautiful now?\"\n\nAccording to the legend, she covers her mouth with a cloth mask, a fan, or a scarf.\n\nThe woman will ask a potential victim \"Am I pretty?\" If they answer yes, she will remove her mask and ask them again in a girly voice. If the potential victim answers yes or screams, she will slash the victim from ear to ear so that the victim resembles her. If they answer no, she will walk away, only to follow her victim home and brutally murder them that night. Said reaction also occurs if you say no before she removes her mask.\n\nTo avoid this fate, several people during the Edo period claimed that they gave her confusing answers like average and so-so or threw money or hard candy at her, buying themselves time to run away and lose her.\n\nAccording to the legend, she walks around wearing a surgical mask.\n\nThe woman will ask a potential victim \"Am I pretty?\" If they answer no, she will kill them with a pair of scissors, which she carries in her pocket. If they answer yes, she will pull away the mask, revealing that her mouth is slit from ear to ear, and ask, \"How about now?\" If they answer no, she will cut her unfortunate victim in half. If the person answers yes, then she will slit his/her mouth so it resembles her mouth. It is impossible to run away from her, as she will simply reappear in front of the victim. \n\nWhen the legend reappeared in the 1970s, rumors of ways to escape also emerged. Some sources say she can also be confused by the victim answering her question with ambiguous answers, such as \"You are average\" or \"So-so\". Another method is to flip her questions towards her, such as asking her \"Do you think \"I'm\" pretty?\" Unsure of what to do, she will give a person enough time to escape while she is lost in thought. Another escape route is to tell her one has a previous engagement; she will pardon her manners and excuse herself. In some variations of the tale, she can be distracted by fruit or candies thrown at her which she will then pick up, thus giving the victim a chance to run.\n\nKuchisake-Onna, as told commonly, was a beautiful, young woman that lived in a village of Japan. She would roam around the village, and ask the folks, \"Am I pretty?\", to which they would reply with an enthusiastic \"yes\". This made her very confident in herself, and as she was married to an intelligent samurai, she believed that she would be able to get away with an affair with a noble soldier. But her husband found out, and in anger, asked the soldier, \"Why her? Why my lady rather than all other women of the village?\", to which he replied, \"For she is the most beautiful of the village, I cannot pass up such an opportunity.\" The samurai adored his honesty, and acknowledged that he had the right response and reason. The soldier was poor after all, and had not had many positive things occur in his life. Although the soldier had proper intentions, the samurai's wife did not. She was the most beautiful woman of the village, and without that, she would be nothing. The samurai angrily took his sword upon her face, and slit her mouth from ear to ear, making her no longer beautiful. Soon after, she killed herself, and was banished to eternity of avenging her own pain.\n\n\n\nThe Kuchisake-onna also makes an appearance in:\n\nThe Kuchisake-onna was planned to make an appearance in episode 5 of \"Ghost Stories\", but it was banned after several complaints that her disfigurement looked too much like a cleft palate.\n\nThere have also been various references and mentions of the Kuchisake-onna, and even multiple inspirations:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32064533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32064533", "title": "Malaysia Agreement", "text": "Malaysia Agreement\n\nThe Malaysia Agreement or the Agreement relating to Malaysia between United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Federation of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore was the agreement which combined North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore with the existing states of the Federation of Malaya, the resulting union being named Malaysia. Singapore later ceased to be a part of Malaysia, becoming an independent state on 9 August 1965.\n\nThe Malayan Union was established by the British Malaya and comprised the Federated Malay States of Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang; the Unfederated Malay States of Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu, Johor; and the Straits Settlements of Penang and Malacca. It came into being in 1946, through a series of agreements between the United Kingdom and Malayan Union. The Malayan Union was superseded by the Federation of Malaya on 1 February 1948, and achieved independence within the Commonwealth of Nations on 31 August 1957.\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, decolonisation became the societal goal of the peoples under colonial regimes aspiring to achieve self-determination hereinafter, the \"Special Committee on Decolonisation\" (also known as the \"U.N. Special Committee of the 24 on Decolonisation\", It reflected in the United Nations General Assembly's proclamation on 14 December 1960 of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples hereinafter, the Committee of 24, or simply, the \"Decolonisation Committee\") was established in 1961 by the General Assembly of the United Nations with the purpose of monitoring implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and to make recommendations on its application. The committee is also a successor to the former Committee on Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories. Hoping to speed the progress of decolonisation, the General Assembly had adopted in 1960 the , also known as the \"Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples\" or simply \"Declaration on Decolonisation\". It stated that all people have a right to self-determination and proclaimed that colonialism should be brought to a speedy and unconditional end.\n\nUnder the Malaysia Agreement signed between Great Britain and the Federation of Malaya, Britain would enact an Act to relinquish sovereign control over Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo (now Sabah). This was accomplished through the enactment of the Malaysia Act 1963, clause 1(1) of which states that on Malaysia Day, \"Her Majesty’s sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of the new states shall be relinquished so as to vest in the manner agreed\".\n\nThe issue of self-determination with respect to the peoples of North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore formed the bedrock of yet another challenge to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Under the Joint Statement issued by the British and Malayan Federal Governments on 23 November 1961, clause 4 provided: \"Before coming to any final decision it is necessary to ascertain the views of the peoples. It has accordingly been decided to set up a Commission to carry out this task and to make recommendations ...\"\n\nIn the spirit of ensuring that decolonisation was carried in accordance with the wishes of the peoples of North Borneo, the\nBritish Government, working with the Federation of Malaya Government, appointed a Commission of Enquiry for North Borneo and Sarawak in January 1962 to determine if the people supported the proposal to create a Federation of Malaysia. The five-man team, which comprised two Malayans and three British representatives, was headed by Lord Cobbold.\n\nIn Singapore, the People's Action Party (PAP) sought merger with Malaysia on the basis of the strong mandate it obtained during the general elections of 1959 when it won 43 of the 51 seats. However, this mandate became questionable when dissension within the Party led to a split. In July 1961, following a debate on a vote of confidence in the government, 13 PAP Assemblymen were expelled from the PAP for abstaining. They went on to form a new political party, the Barisan Sosialis, the PAP’s majority in the Legislative Assembly was whittled down as they now only commanded 30 of the 51 seats. More defections occurred until the PAP had a majority of just one seat in the Assembly. Given this situation, it would have been impossible to rely on the mandate achieved in 1959 to move forth with merger. A new mandate was necessary, especially since the Barisan argued that the terms of merger offered were detrimental to the Singapore people.\n\nWhile Brunei sent a delegation to the signing of the Malaysia Agreement, they did not sign as the Sultan of Brunei wished to be recognised as the senior ruler in the federation.\n\nOn 11 September 1963, just 4 days before the new Federation of Malaysia was to come into being, the Government of the State of Kelantan sought a declaration that the Malaysia Agreement and Malaysia Act were null and void, or alternatively, that even if they were valid, they did not bind the State of Kelantan. The Kelantan Government argued that both the Malaysia Agreement and the Malaysia Act were not binding on Kelantan on the following grounds that the Malaysia Act in effect abolished the Federation of Malaya and this was contrary to the 1957 Federation of Malaya Agreement that the proposed changes required the consent of each of the constituent states of the Federation of Malaya – including Kelantan – and this had not been obtained.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1050798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1050798", "title": "Memorandum", "text": "Memorandum\n\nA memorandum (abbrev.: memo; from Latin \"memorandum est\", \"It must be remembered (that)...\") is a note, document or other communication that helps the memory by recording events or observations on a topic such as may be used in a business office. The plural form of the Latin noun \"memorandum\" so derived is properly \"memoranda\", but if the word is deemed to have become a word of the English language, the plural \"memorandums\", abbreviated to \"memos\", may be used. (See also Agenda, Corrigenda, Addenda).\n\nA memorandum can have only a certain number of formats; it may have a format specific to an office or institution. In law specifically, a memorandum is a record of the terms of a transaction or contract, such as a policy memo, memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement, or memorandum of association. Alternative formats include memos, briefing notes, reports, letters, binders, etc. They could be one page long or many. They may be considered as grey literature. If the user is a cabinet minister or a senior executive, the format might be rigidly defined and limited to one or two pages. If the user is a colleague, the format is usually much more flexible. At its most basic level, a memorandum can be a handwritten note to one's supervisor. In business, a memo is typically used by firms for internal communication, as opposed to letters which are typically for external communication. Hence, we can consider memoranda as an upward communication process through which any complaint, issues, opinion, views and suggestion are put forward to the authorized level.\n\nA specific type of memorandum is the policy briefing note (alternatively referred to in various jurisdictions and governing traditions as policy issues paper, policy memoranda, or cabinet submission amongst other terms), a document for transmitting policy analysis into the political decision making sphere. Typically, a briefing note may be denoted as either “for information” or “for decision”.\n\nThe origins of the term “briefing” lie in legal “briefs” and the derivative “military briefings”.\n\nThe primary purpose of a briefing note “for decision” is to support decision making – and also to “help (or sometimes influence) a decision-maker to make a better decision in a particular problem situation than he might otherwise have made without the analysis”. Other purposes that the briefing note can serve include: conveying information; informing decisions, making a request, providing a response to a question, making a suggestion, presenting an informal report, proposing a solution to a problem, or documenting a reference for future use.\n\nAs the communication mechanism of the policy analysis process, the briefing note should provide a coherent synopsis of a policy problem, identify different policy options for addressing the problem, articulate opposing perspectives and advocate a recommended option. The typical structure for a briefing note includes a description of the proposed policy; relevant background information; a discussion of key considerations (including implementation concerns, financial considerations, stakeholder impacts, and possible unanticipated consequences), a summary of arguments for and against the policy and a recommended decision. Policy documents that start with a proposal and assemble an argument that position are more accurately referred to as a government white paper. A government green paper which raises a policy option and is meant to open a dialogue on the proposal is more similar in tone to a briefing note than is a white paper.\n\nThere is no universal standard for a briefing note, but it is generally understood to be a concise, coherent summary of a public policy problem with a clearly articulated logic for following a recommended course of action. ”Next to a political nose, and a logical brain, the most important skill of the good treasury [person] resides in [their] fine drafting hand. The concise, coherent and penetrating note is the final expression of all other talents.” In many Westminster / Whitehall governance settings, policy analysts are expected to analyze the issue and write the briefing note from a neutral public service perspective. However, the briefing note “for decision” must contain a recommendation, acknowledging that “to say anything of importance in public policy requires value judgments, which must be explained and justified”.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18933632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18933632", "title": "Metadata", "text": "Metadata\n\nMetadata is \"data [information] that provides information about other data\". Many distinct types of metadata exist, among these descriptive metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, reference metadata and statistical metadata\n\n\nMetadata was traditionally used in the card catalogs of libraries until the 1980s, when libraries converted their catalog data to digital databases. In the 2000s, as digital formats were becoming the prevalent way of storing data and information, metadata was also used to describe digital data using metadata standards.\n\nThe first description of \"meta data\" for computer systems is purportedly noted by MIT's Center for International Studies experts David Griffel and Stuart McIntosh in 1967: \"In summary then, we have statements in an object language about subject descriptions of data and token codes for the data. We also have statements in a meta language describing the data relationships and transformations, and ought/is relations between norm and data.\" \n\nThere are different metadata standards for each different discipline (e.g., museum collections, digital audio files, websites, etc.). Describing the contents and context of data or data files increases its usefulness. For example, a web page may include metadata specifying what software language the page is written in (e.g., HTML), what tools were used to create it, what subjects the page is about, and where to find more information about the subject. This metadata can automatically improve the reader's experience and make it easier for users to find the web page online. A CD may include metadata providing information about the musicians, singers and songwriters whose work appears on the disc.\n\nA principal purpose of metadata is to help users find relevant information and discover resources. Metadata also helps to organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and support the archiving and preservation of resources. Metadata assists users in resource discovery by \"allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria, identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information.\" Metadata of telecommunication activities including Internet traffic is very widely collected by various national governmental organizations. This data is used for the purposes of traffic analysis and can be used for mass surveillance.\n\nIn many countries, the metadata relating to emails, telephone calls, web pages, video traffic, IP connections and cell phone locations are routinely stored by government organizations.\n\n\nFor example, a digital image may include metadata that describes how large the picture is, the color depth, the image resolution, when the image was created, the shutter speed, and other data. A text document's metadata may contain information about how long the document is, who the author is, when the document was written, and a short summary of the document. Metadata within web pages can also contain descriptions of page content, as well as key words linked to the content. These links are often called \"Metatags\", which were used as the primary factor in determining order for a web search until the late 1990s. The reliance of metatags in web searches was decreased in the late 1990s because of \"keyword stuffing\". Metatags were being largely misused to trick search engines into thinking some websites had more relevance in the search than they really did.\n\nMetadata can be stored and managed in a database, often called a metadata registry or metadata repository. However, without context and a point of reference, it might be impossible to identify metadata just by looking at it. For example: by itself, a database containing several numbers, all 13 digits long could be the results of calculations or a list of numbers to plug into an equation - without any other context, the numbers themselves can be perceived as the data. But if given the context that this database is a log of a book collection, those 13-digit numbers may now be identified as ISBNs - information that refers to the book, but is not itself the information within the book. The term \"metadata\" was coined in 1968 by Philip Bagley, in his book \"Extension of Programming Language Concepts\" where it is clear that he uses the term in the ISO 11179 \"traditional\" sense, which is \"structural metadata\" i.e. \"data about the containers of data\"; rather than the alternative sense \"content about individual instances of data content\" or metacontent, the type of data usually found in library catalogues. Since then the fields of information management, information science, information technology, librarianship, and GIS have widely adopted the term. In these fields the word \"metadata\" is defined as \"data about data\". While this is the generally accepted definition, various disciplines have adopted their own more specific explanation and uses of the term.\n\nWhile the metadata application is manifold, covering a large variety of fields, there are specialized and well-accepted models to specify types of metadata. Bretherton & Singley (1994) distinguish between two distinct classes: structural/control metadata and guide metadata. \"Structural metadata\" describes the structure of database objects such as tables, columns, keys and indexes. \"Guide metadata\" helps humans find specific items and are usually expressed as a set of keywords in a natural language. According to Ralph Kimball metadata can be divided into 2 similar categories: technical metadata and business metadata. \"Technical metadata\" corresponds to internal metadata, and \"business metadata\" corresponds to external metadata. Kimball adds a third category, \"process metadata\". On the other hand, NISO distinguishes among three types of metadata: descriptive, structural, and administrative.\n\n\"Descriptive metadata\" is typically used for discovery and identification, as information to search and locate an object, such as title, author, subjects, keywords, publisher. \"Structural metadata\" describes how the components of an object are organized. An example of structural metadata would be how pages are ordered to form chapters of a book. Finally, \"administrative metadata\" gives information to help manage the source. Administrative metadata refers to the technical information, including file type, or when and how the file was created. Two sub-types of administrative metadata are rights management metadata and preservation metadata. \"Rights management metadata\" explains intellectual property rights, while \"preservation metadata\" contains information to preserve and save a resource.\n\nStatistical data repositories have their own requirements for metadata in order to describe not only the source and quality of the data but also what statistical processes were used to create the data, which is of particular importance to the statistical community in order to both validate and improve the process of statistical data production.\n\nAn additional type of metadata beginning to be more developed is \"accessibility metadata\". \"Accessibility metadata\" is not a new concept to libraries; however, advances in universal design have raised its profile. Projects like Cloud4All and GPII identified the lack of common terminologies and models to describe the needs and preferences of users and information that fits those needs as a major gap in providing universal access solutions.. Those types of information are accessibility metadata. Schema.org has incorporated several accessibility properties based on IMS Global Access for All Information Model Data Element Specification. The Wiki page WebSchemas/Accessibility lists several properties and their values.\n\nWhile the efforts to describe and standardize the varied accessibility needs of information seekers are beginning to become more robust their adoption into established metadata schemas has not been as developed. For example, while Dublin Core (DC)'s “audience” and MARC 21's “reading level” could be used to identify resources suitable for users with dyslexia and DC's “Format” could be used to identify resources available in braille, audio, or large print formats, there is more work to be done.\n\nMetadata (metacontent) or, more correctly, the vocabularies used to assemble metadata (metacontent) statements, is typically structured according to a standardized concept using a well-defined metadata scheme, including: metadata standards and metadata models. Tools such as controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, thesauri, data dictionaries, and metadata registries can be used to apply further standardization to the metadata. Structural metadata commonality is also of paramount importance in data model development and in database design.\n\nMetadata (metacontent) syntax refers to the rules created to structure the fields or elements of metadata (metacontent). A single metadata scheme may be expressed in a number of different markup or programming languages, each of which requires a different syntax. For example, Dublin Core may be expressed in plain text, HTML, XML, and RDF.\n\nA common example of (guide) metacontent is the bibliographic classification, the subject, the Dewey Decimal class number. There is always an implied statement in any \"classification\" of some object. To classify an object as, for example, Dewey class number 514 (Topology) (i.e. books having the number 514 on their spine) the implied statement is: \"<nowiki><book><subject heading><514></nowiki>. This is a subject-predicate-object triple, or more importantly, a class-attribute-value triple. The first two elements of the triple (class, attribute) are pieces of some structural metadata having a defined semantic. The third element is a value, preferably from some controlled vocabulary, some reference (master) data. The combination of the metadata and master data elements results in a statement which is a metacontent statement i.e. \"metacontent = metadata + master data\". All of these elements can be thought of as \"vocabulary\". Both metadata and master data are vocabularies which can be assembled into metacontent statements. There are many sources of these vocabularies, both meta and master data: UML, EDIFACT, XSD, Dewey/UDC/LoC, SKOS, ISO-25964, Pantone, Linnaean Binomial Nomenclature, etc. Using controlled vocabularies for the components of metacontent statements, whether for indexing or finding, is endorsed by ISO 25964: \"If both the indexer and the searcher are guided to choose the same term for the same concept, then relevant documents will be retrieved.\" This is particularly relevant when considering search engines of the internet, such as Google. The process indexes pages then matches text strings using its complex algorithm; there is no intelligence or \"inferencing\" occurring, just the illusion thereof.\n\nMetadata schemata can be hierarchical in nature where relationships exist between metadata elements and elements are nested so that parent-child relationships exist between the elements.\nAn example of a hierarchical metadata schema is the IEEE LOM schema, in which metadata elements may belong to a parent metadata element.\nMetadata schemata can also be one-dimensional, or linear, where each element is completely discrete from other elements and classified according to one dimension only.\nAn example of a linear metadata schema is the Dublin Core schema, which is one dimensional.\nMetadata schemata are often two dimensional, or planar, where each element is completely discrete from other elements but classified according to two orthogonal dimensions.\n\nIn all cases where the metadata schemata exceed the planar depiction, some type of hypermapping is required to enable display and view of metadata according to chosen aspect and to serve special views. Hypermapping frequently applies to layering of geographical and geological information overlays.\n\nThe degree to which the data or metadata is structured is referred to as its \"granularity\". \"Granularity\" refers to how much detail is provided. Metadata with a high granularity allows for deeper, more detailed, and more structured information and enables greater level of technical manipulation. A lower level of granularity means that metadata can be created for considerably lower costs but will not provide as detailed information. The major impact of granularity is not only on creation and capture, but moreover on maintenance costs. As soon as the metadata structures become outdated, so too is the access to the referred data. Hence granularity must take into account the effort to create the metadata as well as the effort to maintain it.\n\nInternational standards apply to metadata. Much work is being accomplished in the national and international standards communities, especially ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) to reach consensus on standardizing metadata and registries. The core metadata registry standard is ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registries (MDR), the framework for the standard is described in ISO/IEC 11179-1:2004. A new edition of Part 1 is in its final stage for publication in 2015 or early 2016. It has been revised to align with the current edition of Part 3, ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013 which extends the MDR to support registration of Concept Systems.\n(see ISO/IEC 11179). This standard specifies a schema for recording both the meaning and technical structure of the data for unambiguous usage by humans and computers. ISO/IEC 11179 standard refers to metadata as information objects about data, or \"data about data\". In ISO/IEC 11179 Part-3, the information objects are data about Data Elements, Value Domains, and other reusable semantic and representational information objects that describe the meaning and technical details of a data item. This standard also prescribes the details for a metadata registry, and for registering and administering the information objects within a Metadata Registry. ISO/IEC 11179 Part 3 also has provisions for describing compound structures that are derivations of other data elements, for example through calculations, collections of one or more data elements, or other forms of derived data. While this standard describes itself originally as a \"data element\" registry, its purpose is to support describing and registering metadata content independently of any particular application, lending the descriptions to being discovered and reused by humans or computers in developing new applications, databases, or for analysis of data collected in accordance with the registered metadata content. This standard has become the general basis for other kinds of metadata registries, reusing and extending the registration and administration portion of the standard.\n\nThe Geospatial community has a tradition of specialized geospatial metadata standards, particularly building on traditions of map- and image-libraries and catalogues. Formal metadata is usually essential for geospatial data, as common text-processing approaches are not applicable.\n\nThe Dublin Core metadata terms are a set of vocabulary terms which can be used to describe resources for the purposes of discovery. The original set of 15 classic metadata terms, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set are endorsed in the following standards documents:\n\nAlthough not a standard, Microformat (also mentioned in the section metadata on the internet below) is a web-based approach to semantic markup which seeks to re-use existing HTML/XHTML tags to convey metadata. Microformat follows XHTML and HTML standards but is not a standard in itself. One advocate of microformats, Tantek Çelik, characterized a problem with alternative approaches: \n\nMetadata may be written into a digital photo file that will identify who owns it, copyright and contact information, what brand or model of camera created the file, along with exposure information (shutter speed, f-stop, etc.) and descriptive information, such as keywords about the photo, making the file or image searchable on a computer and/or the Internet. Some metadata is created by the camera and some is input by the photographer and/or software after downloading to a computer. Most digital cameras write metadata about model number, shutter speed, etc., and some enable you to edit it; this functionality has been available on most Nikon DSLRs since the Nikon D3, on most new Canon cameras since the Canon EOS 7D, and on most Pentax DSLRs since the Pentax K-3. Metadata can be used to make organizing in post-production easier with the use of key-wording. Filters can be used to analyze a specific set of photographs and create selections on criteria like rating or capture time.\n\nPhotographic Metadata Standards are governed by organizations that develop the following standards. They include, but are not limited to:\n\nInformation on the times, origins and destinations of phone calls, electronic messages, instant messages and other modes of telecommunication, as opposed to message content, is another form of metadata. Bulk collection of this call detail record metadata by intelligence agencies has proven controversial after disclosures by Edward Snowden of the fact that certain Intelligence agencies such as the NSA had been (and perhaps still are) keeping online metadata on millions of internet user for up to a year, regardless of whether or not they [ever] were persons of interest to the agency.\n\nMetadata is particularly useful in video, where information about its contents (such as transcripts of conversations and text descriptions of its scenes) is not directly understandable by a computer, but where efficient search of the content is desirable. This is particularly useful in video applications such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition and Vehicle Recognition Identification software, wherein license plate data is saved and used to create reports and alerts. There are two sources in which video metadata is derived: (1) operational gathered metadata, that is information about the content produced, such as the type of equipment, software, date, and location; (2) human-authored metadata, to improve search engine visibility, discoverability, audience engagement, and providing advertising opportunities to video publishers. In today's society most professional video editing software has access to metadata. Avid's MetaSync and Adobe's Bridge are two prime examples of this.\n\nMetadata can be created either by automated information processing or by manual work. Elementary metadata captured by computers can include information about when an object was created, who created it, when it was last updated, file size, and file extension. In this context an \"object\" refers to any of the following:\n\n\nData virtualization has emerged in the 2000s as the new software technology to complete the virtualization \"stack\" in the enterprise. Metadata is used in data virtualization servers which are enterprise infrastructure components, alongside database and application servers. Metadata in these servers is saved as persistent repository and describe business objects in various enterprise systems and applications. Structural metadata commonality is also important to support data virtualization.\n\nStandardization and harmonization work has brought advantages to industry efforts to build metadata systems in the statistical community. Several metadata guidelines and standards such as the European Statistics Code of Practice and ISO 17369:2013 (Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange or SDMX) provide key principles for how businesses, government bodies, and other entities should manage statistical data and metadata. Entities such as Eurostat, European System of Central Banks, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have implemented these and other such standards and guidelines with the goal of improving \"efficiency when managing statistical business processes.\"\n\nMetadata has been used in various ways as a means of cataloging items in libraries in both digital and analog format. Such data helps classify, aggregate, identify, and locate a particular book, DVD, magazine or any object a library might hold in its collection. Until the 1980s, many library catalogues used 3x5 inch cards in file drawers to display a book's title, author, subject matter, and an abbreviated alpha-numeric string (call number) which indicated the physical location of the book within the library's shelves. The Dewey Decimal System employed by libraries for the classification of library materials by subject is an early example of metadata usage. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, many libraries replaced these paper file cards with computer databases. These computer databases make it much easier and faster for users to do keyword searches. Another form of older metadata collection is the use by US Census Bureau of what is known as the \"Long Form.\" The Long Form asks questions that are used to create demographic data to find patterns of distribution. Libraries employ metadata in library catalogues, most commonly as part of an Integrated Library Management System. Metadata is obtained by cataloguing resources such as books, periodicals, DVDs, web pages or digital images. This data is stored in the integrated library management system, ILMS, using the MARC metadata standard. The purpose is to direct patrons to the physical or electronic location of items or areas they seek as well as to provide a description of the item/s in question.\n\nMore recent and specialized instances of library metadata include the establishment of digital libraries including e-print repositories and digital image libraries. While often based on library principles, the focus on non-librarian use, especially in providing metadata, means they do not follow traditional or common cataloging approaches. Given the custom nature of included materials, metadata fields are often specially created e.g. taxonomic classification fields, location fields, keywords or copyright statement. Standard file information such as file size and format are usually automatically included. Library operation has for decades been a key topic in efforts toward international standardization. Standards for metadata in digital libraries include Dublin Core, METS, MODS, DDI, DOI, URN, schema, EML, and OAI-PMH. Leading libraries in the world give hints on their metadata standards strategies.\n\nMetadata in a museum context is the information that trained cultural documentation specialists, such as archivists, librarians, museum registrars and curators, create to index, structure, describe, identify, or otherwise specify works of art, architecture, cultural objects and their images. Descriptive metadata is most commonly used in museum contexts for object identification and resource recovery purposes.\n\nMetadata is developed and applied within collecting institutions and museums in order to:\n\nMany museums and cultural heritage centers recognize that given the diversity of art works and cultural objects, no single model or standard suffices to describe and catalogue cultural works. For example, a sculpted Indigenous artifact could be classified as an artwork, an archaeological artifact, or an Indigenous heritage item. The early stages of standardization in archiving, description and cataloging within the museum community began in the late 1990s with the development of standards such as Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA), Spectrum, CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) and the CDWA Lite XML schema. These standards use HTML and XML markup languages for machine processing, publication and implementation. The Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR), originally developed for characterizing books, have also been applied to cultural objects, works of art and architecture. Standards, such as the CCO, are integrated within a Museum's Collections Management System (CMS), a database through which museums are able to manage their collections, acquisitions, loans and conservation. Scholars and professionals in the field note that the \"quickly evolving landscape of standards and technologies\" create challenges for cultural documentarians, specifically non-technically trained professionals. Most collecting institutions and museums use a relational database to categorize cultural works and their images. Relational databases and metadata work to document and describe the complex relationships amongst cultural objects and multi-faceted works of art, as well as between objects and places, people and artistic movements. Relational database structures are also beneficial within collecting institutions and museums because they allow for archivists to make a clear distinction between cultural objects and their images; an unclear distinction could lead to confusing and inaccurate searches.\n\nAn object's materiality, function and purpose, as well as the size (e.g., measurements, such as height, width, weight), storage requirements (e.g., climate-controlled environment) and focus of the museum and collection, influence the descriptive depth of the data attributed to the object by cultural documentarians. The established institutional cataloging practices, goals and expertise of cultural documentarians and database structure also influence the information ascribed to cultural objects, and the ways in which cultural objects are categorized. Additionally, museums often employ standardized commercial collection management software that prescribes and limits the ways in which archivists can describe artworks and cultural objects. As well, collecting institutions and museums use Controlled Vocabularies to describe cultural objects and artworks in their collections. Getty Vocabularies and the Library of Congress Controlled Vocabularies are reputable within the museum community and are recommended by CCO standards. Museums are encouraged to use controlled vocabularies that are contextual and relevant to their collections and enhance the functionality of their digital information systems. Controlled Vocabularies are beneficial within databases because they provide a high level of consistency, improving resource retrieval. Metadata structures, including controlled vocabularies, reflect the ontologies of the systems from which they were created. Often the processes through which cultural objects are described and categorized through metadata in museums do not reflect the perspectives of the maker communities.\n\nMetadata has been instrumental in the creation of digital information systems and archives within museums, and has made it easier for museums to publish digital content online. This has enabled audiences who might not have had access to cultural objects due to geographic or economic barriers to have access to them. In the 2000s, as more museums have adopted archival standards and created intricate databases, discussions about Linked Data between museum databases have come up in the museum, archival and library science communities. Collection Management Systems (CMS) and Digital Asset Management tools can be local or shared systems. Digital Humanities scholars note many benefits of interoperability between museum databases and collections, while also acknowledging the difficulties achieving such interoperability.\n\nProblems involving metadata in litigation in the United States are becoming widespread. Courts have looked at various questions involving metadata, including the discoverability of metadata by parties. Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have only specified rules about electronic documents, subsequent case law has elaborated on the requirement of parties to reveal metadata. In October 2009, the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled that metadata records are public record. Document metadata have proven particularly important in legal environments in which litigation has requested metadata, which can include sensitive information detrimental to a certain party in court. Using metadata removal tools to \"clean\" or redact documents can mitigate the risks of unwittingly sending sensitive data. This process partially (see data remanence) protects law firms from potentially damaging leaking of sensitive data through electronic discovery.\n\nOpinion polls have shown that 45% of Americans are \"not at all confident\" in the ability of social media sites ensure their personal data is secure and 40% say that social media sites should not be able to store any information on individuals. 76% of Americans say that they are not confident that the information advertising agencies collect on them is secure and 50% say that online advertising agencies should not be allowed to record any of their information at all.\n\nIn Australia, the need to strengthen national security has resulted in the introduction of a new metadata storage law. This new law means that both security and policing agencies will be allowed to access up to two years of an individual's metadata, with the aim of making it easier to stop any terrorist attacks and serious crimes from happening.\n\nlegislative metadata has been the subject of some discussion in law.gov forums such as workshops held by the Legal Information Institute at the Cornell Law School on March 22 and 23, 2010. The documentation for these forums are titled, \"Suggested metadata practices for legislation and regulations.\" \n\nA handful of key points have been outlined by these discussions, section headings of which are listed as follows:\n\n\nAustralian medical research pioneered the definition of metadata for applications in health care. That approach offers the first recognized attempt to adhere to international standards in medical sciences instead of defining a proprietary standard under the World Health Organization (WHO) umbrella. The medical community yet did not approve the need to follow metadata standards despite research that supported these standards.\n\nResearch studies in the fields of biomedicine and molecular biology frequently yield large quantities of data, including results of genome or meta-genome sequencing, proteomics data, and even notes or plans created during the course of research itself. Each data type involves its own variety of metadata and the processes necessary to produce these metadata. General metadata standards, such as ISA-Tab, allow researchers to create and exchange experimental metadata in consistent formats. Specific experimental approaches frequently have their own metadata standards and systems: metadata standards for mass spectrometry include mzML and SPLASH, while XML-based standard such as PDBML and SRA XML serve as standards for macromolecular structure and sequencing data, respectively.\n\nThe products of biomedical research are generally realized as peer-reviewed manuscripts and these publications are yet another source of data. Metadata for biomedical publications is often created by journal publishers and citation databases such as PubMed and Web of Science. The data contained within manuscripts or accompanying them as supplementary material is less often subject to metadata creation, though they may be submitted to biomedical databases after publication. The original authors and database curators then become responsible for metadata creation, with the assistance of automated processes. Comprehensive metadata for all experimental data is the foundation of the FAIR Guiding Principles, or the standards for ensuring research data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.\n\nA data warehouse (DW) is a repository of an organization's electronically stored data. Data warehouses are designed to manage and store the data. Data warehouses differ from business intelligence (BI) systems, because BI systems are designed to use data to create reports and analyze the information, to provide strategic guidance to management. Metadata is an important tool in how data is stored in data warehouses. The purpose of a data warehouse is to house standardized, structured, consistent, integrated, correct, \"cleaned\" and timely data, extracted from various operational systems in an organization. The extracted data are integrated in the data warehouse environment to provide an enterprise-wide perspective. Data are structured in a way to serve the reporting and analytic requirements. The design of structural metadata commonality using a data modeling method such as entity relationship model diagramming is important in any data warehouse development effort. They detail metadata on each piece of data in the data warehouse. An essential component of a data warehouse/business intelligence system is the metadata and tools to manage and retrieve the metadata. Ralph Kimball describes metadata as the DNA of the data warehouse as metadata defines the elements of the data warehouse and how they work together.\n\nKimball et al. refers to three main categories of metadata: Technical metadata, business metadata and process metadata. Technical metadata is primarily definitional, while business metadata and process metadata is primarily descriptive. The categories sometimes overlap.\n\nThe HTML format used to define web pages allows for the inclusion of a variety of types of metadata, from basic descriptive text, dates and keywords to further advanced metadata schemes such as the Dublin Core, e-GMS, and AGLS standards. Pages can also be geotagged with coordinates. Metadata may be included in the page's header or in a separate file. Microformats allow metadata to be added to on-page data in a way that regular web users do not see, but computers, web crawlers and search engines can readily access. Many search engines are cautious about using metadata in their ranking algorithms due to exploitation of metadata and the practice of search engine optimization, SEO, to improve rankings. See Meta element article for further discussion. This cautious attitude may be justified as people, according to Doctorow, are not executing care and diligence when creating their own metadata and that metadata is part of a competitive environment where the metadata is used to promote the metadata creators own purposes. Studies show that search engines respond to web pages with metadata implementations, and Google has an announcement on its site showing the meta tags that its search engine understands. Enterprise search startup Swiftype recognizes metadata as a relevance signal that webmasters can implement for their website-specific search engine, even releasing their own extension, known as Meta Tags 2.\n\nIn broadcast industry, metadata is linked to audio and video broadcast media to:\n\nThis metadata can be linked to the video media thanks to the video servers. Most major broadcast sport events like FIFA World Cup or the Olympic Games use this metadata to distribute their video content to TV stations through keywords. It is often the host broadcaster who is in charge of organizing metadata through its \"International Broadcast Centre\" and its video servers. This metadata is recorded with the images and are entered by metadata operators (\"loggers\") who associate in live metadata available in \"metadata grids\" through software (such as Multicam(LSM) or IPDirector used during the FIFA World Cup or Olympic Games).\n\nMetadata that describes geographic objects in electronic storage or format (such as datasets, maps, features, or documents with a geospatial component) has a history dating back to at least 1994 (refer MIT Library page on FGDC Metadata). This class of metadata is described more fully on the geospatial metadata article.\n\nEcological and environmental metadata is intended to document the \"who, what, when, where, why, and how\" of data collection for a particular study. This typically means which organization or institution collected the data, what type of data, which date(s) the data was collected, the rationale for the data collection, and the methodology used for the data collection. Metadata should be generated in a format commonly used by the most relevant science community, such as Darwin Core, Ecological Metadata Language, or Dublin Core. Metadata editing tools exist to facilitate metadata generation (e.g. Metavist, , Morpho). Metadata should describe provenance of the data (where they originated, as well as any transformations the data underwent) and how to give credit for (cite) the data products.\n\nWhen first released in 1982, Compact Discs only contained a Table Of Contents (TOC) with the number of tracks on the disc and their length in samples. Fourteen years later in 1996, a revision of the CD Red Book standard added CD-Text to carry additional metadata. But CD-Text was not widely adopted. Shortly thereafter, it became common for personal computers to retrieve metadata from external sources (e.g. CDDB, Gracenote) based on the TOC.\n\nDigital audio formats such as digital audio files superseded music formats such as cassette tapes and CDs in the 2000s. Digital audio files could be labelled with more information than could be contained in just the file name. That descriptive information is called the audio tag or audio metadata in general. Computer programs specializing in adding or modifying this information are called tag editors. Metadata can be used to name, describe, catalogue and indicate ownership or copyright for a digital audio file, and its presence makes it much easier to locate a specific audio file within a group, typically through use of a search engine that accesses the metadata. As different digital audio formats were developed, attempts were made to standardize a specific location within the digital files where this information could be stored.\n\nAs a result, almost all digital audio formats, including mp3, broadcast wav and AIFF files, have similar standardized locations that can be populated with metadata. The metadata for compressed and uncompressed digital music is often encoded in the ID3 tag. Common editors such as TagLib support MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, Speex, WavPack TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4, and ASF file formats.\n\nWith the availability of cloud applications, which include those to add metadata to content, metadata is increasingly available over the Internet.\n\nMetadata can be stored either \"internally\", in the same file or structure as the data (this is also called \"embedded metadata\"), or \"externally\", in a separate file or field from the described data. A data repository typically stores the metadata \"detached\" from the data, but can be designed to support embedded metadata approaches. Each option has advantages and disadvantages:\n\nMetadata can be stored in either human-readable or binary form. Storing metadata in a human-readable format such as XML can be useful because users can understand and edit it without specialized tools. However, text-based formats are rarely optimized for storage capacity, communication time, or processing speed. A binary metadata format enables efficiency in all these respects, but requires special software to convert the binary information into human-readable content.\n\nEach relational database system has its own mechanisms for storing metadata. Examples of relational-database metadata include:\nIn database terminology, this set of metadata is referred to as the catalog. The SQL standard specifies a uniform means to access the catalog, called the information schema, but not all databases implement it, even if they implement other aspects of the SQL standard. For an example of database-specific metadata access methods, see Oracle metadata. Programmatic access to metadata is possible using APIs such as JDBC, or SchemaCrawler.\n\nOne of the first satirical examinations of the concept of Metadata as we understand it today is American Science Fiction author Hal Draper's short story, MS_Fnd_in_a_Lbry (1961).\nHere, the knowledge of all Mankind is condensed into an object the size of a desk drawer, however the magnitude of the metadata (e.g. catalog of catalogs of... , as well as indexes and histories) eventually leads to dire yet humorous consequence for the human race.\nThe story prefigures the modern consequences of allowing metadata to become more important than the real data it is concerned with, and the risks inherent in that eventuality as a cautionary tale.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "207968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207968", "title": "National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands", "text": "National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands\n\nThe National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (, , NSB) was a Dutch fascist and later national socialist political party. As a parliamentary party participating in legislative elections, the NSB had some success during the 1930s. It remained the only legal party in the Netherlands during most of the Second World War.\n\nThe NSB was founded in Utrecht in 1931 during a period when several nationalist, fascist and national socialist parties were founded. The founders were Anton Mussert, who became the party's leader, and Cornelis van Geelkerken. The party based its program on Italian fascism and German national socialism, however unlike the latter before 1936 the party was not anti-semitic and even had Jewish members.\n\nIn 1933, after a year of building an organization, the party organized its first public meeting, a \"Landdag\" in Utrecht which was attended by 600 party militants. Here the party presented itself. After that the party's support began to grow. In the same year the government forbade civil servants to be members of the NSB.\n\nIn the provincial elections of 1935 the party gained 8 percent of the votes and two seats in the Senate. This result was achieved against the background of the economic hardship of the Great Depression. Mussert's image as a reliable politician and his pragmatism allowed him to unite the different types of fascism and contributed to the party's success. This was bolstered by the party's strong organization and its political strategy, which was not oriented towards violent revolution but a democratic legal take over of the country. By 1936 the party had begun holding annual mass meetings near Lunteren in Gelderland, and in 1938 it built the Muur van Mussert there, a wall which was supposed to be one element in a set of buildings and monuments inspired by the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg.\n\nIn 1936, under influence of Meinoud Rost van Tonningen the party became openly anti-semitic. Rost van Tonningen began to question Mussert's leadership with support of the German Nazi Party, raising internal divisions within the party. This led to decreased support for the party and a strong anti-fascist reaction of the political parties, trade unions and churches. In the 1937 general elections the party gained only 4 percent of the votes and four seats in the House of Representatives, however it increased its representation in the Senate to five seats. In parliament the NSB MPs showed little respect for parliamentary procedures and rules. Many NSB MPs were called to order by the chairman of parliament for physical and verbal violence. In the provincial election of 1939 the party also gained 4 percent of the votes.\n\nAfter the Second World War broke out, the NSB sympathized with the Germans and advocated strict neutrality for the Netherlands. In May 1940, 800 NSB members and sympathizers were put in custody by the Dutch government, after the German invasion. Soon after the Dutch defeat on 14 May 1940, they were set free by German troops. In June 1940, Mussert delivered a speech in Lunteren in which he called for the Netherlands to embrace the Germans and renounce the Dutch Monarchy, which had fled to London.\n\nIn 1940 the German occupation government had outlawed all socialist and communist parties; in 1941 it forbade all parties, except for the NSB. The NSB openly collaborated with the occupation forces. Its membership grew to about 100,000. The NSB played an important role in lower government and civil service; every new mayor appointed by the German occupation government was a member of the NSB. On the national level, Mussert had expected he would be made leader of an independent Dutch state allied to Germany; in reality, however, the Austrian national socialist Arthur Seyss-Inquart was in charge of an occupation government. Mussert had several meetings with Adolf Hitler in which he pleaded for an independent Netherlands, but he was unsuccessful. Although Seyss-Inquart had proposed that Mussert should be made Prime Minister of the Netherlands, he was only given the honorary title 'Leader of the Dutch People', and he was allowed to build a marginal State Secretariat, but he was given little or no actual power. His influence in the party waned at the expense of Rost van Tonningen and other more pro-German members. Beginning in the summer of 1943, many male members of the NSB were organized in the Landwacht, which helped the government control the population.\n\nOn 4 September 1944, the Allied forces conquered Antwerp and the NSB expected the fall of the Netherlands to come soon. On 5 September, most of the NSB's leadership fled to Germany and the party's organization fell apart, on what is known as \"Dolle Dinsdag\" (Mad Tuesday).\n\nAfter the German signing of surrender on 6 May 1945, the NSB was outlawed. Mussert was arrested the following day. Many of the members of the NSB were arrested, but only a few were convicted. Mussert was executed on 7 May 1946.\n\nThere were no attempts to continue the organization illegally.\n\nThe NSB started out as a classical fascist party, which based itself on the principles of leadership. It wanted a fascist state with a compliant government, fascist order and state control. It put the \"national interest\" above the individual interest and the interest of social groups, (pillars) that had characterized Dutch society. The party was anti-parliamentary and authoritarian. Its program, which was modeled on the program of the German Nazi Party, lacked reference to anti-semitic or racist ideology of the Nazi Party. After 1936, under the influence of Meinoud Rost van Tonningen, the party became more oriented towards the Nazi Party and took over its anti-semitic and racist ideas. It also began to sympathize with the aggressive foreign policy of Italy and Germany.\n\nPractical demands of the NSB were: abolition of individual voting rights, corporatism, a duty to work and serve in the army, limits on the freedom of the press, laws against strikes. It demanded a reunification of the Netherlands with Flanders and French Flanders in a Greater Netherlands, which would also control a large colonial empire consisting of Belgian Congo, Dutch East Indies and perhaps South Africa. This state would not be a part of Germany, but only an independent loyal ally to Germany.\n\nThe NSB copied elements of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis. Like Mussolini's Fascists, the NSB uniforms included black shirts, and the Party adopted the Fascist salute. Since 1933 it used the salute \"Hou Zee!\", which, Anton Mussert said, connoted courage and referred to the glorious maritime history of the Dutch Republic. It also began using titles like \"Leider\" for Mussert (Leader; similar to Duce or Führer), \"Kameraad\" for men (comrade) and \"Kameraadske\" ('comradess', a neologism) for women. One party slogan was \"Mussert or Moscow\", evoking the Fascist defense against supposed Communist subversion. Although the Party later adopted the Nazi red and black colors and the swastika symbol, the original NSB flag used the Prince's Flag. A blue \"wolfsangel\" (a hooked symbol of a wolf trap) on a white disc was set against an orange field.\n\nThis table shows the results of the NSB in elections to the House of Representatives (lower house), the Senate, the States-Provincial, and the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader. The membership of NSB is also represented. The House of Representatives then had 100 members.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> leader in the Senate\n\nBefore 1940 the NSB held seats in provincial and municipal legislatures, but did not cooperate in any governments. After 1940 these legislatures stopped functioning and the NSB's role in local and provincial legislatures expanded. All newly appointed mayors were member of the NSB.\n\nThe following figure shows the election results of the provincial elections of 1935 and 1939, per province. It shows the areas where the NSB was strong, namely in South Holland, North Holland and Gelderland. The NSB was the strongest in Drenthe and Limburg. In 1935, it became the second largest party in Limburg. The party was weaker in Friesland, North Brabant and Zeeland.\n\nIn 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, the party lost nearly half of its provincial seats.\n\nThe NSB drew its main support from the middle class: civil servants, farmers, business people and soldiers supported the party. Most of these people were not part of the strong pillarized organisations surrounding the socialist unions, and the Protestant and Catholic Churches, instead they were often a loose member of the weaker liberal pillar, which was very diverse. The NSB party scored particularly well in Drenthe, Gelderland and the towns of Limburg at the border with Germany.\n\nHistorians Lou de Jong and A.A. de Jonge have characterized NSB members as socially isolated opportunists who were motivated to join the NSB through a mix of opportunism, idealism and social connections.\n\nThe party was organized with Mussert serving as party chair and political leader. From September 1940 until its dissolution, Carolus Josephus Huygen served as Secretary General of the party. Yearly the party organized a \"Landdag\", where Mussert held a political speech.\n\nThe NSB was surrounded by several party organizations. It published a weekly newspaper, \"Volk en Vaderland\" (\"People and Fatherland\"). Between 1931 and 1935 the party had its own paramilitary organization, the black uniformed \"Weerbaarheidsafdeling\" (WA), similar to the \"Sturmabteilung\" of the Nazi Party. It was refounded in 1940. It also founded its own youth organization, \"Nationale Jeugdstorm\" (Youthstorm); a farmers' organization; and a daily newspaper, \"Het Nationale Dagblad\" (The National Daily).\n\nIn 1940 the NSB formed the Nederlandsche SS (Dutch SS), it had up to 7,000 members.\n\nThe term \"NSB'er\" has become synonymous with traitor in the Netherlands, and is used as an insult, especially in the context of ratting somebody out to authorities.\n\nA grim joke after World War II, made by Dutch Resistance fighters, is that former NSB members insisted that their acronym actually stood for \"Niet So [zo] Bedoeld\" or \"I didn't mean it\" as they attempted to downplay their treachery.\n\nThe NSB was methodically isolated by other parties. Before the war the socialist Social Democratic Workers' Party and \"Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen\" (Dutch Association of Trade Unions) coordinated counter-demonstrations and propaganda with a separate organization 'Freedom, Labour and Bread'.\n\n"}

There are many web archives running. The most famous began in 1996: the Swedish Kulturarw3; the Australian Pandora, and the most popular repository, Internet Archive. \nThe analysis of these and other projects, made way to the planning of PADICAT project, following the common trend around the world of a hybrid model of functioning, complementing the regular capture of a whole geographical domain (.cat domain in this case), with selective actions, and expand these coverage to different social events that generate an intense activity in the network (electoral campaigns, for instance) or with thematic packages (museums of Catalonia, Catalan folk-rock on the web, etc.).

On September 11, 2006, coinciding with celebration of National Day of Catalonia, PADICAT website was opened to the public, with about thirty web pages stored.\n\nThe 2006–08 period represents production phase, project plan pilot, PADICAT operation phase: systematic capture of web pages of Catalonia.\n\nThe 2009–2011 period, Biblioteca de Catalunya should be in an optimum position, whereby this system -a pioneer in Spain and a benchmark in Europe- operates at full capacity. Furthermore, have reached cooperation agreements with more than 450 institutions of all kinds and has warranted online open access to all collection.\nOn September 11, 2011, coinciding again with the National Day of Catalonia and with the fifth anniversary of its website, PADICAT has opened a new website version to access all deposited contents.\n\nIn November 2012, PADICAT has preserved 58,122 webs, 249.609 crawls, 349 million files and 13 TB of disk space. All of them are freely available.\n\nThe mission of PADICAT is to harvest, to process and to provide access to digital heritage of Catalonia born on the Internet.\nIts objectives are:\n\n\nAfter its birth (2005-2006), growth (2007-2008) and consolidation (2009-2011) phases, since 2012 is wanted to systematize its capacity for growth, with the goal of incorporating 75.700 versions of about 32.000 web sites per year, from:\n\n\nIn addition, there are four permanent work areas:\n\n\nPADICAT is a system based on the implementation of several software that allow web pages to be collected, stored, organized, preserved and permanently accessed. Later to analysis phase and software test was determined that be used Heritrix software, applied in most capture of digital resources projects. This is a software charge to compile web pages as the user sees when surf the Internet and store it in compressed files with ARC or WARC extension. Then, Heritrix software is complemented by NutchWax, or by combination with Hadoop and Wayback, doing an indexing process to compiled information that will permit use these index for localize collection resources from query interfaces: Wera, that permits search from keywords through generated indexes by NutchWax; and Wayback, that lets consult by URL in generated indexes by Hadoop and same Wayback.\n\nHas been used Web Curator Tool software, developed by National Library of New Zealand and British Library, as a document management system that permits allocate metadata to a significant part of collection, in order to integrate, in future, funds of deposit to search in other catalogs, from the Biblioteca de Catalunya or other institutions. Nowadays, websites are being cataloged through CAT, a software expressly developed by CESCA technicians for the project.\n\nWith regard to hardware that maintains system, there are six nodes HP ProLiant DL360 G4p, charge to collection and indexation tasks of web pages. In charge of results searching and viewing in web interface there is Linux cluster high-availability, with balance features of requests loads and error tolerance if there is a technical disaster of nodes that integrate platform. NetApp FAS3170 cabin presents 19TB of disk capacity via NFS to these nodes.\n\nNodes are connected with fibre to a Storage Area Network (SAN) and is complemented with saving system of data backup robot.\n\nIs expected to include the deposited contents in PADICAT to COFRE (COnservem per al Futur Recursos Electrònics), a high security preservation system created for the Biblioteca de Catalunya\n\n"}

{"id": "1866206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866206", "title": "Pipe rolls", "text": "Pipe rolls\n\nThe Pipe rolls, sometimes called the Great rolls, or the Great Rolls of the Pipe, are a collection of financial records maintained by the English Exchequer, or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833. They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they are some of the earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.\n\nThey were the records of the yearly audits performed by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.\n\nThe Pipe rolls are named after the \"pipe\" shape formed by the rolled up parchments on which the records were originally written. There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they \"piped\" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or pipe of wine. They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe.\n\nThe Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually conducted at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.\n\nThe earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129–30, and the continuous series begins in 1155–56, and continued for almost seven hundred years.\n\nCombined with the Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started about the same time as the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.\n\nThe \"Dialogus de Scaccario\" or \"Dialogue concerning the Exchequer\", written in about 1178, details the workings of the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The \"Dialogue\" was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the \"Dialogue\", the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner workings of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The \"Dialogue\" also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.\n\nThe main source of income recorded on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls. Scutage payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.\n\nAlthough they recorded all income that came through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, as well as more occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.\n\nExpenditures were also subject to documentation in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses, wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons, hunting expenses, payments to acquire a governmental office, payments to mercenaries, and the costs of bags and casks to transport silver pennies about the kingdom.\n\nInformation about other subjects besides revenues also is contained in the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons. The Pipe rolls also allow the identification of the custodians of royal lands and castles. The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.\n\nCertain areas did not report their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These included the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, but it was not a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.\n\nAlthough the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years. An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the Cotton Library at the British Museum. Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign, but others feel that they were introduced by King William I (reigned 1066–1087). The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian Pauline Stafford argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of Cnut (reigned 1016–1035), Æthelred II (reigned 978–1016), and Edgar the Peaceable (reigned 959–975). There is a reference to the king's \"rolls\" in a writ from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of Westminster of ten shillings, but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later cartulary, and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a solid source for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.\n\nAfter the one surviving roll from Henry I's reign, no further Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from the reign of his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by the second year of King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).\n\nThe surviving Pipe roll from 1130 records an income of £24,500. This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850. The income that they record in the early years of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.\n\nBy the time of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of information in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system was settled on whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded in a set of \"receipt rolls\" and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls. A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate \"Estreat rolls\", and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls. In 1284 the \"Statutes of Rhuddlan\" were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls. At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a \"d\" and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.\n\nYet more extraneous details were removed from the Pipe rolls under the \"Cowick Ordinance\" of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the \"Cowick Ordinance\" attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.\n\nIn 1462, the exchequer was told to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as these would be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.\n\nThe Pipe rolls series ended in 1834 when the office that was in charge of their creation, the Pipe Office, was abolished.\n\nThey were created by taking the shire, or other governmental districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about wide. The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe. They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the Patent Rolls were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving the name of the county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.\n\nSometimes they are referred to, in Latin, as \"magnus rotulus pipae\". Several sources for the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may have been from Sicily.\n\nThe rolls were written in Latin until 1733, except for a short time around 1650. During the reign of Henry II, a duplicate copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the Chancellor, and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created at the same time as the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor. The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or other material.\n\nThe example of the royal exchequer's records eventually influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls are those of the Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a continuous series from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator. They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.\n\nA number of historians have studied the surviving Pipe rolls, using them as the basis for study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as on the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.\n\nThe Pipe rolls from the 13th century onwards are less important for historical study because there are other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls. However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.\n\nThe earliest Pipe rolls were published by the Record Commission in 1833 (the isolated roll of 1130) and the Public Record Office in 1844 (the rolls for 1155–58). The Commission's edition of the 1130 roll has now been superseded by a new edition (with English translation) published by the Pipe Roll Society in 2012.\n\nIn 1883 the Pipe Roll Society (a text publication society) was founded by the Public Record Office, on the initiative of Walford Dakin Selby and his colleague James Greenstreet, to establish a systematic publishing programme for the Pipe rolls. It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224. Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the Yale University Press. Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in \"record type\", designed to produce a near-facsimile of the original manuscript, including its scribal abbreviations. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since have been published in normal type with abbreviations extended.\n\nThe Pipe Roll Society has also published numerous related texts, including the Chancellor's Roll for 1196 and the Norman Pipe Rolls of Henry II. Rolls for the Irish Exchequer and the Norman Exchequer have also been published.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29880890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29880890", "title": "Ravens of the Tower of London", "text": "Ravens of the Tower of London\n\nThe Ravens of the Tower of London is a group of at least six captive ravens which live at the Tower of London. Their presence is traditionally believed to protect The Crown and the tower; a superstition holds that \"if the Tower of London ravens are lost or fly away, the Crown will fall and Britain with it\". Some historians, including the Tower's official historian believe the \"tower's raven mythology is likely to be a Victorian flight of fantasy\". The earliest known reference to captive ravens at the Tower is a picture from 1883.\n\nHistorically, wild ravens were common throughout Britain, even in towns, the tower being within their natural range. When they were exterminated from much of their traditional range, including London, they could only exist at the tower in captivity and with official support. They are tanded to by an official Ravenmaster. Local legend puts the origin of the captive raven population at the time of King Charles II (reigned 1660–85). Some of the ravens at the tower were specially bred in Somerset.\n\nOne of the earliest legends that connects the Tower with a raven is the tale of the euhemerised mutually destructive battle against the Irish leader Matholwch who had mistreated the British princess Branwen. Branwen's brother Brân the Blessed (King of the Britons) ordered his followers to cut off his head and bury it beneath the White Hill (where the Tower now stands) facing out towards France as a talisman to protect Britain from foreign invasion. Brân is the Welsh word for Raven, relating Brân's head being buried beneath the site of today's tower to the continued presence of ravens.\n\nAllegedly, at the execution of Anne Boleyn in 1536, \"Even the ravens of the Tower sat silent and immovable on the battlements and gazed eerily at the strange scene. A Queen about to die!\" The ravens of the Tower supposedly behaved much worse during the execution of Lady Jane Grey in 1554, allegedly \"pecking the eyes from the severed head\" of the queen.\n\nIn his article \"How Ravens Came to the Tower of London\", American author Boria Sax came to the conclusion that \"the ravens were originally brought in to dramatise the alleged site of executions at the Tower\".\n\nOne legend attributes the start of the tradition of keeping ravens with clipped wings in the Tower of London to Charles II and to his royal astronomer John Flamsteed, although there are versions of the legend that differ in their datials\n. According to one legend, John Flamsteed complained to Charles II that wild ravens were flying past his telescope and making it harder for him to observe the sky from his observatory in the White Tower. Flamsteed requested that the birds be removed, but Charles II refused to comply with this request.\n\nAnother variation of this legend says that it was Charles II himself who disliked the wild ravens' droppings falling onto the telescope. The conversation with his astronomer that supposedly followed decided the fate not only of the ravens, but also of Greenwich, where the Greenwich Observatory was commissioned by the King in 1675. In this version of the legend the King complained: \n\nYet another legend attributes the appearance of ravens in the Tower to the Great Fire of London in 1666. Wild ravens, as well as pigs and kites, were the biggest scavengers in medieval London. Allegedly after the fire, survivors started persecuting ravens for scavenging, but Flamsteed explained to Charles II that killing all ravens would be a bad omen, and that the kingdom would not outlive the last killed raven. Charles II then ordered six birds to be kept at the Tower.\n\nWild ravens are native to Britain (and most other parts of the Northern Hemisphere) although in recent times breeding populations are mostly restricted to the wilder western upland areas of the British Isles. It is quite likely that ravens lived in and around the Tower centuries ago, because until the 16th century, ravens lived in close proximity to people as well as in wild areas; they were welcomed in towns because their scavenging habits of feeding helped keep the streets clean. However, in later years wild ravens were viewed as a threat to livestock, and during the 19th century they were eliminated in many areas by systematic hunting and shooting. The last time ravens nested in the wild in London was in Hyde Park in 1826, but the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reported in 2004 that ravens had been observed nesting in the Home Counties around London, as close as 30 miles from the Tower.\n\nThe first two known depictions of ravens in the Tower of London both date from the year 1883. One is in a special edition of the newspaper \"The Pictorial World\" and the other is from the children's Book \"London Town\", written by Felix Leigh and illustrated by Thomas Crane and Elizabeth Houghton.\n\nSax found the one early mention of importation of captive ravens in the 1918 book \"The Tower from Within\" by George Younghusband. Younghusband stated that the ravens were provided by the 4th Earl of Dunraven (1841–1926). The second Earl of Dunraven had been a patron of the Druidic scholar, poet, and forger Iolo Morganwg, who convinced the family that their castle in Glamorgan had been the original residence of the raven-god Bran, actually an early king. The Earls may have thought of the ravens as avatars of Bran, and wished to assert a spiritual claim over the Tower.\n\nGeoffrey Parnell, the official Tower of London historian and a member of the Royal Armouries staff, also believes that the allegedly ancient history of captive ravens at the Tower is just a legend that was created during the Victorian era. And during Parnell's research, despite the superstition that the Crown depends on the continued presence of the ravens, \"[he] has found the blunt statement in the records 'there are none left' – and yet the monarchy and the tower have more or less survived\". This alludes to a period right before the reopening of the Tower after World War II, when the only surviving ravens, the mated pair Mabel and Grip, disappeared from the Tower, perhaps eloping to a nearby wood. The story of their escape appeared in several local American papers.\n\nDr Parnell also believes that the first captive ravens may have been introduced to the Tower as pets of the staff. After \"The Raven\" the famous narrative poem by American writer Edgar Allan Poe was first published in January 1845, the Western world became fascinated with the birds.\n\nJapanese novelist and scholar Natsume Sōseki who visited the Tower in 1900, wrote an account published in 1906 reporting a total of six ravens at the Tower as a central focus during and following an execution at the site; however, as Boria Sax points out, the writing style \"blends fantasy, history, and present experience.\"\n\nThe first reference to an early version of the legend that Britain will fall if the ravens leave the Tower comes from July 1944, when ravens were used as unofficial spotters for enemy bombs and planes during the Blitz of World War II. Only one raven was able to survive the wartime hardships, so Winston Churchill, then prime minister, ordered more to bring the flock to the correct size. The Tower ravens are enlisted as soldiers of the Kingdom and were issued attestation cards in the same way as soldiers and police. As with soldiers, they can be dismissed for unsatisfactory conduct.\n\nToday the Tower's ravens are one of the attractions for tourists visiting the City of London. However, visitors are advised not to feed the birds, and warned that a raven will bite if it feels threatened.\n\nSince 1987, the Tower ravens have been the subject of a successful captive breeding programme. For example, over time, 17 chicks were successfully hatched and raised by a pair of ravens known as \"Charlie\" and \"Rhys\". Charlie came to an unhappy end: he bit a bomb-sniffing dog (who was also named Charlie), and the dog grabbed the raven with his teeth. This dog bite killed the bird.\n\nWhile visiting the Tower in 2003, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, is reported to have been impressed by one of the bird's verbal skills; Thor greeted each person in his entourage with a \"Good morning!\".\n\nDuring the global spread of H5N1 virus (\"bird flu\") in 2006, the ravens of the Tower were taken inside, and lived in \"custom-built aviaries\".\n\nIn May 2013, two ravens were killed by a fox that managed to infiltrate the grounds, the only fox attack inside the walls ever recorded. The raven population was temporarily reduced to the minimum number of six. Upgraded security measures were included in the plans for a major refurbishment of the raven accommodations, funded by the independent Historic Royal Palaces organisation.\n\nAppointed in 2011, current Ravenmaster Chris Skaife was caring for seven of the birds in 2018. He has reduced the amount of clipping of wings and feathers by a third to allow the ravens to fly, instead of merely hopping or gliding. He has allowed one of the birds, Merlina, to fly to the wharf on the Thames but she always returns due to the bonding with her keeper. \n\nDuring Skaife's tenure, only one raven, Munin, has escaped but was captured by a member of the public.\n\nThe ravens cannot fly because the flight feathers on one wing are clipped. With a single wing clipped, they can only fly short distances to perch. Otherwise, as Boria Sax writes, tongue-in-cheek:\nEach Tower raven has a different coloured band on one leg, to make it easier to identify individual birds. Ravens in captivity in the Tower grounds have had lifespans of over 40 years.\n\nThe Tower's ravens are given individual names, and are all under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The diet of the ravens is carefully maintained. In 2007, the Ravenmaster Derek Coyle commented: \"I buy fresh meat from Smithfield – liver, lamb, beef, chicken. And occasionally when I’m at my own place in Suffolk someone will give me some rabbit that’s been killed. If I see roadkill on the road, and it’s not been too badly mangled, I normally put it in a black bag and bring it back here. I give them biscuits as well, soaked in blood from the meat that I buy. And in winter I get them capsules of cod liver oil. I know they’re getting as much vitamins and oil as they possibly can. That’s why they look so healthy.\"\n\nTheir diet consists of raw meat daily, usually liver, lambs' hearts and beef or pork trimming, and every other day includes boiled egg with shell and blood-soaked bird biscuits. Occasionally, rabbit parts with fur are added for roughage. Once a week the birds are given a thorough check-over, and once every third week the lifting feathers on their right wings are trimmed to prevent them from flying away.\n\nMost Londoners are fond of the ravens, but sometimes an individual bird will fall out of favour because of inappropriate behaviour. For example, \"Raven George\" lost his appointment to the Crown, and was retired to Wales for attacking and destroying TV aerials. A special decree was issued about the incident:\nIn 1996, two more ravens fell out of favour and were dismissed from the Tower for \"conduct unbecoming Tower residents.\"\n\nDespite having their flight feathers clipped on one wing, sometimes the Tower ravens desert their duties. In 1981, Grog the raven decided to leave the surroundings of the Tower for those of a pub, after 21 years of faithful service to the Crown. In contrast, a raven named Mabel was kidnapped from the Tower soon after World War II, a mystery that has never been solved.\n\nAnother story concerns the two ravens named \"James Crow\" and \"Edgar Sopper\". James Crow was a much-loved and long-lived raven. After noticing the commotion surrounding the other raven's death, Edgar Sopper decided he could \"play dead\" in order to bring more attention to himself. His trick was so convincing that the ravenmaster fully believed that Edgar Sopper had died. When the ravenmaster picked up the \"corpse\", Edgar bit the man's finger and \"flapped off croaking huge raven laughs\". Likewise, \"Merlin\" is known for eliciting a commotion from visitors by occasionally playing dead.\n\nIn 1990 a chaplain named Norman Hood died in his chamber on the Tower grounds. Former Assistant Ravenmaster Tom Trent has reported that the ravens appeared to be aware of the death, for they soon gathered on the Tower Green near the chapel, called out, and then became quiet, as though to pay their respects. Corvids have been widely reported to hold \"funerals,\" in which they mourn and then cluster around a dead bird in silence.\n\n\n"}

Such supplements can have guest editors, are often not peer-reviewed to the same standard as the journal itself, and are more likely to use promotional language. Many journals do not publish sponsored supplements. Small-circulation journals are more likely to publish supplements than large, high-prestige journals.

It covers a period of several decades, and includes considerable background material.\n\nThe 1989 WANK worm attack on NASA computers, originally thought to threaten the Galileo spacecraft, is depicted as the work of Australian hackers, including Assange. The founding of Wikileaks in 2006 is followed by coverage of several key events: its 2009–2010 leaks about the Icelandic financial collapse, Swiss banking tax evasion, Kenyan government corruption, toxic-waste dumping, Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning's communications with Adrian Lamo, uploads to Wikileaks of the Iraq and Afghanistan war documents, diplomatic cables, and video, exposure to the FBI by Lamo, and the accusations of sexual assault made against Assange. Interview subjects include Julian Assange, Heather Brooke, James Ball, Donald Bostom, Nick Davies, Mark Davis, Jason Edwards, Timothy Douglas Webster, Michael Hayden, Adrian Lamo, J. William Leonard, Gavin MacFadyen, Smári McCarthy, Iain Overton, Kevin Poulsen and Vaughan Smith.\n\nAssange did not participate in the production, so previously recorded interviews were used. Manning was also unavailable. John Young and Deborah Natsios contributed contacts and research material, but declined to be interviewed for the film upon learning it was tentatively titled \"Unnamed Wikileaks Project\". \nAbout 35 minutes of chat animations, headline effects, and other visual effects were designed and rendered by Framestore in New York.\n\nThe film previewed in December 2012, and debuted January 21, 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival. It was scheduled to be released May 24, 2013 in New York and Los Angeles, and widely in June.\n\n\"We Steal Secrets\" has been widely praised by film reviewers, with film review site Rotten Tomatoes noting that 92% of critics have reviewed the film positively. Nonetheless it has been criticized by journalists and professors including Chris Hedges, Alexa O'Brien, and Robert Manne who was interviewed in the documentary.\n\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" writer David Rooney found the film to be a \"tremendously fascinating story told with probing insight and complexity\". David Edelstein of \"New York Magazine\" wrote that the film is a \"twisty, probing, altogether enthralling movie,\" adding that it is \"a documentary with the overflowing texture of fiction.\" Steven Rea of the \"Philadelphia Inquirer,\" who calls the film \"riveting and revelatory,\" notes that the director \"lines up an A-list of experts, observers, cohorts, and adversaries, tracing how Assange's and Manning's worlds collide - virtually, and violently - and how a noble quest for transparency and truth turned into a tale of conspiracy and paranoia.\"\n\nSeveral reviewers have noted that despite the film's strengths, some flaws remain. In the UK \"Guardian\", Jeremy Kay gave the film 3 of 5 stars, asserting that, although the film explored facts and themes thoroughly and thoughtfully, and provided \"insightful commentary\" from government, media, and WikiLeaks insiders, the film revealed little about Assange, who remained unavailable to be interviewed by the director. Kay wrote, \"It's probably too soon for a meaningful perspective on the WikiLeaks saga.\" In \"Variety\", Peter Debruge found the film \"dramatically lacking\" a central core conflict, especially when compared with Gibney's previous work. Like Kay in \"The Guardian\", Debruge found Manning's story the most compelling part of the film.\n\n\"We Steal Secrets\" was among five films nominated for the 2013 International Documentary Association ABC News Videosource Award.\n\nRobert Manne, who was interviewed in the film, considered it to be a \"superficially impressive but ultimately myopic film\". He detailed his criticism in \"The Monthly\". Based on this article Manne and Gibney had a written debate.\n\nIn his \"Truthdig\" review, journalist Chris Hedges called the film \"agitprop for the security and surveillance state,\" adding that it \"dutifully peddles the state's contention that WikiLeaks is not a legitimate publisher and that Chelsea Manning, who passed half a million classified Pentagon and State Department documents to WikiLeaks, is not a legitimate whistle-blower.\" \"Salon\" reporter Andrew O'Hehir claimed that many of Hedges's statements about the film are patently false, and that his \"alarming accusations and peculiar misreadings of the film\" are \"an attempt to attack Gibney's integrity and sabotage his reputation.\"\n\nWikiLeaks published a transcript of the film, annotated with comments, asserted to be corrections, by WikiLeaks. Director Gibney responded that the transcript was incomplete, lacked Private Manning's words, and was from an unreleased, incomplete version of the film. Later, Gibney published his own annotated version of the WikiLeaks transcript, responding to the criticisms and assertions made by Assange and his supporters.\nAccording to the film's executive producer Jemima Khan, \"We Steal Secrets\" was \"denounced before seeing\" by Assange, who tweeted \"an unethical and biased title in the context of pending criminal trials. It is the prosecution's claim and it is false\". Khan asserted the title was based on a quote in the film \"from Michael Hayden, a former director of the CIA, who told Gibney that the US government was in the business of 'stealing secrets' from other countries\".\n\n\nthe ammount of this movie cost to make was 2 dollars\n\n"}

{"id": "411562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411562", "title": "Xmas", "text": "Xmas\n\nXmas is a common abbreviation of the word \"Christmas\". It is sometimes pronounced , but \"Xmas\", and variants such as \"Xtemass\", originated as handwriting abbreviations for the typical pronunciation . The \"X\" comes from the Greek letter \"Chi\", which is the first letter of the Greek word \"Χριστός\", which in English is \"Christ\".\nThe \"-mas\" part is from the Latin-derived Old English word for \"Mass\".\n\nThere is a common misconception that the word \"Xmas\" stems from a secular attempt to remove the religious tradition from Christmas by taking the \"Christ\" out of \"Christmas\", but its use dates back to the 16th century.\n\n\"Xmas\" is deprecated by some modern style guides, including those at the \"New York Times\", \"The Times\", \"The Guardian\", and the BBC. Millicent Fenwick, in the 1948 \"Vogue's Book of Etiquette\", states that \"'Xmas' should never be used\" in greeting cards. \"The Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage\" states that the spelling should be considered informal and restricted to contexts where concision is valued, such as headlines and greeting cards. \"The Christian Writer's Manual of Style\", while acknowledging the ancient and respectful use of \"Xmas\" in the past, states that the spelling should never be used in formal writing.\n\nEarly use of \"Xmas\" includes Bernard Ward's \"History of St. Edmund's college, Old Hall\" (originally published circa 1755). An earlier version, \"X'temmas\", dates to 1551. Around 1100 the term was written as \"Xp̄es mæsse\" in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". \"Xmas\" is found in a letter from George Woodward in 1753. Lord Byron used the term in 1811, as did Samuel Coleridge (1801) and Lewis Carroll (1864). In the United States, the fifth American edition of William Perry's \"Royal Standard English Dictionary\", published in Boston in 1800, included in its list of \"Explanations of Common Abbreviations, or Contraction of Words\" the entry: \"Xmas. Christmas.\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. used the term in a letter dated 1923. Since at least the late 19th century, \"Xmas\" has been in use in various other English-language nations. Quotations with the word can be found in texts first written in Canada, and the word has been used in Australia, and in the Caribbean. \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\" stated that modern use of the term is largely limited to advertisements, headlines and banners, where its conciseness is valued. The association with commerce \"has done nothing for its reputation\", according to the dictionary.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the former Church of England Bishop of Blackburn, Alan Chesters, recommended to his clergy that they avoid the spelling.\nIn the United States, in 1977 New Hampshire Governor Meldrim Thomson sent out a press release saying that he wanted journalists to keep the \"Christ\" in Christmas, and not call it Xmas—which he called a \"pagan\" spelling of Christmas.\n\nThe abbreviation of Christmas as \"Xmas\" is the source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday. \n\nThe December 1957 \"News and Views\" published by the Church League of America, a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett, attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled \"X=The Unknown Quantity\". The claims were picked up later by Gerald L. K. Smith, who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a \"blasphemous omission of the name of Christ\" and that \"'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity.\" Smith further argued that Jews introduced Santa Claus to suppress the New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of \"world Jewry\", had \"outlawed the name of Christ\". There is, however, a well documented history of use of \"Χ\" (actually a chi) as an abbreviation for \"Christ\" (Χριστός) and possibly also a symbol of the cross. The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.\n\nDennis Bratcher, writing for a website for Christians, states \"there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation 'Xmas' as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity\". Among them are evangelist Franklin Graham and CNN journalist Roland S. Martin. Graham stated in an interview: \"for us as Christians, this is one of the most holy of the holidays, the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. And for people to take Christ out of Christmas. They're happy to say merry Xmas. Let's just take Jesus out. And really, I think, a war against the name of Jesus Christ.\" Roland Martin likewise relates the use of \"Xmas\" to his growing concerns of increasing commercialization and secularization of one of Christianity's highest holy days. Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of \"Christ\" for various purposes.\n\nThe word \"Christ\" and its compounds, including \"Christmas\", have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern \"Xmas\" was commonly used. \"Christ\" was often written as \"Xρ\" or \"Xt\"; there are references in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as far back as 1021. This X and P arose as the uppercase forms of the Greek letters χ (Ch) and ρ (R) used in ancient abbreviations for Χριστος (Greek for \"Christ\"). The labarum, an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as ☧, is a symbol often used to represent Christ in Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox Christian Churches.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") and the \"OED Supplement\" have cited usages of \"X-\" or \"Xp-\" for \"Christ-\" as early as 1485. The terms \"Xtian\" and less commonly \"Xpian\" have also been used for \"Christian\". The \"OED\" further cites usage of \"Xtianity\" for \"Christianity\" from 1634. According to \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\", most of the evidence for these words comes from \"educated Englishmen who knew their Greek\".\n\nIn ancient Christian art, χ and χρ are abbreviations for Christ's name. In many manuscripts of the \"New Testament\" and icons, Χ is an abbreviation for Χριστος, as is XC (the first and last letters in Greek, using the lunate sigma); compare IC for Jesus in Greek.\n\nOther proper names containing the name \"Christ\" besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly, either as \"X\" or \"Xt\", both of which have been used historically, e.g., \"Xtopher\" or \"Xopher\" for \"Christopher\", or \"Xtina\" or \"Xina\" for the name \"Christina\".\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, \"Xene\" and \"Exene\" were common spellings for the given name Christine. The American singer Christina Aguilera has sometimes gone by the name \"Xtina\". Similarly, Exene Cervenka has been a noted American singer-songwriter since 1977.\n\nThis usage of \"X\" to spell the syllable \"kris\" (rather than the sounds \"ks\") has extended to \"xtal\" for \"crystal\", and on florists' signs to \"xant\" for \"chrysanthemum\", even though these words are not etymologically related to \"Christ\": \"crystal\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"ice\" (and not even using the letter χ), and \"chrysanthemum\" comes from Greek words meaning \"golden flower\", while \"Christ\" comes from a Greek word meaning \"anointed\".\n\nIn the animated television series \"Futurama\", which is set in the 31st century, Xmas is the official name for the day formerly known as Christmas (which, in the episode \"Xmas Story\", is said to have become an \"archaic pronunciation\").\n\nIn the American version of the board game \"Monopoly\", players can draw a card from the Community Chest which reads: \"Xmas fund matures. Collect $100\".\n\n\n"}
