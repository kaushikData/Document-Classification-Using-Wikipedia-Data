{"id": "44134598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44134598", "title": "Anti-Greek sentiment", "text": "Anti-Greek sentiment\n\nAnti-Greek sentiment (also known as Hellenophobia (), anti-Hellenism, mishellenism (), or Greek-bashing) refers to negative feelings, dislike, hatred, derision and/or prejudice towards Greeks, the Hellenic Republic, and Greek culture. It is the opposite of philhellenism.\n\nIn the mid-Republican period Rome phil-Hellenic and anti-Hellenic Roman intellectuals were involved in a conflict over Greek influence. One author explains, \"the relationship of Romans to Greek culture was frequently ambiguous: they admired it as superior and adopted its criteria, while they remained skeptical of some aspects; hence they adapted it selectively according to their own purposes.\" An anti-Hellenic movement emerged in reaction to the primacy of Greek led by the conservative and reactionary statesman Cato the Elder (234-149 BCE), who was the first to write a Roman history in Latin, and was prominent for his anti-Hellenic views. He saw Hellenism a threat to Roman culture, but did not find wide support, especially in the upper class. However, Erich S. Gruen argued that Cato's \"anti-Greek 'pronouncements' reflect deliberate posturing and do not represent 'the core of Catonian though'.\" The prominent philosopher and politician Cicero (106–43 BCE) was \"highly ambivalent\" about Greeks, and practiced \"anti-Greek slur\". The first-second century poet Juvenal was another major anti-Hellenic figure.\n\nFollowing the East–West Schism of 1054, anti-Greek sentiment became widespread in the Latin West (dominated by the Catholic Church). It reached its climax during the Fourth Crusade and the 1204 sack of Constantinople, the Byzantine capital, and the establishment of the Latin Empire.\n\nIn the Interwar period (1918–39), the Albanian government closed down Greek schools as part of its policies of assimilation. During the Communist rule in Albania (1944–92), the government restricted the use of Greek language and Greek names by the country's Greek minority in an attempt of forced assimilation. Anti-Greek sentiment dominated the thinking of Enver Hoxha, the communist leader of Albania, during the Greek Civil War.\n\nIn post-Communist Albania, \"there are no significant explicitly racist or chauvinist political parties\", although, according to James Pettifer, \"there are many individual politicians who adhere to very strong anti-Greek views, which in turn affects the orientation of virtually all ethnic Albanian political parties.\" In a 2013 poll in Albania, Greece topped the list of countries perceived to be a threat to Albania (18.5%), although the plurality of respondents (46.4%) agreed with the statement \"No country is a threat to Albania\".\n\nGreeks in Australia have been subject to discrimination. During World War I, due to King Constantine I's pro-German sympathies, Greek immigrants were viewed with hostility and suspicion. Anti-Greek riots occurred in Perth in 1915 and in Kalgoorlie in 1916.\n\nThe word \"wog\" is an ethnic slur used in Australia to refer to Southern European and Middle Eastern people of the Mediterranean region, including Greeks. The term has also been adopted and used by Greek Australians to refer to themselves, including through the sitcom \"Acropolis Now\" (1989–92), the television spin-off of the 1987 play \"Wogs Out of Work\" and the 2000 film \"The Wog Boy\".\n\nIn 1906, during the Macedonian Struggle, anti-Greek rallies and violent attacks took place in a number of Bulgarian cities. In Plovdiv, Greek Orthodox churches and schools, Greek-owned properties were looted and plundered. In Pomorie (Anchialos) the Greek population was expelled after the city was set up on fire and up to 110 Greeks were killed. Pogroms also took place in Varna, Burgas and other locations. Following the pogroms, around 20,000 Greeks fled Bulgaria.\n\nOn August 2–5, 1918, a three-day anti-Greek riot occurred in Toronto. \"Mobs of up to 5,000 people, led by war veterans returned from Europe, marched through the city's main streets waging pitched battles with law enforcement officers and destroying every Greek business they came across.\" The consequence was damages of $100,000 to Greek businesses and private property.\n\nThe Macedonia naming dispute since the breakup of Yugoslavia has given rise to anti-Greek sentiment in the Republic of Macedonia. According to one author, there was \"considerable popular anti-Greek feeling in Macedonia\" as of 2004. On the contrary, German diplomat Geert-Hinrich Ahrens () wrote in 2007 that he \"had never detected any anti-Greek manifestations\" in the republic.\n\nThe main opposition party of the Republic of Macedonia, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), founded in 1990, includes the name of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, a revolutionary movement active in the early 20th century, which is regarded by Greeks \"a notorious anti-Greek terrorist organization.\" During the party's First Congress, Ljubčo Georgievski, first leader of the party, declared that \"the next Congress will convene in Solun\" (Thessaloniki in South Slavic languages).\nAccording to Dimitar Bechev, a British-based international relations researcher, Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski (the leader of VMRO-DPMNE) exploited \"anti-Greek nationalism\" during the 2008 parliamentary election. In 2012 Gruevski accused Greece of having waged \"political genocide\" against his country. Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Gregory Delavekouras responded that Gruevski's statements \"stoke the systematic negative government propaganda that is aimed at turning public opinion in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia against Greece.\"\n\nAt its inception Romanian national historiography was heavily influenced by romanticism. This led to a reconsideration of the role played by the Phanariotes who ruled modern day Romania as emissaries of the Ottoman Empire. Romanian national poet Mihai Eminescu described Greeks as \"the poison of the Orient, hypocritical people who crave to exploit others\". The hellenophobic tendency in Romanian historiography was reversed through the work of historian Nicolae Iorga.\n\nDuring the course of the Macedonian Struggle, Romania founded the Society of Macedono–Romanian Culture which conducted ethnographic expeditions to Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly. The Society later took up the role of representing Romania interests in the region. The propagation of Romanian nationalist ideals among the Aromanian communities, created a rift between the two countries known as the Vlach Question. Another important issue was the status of the inheritances of Greeks in Romania. In 1892, Romania refused to hand over the property of the recently deceased Greek expatriate Konstantinos Zappas to the Greek state citing an article of the Romanian constitution forbidding foreign nationals from owning agricultural land. The Trikoupis government then recalled its ambassador in Bucharest, Romania followed suit thus severing diplomatic relations between the countries. Diplomatic relations were restored in July 1896, in response to a rise of Bulgarian komitadji activity in Macedonia. In 1905, the two countries exchanged accusations regarding the Vlach Question. Romania claimed that Greek armed bands targeted ethnic Romanians in Macedonia, whereas Greece accused Romania of trying to create a false equation between Aromanians and Romanians.\n\nHellenophobic articles began appearing in the Romanian press. On 2 August 1905, the Society of Macedono–Romanian Culture organized an anti–Greek protest in Bucharest, attended by army officers, student and Vlachs. After decrying Greek war crimes in Macedonia, the organizers called for a boycott of Greek products and services. Rioting was prevented by a large force of Romanian gendarmerie. On the same day a Greek owned cafe in Bucharest was vandalized and its owner beaten. Several days later three editors of the Greek language newspaper Patris were expelled from the country for sedition. On 13 August, protesters burnt a Greek flag in Giurgiu. An official remonstrance by the Greek ambassador Tombazis was rebutted leading to a mutual withdrawal of embassies on 15 September. In November, the Romanian government allocated funding for the creation of armed Aromanian bands in Macedonia, a parallel motion closed numerous Greek schools in the country. In February 1906, six leading members of the Greek community were expelled from the country, citing their alleged funding of Greek bands in Macedonia. In July 1906, the Greek government officially severed diplomatic relations with Romania. In 1911, Greek prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos used the occasion of the Italo-Turkish War to improve relations with Bulgaria and Romania, restoring diplomatic relations with the latter.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1924 around 47,000 Greeks emigrated from Russia to Greece as a result of the official and unofficial anti-Greek sentiment in Russia, which in its turn was a result of the Greek intervention in the Black Sea region in the Russian Civil War against the Bolsheviks.\n\nTens of thousands of Greeks were deported to the remote parts of the Soviet Union during World War II in the Greek Operation of NKVD.\n\nAnti-Greek sentiment is \"deeply rooted\" in the Turkish public. A 2011 survey in Turkey revealed that 67% of respondents had unfavorable views toward Greeks, although only 6% of Turks said Greece was their country's main enemy in a poll carried out in the same year. Despite this, according to political scientist Emre Erdogan, Greece remains one of the \"eternal enemies of Turkey\", along with Armenia. Journalist Dr. Cenk Saraçoğlu of Ankara University argues that anti-Greek attitudes in Turkey \"are no longer constructed and shaped by social interactions between the 'ordinary people' [...] Rather, the Turkish media and state promote and disseminate an overtly anti-Greek discourse.\" On the other hand, Turkish political scientist Bahar Rumelili wrote in 2007:\nIn 1821 Greeks of Constantinople were massacred in response to the Greek War of Independence, while Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople was hung.\n\nDuring and following World War I, almost all of the Greek population of Anatolia was either exterminated by the Ottoman government or later transferred to Greece as part of a population exchange.\n\nIn September 1955 the Turkish government sponsored anti-Greek riots and pogrom in Istanbul. The dispute over Cyprus kept anti-Greek feelings in Turkey high. At the height of the intercommunal violence in Cyprus, thousands of Greeks were expelled from Turkey, mostly Istanbul. In March of that year all persons (over 6,000) with Greek citizenship were expelled \"on the grounds that they were dangerous to the 'internal and external' security of the state.\" Additionally, in September 1964, 10,000 Greeks were expelled. \"Cumhuriyet\" reported that 30,000 \"Turkish nationals of Greek descent had left permanently, in addition to the Greeks who had been expelled.\" Within months a total of 40,000 Greeks were expelled from Istanbul.\n\nIn 1999 Turkey \"was again swept by a wave of anti-Greek sentiment, encouraged by the Turkish government\" following the capture of the Kurdistan Workers' Party leader Abdullah Öcalan. However, as a result of the \"earthquake diplomacy\" and the subsequent rapprochement efforts between Greece and Turkey, the public perception of Greece as their main enemy decreased in Turkey from 29% in 2001 to 16.9% in 2004.\n\nThe Grey Wolves, a far-right organization associated with the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), routinely demonstrate outside the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in Fener (Phanar), Istanbul and burn the Patriarch in effigy. In October 2005 they staged a rally and proceeding to the gate they laid a black wreath, chanting \"Patriarch Leave\" and \"Patriarchate to Greece\", inaugurating the campaign for the collection of signatures to oust the Ecumenical Patriarchate from Istanbul. As of 2006 the Grey Wolves claimed to have collected more than 5 million signatures for the withdrawal of the Patriarch and called on the Turkish government to have the patriarch deported to Greece.\n\nIn the early 20th century Greeks in the United States were discriminated against in many ways. In 1904 Greek immigrants, unaware of labor conditions and largely inexperienced, served as strikebreakers during a strike in Chicago diesel shops. This fueled anti-Greek sentiment among union members. Three Greek immigrants were killed during a riot in 1908 in McGill, Nevada. On February 21, 1909 a major anti-Greek riot took place in South Omaha, Nebraska. The Greek population was forced to leave the city, while properties owned by Greek migrants were destroyed. Greeks were viewed with particular contempt in the Mormon stronghold of Utah. The local press characterized them as \"a vicious element unfit for citizenship and as ignorant, depraved, and brutal foreigners.\" Anti-Greek riots occurred in Salt Lake City in 1917 which \"almost resulted\" in lynching of a Greek immigrant. In 1922, as a response to the anti-Greek nativist xenophobia by the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA) was founded, which sought to Americanize the Greek immigrant in America.\n\nIn December 2014 MTV aired the first episode of its new reality show \"Growing Up Greek\". It was immediately denounced by Greek Americans and characterized as \"stereotype-laden\" and \"offensive\". The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA) called for it to be canceled.\n\nAs a result of the Greek government-debt crisis, starting in 2010, anti-Greek sentiments grew in some European countries, especially in Germany. A 2014 study found, \"An anti-Greek sentiment evolved and spread among German citizens and solidarity for crisis-hit Greece was mostly rejected.\" In 2012 Pew Research Center found, \"Among the major European countries, Greece is clearly the least popular. And its reputation is slipping. In no country, other than Greece itself, is there a majority with a favorable view of Greece.\" Only 27% of respondents in Germany viewed Greece favorably.\n\nHostile and unfavorable views towards Greece and Greeks were especially pronounced in the tabloid press. A 2013 study found that \"British and German news sources indicate bias against Greece in financial crisis coverage, although likely with important differences; both, however, include stereotypes, the recommendation of austerity as a punishment, morality tales, an absence of solidarity, and fear mongering.\" The popular German tabloid \"Bild\" \"published numerous reports that implicitly and explicitly constituted the myth of the corrupt and lazy Greeks in comparison to the hard-working Germans.\" Dutch TV producer Ingeborg Beugel () claimed that \"the [anti-Greek] propaganda of the mainstream media provides Europe and the Netherlands with a convenient scapegoat to exploit.\"\n\nGerman politicians, such as Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, publicly criticized the anti-Greek sentiment in their country and called for solidarity with Greece.\n\n"}

{"id": "2782394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2782394", "title": "Book of Dede Korkut", "text": "Book of Dede Korkut\n\nThe Book of Dede Korkut or Book of Korkut Ata (; , دده قورقود; ) is the most famous among the epic stories of the Oghuz Turks. The stories carry morals and values significant to the social lifestyle of the nomadic Turkic peoples and their pre-Islamic beliefs. The book's mythic narrative is part of the cultural heritage of Turkic countries, including Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and to a lesser degree Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe epic tales of \"Dede Korkut\" are some of the best known Turkic dastans from among a total of well over 1,000 recorded epics among the Mongolian and Turkic language families.\n\n\"Dede Korkut\" is a heroic dastan (legend), also known as \"Oghuz-nameh\" among the Oghuz Turkic people, which starts out in Central Asia, continues in Anatolia and Iran, and centers most of its action in the Azerbaijani Caucasus. According to Barthold, \"it is not possible to surmise that this dastan could have been written anywhere but in the Caucasus\".\n\nFor the Turkic peoples, especially people who identify themselves as Oghuz, it is the principal repository of ethnic identity, history, customs and the value systems of the Turkic peoples throughout history. It commemorates struggles for freedom at a time when the Oghuz Turks were a herding people, although \"it is clear that the stories were put into their present form at a time when the Turks of Oghuz descent no longer thought of themselves as Oghuz.\" From the mid-10th century on, the term 'Oghuz' was gradually supplanted among the Turks themselves by 'Turcoman' (Turkmen); this process was completed by the beginning of the 13th century. The Turcomans were those Turks, mostly but not exclusively Oghuz, who had embraced Islam and begun to lead a more sedentary life than their forefathers. In the 14th century, a federation of Oghuz, or, as they were by this time termed, Turcoman tribesmen, who called themselves Ak-koyunlu established a dynasty that ruled eastern Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and western Iran.\n\nThe twelve stories that comprise the bulk of the work were written down after the Turks converted to Islam, and the heroes are often portrayed as good Muslims while the villains are referred to as infidels, but there are also many references to the Turks' pre-Islamic magic. The character Dede Korkut, i.e. \"Grandfather Korkut\", is a widely renowned soothsayer and bard, and serves to link the stories together, and the thirteenth chapter of the book compiles sayings attributed to him. \"In the dastans, Dede Korkut appears as the \"aksakal\" [literally 'white-beard,' the respected elder], the advisor or sage, solving the difficulties faced by tribal members. ... Among the population, respected aksakals are wise and know how to solve problems; among \"ashiks\" [reciters of dastans] they are generally called \"dede\" [grandfather]. In the past, this term designated respected tribal elders, and now is used within families; in many localities of Azerbaijan, it replaces \"ata\" [ancestor or father].\" The historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (d. 1318) says that Dede Korkut was a real person and lived for 295 years; that he appeared in the time of the Oghuz ruler Inal Syr Yavkuy Khan, by whom he was sent as ambassador to the Prophet; that he became Muslim; that he gave advice to the Great Khan of the Oghuz, attended the election of the Great Khan, and gave names to children.\n\nThe tales tell of warriors and battles and are likely grounded in the conflicts between the Oghuz and the Pechenegs and Kipchaks. Many story elements are familiar to those versed in the Western literary tradition. For example, the story of a monster named \"Goggle-eye\" Tepegoz bears enough resemblance to the encounter with the Cyclops in Homer's \"Odyssey\" that it is believed to have been influenced by the Greek epic or to have one common ancient Anatolian root. The book also describes in great detail the various sports activities of the ancient Turkic peoples: \"Dede Korkut (1000–1300) clearly referred to certain physical activities and games. In Dede Korkut's description, the athletic skills of Turks, both men and women, were described to be \"first-rate,\" especially in horse-riding, archery, cirit (javelin throw), wrestling and polo, which are considered Turkish national sports.\"\n\n\nSince the early 18th century, the \"Book of Dede Korkut\" has been translated into French, English, Russian and Hungarian. However, it was not until it caught the attention of H.F. Von Diez, who published a partial German translation of Dede Korkut in 1815, based on a manuscript found in the Royal Library of Dresden, that \"Dede Korkut\" became widely known to the West. The only other manuscript of \"Dede Korkut\" was discovered in 1950 by Ettore Rossi in the Vatican Library. Until \"Dede Korkut\" was transcribed on paper, the events depicted therein survived in the oral tradition, at least from the 9th and 10th centuries. The \"Bamsi Beyrek\" chapter of \"Dede Korkut\" preserves almost verbatim the immensely popular Central Asian dastan Alpamysh, dating from an even earlier time. The stories were written in prose, but peppered with poetic passages. Recent research by Turkish and Turkmen scholars revealed, that the Turkmen variant of the \"Book of Dede Korkut\" contains sixteen stories, which have been transcribed and published in 1998.\n\nThe work originated as a series of epics orally told and transferred over the generations before being published in book form. There are numerous versions collected of the stories. It is thought that the first versions were in natural verse, since Turkish is an agglutinative language, but that they gradually transformed into combinations of verse and prose as the Islamic elements affected the narrative over time.\n\nVarious dates have been proposed for the first written copies. Geoffrey Lewis dates it fairly early in the 15th century, with two layers of text: a substratum of older oral traditions related to conflicts between the Oghuz and the Pecheneks and Kipchaks and an outer covering of references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation. Cemal Kafadar agrees that it was no earlier than the 15th century since \"the author is buttering up both the Akkoyunlu and the Ottoman rulers\". However, in his history of the Ottoman Empire, Stanford Jay Shaw (1977) dates it in the 14th century. Professor Michael E. Meeker argues for two dates, saying that the versions of the stories we have today originated as folk stories and songs no earlier than the 13th century and were written down no later than the early the 15th century. At least one of the stories (Chapter 8) existed in writing at the beginning of the 14th century, from an unpublished Arabic history, Dawadari's \"Durar al-Tijan\", written in Egypt some time between 1309 and 1340.\n\nA precise determination is impossible to come by due to the nomadic lifestyle of the early Turkic people, in which epics such as Dede Korkut passed from generation to generation in an oral form. This is especially true of an epic book such as this, which is a product of a long series of narrators, any of whom could have made alterations and additions, right down to the two 16th-century scribes who authored the oldest extant manuscripts. The majority of scholars of ancient Turkic epics and folk tales, such as Russian-Soviet academician Vasily Bartold and British scholar Geoffrey Lewis, believe that the \"Dede Korkut\" text \"exhibits a number of features characteristic of Azeri, the Turkish dialect of Azerbaijan\".\n\nThe majority of the Turkic peoples and lands described in the \"Book of Dede Korkut\" were part of the Soviet Union from 1920 until 1991, and thus most of the research and interest originated there. The attitude towards the Book of Dede Korkut and other dastans related to the Turkic peoples was initially neutral.\n\nTurkish historian Hasan Bülent Paksoy argues that after Stalin solidified his grip on power in the USSR, and especially in the early 1950s, a taboo on Turkology was firmly established. He observed that the first full-text Russian edition of the Book of Dede Korkut, by Azerbaijani academicians Hamid Arasli and M.G.Tahmasib and based on the Barthold translation of the 1920s, was published on a limited basis only in 1939 and again in 1950. He asserts, \"Turkic scholars and literati (who raised the same issues) were lost to the Stalinist 'liquidations' or to the 'ideological assault' waged on all dastans in 1950–52.\" According to Paksoy, this taboo of the early 1950s was also expressed in the \"Trial of Alpamysh\" (1952–1957), when \"all dastans of Central Asia were officially condemned by the Soviet state apparatus\".\n\nSoviet authorities criticized \"Dede Korkut\" for promoting bourgeois nationalism. In a 1951 speech delivered at the 18th Congress of the Azerbaijani Communist Party, Azerbaijani communist leader Mir Jafar Baghirov advocated expunging the epic from Azerbaijani literature, calling it a \"harmful\" and \"antipopular book\" that \"is shot through with the poison of nationalism, chiefly against the Georgian and Armenian brother-peoples.\"\n\nNevertheless, the publication of dastans did not wholly cease during that period, as editions of \"Alpamysh\" were published in 1957, 1958 and 1961, as they had been in 1939, 1941, and 1949; the entry on dastans in the second edition of the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" (volume 13, 1952) does not contain any \"condemnation\" either. Despite the liberalization of the political climate after the denunciation of Stalinism by Nikita Khrushchev in February 1956, the same \"Barthold\" edition of the \"Book of Dede Korkut\" was re-published only in 1962 and in 1977. Problems persisted all the way to perestroika, when the last full edition in Azerbaijani language was sent for publication on July 11, 1985, but received permission for printing only on February 2, 1988.\n\nIn 1998, the Republic of Azerbaijan and UNESCO nominated, and in 2000 celebrated, the \"One thousand three hundredth anniversary of the epic Azerbaijani legend Kitab-i Dede Qorqud\". In 2000, the General Director of UNESCO remarked: \"Epics – and I have in mind in particular that of the Turkish-speaking peoples attributed to \"Dede Korkut\", perpetuated by oral tradition up to the 15th century before being written down...are vectors of the historical, geographical, political, social, linguistic and literary references of the peoples whose history they relate. Although many of these epics have already been noted down, the oral and gestural skills of the storytellers and griots who keep them alive should also be immortalized without delay. The matter is urgent.\"\n\nSince 1956, UNESCO has commemorated historic events and the anniversaries of eminent personalities celebrated by Member States and Associate Members, in order to give them worldwide significance. Azerbaijan announced the Kitab-i Dede Qorqud as its first \"Celebration of anniversaries\" in 1998.\nIn 1999 the National Bank of Azerbaijan minted gold and silver commemorative coins for the 1,300th anniversary of the epic.The epic culture, folk tales and music of Dede Qorqud has been included in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO in November 2018.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The declaration asserted Estonia's sovereignty and the supremacy of the Estonian laws over the laws of the Soviet Union. Estonia's parliament also laid claim to the republic's natural resources: land, inland waters, forests, mineral deposits and to the means of industrial production, agriculture, construction, state banks, transportation, municipal services, etc. in the territory of Estonia's borders. November 16 is now celebrated annually as the \"Day of Declaration of Sovereignty\".\n\nEstonia gained independence in the aftermath of World War I and Estonian War of Independence (1918–1920). In 1940 as a consequence of the German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact and its of August 1939 Estonia was occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union.\n\nThe majority of Western nations refused to recognize the incorporation of Estonia \"de jure\" by the Soviet Union and only recognized the government of the Estonian SSR \"de facto\" or not at all. Such countries recognized Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in the name of their former governments. These aging diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Baltic independence.\n\nIn the 1980s new policies of Perestroika and Glasnost were introduced and political repression in the Soviet Union came to an end. As a result, during the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt a 20 August 1991 declaration proclaimed the reestablishment of the independent Estonian republic almost three years after the declaration was made, becoming the last of the Baltic republics to declare the reestablishment of independence (after Lithuania and Latvia in 1990). On September 6, 1991, the Soviet Union recognized the independence of Estonia and the country was admitted to the UN on September 17.\n\nAfter more than three years of negotiations, on August 31, 1994, the armed forces of Russia withdrew from Estonia. The Russian Federation officially ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in Paldiski in September 1995. Estonia joined the European Union in May 2004, shortly after it became a member of NATO, and later joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2010.\n\n"}

The beta version of Fanlore launched in September 2008, and the wiki came out of beta in December 2010. As of June 2018, more than 45,000 pages have been created on Fanlore, with more than 780,000 edits made by more than 35,000 registered users.\n\nFanlore's focus is for fans to document their understandings of and experiences in fandom, past and present. The intent of its parent group, the non-profit Organization for Transformative Works, is to preserve for future reference fandom occurrences, work done by fans, and their discussions and debates. The site's audiences include journalists, academics, and people new to fandom. Fanlore is run by the Fanlore Committee within the Organization for Transformative Works. Additional volunteers termed Gardeners have extra editing access on the site, and they monitor recent edits to make sure all contributions are properly integrated. These volunteers also answer questions and provide help to fan contributors.\n\nFanlore's major content categories include Fan Activities, Fan Communities, People, Fandoms, Perspectives on Fans, a Glossary, Tropes & Genres, Fanworks and a Chronology.\n\nFanlore is guided by the Plural Point of View (PPOV) policy, which was discussed by one of the Organization for Transformative Works' founders, Francesca Coppa:\n\nFanlore is much much friendlier and more accepting and less confrontational than most wikis, which can be notoriously hostile places. We have a specific Plural Point of View philosophy and not just accept–but actively seek out–multiple viewpoints in all things.\n\nMany of the people who have been most active on Fanlore are older, more established fans interested in documenting fannish history prior to 2010, leading to a site with a particular focus on zines and fannish activities on LiveJournal. Fanlore continues to solicit contributions from fans with different experiences.\n\nThe site hosts regular editing challenges, such as the annual April Showers event and has its own social media outlets. The site's creation and development largely by female fans has also meant a focus on fan history that reflects women's activities in fannish spaces.\n\nIn May 2015, Fanlore announced that the site had been chosen by the American Folklife Center, part of the U.S. Library of Congress, for archiving as part of the Digital Culture Web Archive. The head of the American Folklife Center, Nicole Saylor, explained in 2016 that the site was selected because: \"[F]an fiction and other kinds of fan works were identified as significant because fandom enacts so many of the key elements of folklore and vernacular culture. As a result, there are a range of fandom-focused sites that were selected for the collection. We were also interested in harvesting sites where communities had worked to synthesize, organize and collect examples of practice.\" The site's content was captured from October 7, 2010 to August 5, 2016.\n\nEntries on Fanlore have been used as a resource in a number of media articles and other discussions that feature fan terminology fan activities, the history of particular genres fan discussions about their own culture, statements about fanworks by canon creators, documentation about individual fandoms and popular topics, the development of modern fandom, the history of former fan fiction authors, lists of fandom communities, representations of characters, and the topics found in fanworks.\n\nFanlore's archiving of images has been used in fandom-related media articles. Fanlore also serves as a resource for discussions about the mission of its founding organization, the Organization for Transformative Works.\n\nAside from the news media, Fanlore has been a resource to academics researching fans and fandom related topics.

Gonzales, 548 U.S. 30 (2006), is a United States Supreme Court case that considered Humberto Fernandez-Vargas, a Mexican citizen who, after being deported, illegally reentered the United States in 1982, and remained undetected for over 20 years, fathering a son in 1989 and marrying the boy’s mother, a U.S. citizen, in 2001. He filed an application to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident, but the Government began proceedings to reinstate his 1981 deportation order under §241(a)(5), and deported him. \n\nFernandez-Vargas argued that because he illegally reentered the country before IIRIRA's effective date, §241(a)(5) did not bar his application for an adjustment of status, and that §241(a)(5) would be impermissibly retroactive if it did bar his adjustment application. The Court held that Section 241(a)(5) applies to those who reentered the U.S. before IIRIRA's effective date and does not retroactively affect any right of, or impose any burden on, the continuing violator of the INA now before this Court. \n"}

As some writers refer to all land beyond Greenland as Vinland, Helluland is sometimes considered a part of Vinland.\n\nThe name Helluland was given by Leif Erikson during his voyage to Vinland according to the Greenland Saga and means \"Land of Flat Rocks\" or \"Land of Flat Stones\" in the Old Norse language.\n\nHelluland was said to be the first of three lands in North America visited by Eriksson. He decided against trying to settle there because he found the land inhospitable. He continued south to \"Markland\" (probably Labrador) and \"Vinland\" (possibly Newfoundland).\n\nAccording to the \"Saga of Erik the Red,\" \n\"They sailed away from land; then to the Western Settlement and to Bjarneyjar (the Bear Islands). Thence they sailed away from Bjarneyjar with northerly winds. They were out at sea two half-days. Then they came to land, and rowed along it in boats, and explored it, and found there flat stones, many and so great that two men might well lie on them stretched on their backs with heel to heel. Polar-foxes were there in abundance. This land they gave name to, and called it Helluland.\" [the land of flat stones]\n\nIn the Saga of Halfdan Eysteinsson (Hálfdanar saga Eysteinssonar), written no earlier than the mid-14th century a fragment says:\n\n\"Ragnar brought Helluland's obygdir under his sway and destroyed all the giants there...\"\n\nWritten in the last half of the 13th century an anonymous Icelandic \"fornaldarsaga\" , describes the attempts of Örvar-Oddr and his son Vignor to track down an enemy named Ogmund:\n\n\"I will tell you where Ogmund has gone. He has gone into the Skuggifjord (Hudson Strait), it is in Helluland's Obygdir (unihabited regions)... he has gone there because he wishes to escape you. But now you may track him to his house if you wish and see what comes of it.\"\n\n\"Thereupon he (and his son Vignor in separate ships) sailed until they came into the Greenland Sea (which lay between Iceland and Greenland) when they turned south and sailed around the land and to the west... They sailed then until they came to Helluland and laid their course into the Skuggifjord...\"\n\n\"When they reached the land (which they were seeking in the Skuggifjord) father and son went ashore and walked until they saw a fortified structure very strongly built...\"\n\nAccording to a footnote in Arthur Middleton Reeves's \"The Norse Discovery of America\" (1906), \"the whole of the northern coast of America, west of Greenland, was called by the ancient Icelandic geographers Helluland it Mikla, or Great Helluland; and the island of Newfoundland simply Helluland, or Litla Helluland.\"\n\nThe Icelandic \"Saga of Erik the Red\" and the \"Greenland Saga\" characterized Helluland as a land of flat stones (Old Norse: \"hella\"). Most scholars agree that Helluland corresponds to Baffin Island in the present-day Canadian territory of Nunavut.\n\nFrom the testimony of the sagas, the Norse explorers probably made contact with the native Dorset culture of the region, people whom the sagas term \"skrælings\". Historians suggest the contact had no major cultural ramifications for either side.\n\nPatricia Sutherland of the Canadian Museum of Civilization originally found in the museum's collections yarn collected in archaeological digs on Baffin Island that corresponded to that found in Viking settlements in Greenland, which led her to explore in depth the potential that Vikings had settled on Baffin Island. Over a number of years searching in collections and digging at sites such as Tanfield Valley, she found numerous artifacts, such as tally sticks, signs of iron and bronze metallurgy and whetstones used for sharpening metal tools, and European-style masonry and turf construction, which indicated to her that the Vikings had been on Baffin for an extended period and likely had an established trading relationship with the Dorset natives in the area.\n\nSutherland's new findings further strengthen the case for a Viking camp on Baffin Island. \"While her evidence was compelling before, I find it convincing now,\" said James Tuck, professor emeritus of archaeology, ... at Memorial University.\" \nSutherland and the Helluland Archaeology Project among others have identified several potential pre-Columbian European archaeological sites including Tanfield Valley, Avayalik at the far north of the Labrador Peninsula, Willows Island at the southern part of Baffin Island, Pond Inlet (Nunguvik) in the far north of Baffin Island.\n\n\n"}

He received a Master of Arts degree from Columbia the following year and joined Doubleday and Company as an editorial trainee.\n\nAt Doubleday, he saw the need for inexpensive, well made paperbacks of the kinds of books that his classmates, many of them veterans studying on the GI Bill, were reading but couldn't afford to own in their hardcover editions. With the support of Ken McCormick, Doubleday's chief editor, he launched Anchor Books, the first so-called Quality Paperbacks, which quickly became the dominant paperback format. In 1954 Anchor Books won the Carey-Thomas Award. \n\nIn 1958 he left Doubleday to join Random House where he served as editorial director until his retirement in 1999.

He was referred to as a \"strigoi\", \"štrigon\" or \"štrigun\", a local word for something resembling a vampire and a warlock.\n\nJure Grando lived in Kringa, a small town in the interior of the Istrian peninsula near Tinjan. He died in 1656 due to illness but according to legend, returned from the grave at night as a vampire (\"štrigon\") and terrorised his village until his decapitation in 1672. Ana and Nikola Alilović, daughter and son of Jure, fled from Istria to Volterra, Italy at young ages.\n\nThe legend tells that, for 16 years after his death, Jure would arise from his grave by night and terrorise the village. The village priest, Giorgio, who had buried Jure sixteen years previously discovered that at night somebody would knock on the doors around the village, and on whichever door he knocked, someone from that house would die within the next few days.\n\nJure also appeared to his terrified widow in her bedroom, who described the corpse as looking as though he was smiling and gasping for breath, and would then sexually assault her. When Father Giorgio eventually came face to face with the vampire, he held out a cross in front of him and yelled \"Behold Jesus Christ, you vampire! Stop tormenting us!\"\n\nThe bravest of the villagers led by the prefect Miho Radetić chased and tried to kill the vampire by piercing his heart with a hawthorn stick, but failed because the stick just bounced off of his chest. One night later, nine people went to the graveyard, carrying a cross, lamps and a hawthorn stick. They dug up Jure's coffin, and found a perfectly preserved corpse with a smile on its face. Father Giorgio said: \"Look, \"štrigon\", there is Jesus Christ who saved us from hell and died for us. And you, \"štrigon\", you cannot have peace!\" They then tried to pierce its heart again, but the stick could not penetrate its flesh.\n\nAfter some exorcism prayers, Stipan Milašić (one of the villagers), took a saw and sawed the head off the corpse. As soon as the saw tore his skin, the vampire screamed and blood started to flow from the cut. According to folklore, peace finally returned to the region after Jure's decapitation.\n\nCarniolan scientist Janez Vajkard Valvasor wrote about Jure Grando Alilović's life and afterlife in his extensive work \"The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola\" when he visited Kringa during his travels. This was the first written document on vampires. Grando was also mentioned in writings by Erasmus Francisci and Johann Joseph von Goerres (\"La mystique divine, naturelle, et diabolique\", Paris 1855), whose story was much more elaborate, full of fantastic details to make the story more interesting and sensational. In modern times, Croatian writer Boris Perić has researched the legend and written a book (\"The Vampire\") on the story.\n\nToday, Kringa has embraced the story of Jure Grando Alilović and have opened up a vampire themed bar aimed at attracting tourists to the town. The Juraj Dobrila gymnasium in Pazin created a short film called \"Vampire of My Homeland\" (\"Vampir moga zavičaja\") based on the writings from Valvasor.\n\nThe folklore related to the \"štrigun\" has recently been documented and examined by numerous scientists at the University of Zagreb.\n\n"}
{"id": "2747188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2747188", "title": "Khatushyam", "text": "Khatushyam\n\nIn Hinduism, Khatushyam is a name and manifestation of Barbaric, grandson of Bhima and son of Mata Ahilyavati (daughter of Basuki Naag). This manifestation is especially popular in the Indian state of Rajasthan and Haryana. The original Sanskrit name \"Barbarīka\" is often replaced in Rajasthan by the Hindi version, \"Barbarīk\", often written as \"Barbareek\".\n\nIn the \"Skanda Purana\", Barbarika, Baliyadev (IAST Barbarīka) was the son of Ghatotkacha and Maurvi (Ahilawati), daughter of Muru, a Yadava king., though other references state he is a Warrior from the South. Barbarika was originally a yaksha, and was reborn as a man. He was bound by his principle of always fighting on the losing side, which led him to stand witness to the battle of Mahabharata without taking part in it. In Nepali culture Kirata King Yalamber of Nepal is portrayed as Barbarika while Native of Kathmandu Valley portrait him as Akash Bhairav.\n\nIn Rajasthan, he is worshiped as Khatushyamji, and In Gujarat, he is worshiped as Baliyadev is believed to have been sacrificed before the Mahabharata war to ensure the victory of his grandfathers, the Pandavas. In return for his sacrifice, he was deified by a boon given by Krishna.\n\n\nBarbarika alias Khatushyamji Baliyadev alias Shyam was a grandson of Bhima (second of the Pandava brothers), and the son of Ghatotkacha. Ghatotkacha was the son of Bhima and Hidimbi. Even in his childhood, Barbarika was a very brave warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from his mother. The gods (\"ashtadeva\") gave him the three infallible arrows. Hence, Barbarika came to be known as \"Bearer of Three Arrows\".\nWhen Barbarika learnt that battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas had become inevitable, he wanted to witness what was to be the Mahābhārata War. He promised his mother that if he felt the urge to participate in the battle, he would join the side which would be losing. He rode to the field on his Blue Horse equipped with his three arrows and bow.\n\nBefore the Mahabharata war began, Lord Krishna asked all the warriors how many days they would take to finish Mahabharata war alone. Bhishma answered that he would take 20 days to finish the war. Dronacharya replied that it would take him 25 days. When Karna was asked, he said he would take 24 days. Arjuna told Krishna it would take 28 days for him to complete the battle by himself. In this manner, Lord Krishna asked each warrior and received an answer.\n\nKrishna disguised as a Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. When asked how many days he would take to finish the war alone, Barbarika answered that he could finish it in one minute. Krishna then asked Barbarika how he'd finish the great battle with just three arrows. Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his opponents in the war, and it would then return to his quiver. He stated that, the first arrow is used to mark all the things that he wants to destroy. If he uses the second arrow, then the second arrow will mark all the things that he wants to save. On using the third arrow, it will destroy all the things that are not marked and then return to his quiver. In other words, with one arrow he can fix all his targets and with the other he can destroy them.\n\nKrishna then challenged him to tie all the leaves of the Peepal tree under which he was standing, using his arrows. Barbarika Baliyadev accepts the challenge and starts meditating to release his arrow by closing his eyes. As Barbarika starts meditating, Krishna quietly plucks a leaf from the tree and hides it under his foot. When Barbarika releases his first arrow, it marks all the leaves of the tree and finally started hovering around the leg of Krishna. Krishna asks Barbarika why the arrow was hovering over his foot. Barbarika replies that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting his foot to mark the leaf that is hidden underneath. Barbarika advises Krishna to lift his leg, otherwise the arrow would mark the leaf by piercing Krishna's foot. Krishna then lifts his foot and the first arrow also marks the hidden leaf. The third arrow then collects all the leaves (including the hidden leaf ) and ties them together. By this Krishna concludes that the arrows are so powerful and infallible, that even if Barbarika is unaware of the whereabouts of his targets, his arrows can still navigate and trace his intended targets. The moral of this incident is that, in a real battle field, if Krishna wants to isolate someone (for example: the 5 Pandava brothers) and hide them elsewhere in order to prevent them from being Barbarika's victim, he would not be successful as the arrows could trace even the hidden targets and destroy them. So, nobody would be able to escape from these arrows. Thus Krishna gets a deeper insight about Barbarika's phenomenal power.\n\nKrishna then asks the boy whom he would favour in the war. Barbarika reveals that he intends to fight for the side whichever is weak. As the Pandavas have only seven Akshauhini armies compared to the eleven of the Kauravas, he considers that the Pandavas to be relatively the weaker side and hence wants to support them. But Krishna asks him, if he had seriously given a thought about the consequences, before giving such a word to his mother (about supporting the weaker side). Barbarika assumes that his support, to the relatively weaker Pandava side, will make them victorious. But, Krishna reveals the actual consequences of his word to his mother:\n\nKrishna tells that whichever side he supports will end up making the other side weaker due to his power. Nobody will be able to defeat him. Hence, as he will be forced switch sides to support the other side that has become weaker (due to his word to his mother). Thus, in an actual war, he will keep oscillating between two sides, thereby destroying the entire army of both sides and eventually only he would remain. Subsequently, none of the sides would become victorious and he would be the lone survivor. Hence, Krishna avoids his participation in the war by seeking his head in charity.\n\nThe other version of story tells that the first arrow indeed pierces Krishna's leg and marks the leaf that is hidden under Krishna's foot. This becomes a weak spot of Krishna. Prior to this event, lord Krishna also gets a boon from sage Durvasa that his entire body except his leg will be immune to all weapons. Hence, only his leg will be vulnerable. Later, in the Mausala parva, a hunter by name Jara, hits Krishna's foot with arrows, mistaking him for a deer. This leads to the death of Krishna. In other words, this weak spot on Krishna's foot was first created by Barbarika's arrow.\n\nThe three arrows are signs of three 'taapa's that a human being experiences. These include the physical, the mental and the emotional turmoils, conflicts and confusions that are found almost everywhere. These three 'taapa's are cleared with chanting of name of Shri Krishna. Thus, giving Barabarika the name \"Shyaam\", the Lord intended to remove the three 'taapa's of human life, symbolized by the three arrows, without which it might not be possible to destroy or overcome the 'taapa's.\n\nOne another legend says that the three arrows of Barabarika can be used as follows: First arrow to mark all the near and dear ones, relatives, etc., Second arrow to mark the people who are not part of the war or who are not taking any side in the war, and the third arrow to destroy everything that is not marked by first and second arrows. This was the speciality of Barbarika's three arrows.\n\nKrishna then explained to him that before a battle, the head of the bravest Kshatriya needs to be sacrificed, in order to worship/sanctify the battlefield. Krishna said that he considered Barbarika to be the bravest among Kshatriyas, and was hence asking for his head in charity. In fulfillment of his promise, and in compliance with the Krishna's command, Barbarika gave his head to him in charity. This happened on the 12th day of the Shukla Paksha (bright half) of the month of Phaagun on Tuesday. Barbarika was a Yaksha in his previous birth. Once Lord Brahma and several other Devas came to Vaikuntha and complained to Lord Vishnu that the Adharma on Earth was increasing; it was not possible for them to bear the tortures causes by the wicked people. Hence they came to seek the help of Lord Vishnu to check them. Lord Vishnu told the Devas that he will soon be incarnated on Earth as a human being and destroy all the evil forces. Then, a Yaksha told the Devas that he alone is enough to kill all evil elements on the Earth, and it was not necessary for Lord Vishnu to descend to Earth. This hurt Lord Brahma very much. Lord Brahma cursed this Yaksha that whenever the time comes to eliminate all the evil forces on Earth, then Lord Vishnu will first kill him. Later, the Yaksha takes birth as Barbarika and Lord Krishna seeks his head in charity as a result of this curse.\n\nBefore decapitating himself, Barbarika told Krishna of his great desire to view the forthcoming battle and requested him to facilitate the same. Krishna agreed and placed the head on top of a hill overlooking the battlefield. From the hill, the head of Barbarika watched the entire battle.\n\nAt the end of the battle, the victorious Pandava brothers argued among themselves as to who was responsible for their victory. Krishna suggested that Barbarika's head, which had watched the whole battle should be allowed to judge. Barbarika's head suggested that it was Krishna alone who was responsible for the victory.\nBarbarika replies, “All I could see were two things. One, a divine chakra spinning all around the battle field, killing all those who were not on the side of Dharma. The other was the Draupadi who has taken her original form of Goddess Mahakali, who spread out her tongue on the battle field and consumed all the sinners as her sacrifice\". Listening to this, Pandavas realized that it was Lord Narayana and Goddess Parvati (Mahakali) who actually cleaned up the world from Adharma, and the Pandavas were mere instruments.\n\nHis other name is God Kamrunaag and is venerated as the preeminent deity in District Mandi, in Himachal Pradesh. A pond and a temple are situated in Kamru hill in Sundernagar, District Mandi. He witnessed the entire battle of Kurukshetra from the hill which is now known as Khatushyam Temple, located in Khatu village in Sikar District, Rajasthan. An impressive and especially sacred Temple of Baliyadev, Barbarik is situated at village Lambha in Ahmedabad District, Gujarat.\nBarbarika is worshiped as Shyam, being Krishna himself. Therefore, the flavour of the festivities reflects the playful and vibrant nature of Krishna. The festivals of Krishna Janmaashtami, \"Jhool Jhulani Ekadashi\", Holi and \"Vasant Panchami\" are celebrated with gusto in the temple. The \"Phalguna Mela\" detailed below is the principal annual festival.\n\nHundreds of devotees visit the temple every day. Newly married couples come to pay homage and newborn babies are brought to the temple for their \"mundan\" (the first hair-shaving) ceremony. An elaborate aarti is performed at the temple five times a day. These are:\n\nTwo special hymns, the \"Shri Shyam Aarti\" and the \"Shri Shyam Vinati,\" are chanted on all these occasions. The Shyam mantra is another litany of the Lord's names that is chanted by devotees.\n\nOther particular observances include:\n\nShukla Ekadashi and Dwadashi: The 11th and 12th days of the bright half of every month in the Hindu calendar is of special significance to the temple. This is because Barbarika was born on the 11th day of the bright half of the month of Kartika, and he donated his head (\"Sheesh\") to Krishna on the 12th day of the bright half of the month of phaagun on Tuesday. \"Darshan\" on these two days is therefore considered auspicious and devotees come in their thousands every month. The temple remains open throughout the night that falls between these days. Night-long \"Bhajan\" sessions are organised since devotees traditionally pass the night in singing the praises of the Lord. Devotees organise Bhajan programmes and invite Bhajan singers to sing devotional songs.\n\nBathing in the Shyam Kund: This is the holy pond near the temple from which the idol was retrieved. It is believed that a dip in this pond cures a person from ailments and brings good health. Filled with devotional fervor, people take ritual dips in the \"Shyam Kund.\" They believe that this will relieve them of diseases and contagion. Bathing during the annual Phalguna Mela festival is deemed specially salutary.\n\nNishan Yatra: It is believed that your wishes are granted if you offer a \"Nishan\" at the temple. A \"Nishan\" is a triangular flag of a particular size, made of cloth, which is hoisted on a bamboo stick. It is carried in one's hands while covering the route from the town of Ringas to Khatu (17 km) on (bare) foot. \"Nishans\" are offered in millions during the \"Phalguna Mela.\"\n\nPhalguna Mela: The most important festival associated with the temple is the Phalguna Mela which occurs just 8–9 days before from the festival of Holi. Barbarika's head appeared on \"Phalguna Shuddha Ekadashi,\" the 11th day of the bright half of the Hindu month of Phalguna. Therefore, the fair is held from the 9th to the 12th of that month. The fair has now been extended to nearly 12–15 days of the bright half of the Phalguna Month.\n\nOn this holy occasion pilgrims all over the country come here on foot with nishaans (holy mark - flags) in their hands. People enjoy their holy journey by singing \"shyam bhajans\" and playing various musical instruments. They enjoy the journey by playing \"holi\" with gulal. Many Shyam Bhaktas supply food to pedestrians in the shade of tents. They encourage also to complete their journey with full enthusiasm. They enjoy this occasion as the marriage of Khatushyamji. People enjoy the mela by purchasing various things. On Dwadashi (= 12th day of month), Bhog is being prepared as Baba's Prasadi of Kheer, Churama.\n\nSpecial arrangements for security are made to control the crowd. Around 500,000 people visit in three days of this holy mela in this small village. To briefly see Baba Shyam's idol, a very tight security is made with the help of bamboo fence around .\n"}

His name means One Who Lives Above.\n\nThe story of his creation tells that in the beginning, before there were earth or sky there was only darkness. Into it came a small and thin disc with yellow and white on its alternate sides, and inside it sat Kuterastan, a small bearded man no larger than a frog. Kuterastan is described as awakening and rubbing his eyes. When he peers above him into the darkness it filled with light and illuminated the darkness below. When he looked east the light became tinged with the yellow of dawn, and when he looked west the light was shaded with the amber tones of dusk. As he glanced about himself clouds in different colors appeared. Then again Kuterastan rubbed his eyes and face, and as he flung the sweat from his hands another cloud appeared with a tiny little girl Stenatliha sitting on top. Stenatliha's name translates as the Woman Without Parents. Kuterastan and Stenatliha were puzzled where the other had come from, and where were the Earth and Sky. After thinking for some time, Kuterastan again rubbed his eyes and face, then his hands together, and from the sweat flying as he opened hands first Chuganaai, the Sun, and then Hadintin Skhin, or Pollen Boy, appeared. After the four sat a long time in silence on a single cloud, Kuterastan finally broke the silence to say, \"What shall we do?\" and started the creation.\n\nThe story describes the sequence, with Nacholecho, the Tarantula, the first to be created. Kuterastan followed by making the Big Dipper, the wind, lightning, and thunder, each given their characteristic tasks. Finding the cloud a poor home, he then turned his attention to making the earth. With the sweat of the four gods mixed together in Kuterastan's palms there emerged a small brown ball no bigger than a bean. This was expanded as the gods kicked the small brown ball. Then the wind went inside the ball and to inflate it. Tarantula attached to the ball a spun black cord and stretched it far to the east. Tarantula also attached one cord each of blue, yellow and white to the ball pulling one far to the south, another west, and the last to the north. When Tarantula was finished, the earth was vast expanse of smooth brown plain. Poles were placed at each corner to hold the earth in place. And at this Kuterastan sang a repeating refrain, \"The world is now made and it sits still.\"\n"}

{"id": "3232424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3232424", "title": "Memorandum of association", "text": "Memorandum of association\n\nThe memorandum of association of a company is an important corporate document in certain jurisdictions. It is often simply referred to as the memorandum. In the UK, it has to be filed with the Registrar of Companies during the process of incorporating a company. It is the document that regulates the company’s external affairs, and complements the articles of association which cover the company's internal constitution. It contains the fundamental conditions under which the company is allowed to operate. Until recently it had to include the \"objects clause\" which let the shareholders, creditors and those dealing with the company know what is its permitted range of operation, although this was usually drafted very broadly. It also shows the company's initial capital. It is one of the documents required to incorporate a company in India, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Nigeria, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania and is also used in many of the common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth.\n\nIt is still a requirement to file a memorandum of association to incorporate a new company, but it contains less information than was required before 1 October 2010. The Companies (Registration) Regulation 2008 included pro-forma Memoranda.\n\nIt is basically a statement that the subscribers wish to form a company under the Companies Act 2006, have agreed to become members and, in the case of a company that is to have a share capital, to take at least one share each. It is no longer required to state the name of the company, the type of company (such as public limited company or private company limited by shares), the location of its registered office, the objects of the company, and its authorised share capital. Companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2009 are not required to amend their memorandum. Those details which are now required to appear in the Articles, such as the objects clause and details of the share capital, are deemed to form a part of the Articles.\n\nThe memorandum no longer restricts the activities of a company. Since 1 October 2009, if a company's constitution contains any restrictions on the objects at all, those restrictions will form part of the articles of association.\n\nHistorically, a company's memorandum of association contained an objects clause, which limited its capacity to act. When the first limited companies were incorporated, the objects clause had to be widely drafted so as not to restrict the board of directors in their day to day trading. In the Companies Act 1989, the term \"General Commercial Company\" was introduced which meant that companies could undertake \"any lawful or legal trade or business.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "901046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=901046", "title": "Minutes", "text": "Minutes\n\nMinutes, also known as minutes of meeting (abbreviation MoM), protocols or, informally, notes, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing. They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues.\n\nMinutes may be created during the meeting by a typist or court reporter, who may use shorthand notation and then prepare the minutes and issue them to the participants afterwards. Alternatively, the meeting can be audio recorded, video recorded, or a group's appointed or informally assigned secretary may take notes, with minutes prepared\n\nMinutes are the official written record of the meetings of an organization or group. They are not transcripts of those proceedings. Using \"Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised\" (RONR), the minutes should contain mainly a record of what was \"done\" at the meeting, not what was \"said\" by the members. The organization may have its own rules regarding the content of the minutes.\n\nFor most organizations or groups, it is important for the minutes to be terse and only include a summary of the decisions. A verbatim report (transcript) is typically not useful. Unless the organization's rules require it, a summary of the discussions in a meeting is neither necessary nor appropriate.\n\nThe minutes of certain groups, such as a corporate board of directors, must be kept on file and are important legal documents. Minutes from board meetings are kept separately from minutes of general membership meetings within the same organization. Also, minutes of executive sessions may be kept separately. Committees are not required to keep formal minutes although less formal notes may be taken. For committees, their formal records are the reports submitted to their parent body.\n\nThe format of the minutes can vary depending on the standards established by an organization, although there are general guidelines. \"Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised\" contains a sample set of minutes.\n\nGenerally, minutes begin with the name of the body holding the meeting (e.g., a board) and may also include the place, date, list of people present, and the time that the chair called the meeting to order.\n\nSince the primary function of minutes is to record the decisions made, all official decisions must be included. If a formal motion is proposed and seconded, then (regardless whether it passes) this is recorded. The voting tally may also be included. The part of the minutes dealing with a routine motion might note merely that a particular motion was \"moved by Ann and passed\". It is not strictly necessary to include the name of the person who seconds a motion. Where a tally is included, it is sufficient to record the number of people voting for and against a motion, but requests by participants to note their votes by name may be allowed. If a decision is made by roll-call vote, then all of the individual votes are recorded by name. If it is made by general consent without a formal vote, then this fact may be recorded.\n\nThe minutes may end with a note of the time that the meeting was adjourned.\n\nMinutes are sometimes submitted by the person who is responsible for them (often the secretary) at a subsequent meeting for review. The traditional closing phrase is \"Respectfully submitted\" (although this is no longer common), followed by the officer's signature, his or her typed (or printed) name, and his or her title.\n\nUsually, one of the first items in an order of business or an agenda for a meeting is the reading and approval of the minutes from the previous meeting. If the members of the group agree (usually by unanimous consent) that the written minutes reflect what happened at the previous meeting, then they are approved, and the fact of their approval is recorded in the minutes of the current meeting. If there are significant errors or omissions, then the minutes may be redrafted and submitted again at a later date. Minor changes may be made immediately using the normal amendment procedures, and the amended minutes may be approved \"as amended\". It is normally appropriate to send a draft copy of the minutes to all the members in advance of the meeting so that the meeting is not delayed by a reading of the draft.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "500004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=500004", "title": "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences", "text": "On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), also cited simply as Sloane's, is an online database of integer sequences. It was created and maintained by Neil Sloane while a researcher at AT&T Labs. Foreseeing his retirement from AT&T Labs in 2012 and the need for an independent foundation, Sloane agreed to transfer the intellectual property and hosting of the OEIS to the OEIS Foundation in October 2009. Sloane continues to be involved in the OEIS in his role as President of the OEIS Foundation.\n\nOEIS records information on integer sequences of interest to both professional mathematicians and amateurs, and is widely cited. it contains over 300,000 sequences, making it the largest database of its kind.\n\nEach entry contains the leading terms of the sequence, keywords, mathematical motivations, literature links, and more, including the option to generate a graph or play a musical representation of the sequence. The database is searchable by keyword and by subsequence.\n\nNeil Sloane started collecting integer sequences as a graduate student in 1965 to support his work in combinatorics. The database was at first stored on punched cards. He published selections from the database in book form twice:\nThese books were well received and, especially after the second publication, mathematicians supplied Sloane with a steady flow of new sequences. The collection became unmanageable in book form, and when the database had reached 16,000 entries Sloane decided to go online—first as an e-mail service (August 1994), and soon after as a web site (1996). As a spin-off from the database work, Sloane founded the \"Journal of Integer Sequences\" in 1998.\nThe database continues to grow at a rate of some 10,000 entries a year.\nSloane has personally managed 'his' sequences for almost 40 years, but starting in 2002, a board of associate editors and volunteers has helped maintain the database.\nIn 2004, Sloane celebrated the addition of the 100,000th sequence to the database, , which counts the marks on the Ishango bone. In 2006, the user interface was overhauled and more advanced search capabilities were added. In 2010 an OEIS wiki at OEIS.org was created to simplify the collaboration of the OEIS editors and contributors. The 200,000th sequence, , was added to the database in November 2011; it was initially entered as A200715, and moved to A200000 after a week of discussion on the SeqFan mailing list, following a proposal by OEIS Editor-in-Chief Charles Greathouse to choose a special sequence for A200000.\n\nBesides integer sequences, the OEIS also catalogs sequences of fractions, the digits of transcendental numbers, complex numbers and so on by transforming them into integer sequences.\nSequences of rationals are represented by two sequences (named with the keyword 'frac'): the sequence of numerators and the sequence of denominators. For example, the fifth order Farey sequence, formula_1, is catalogued as the numerator sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4 () and the denominator sequence 5, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5 ().\nImportant irrational numbers such as π = 3.1415926535897... are catalogued under representative integer sequences such as decimal expansions (here 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 8, 8, ... ()), binary expansions (here 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... ()), or continued fraction expansions (here 3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 84, 2, 1, 1, ... ()).\n\nThe OEIS was limited to plain ASCII text until 2011, and it still uses a linear form of conventional mathematical notation (such as \"f\"(\"n\") for functions, \"n\" for running variables, etc.). Greek letters are usually represented by their full names, \"e.g.\", mu for μ, phi for φ.\nEvery sequence is identified by the letter A followed by six digits, almost always referred to with leading zeros, \"e.g.\", A000315 rather than A315.\nIndividual terms of sequences are separated by commas. Digit groups are not separated by commas, periods, or spaces.\nIn comments, formulas, etc., a(n) represents the \"n\"th term of the sequence.\n\nZero is often used to represent non-existent sequence elements. For example, enumerates the \"smallest prime of \"n\"² consecutive primes to form an \"n\"×\"n\" magic square of least magic constant, or 0 if no such magic square exists.\" The value of \"a\"(1) (a 1×1 magic square) is 2; \"a\"(3) is 1480028129. But there is no such 2×2 magic square, so \"a\"(2) is 0.\nThis special usage has a solid mathematical basis in certain counting functions. For example, the totient valence function \"N\"(\"m\") () counts the solutions of φ(\"x\") = \"m\". There are 4 solutions for 4, but no solutions for 14, hence \"a\"(14) of A014197 is 0—there are no solutions.\nOccasionally −1 is used for this purpose instead, as in .\n\nThe OEIS maintains the lexicographical order of the sequences, so each sequence has a predecessor and a successor (its \"context\"). OEIS normalizes the sequences for lexicographical ordering, (usually) ignoring all initial zeros and ones, and also the sign of each element. Sequences of weight distribution codes often omit periodically recurring zeros.\n\nFor example, consider: the prime numbers, the palindromic primes, the Fibonacci sequence, the lazy caterer's sequence, and the coefficients in the series expansion of formula_2. In OEIS lexicographic order, they are:\nwhereas unnormalized lexicographic ordering would order these sequences thus: #3, #5, #4, #1, #2.\n\nVery early in the history of the OEIS, sequences defined in terms of the numbering of sequences in the OEIS itself were proposed. \"I resisted adding these sequences for a long time, partly out of a desire to maintain the dignity of the database, and partly because A22 was only known to 11 terms!\", Sloane reminisced.\nOne of the earliest self-referential sequences Sloane accepted into the OEIS was (later ) \"\"a\"(\"n\") = \"n\"-th term of sequence A or -1 if A has fewer than n terms\". This sequence spurred progress on finding more terms of . \nThis line of thought leads to the question \"Does sequence A contain the number \"n\" ?\" and the sequences , \"Numbers \"n\" such that OEIS sequence A contains \"n\", and , \"n\" is in this sequence if and only if \"n\" is not in sequence A\". Thus, the composite number 2808 is in A053873 because is the sequence of composite numbers, while the non-prime 40 is in A053169 because it's not in , the prime numbers. Each \"n\" is a member of exactly one of these two sequences, and in principle it can be determined \"which\" sequence each \"n\" belongs to, with two exceptions (related to the two sequences themselves):\n\nThis entry, , was chosen because it contains every field an OEIS entry can have.\n\n\nIn 2009, the OEIS database was used by an amateur mathematician to measure the \"importance\" of each integer number. The result shown in the plot on the right shows a clear \"gap\" between two distinct point clouds the \"uninteresting numbers\" (blue dots) and the \"interesting\" numbers that occur comparatively more often in sequences from the OEIS. It contains essentially prime numbers (red), numbers of the form a^n (green) and highly composite numbers (yellow). This phenomenon was studied by Nicolas Gauvrit, Jean-Paul Delahaye and Hector Zenil who explained the speed of the 2 clouds in terms of algorithmic complexity and the gap by social factors based on an artificial preference for sequences of primes, even numbers, geometric and Fibonacci-type sequences and so on. Sloane's gap was featured on a Numberphile video.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Critics claim that he was referring to Iraq War veterans critical of the war.\nLimbaugh argued that the comment referred to persons falsely claiming to be such veterans.\n\nIn response to Limbaugh's comments, United States Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Mark P. Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications. The letter of complaint requested that Mays \"publicly repudiate these comments and ask Mr. Limbaugh to apologize\" for the remarks. The Reid letter was signed by 41 Democratic senators.\nLimbaugh obtained the letter and sold it on eBay for $2,100,100, the record for a charitable auction on that site. He promised to donate the funds to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation with a matching donation of his own bringing the total to $4.2million.\n\nOn September 21, 2007, the Associated Press released a story in which Doug Carver from the Office of the Inspector General of the Veterans Administration called individuals who never served in the military and attempted to defraud the government of veteran benefits \"Phony War Heroes\":\n\n\"The phony war hero phenomenon ... tarnishes the service of thousands of veterans who have served honorably,\" -- Doug Carver\n\nThe story was about Jesse Macbeth, who claimed at the onset of the Iraq War that he had witnessed attacks on Arabs in mosques and abuses of civilians. In reality, he did not graduate from Army boot camp. He was also receiving veteran benefits after he made those claims. MacBeth was eventually sentenced to 5 months in prison.\n\nOn September 24, the ABC News program \"World News with Charles Gibson\" ran a segment on \"phony heroes\". The show's opening stated that \"A famous recruiting slogan once touted the Army as a place to be all you can be. But increasingly, scam artists are posing as the war heroes they never were, claiming credit for acts of courage in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nOn the September 26 radio broadcast of \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\", Limbaugh took a call from two listeners. The first, a man who claimed to be a Republican and former member of the military, expressed a desire for the US to withdraw from Iraq. The second, responding to the first caller, complained that the media never talked to \"real soldiers\". In response to the caller saying \"They pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and spout to the media\", Limbaugh said \"the phony soldiers\". After the conversation, Limbaugh read aloud the Associated Press article about MacBeth.\n\nThe unedited transcript of the conversation is as follows:\n\nCALLER: Hi, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.\n\nLIMBAUGH: You bet.\n\nCALLER: I have a retort to Mike in Chicago, because I am serving in the American military, in the Army. I've been serving for 14 years, very proudly.\n\nLIMBAUGH: Thank you, sir.\n\nCALLER: I'm one of the few that joined the Army to serve my country, I'm proud to say, not for the money or anything like that. What I would like to retort to is that, what these people don't understand, is if we pull out of Iraq right now, which is not possible because of all the stuff that's over there, it would take us at least a year to pull everything back out of Iraq, then Iraq itself would collapse and we'd have to go right back over there within a year or so.\n\nLIMBAUGH: There's a lot more than that that they don't understand. The next guy that calls here I'm going to ask them, \"What is the imperative of pulling out? What's in it for the United States to pull out?\" I don't think they have an answer for that other than, \"When's he going to bring the troops home? Keep the troops safe,\" whatever. \n\nCALLER: Yeah.\n\nLIMBAUGH: It's not possible intellectually to follow these people.\n\nCALLER: No, it's not. And what's really funny is they never talk to real soldiers. They pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and spout to the media.\n\nLIMBAUGH: The phony soldiers.\n\nCALLER: Phony soldiers. If you talk to any real soldier and they're proud to serve, they want to be over in Iraq, they understand their sacrifice and they're willing to sacrifice for the country.\n\nLIMBAUGH: They joined to be in Iraq.\n\nCALLER: A lot of people.\n\nLIMBAUGH: You know where you're going these days, the last four years, if you sign up. The odds are you're going there or Afghanistan, or somewhere.\n\nCALLER: Exactly, sir. My other comment, my original comment, was a retort to Jill about the fact we didn't find any weapons of mass destruction. Actually, we have found weapons of mass destruction in chemical agents that terrorists have been using against us for a while now. I've done two tours in Iraq, I just got back in June, and there are many instances of insurgents not knowing what they're using in their IEDs. They're using mustard artillery rounds, VX artillery rounds in their IEDs. Because they didn't know what they were using, they didn't do it right, and so it didn't really hurt anybody. But those munitions are over there. It's a huge desert. If they bury it somewhere, we're never going to find it.\n\nLIMBAUGH: Well, that's a moot point for me right now.\n\nCALLER: Right. \n\nLIMBAUGH: The weapons of mass destruction. We gotta get beyond that. We're there. We all know they were there, and Mahmoud even admitted it in one of his speeches here talking about Saddam using the poison mustard gas or whatever it is on his own people. But that's moot. What's more important is all this is taking place now in the midst of the surge working, and all of these anti-war Democrats are getting even more hell-bent on pulling out of there, which means that success on the part of you and your colleagues over there is a great threat to them. It's frustrating and maddening, and why they must be kept in the minority. I want to thank you, Mike, for calling. I appreciate it very much. \n\nHere is a Morning Update that we did recently, talking about fake soldiers. This is a story of who the left props up as heroes. They have their celebrities and one of them was Army Ranger Jesse Macbeth. Now, he was a \"corporal.\" I say in quotes. Twenty-three years old. What made Jesse Macbeth a hero to the anti-war crowd wasn't his Purple Heart; it wasn't his being affiliated with post-traumatic stress disorder from tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. No. What made Jesse Macbeth, Army Ranger, a hero to the left was his courage, in their view, off the battlefield, without regard to consequences. He told the world the abuses he had witnessed in Iraq, American soldiers killing unarmed civilians, hundreds of men, women, even children. In one gruesome account, translated into Arabic and spread widely across the Internet, Army Ranger Jesse Macbeth describes the horrors this way: \"We would burn their bodies. We would hang their bodies from the rafters in the mosque.\"\n\nNow, recently, Jesse Macbeth, poster boy for the anti-war left, had his day in court. And you know what? He was sentenced to five months in jail and three years probation for falsifying a Department of Veterans Affairs claim and his Army discharge record. He was in the Army. Jesse Macbeth was in the Army, folks, briefly. Forty-four days before he washed out of boot camp. Jesse Macbeth isn't an Army Ranger, never was. He isn't a corporal, never was. He never won the Purple Heart, and he was never in combat to witness the horrors he claimed to have seen. You probably haven't even heard about this. And, if you have, you haven't heard much about it. This doesn't fit the narrative and the template in the Drive-By Media and the Democrat Party as to who is a genuine war hero. Don't look for any retractions, by the way. Not from the anti-war left, the anti-military Drive-By Media, or the Arabic websites that spread Jesse Macbeth's lies about our troops, because the truth for the left is fiction that serves their purpose. They have to lie about such atrocities because they can't find any that fit the template of the way they see the US military. In other words, for the American anti-war left, the greatest inconvenience they face is the truth.\n\nOn September 28 Limbaugh published an edited audio and transcript versions of the September 26th exchange. Deleted from what he called the \"entire transcript\" was a one minute 35 seconds exchange. Limbaugh provided, according to Media Matters, no \"notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript of the September 26 clip he used.\" Media Matters referred to the edits as being employed \"selectively\" in an attempt to \"recast\" the controversy while he \"misrepresented\" his comments.\nMedia Matters published the September 26 transcript and audio with September 28 edits. The excepted transcript below notes and highlights the deletions.\nCALLER 2: A lot of them -- the new kids, yeah.\n\nLIMBAUGH: Well, you --\n\n[begin Limbaugh edit]\n\n[end Limbaugh edit]\n\nOn September 27, 2007, Media Matters for America published a report headlined \"Limbaugh: Service members who support U.S. withdrawal are 'phony soldiers'\",\ntouching off a series of rebukes from Democrats demanding that Limbaugh apologize. John Kerry called Limbaugh's comment \"a disgusting attack\", and stated, \"In a single moment on his show, Limbaugh managed to question the patriotism of men and women in uniform who have put their lives on the line and many who died for his right to sit safely in his air-conditioned studio peddling hate.\"\n\nThe Senate rebuke drew criticism from Congressional Republicans like Congressman Doug Lamborn of Colorado who said on the floor of the House of Representatives, \"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the liberals' fraudulent attacks on Rush Limbaugh. Anyone who reads the widely available transcript, as I have done, sees that Mr. Limbaugh was appropriately referring to the pretenders who pose as medal winners, or who falsely claim to have committed atrocities in Iraq, when he used the phrase \"phony soldiers.\" No, the real scandal here is that liberals in America and here in this Congress are willing to manipulate facts to smear those they disagree with. But there’s an even more insidious agenda by liberals going on, and that is to reinstitute the so-called Fairness Doctrine, which is actually a way to silence conservatives on the radio waves. Mr. Limbaugh deserves mega kudos for being a forceful and effective voice on the side of common sense and for being an example of the First Amendment in action. After all, isn’t that what our country is supposed to be about?\"\n\nIn the days that followed Limbaugh stated on his radio program that when he referred to \"phony soldiers\" he was specifically referring to Jesse MacBeth, whom he mentioned by name in the dialogue of his show, and those who never actually served.\n\nOn October 2, 2007, Harry Reid authored a two-page letter to Mark Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications (the radio company which broadcasts the Rush Limbaugh show) requesting that he \"publicly repudiate these comments and ask Mr. Limbaugh to apologize.\"\n\nForty-one U.S. Senators, all of the Democratic Party, signed the letter, four of whom were running for the Democratic nomination for President: Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, and Barack Obama. The other signatories are Harry Reid, Blanche Lincoln, Richard Durbin, Kent Conrad, Bob Menendez, Charles Schumer, Barbara Mikulski, Patty Murray, Byron Dorgan, Bill Nelson, Daniel Akaka, Dianne Feinstein, Max Baucus, Tom Harkin, Jack Reed, Daniel Inouye, Jay Rockefeller, Barbara Boxer, Edward M. Kennedy, Ken Salazar, Sherrod Brown, John Kerry, Bernie Sanders, Robert Byrd, Amy Klobuchar, Debbie Stabenow, Benjamin Cardin, Mary Landrieu, Jon Tester, Tom Carper, Frank Lautenberg, Jim Webb, Bob Casey, Patrick Leahy, Sheldon Whitehouse, Carl Levin, and Ron Wyden.\n\nOn October 2, 2007, Mark Mays sent a reply to Senator Reid stating, \"I have carefully read the transcript from the episode in question. I hope you will appreciate that I can not speak with authority to whom exactly Mr. Limbaugh's comments were directed or what was his intent. Only Mr. Limbaugh can speak to those issues, which he has done.\" Mays goes on to explain to the Senate Majority leader that, \"The first Amendment gives every American the right to voice his or her opinion, no matter how unpopular. That right is one I am sure you agree must be cherished and protected.\" Mays then turned the Reid letter over to Rush Limbaugh.\n\nOn October 11, 2007, on his \"Rush to Excellence\" tour in Philadelphia, he announced that he would be putting the letter on eBay the following day to sell to the highest bidder, the resulting revenue to be turned over to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, a charity which provides scholarships and assistance to the children of servicemen and police officers killed in the line of duty and an organization for which Limbaugh is a Director and one of the chief fundraisers.\n\nOn October 19, 2007, the letter sold for a record $2,100,100 to Betty Casey, Director of the Eugene B. Casey Foundation. Limbaugh matched the donation with his own money bringing the total donation to the Foundation to $4,200,200. Betty Casey remarked, \"The Eugene B. Casey Foundation believes freedom of speech is a basic right of every citizen of this country. Their purchase of the smear letter was to demonstrate their belief in this right and to support Rush Limbaugh, his views and his continued education of us.\"\n\nWithin an hour of the record-setting auction closing, Senator Reid addressed the issue again on the floor of the Senate stating, \"I strongly believe when we can put our differences aside, even Harry Reid and Rush Limbaugh, we should do that and try to accomplish good things for the American people.\"\n\nThe letter was being kept in a bank vault awaiting the refurbishment of Patrick Henry's original homestead, where Limbaugh presented it to Casey and where it is now on permanent display.\n\n"}
{"id": "1330156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1330156", "title": "Polonization", "text": "Polonization\n\nPolonization (or Polonisation; ) was the acquisition or imposition of elements of Polish culture, in particular the Polish language. This was experienced in some historic periods by the non-Polish populations of territories controlled or substantially under the influence of Poland. As with other examples of cultural assimilation, it could either be voluntary or forced and is most visible in the case of territories where the Polish language or culture were dominant or where their adoption could result in increased prestige or social status, as was the case of the nobility of Ruthenia and Lithuania. To a certain extent Polonization was also administratively promoted by the authorities, particularly in the period following World War II.\n\nPolonization can be seen as an example of cultural assimilation. Such a view is widely considered applicable to the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795) when the Ruthenian and Lithuanian upper classes were drawn towards the more Westernized Polish culture and the political and financial benefits of such a transition, as well as, sometimes, by the administrative pressure exerted on their own cultural institutions, primarily the Orthodox Church. The conversion to the Roman Catholic (and to a lesser extent, Protestant) faith was often the single most important part of the process. For Ruthenians of that time, being Polish culturally and Roman Catholic by religion was almost the same. This aspect of Polonization that led to the diminishing of the Orthodox Church was the part that was most resented by the Belarusian and Ukrainian masses. In contrast the Lithuanians, who were mostly Catholic, were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation, but that did not become evident for the wide masses of Lithuanians until the Lithuanian national renaissance in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nOn the other hand, the Polonization policies of the Polish government in the interwar years of the 20th century were again two-folded. Some of them were similar to the mostly forcible assimilationist policies, implemented by other European powers that have aspired to regional dominance (e.g., Germanization, Russification), while others resembled policies carried out by countries aiming at increasing the role of their native language and culture in their own societies (e.g., Magyarization, Rumanization, Ukrainization). For Poles, it was a process of rebuilding Polish national identity and reclaiming Polish heritage, including the fields of education, religion, infrastructure and administration, that suffered under the prolonged periods of foreign occupation by the neighboring empires of Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary. However, as a third of recreated Poland's population was ethnically non-Polish and many felt their own nationhood aspirations thwarted specifically by Poland, large segments of this population resisted to varying extents the policies intended to assimilate them. Part of the country's leadership emphasized the need for the ethnic and cultural homogeneity of the state in the long term. However, the promotion of the Polish language in the administration, public life and, especially education, were perceived by some as an attempt at forcible homogenization. In areas inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians for example, actions of the Polish authorities seen as aiming at restricting the influence of the Orthodox and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church caused additional resentment, and were considered to be closely tied to religious Polonization.\n\nBetween the 12th and the 14th centuries many towns in Poland adopted the so-called Magdeburg rights that promoted the towns' development and trade. The rights were usually granted by the king on the occasion of the arrival of migrants. Some, integrated with the larger community, such as merchants who settled there, especially Greeks and Armenians. They adopted most aspects of Polish culture but kept their Orthodox faith. Since the Middle Ages, Polish culture, influenced by the West, in turn radiated East, beginning the long and uneasy process of cultural assimilation.\n\nIn the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Ruthenian territories controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the newly formed Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The non-Polish ethnic groups found themselves under strong influence of the Polish culture and language. Quarter century later, following the Union of Brest the Ruthenian Church sought to break relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church. The sparsely populated lands, owned by the Polish and Polonized nobility, were settled by farmers from central Poland. The attractions, and pressures of Polonization on Ruthenian nobility and cultural elite resulted in almost complete abandonment of Ruthenian culture, traditions and the Orthodox Church by the Ruthenian higher class.\n\nThe Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila was offered the Polish crown and became Władysław II Jagiełło (reigned 1386–1434). This marked the beginning of the gradual, voluntary Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility. Jagiełło built many churches in pagan Lithuanian land and provided them generously with estates, gave out the lands and positions to the Catholics, settled the cities and villages and granted the biggest cities and towns Magdeburg Rights. The Ruthenian nobility was also freed from many payment obligations and their rights were equalized with those of the Polish nobility.\n\nUnder Jogaila successor as a king of Crown Władysław III of Varna, who reigned in 1434–1444, Polonization attained a certain degree of subtlety. Władysław III introduced some liberal reforms. He expanded the privileges to all Ruthenian nobles irrespective of their religion, and in 1443 signed a bull equalizing the Orthodox church in rights with the Roman Catholicism thus alleviating the relationship with the Orthodox clergy. These policies continued under the next king Casimir IV Jagiellon. Still, the mostly cultural expansion of the Polish influence continued since the Ruthenian nobility were attracted by both the glamour of the Western culture and the Polish political order where the magnates became the unrestricted rulers of the lands and serfs in their vast estates.\n\nSome Ruthenian magnates like Sanguszko, Wiśniowiecki and Kisiel, resisted the cultural Polonization for several generations, with the Ostrogski family being one of the most prominent examples. Remaining generally loyal to the Polish state, the magnates, like Ostrogskis, stood by the religion of their forefathers, and supported the Orthodox Church generously by opening schools, printing books in Ruthenian language (the first four printed Cyrillic books in the world were published in Cracow, in 1491) and giving generously to the Orthodox churches' construction. However, their resistance was gradually waning with each subsequent generation as more and more of the Ruthenian elite turned towards Polish language and Catholicism. Still, with most of the educational system getting Polonized and the most generously funded institutions being to the west of Ruthenia, the Ruthenian indigenous culture further deteriorated. In the Polish Ruthenia the language of the administrative paperwork started to gradually shift towards Polish. By the 16th century the language of administrative paperwork in Ruthenia was a peculiar mix of the older Church Slavonic with the Ruthenian language of the commoners and the Polish language. With the Polish influence in the mix gradually increasing it soon became mostly like the Polish language superimposed on the Ruthenian phonetics. The total confluence of Ruthenia and Poland was seen coming.\n\nAs the Eastern Rite Greek-Catholic Church originally created to accommodate the Ruthenian, initially Orthodox, nobility, ended up unnecessary to them as they converted directly into the Latin Rite Catholicism en masse, the Church largely became an hierarchy without followers. The Greek Catholic Church was then used as a tool aimed to split even the peasantry from their Ruthenian roots, still mostly unsuccessfully. The commoners, deprived of their native protectors, sought protection through the Cossacks, who, being fiercely Orthodox, tended also to easily turn to violence against those they perceived as their enemies, particularly the Polish state and what they saw as its representatives, the Poles and generally the Catholics, as well as the Jews.\n\nAfter several , especially the fateful Khmelnytsky uprising, and foreign invasions (like the Deluge), the Commonwealth, increasingly powerless and falling under the control of its neighbours, started to decline, the process which eventually culminated with elimination of the Polish statehood in the end of the 18th century for the next 123 years.\n\nWhile the Commonwealth's Warsaw Compact is widely considered an example of an unprecedented religious tolerance for its time, the oppressive policies of Poland towards its Eastern Orthodox subjects is often cited as one of the main reasons that brought the state's demise. \n\nDuring all time of existing of Commonwealth Polonization in western part of country referred to rather small groups of colonists, like Bambrzy in Greater Poland.\n\nPolonization also occurred during times when a Polish state didn't exist, despite the empires that partition Poland applied the policies aimed at reversing the past gains of Polonization or aimed at replacing Polish identity and eradication of Polish national group.\n\nThe Polonization took place in the early years of the Prussian partition, where, as a reaction to the persecution of Roman Catholicism during the Kulturkampf, German Catholics living in areas with a Polish majority voluntarily integrated themselves within Polish society, affecting approximately 100,000 Germans in the eastern provinces of Prussia.\n\nAccording to some scholars the biggest successes in Polonization of the non-Polish lands of former Commonwealth were achieved after the Partitions, in times of persecution of Polishness (noted by Leon Wasilewski (1917), Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky (1926)). Paradoxically, the substantial eastward movement of the Polish ethnic territory (over these lands) and growth of the Polish ethnic regions were taking place exactly in the period of the strongest Russian attack on everything Polish in Lithuania and Belarus.\n\nThe general outline of causes for that is considered to include the activities of the Roman-Catholic Church and the cultural influence exacted by the big cities (Vilna, Kovno) on these lands, the activities of the Vilna educational district in 19th century–1820s, the activities of the local administration, still controlled by the local Polish or already Polonized nobility up to the 1863–1864 January uprising, secret (Polish) schools in second half nineteenth to the beginning of the 20th century (\"tajne komplety\") and the influence of the land estates.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the end of the 18th century, the Polonization trends initially continued in Lithuania, Belarus and Polish-dominated parts of Ukraine as the initially liberal policies of the Empire gave the Polish elite significant concessions in the local affairs. Dovnar-Zapolsky notes that the Polonization actually intensified under the liberal rule of Alexander I, particularly due to the efforts of Polish intellectuals who led the Vilnius University which was organized in 1802–1803 from the Academy in Vilna (\"Schola Princeps Vilnensis\"), vastly expanded and given the highest \"Imperial\" status under the new name Vilna Imperial University (\"Imperatoria Universitas Vilnensis\"). By the Emperor's order, the Vilna education district overseen by Adam Czartoryski, a personal friend of Alexander, was greatly expanded to include the vast territories in the West of the Russian Empire stretching to Kiev in south-east and much of the Polish territory and the development of the University, which had no rival in the whole district, received the highest priority of the Imperial authorities which granted it significant freedom and autonomy. With the effort of Polish intellectuals who served the rectors of the University, Hieronim Strojnowski, Jan Śniadecki, Szymon Malewski, as well as Czartoryski who oversaw them, the University became the center of Polish patriotism and culture; and as the only University of the district the center attracted the young nobility of all ethnicities from this extensive region.\n\nWith time, the traditional Latin was fully eliminated from the University and by 1816 it was fully replaced by Polish and Russian. This change both affected and reflected a profound change in the Belarusian and Lithuanian secondary schools systems where Latin was also traditionally used as the University was the main source of the teachers for these schools. Additionally, the University was responsible for the textbooks selection and only Polish textbooks were approved for printing and usage.\n\nDovnar-Zapolsky notes that \"the 1800s–1810s had seen the unprecedented prosperity of the Polish culture and language in the former Great Duchy of Lithuania lands\" and \"this era has seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the smallest nobility, with further reduction of the areal of use of the contemporary Belarusian language. also noting that the Polonization trend had been complemented with the (covert) anti-Russian and anti-Eastern Orthodox trends. The results of these trends are best reflected in the ethnic censuses in previously non-Polish territories.\n\nFollowing the Polish November uprising aimed at breaking away from Russia, the Imperial policies finally changed abruptly. The University was forcibly closed in 1832 and the following years where characterized by the policies aimed at the assimilationist solution of the \"Polish question\", a trend that was further strengthened following another unsuccessful uprising (1863).\n\nIn the 19th century, the mostly unchallenged Polonization trend of the previous centuries had been met staunchly by then \"anti-Polish\" Russification policy, with temporary successes on both sides, like Polonization rises in mid-1850s and in 1880s and Russification strengthenings in 1830s and in 1860s. Any Polonization of the east and west territories (Russian and German partitions) occurred in the situation were Poles had steadily diminishing influence on the government. Partition of Poland posed a genuine threat to the continuation of Polish language-culture in those regions. As Polonization was centered around Polish culture, policies aimed at weakening and destroying it had a significant impact on weakening Polonization of those regions. This was particularly visible in Russian-occupied Poland, where the Polish culture fared worst, as Russian administration gradually became strongly anti-Polish. After a brief and relatively liberal early period in the early 19th century, where Poland was allowed to retain some autonomy as the Congress Poland puppet state, the situation for Polish culture steadily worsened.\n\nBy the times of Second Polish Republic (1918–1939) much of Poland's previous territory, which were historically mixed Ruthenian and Polish, had Ukrainian and Belorussian majorities. Following the post-World War I rebirth of the Polish statehood, these lands again became disputed but the Poles were more successful than the nascent West Ukrainian People's Republic in the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1918. Approximately one third of the new state's population was non-Catholic, including a large number of Russian Jews who immigrated to Poland following a wave of Ukrainian pogroms which continued until 1921. The Jews were entitled by a peace treaty in Riga to choose the country they preferred and several hundred thousand joined the already large Jewish minority of the Polish Second Republic.\n\nThe issue of non-Polish minorities was a subject of intense debate within the Polish leadership. Two ideas of Polish policy clashed at the time: a more tolerant and less assimilationist approach advocated by Józef Piłsudski, and an assimilationist approach advocated by Roman Dmowski and Stanisław Grabski.\n\nLinguistic assimilation was considered by National Democrats to be a major factor for \"unifying the state.\" For example, Grabski as Polish Minister for Religion and Public Education in 1923 and 1925–1926, wrote that \"Poland may be preserved only as a state of Polish people. If it were a state of Poles, Jews, Germans, Rusyns, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Russians, it would lose its independence again\"; and that \"it is impossible to make a nation out of those who have no 'national self-identification,' who call themselves 'local' (\"tutejszy\").\" Grabski also said that \"the transformation of the state territory of the Republic into a Polish national territory is a necessary condition of maintaining our frontiers.\"\n\nIn internal politics, Piłsudski's reign marked a much-needed stabilization and improvement in the situation of ethnic minorities, which formed almost a third of the population of the Second Republic. Piłsudski replaced the National-Democratic \"ethnic-assimilation\" with a \"state-assimilation\" policy: citizens were judged by their loyalty to the state, not by their ethnicity. The years 1926–1935 were favourably viewed by many Polish Jews, whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of Piłsudski's appointee Kazimierz Bartel. However a combination of various reasons, from the Great Depression, through the Piłsudski's need for support from parties for the parliament's election to the vicious spiral of terrorist attacks by Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and government pacifications meant that the situation continued to degenerate, despite Piłsudski's efforts.\n\nHowever, Polonization also created a new educated class among the non-Polish minorities, a class of intellectuals aware of the importance of schooling, press, literature and theatre, who became instrumental in the development of their own ethnic identities.\n\nThe territories of Western Belarus, western Ukraine and the Vilnius region, were incorporated into interwar Poland in 1921 at the Treaty of Riga in which the Polish eastern frontiers had been first defined following the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. At the same time, the government of the new Polish state, with pressure from the Allies agreed to grant political autonomy to Galicia, but not Volhynia.\n\nThe Treaty of Riga signed between sovereign Poland and the Soviet Russia representing the Soviet Ukraine without any participation from Belarusian side assigned almost half of the modern-day Belarus (the western half of Soviet Belarus) to the Polish Second Republic. The government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic according to the text of the Riga treaty was also acting \"on behalf of Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic\" formed in the course of war. Additionally, in accordance with the Treaty, the Soviet Russia received three regions from the newly formed Soviet Belarus, which were reassigned back by the Bolsheviks in 1924 and 1926. Protests by the exiled government of the Belarusian Democratic Republic proclaimed in 1918 were ignored by Poland and the Soviets.\n\nAccording to Per Anders Rudling, the Belarusian language was essentially pushed out of the schools in Polish West Belarus in violation of the Minorities' Treaty between Poland and the Western powers of 1919. The Polish author Marek Wierzbicki brings this in connection with the fact that the first textbook of Belarusian grammar was written no earlier than 1918.\n\nFollowing the intentions of the majority of the Polish society, the Polish government introduced harsh policies of polonization and assimilation of Belarusians in West Belarus. The Polish official Leopold Skulski, an advocate of polonization policies, is being quoted as saying in the Sejm in late 1930s: \"I assure you that in some ten years you won't be able to find a single [ethnic] Belarusian [in West Belarus]\".\n\nWładysław Studnicki, an influential Polish official at the administration of the Kresy region, openly stated that Poland needed the Eastern regions as an object for colonization.\n\nThere widespread cases of discrimination of the Belarusian language, it was forbidden for usage in state institutions.\n\nOrthodox Christians also faced discrimination in interwar Poland. This discrimination was also targeting assimilation of Eastern Orthodox Belarusians. The Polish authorities were imposing Polish language in Orthodox church services and ceremonies, initiated the creation of \"Polish Orthodox Societies\" in various parts of West Belarus (Slonim, Bielastok, Vaŭkavysk, Navahrudak).\n\nBelarusian Roman Catholic priests like Fr. Vincent Hadleŭski who promoted Belarusian language in the church and Belarusian national awareness were also under serious pressure by the Polish regime and the leadership of the Catholic Church in Poland. The Polish Catholic Church issued documents to priests prohibiting the usage of the Belarusian language rather than Polish language in Churches and Catholic Sunday Schools in West Belarus. A 1921 Warsaw-published instruction of the Polish Catholic Church criticized the priests introducing the Belarusian language in religious life: “\"They want to switch from the rich Polish language to a language that the people themselves call simple and shabby\"”.\n\nBefore 1921, there were 514 Belarusian language schools in West Belarus. In 1928, there were only 69 schools which was just 3% of all existing schools in West Belarus at that moment. All of them were phased out by the Polish educational authorities by 1939. The Polish officials openly prevented the creation of Belarusian schools and were imposing Polish language in school education in West Belarus. The Polish officials often treated any Belarusian demanding schooling in Belarusian language as a Soviet spy and any Belarusian social activity as a product of a communist plot.\n\nThe Belarusian civil society resisted polonization and mass closure of Belarusian schools. The Belarusian Schools Society (), led by Branisłaŭ Taraškievič and other activists, was the main organization promoting education in Belarusian language in West Belarus in 1921–1937.\n\nCompared to the (larger) Ukrainian minority living in Poland, Belarusians were much less politically aware and active. Nevertheless, according to Belarusian historians, the policies by the Polish government against the population of West Belarus increasingly provoked protests and armed resistance. In the 1920s, Belarusian partisan units arose in many areas of West Belarus, mostly unorganized but sometimes led by activists of Belarusian left wing parties. In the spring of 1922, several thousands Belarusian partisans issued a demand to the Polish government to stop the violence, to liberate political prisoners and to grant autonomy to West Belarus. Protests were held in various regions of West Belarus until mid 1930s.\n\nThe largest Belarusian political organization, the \"Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union\" (or, the Hramada), which demanded a stop to the polonization and autonomy for West Belarus, grew more radicalized by the time. It received logistical help from the Soviet Union, and financial aid from the Comintern. By 1927 \"Hramada\" was controlled entirely by agents from Moscow. It was banned by the Polish authorities, and further opposition to the Polish government was met with state-imposed sanctions once the connection between \"Hramada\" and the more radical pro-Soviet Communist Party of Western Belarus was discovered. The Polish policy was met with armed resistance.\n\nTerritories of Galicia and Volhynia had different backgrounds, different recent histories and different dominant religions. Until the First World War, Galicia with its large Ukrainian Greek Catholic population in the east (around Lwów), and Polish Roman Catholics in the west (around Kraków), was controlled by the Austrian Empire. On the other hand, the Ukrainians of Volhynia, formerly of the Russian Empire (around Równe), were largely Orthodox by religion, and were influenced by strong Russophile trends. Both \"Polish officials and Ukrainian activists alike, distinguished between Galician and Volhynian Ukrainians\" in their political aims. There was a much stronger national self-perception among the Galician Ukrainians increasingly influenced by OUN (Ukrainian nationalists).\n\nWhile the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC), which functioned in communion with the Latin Rite Catholicism, could have hoped to receive a better treatment in Poland where the leadership saw Catholicism as one of the main tools to unify the nation – the Poles under Stanisław Grabski saw the restless Galician Ukrainians as less reliable than the Orthodox Volhynian Ukrainians, seen as better candidates for gradual assimilation. That's why the Polish policy in Ukraine initially aimed at keeping Greek Catholic Galicians from further influencing Orthodox Volhynians by drawing the so-called \"Sokalski line\".\n\nDue to the region's history the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church attained a strong Ukrainian national character, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with the Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lviv for a considerable amount of time. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Rite faithful, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.\n\nWith respect to the Orthodox Ukrainian population in eastern Poland, the Polish government initially issued a decree defending the rights of the Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the Catholics, also eager to strengthen their position, had official representation in the Sejm and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Roman Catholic Church. The goal of the two so called \"revindication campaigns\" was to deprive the Orthodox of those churches that had been Greek Catholic before Orthodoxy was imposed by the tsarist Russian government. 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed, some of the destroyed churches were abandoned, and 150 more were forcibly transformed into Roman Catholic (not Greek Catholic) churches. Such actions were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who claimed that these acts would \"destroy in the souls of our non-united Orthodox brothers the very thought of any possible reunion.\"\n\nThe Polish administration closed many of the popular Prosvita Society reading rooms, an action which, combined with the devastation brought about during the war years, produced a marked decline in the number of reading rooms, from 2,879 in 1914 to only 843 in 1923.\n\nAs for the educational system, the provincial school administration from the Austrian era, which was based in L'viv and had separate Ukrainian representation, was abolished in January 1921. All decisions were subsequently to be made in Warsaw and to be implemented by administrators in local school districts. Ukrainians now found themselves within six different school districts (L'viv, Volhynia, Polissia, Cracow, Lublin, and Bialystok), although at least initially the Ukrainian school system, especially at the elementary level, was left undisturbed.\n\nIn 1924, the government of Prime Minister Władysław Grabski passed a law (known as the lex Grabski), over the objections of Ukrainian parliamentary representatives, which set up bilingual Ukrainian and Polish schools. The result was a rapid decline in the number of unilingual Ukrainian schools together with a sharp increase in Polish-Ukrainian bilingual schools in Galicia and Polish schools in Volhynia (1,459 in 1938).\n\nSince Ukrainians in Poland had only limited control over the formal education of their children, the Plast scouting movement took up the challenge of inculcating youth with a Ukrainian national identity. Plast scouts came into being on the eve of World War I on Ukrainian lands in both the Russian and the Austro-Hungarian empires, but it was during the interwar years in western Ukraine (in particular Galicia and Transcarpathia) that they had their greatest success. By 1930, the organization had over 6,000 male and female members in branches affiliated with secondary schools in Galicia and with Prosvita societies in western Volhynia. Concerned by Plast's general popularity and the fact that many of its 'graduates' after age eighteen joined clandestine Ukrainian nationalist organizations, Poland's authorities increased restrictions on the movement until banning it entirely after 1930. It nonetheless continued to operate underground or through other organizations for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe principle of \"numerus clausus\" had been introduced following which the Ukrainians were discriminated when entering the Lviv University (not more than 15% of the applicants' total number, the Poles enjoying not less than the 50% quota at the same time).\n\nThe land reform designed to favour the Poles in Volhynia, where the land question was especially severe, and brought the alienation from the Polish state of even the Orthodox Volhynian population who tended to be much less radical than the Greek Catholic Galicians.\n\nTraditionally, Volhynian Ukrainian peasants had benefited from rights of use in the commons, which in Volhynia meant the right to collect wood from forests owned by nobles. When all land was treated as private property with defined owners, such traditional rights could not be enforced. Forests were cleared, and the lumber sold abroad. Volhynian peasants lost access to what had been a common \"good\", without profiting from its commercialization and sale.\n\nBy 1938 nearly two million acres (some 800,000 hectares) had been redistributed within Ukrainian-inhabited areas. The redistribution did not necessarily help the local Ukrainian population, however. For instance, as early as 1920, 39 percent of the newly allotted land in Volhynia and Polissia (771,000 acres [312,000 hectares]) had been awarded as political patronage to veterans of Poland's 'war for independence,' and in eastern Galicia much land (494,000 acres [200,000 hectares]) had been given to land-hungry Polish peasants from the western provinces of the country. This meant that by the 1930s the number of Poles living within contiguous Ukrainian ethnographic territory had increased by about 300,000.\n\nDuring the interwar period of the 20th century (1920–1939), Lithuanian–Polish relations were characterized by mutual enmity. As a consequence of the conflict over the city of Vilnius, and the Polish–Lithuanian War, both governments – in the era of nationalism which was sweeping through Europe – treated their respective minorities harshly. In 1920, after the staged mutiny of Lucjan Żeligowski, Lithuanian cultural activities in Polish controlled territories were limited and the closure of Lithuanian newspapers and the arrest of their editors occurred. One of them – Mykolas Biržiška was accused of state treason and sentenced to the death penalty and only the direct intervention by the League of Nations saved him from being executed. He was one of 32 Lithuanian and Belarusian cultural activists formally expelled from Vilnius on 20 September 1922 and deported to Lithuania. In 1927, as tensions between Lithuania and Poland increased, 48 additional Lithuanian schools were closed and another 11 Lithuanian activists were deported. Following Piłsudski's death in 1935, the Lithuanian minority in Poland again became an object of Polonization policies with greater intensity. 266 Lithuanian schools were closed after 1936 and almost all Lithuanian organizations were banned. Further Polonization ensued as the government encouraged settlement of Polish army veterans in the disputed regions. About 400 Lithuanian reading rooms and libraries were closed in Poland between 1936 and 1938. Following the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania, Lithuania re-established diplomatic relations with Poland and efforts to Polonize Lithuanians living in Poland decreased somewhat.\n\nDuring Operation Vistula of 1947, the Soviet-controlled Polish communist authorities removed the support base for the Ukrainian Insurgent Army by forcibly resettling about 141,000 civilians residing around Bieszczady and Low Beskids to northern areas of the so-called Recovered Territories awarded by the Allies to Poland in the post-war settlement. The farmers received financial help from the Polish government and took over homes and farms left behind by the displaced Germans, in most cases improving their living conditions due to increased size of the newly reassigned properties, brick buildings, and running water. Dr Zbigniew Palski from IPN explains that identical operation was performed in Ukraine by the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic at exactly the same time. It was dubbed Operation West. Both operations were coordinated from Moscow; however, there was a shocking difference between their outcomes.\n\nWhile Operation Vistula was underway in south-western Poland, the Soviet NKVD deported over 114,000 mostly women and children from West Ukraine to Kazakh SSR and Siberia during parallel Operation West. Only 19,000 men were among the Soviet deportees, most of them sent to coal mines and stone quarries in the north. None of the families deported by the NKVD received any farms or empty homes to live in. They were instantaneously forced into extreme poverty and hunger. Dr Zbigniew Palski informs also that during Operation Vistula none of the three conditions of the United Nations Charter of 26 June 1945 about the possible struggle toward their own self-determination among the Polish deportees was broken at the time. Other international laws were already in effect.\n\n\n"}

It was in response to what he perceived to be a lack of recognition for people who have greatly impacted the lives of LGBTQ Canadians through their dedication to human rights. It is an independent entity and is not associated directly with Qmunity in governance or management. At the inaugural induction ceremony for the Q Hall of Fame, known as Q Ball, Qmunity was the \"selected beneficiary\" of the 2009 proceeds and \"a possible future home of the hall's memorabilia\", however a recent shift in the mandate of the Hall of Fame has amended that. \n\nInductees for the Q Hall of Fame are selected through a public nomination process. Nominees are usually members of the LGBT community themselves, although heterosexual allies who have played prominent roles in the protection or advancement of LGBT equality rights in Canada — such as former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau — may also be honoured. \n\nAt the 2009 induction ceremony, entertainer Robert Kaiser (also known as Joan-E) was the first inductee into the Hall of Fame, and he was followed by Olympic gold medalist Mark Tewksbury, head of the Canadian Drag Court Ted Northe, author and bookseller Janine Fuller and former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, for his role in decriminalising homosexuality in Canada. \n\nHeld every two years, Q Ball was held in Vancouver in 2009, and again in 2011.

Hayakawa\n\nSamuel Ichiye Hayakawa (July 18, 1906 – February 27, 1992) was a Canadian-born American academic and politician of Japanese ancestry. A professor of English, he served as president of San Francisco State University, and then as U.S. Senator from California from 1977 to 1983.\n\nBorn in Vancouver, British Columbia, Hayakawa was educated in the public schools of Calgary, Alberta, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Manitoba in 1927 and graduate degrees in English from McGill University in 1928 and the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1935.\n\nProfessionally, Hayakawa was a linguist, psychologist, semanticist, teacher, and writer. He served as an instructor at the University of Wisconsin from 1936 to 1939 and at the Armour Institute of Technology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) from 1939 to 1948.\n\nHis first book on semantics, \"Language in Thought and Action\", was published in 1949 as an expansion of the earlier work, \"Language in Action\", written since 1938 and published in 1941 to be a Book-of-the-Month Club selection. It is currently in its fifth edition and has greatly helped to popularize Alfred Korzybski's general semantics and semantics in general, while semantics or theory of meaning was overwhelmed by mysticism, propagandism and even scientism. In the preface, Hayakawa cautioned:\n\nIn addition to such motivation, he acknowledged his debt as follows:\n\nHe was a lecturer at the University of Chicago from 1950 to 1955. During this time he presented a talk at the 1954 Conference of Activity Vector Analysts at Lake George, New York, in which he discussed a theory of personality from the semantic point of view. This was later published as \"The Semantic Barrier\". This was a definitive lecture as it discussed the Darwinism of the \"survival of self\" as contrasted with the \"survival of self-concept\". His ideas on general semantics influenced A. E. van Vogt's Null-A novels, \"The World of Null-A\" and \"The Pawns of Null-A\". Van Vogt in \"The World of Null-A\" (i.e., non-Aristotelian) makes Hayakawa a character, introducing him as: \"Professor Hayakawa is today's Mr. Null-A himself, the elected head of the International Society for General Semantics.\"\n\nHayakawa was an English professor at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) from 1955 to 1968. In the early 1960s, he helped organize the \"Anti Digit Dialing League\", a San Francisco group that opposed the introduction of all-digit telephone exchange names. Among the students he trained were commune leader Stephen Gaskin and author Gerald Haslam. He was named acting president of San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) on November 26, 1968, when Ronald Reagan was governor of California and Joseph Alioto was mayor of San Francisco. On July 9, 1969, the California State Colleges Board of Trustees appointed Hayakawa the ninth president of San Francisco State. Hayakawa retired on July 10, 1973.\n\nHayakawa wrote a column for the Register and Tribune Syndicate from 1970 to 1976. In 1973, Hayakawa changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to Republican Party and became president emeritus at what became San Francisco State University.\n\nIn 1968–69, there was a bitter student and Black Panthers strike at San Francisco State University in order to establish an ethnic studies program. It was a major news event at the time and chapter in the radical history of the United States and the Bay Area. The strike was led by the Third World Liberation Front supported by Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Panthers and the countercultural community.\n\nIt proposed fifteen \"non-negotiable demands\", including a Black Studies department chaired by sociologist Nathan Hare independent of the university administration and open admission to all black students to \"put an end to racism\", and the unconditional, immediate end to the War in Vietnam and the university's involvement. It was threatened that if these demands were not immediately and completely satisfied the entire campus was to be forcibly shut down. Hayakawa became popular with conservative voters in this period after he pulled the wires out from the loud speakers on a protesters' van at an outdoor rally. Hayakawa relented on December 6, 1968, and created the first-in-the-nation College of Ethnic Studies\n\nHayakawa won an unexpected victory in the 1976 Republican senate primary over three better-known career politicians including HEW Secretary Robert Finch, long-time Congressman Alphonso Bell, and California Lt. Governor John L. Harmer. Much like Jimmy Carter, Hayakawa touted himself as a political outsider.\nOn the Democratic side, incumbent Senator John Tunney faced a surprisingly strong challenge from another political outsider, Tom Hayden. Hayden's extremely liberal candidacy forced Tunney to run more to the left in the primary, which hurt him in the general election.\n\nNevertheless, Tunney was favored to easily win re-election. Comfortably ahead in the polls, Tunney did not aggressively campaign until the final weeks before the election. But Hayakawa's position as a political outsider was popular in the wake of the Watergate Scandal. In addition, Tunney had a high absenteeism rate while serving in the Senate and missed numerous votes. Hayakawa exploited this with a TV ad that showed an empty chair in the US Senate chamber. Hayakawa gradually closed the gap with Tunney, and ultimately defeated him by just over three percentage points.\n\nDuring his 1976 Senate campaign, he spoke about the proposal to transfer possession of the Panama Canal and Canal Zone from the United States to Panama. Hayakawa said, \"We should keep the Panama Canal. After all, we stole it fair and square.\" However, in 1978 he helped win Senate approval of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which transferred control of the zone and canal to Panama. He also supported a bill that led to the creation of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, which examined the causes and effects of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. During his time in the U.S. Senate, Hayakawa was one of three Japanese Americans in the chamber, the other two being Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, both of Hawaii.\n\nHe planned to run for reelection in 1982 but trailed other Republican candidates badly in early polls and was short on money. He dropped out of the race early in the year and was ultimately succeeded by Republican San Diego mayor Pete Wilson.\n\nHayakawa founded the political lobbying organization U.S. English, which is dedicated to making the English language the official language of the United States. Hayakawa, who lived in Chicago as a Canadian citizen during World War II and was thus not subject to confinement, argued that the internment of Japanese Americans \"eventually worked to their advantage\" and that Japanese Americans should not be paid for \"fulfilling their obligations\" to submit to Executive Order 9066.\n\nHayakawa was a resident of Mill Valley, California, until his death in nearby Greenbrae, in 1992. He was also a member of the Bohemian Club. He had an abiding interest in traditional jazz and wrote extensively on that subject, including several erudite sets of album liner notes. Sometimes in his lectures on semantics, he was joined by the respected traditional jazz pianist Don Ewell, whom Hayakawa employed to demonstrate various points in which he analyzed semantic and musical principles. Hayakawa was often favorite fodder for the news media reporters, every time he was found napping through important legislative voting.\n\nHe was the nephew-in-law of Joseph Stalin, in that his wife Margedant's brother William Wesley Peters was married to Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Freedom of the Press Foundation took over development of DeadDrop under the name \"SecureDrop\", and has since assisted with its installation at several news organizations, including ProPublica, \"The Guardian\", \"The Intercept\", and \"The Washington Post\".\n\nSecureDrop uses the anonymity network Tor to facilitate communication between whistleblowers, journalists, and news organizations. SecureDrop sites are therefore only accessible as hidden services in the Tor network. After a user visits a SecureDrop website, they are given a randomly generated code name. This code name is used to send information to a particular author or editor via uploading. Investigative journalists can contact the whistleblower via SecureDrop messaging. Therefore, the whistleblower must take note of their random code name.\n\nThe system utilizes private, segregated servers that are in the possession of the news organization. Journalists use two USB flash drives and two personal computers to access SecureDrop data. The first personal computer accesses SecureDrop via the Tor network, the journalist uses the first flash drive to download encrypted data from the Internet. The second personal computer does not connect to the Internet, and is wiped during each reboot. The second flash drive contains a decryption code. The first and second flash drives are inserted into the second personal computer, and the material becomes available to the journalist.

In all cases it refers to a land in the East. Originally, it referred to the land south of the Caspian Sea, but it gradually expanded to cover all Islamic lands, including in Africa (and possibly even Muslim Sicily).\n\nNotably one of the Ingvar runestones, the Sö 179, raised circa 1040 at Gripsholm Castle, commemorates a Varangian loss during an ill-fated raid in Serkland.

It has a Designated Collection of national importance.\n\nThe Shipley Art Gallery opened to the public in 1917. This was made possible by a bequest from wealthy local solicitor and art collector, Joseph Ainsley Davidson Shipley (1822–1909).\n\nShipley was a rather enigmatic person about whom little is known. He was born in Gateshead, near High Street. He was a solicitor in the Newcastle firm of Hoyle, Shipley and Hoyle. From 1884 until his death, he leased Saltwell Park House, now known as Saltwell Towers. Shipley’s main passion was art and collecting paintings. He bought his first painting when he was sixteen and by the time he died he had amassed a collection of some 2,500 paintings.\n\nOn his death, Shipley left £30,000 and all his pictures to the City of Newcastle, which was to build a new gallery to house the collection. This was to be known as \"The Shipley Bequest\". His will specifically excluded the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle from benefiting from the bequest, and this clause became the subject of much public discussion, and eventually led to Newcastle's rejection of the bequest. It was only following this that Gateshead Municipal Council was offered the collection. As it was impossible to house all of the paintings, 359 of the pictures recommended by the executors of Shipley's will were selected. A further group was then added by the Gateshead Committee, bringing the total to 504.\n\nIn 1914, after the sale of the remaining paintings, work began on the new art gallery. The building, which was designed by Arthur Stockwell, M.S.A. of Newcastle, opened on 29 November 1917. The stone entrance portico is \"distyle in antis\" – four Corinthian-style stone columns flanked by solid pilasters. These are surmounted by two sculptured figures, one representing the Arts and the other Industry and Learning, by W. Birnie Rhind, R.S.A. of Edinburgh.\n\nPevsner described the art gallery as a \"bold arrangement of a brick central block and lower wings containing galleries\". The building was designated as Grade II listed in 1982.\n\nThe original 504 paintings represented all the main European schools from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Since 1917, the collection has been added to, and now comprises some 10,000 items.\n\nWilliam C. Irving's painting, \"Blaydon Races\" captures the spirit of the traditional Blaydon Races, and takes pride of place at the gallery. The gallery also holds a strong collection of 16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish paintings, as well as 19th century British works, watercolours, prints, drawings and sculpture.\n\nSince 1977 the gallery has become established as a national centre for contemporary craftwork. It has built up one of the best collections outside London, which includes ceramics, wood, metal, glass, textiles and furniture. In 2008, the Shipley opened its \"Designs for Life\" gallery which showcases the gallery's collections of contemporary craft and design. The Gallery also hosts a varied programme of temporary exhibitions and has a strong partnership with the V&A Museum in London.\n\nThe Shipley Art Gallery is managed by Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums on behalf of Gateshead Council.\n\n"}

It is therefore a sub-division of the class of dictionary called a single-field dictionary. Sub-field dictionaries should be contrasted with multi-field dictionaries and single-field dictionaries.\n\nThe typology consisting of these three dictionaries is important for a number of reasons. First of all a sub-field dictionary is an example of a very specialized dictionary in that it covers only a limited part of one single subject field. Examples of sub-field dictionaries are a dictionary of contract law (as opposed to the single-field dictionary of law) and a dictionary of fusion welding (as opposed to a dictionary of welding), or a dictionary of ethical philosophy (as opposed to a dictionary of philosophy).\n\nThe main advantage of sub-field dictionaries is that they can easily be maximizing dictionaries, i.e. deep rather than broad, attempting to cover as many terms of the sub-field as possible without expanding into several volumes. Consequently, sub-field dictionaries are ideal for extensive coverage of the linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within a particular subject field.\n\nSecondly, if the lexicographers intend to make a bilingual, maximizing sub-field dictionary they will not run into the same problems with the space available for presenting the large amount of data that has to be included in the dictionary, cf. a multi-field dictionary.\n\nConsequently, the best coverage of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the subject field covered by a dictionary will be found in a sub-field dictionary. The best coverage of a subject field will then be to compile a number of sub-field dictionaries that together cover the entire subject.\n\n"}

The book's first half chronicles the main character's travels through Outback Australia and his various encounters, while the second half is dedicated to his musings on the nature of man as nomad and settler.\n\nChatwin asserts that language started as song, and in the aboriginal Dreamtime, it sang the land into existence for the conscious mind and memory. As you sing the land, the tree, the rock, the path, they come to be, and the singers are one with them. Chatwin combines evidence from Aboriginal culture with modern ideas on human evolution, and argues that on the African Savannah, we were a migratory species hunted by a dominant feline predator. Our wanderings spread \"songlines\" across the globe (generally from southwest to northeast), eventually reaching Australia, where they are now preserved in the world's oldest living culture.\n\nSometimes defined as a travelogue, the text has been criticised for being masculist, colonialist, simplistic and unreliable as both a source on European Australians and Aboriginal culture. Other critics have praised it, and Chatwin in the book is vehemently opposed to the image of the inferiority of the Aboriginals; others also see the author as a proponent of postmodern writing, challenging traditional forms of linear narrative.\n\nThe character Arkady refers to Australia as \"the country of lost children\". This was used as the title for Peter Pierce's 1999 book \"The Country of Lost Children: An Australian Anxiety\".\n\n"}

His ten books include \"The Panama Hat Trail\", \"On the Border\", \"Trading with the Enemy\", and \"Jack Ruby's Kitchen Sink\" (later rereleased as \"Revenge of the Saguaro\"). He has written articles for the \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\", \"The New Yorker\", \"The Smithsonian\", \"Natural History\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"Life\", \"Crawdaddy\" and many other magazines.\n\nMiller's childhood was full of reading. The family read three newspapers daily, and the bookshelves of his home were always full. His earliest travels were to Camp Catawba, a summer boys' camp in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. He wrote for his high school newspaper, and by his fifth and final semester of college, was editor-in-chief of the school's weekly paper. But this was the late 1960s, and the underground, anti-war press had for him a cultural and political appeal the college presses lacked. He continued through the early 1970s editing and writing underground pamphlets, papers, and flyers.\n\nIn 1969 he moved to Tucson, Arizona. He tried working odd jobs—selling encyclopedias door-to-door and working as a janitor, both jobs lasting four weeks—but focused on living cheaply and writing for whatever money he could earn. In the late sixties and early 1970s Miller continued to write for underground and alternative periodicals such as the Austin Rag, the Washington Free Press, Dallas Notes, Dallas Iconoclast, the Albuquerque Current, Liberation News Service, the Liberated Guardian, and many other outlets. He soon wrote for “sea level” publications, as his colleague Andrew Kopkind called them – Fusion, Creem, Rolling Stone, and the like. His first break would come after writing a short piece for \"SunDance\" magazine that an editor at \"Esquire\" happened to read. He had been paid $15 to write the article; the editor suggested his magazine would have paid $750 for the same work. Soon he would find his first mainstream work with them.\n\nIn 1971 the Internal Security Division of the U.S. Justice Department probing the anti-Vietnam war protests, subpoenaed Miller to testify before a grand jury. He refused to enter the grand jury room, claiming First Amendment rights that as a journalist, even free-lance for the underground press, to testify in secret would place a cloak of suspicion over him and affect his ability to gather news. Many journalists wrote affidavits on his behalf. US District Court Judge William Frey ruled on Miller’s behalf, stating that Miller “appears to be a member of the group about which he reports rather than an objective reporter. He occupies a dual capacity. However…” The Justice Department appealed the decision and refused to state its reason for subpoenaing Miller. Eventually the grand jury expired and the case ended with Miller free and clear of its purpose.\n\nAn offbeat 1975 article Miller wrote for \"Crawdaddy\" about the Kennedy Assassination was read by a literary agent who insisted it could be expanded into a full-length book. This became \"The Assassination Please Almanac\", his first book, whose cover blurb called it \"a consumer's guide to conspiracy theories.\"\n\nLife on the southern U.S. border inspired his first travel book: \"On the Border: Portraits of America's Southwestern Frontier.\" He travelled the full 2,000 mile length of the United States–Mexico border interviewing its denizens. The book was published in 1981. For approximately six years (1979-1985) Miller worked as a stringer for the National Desk of the New York Times, filing stories on conflict and culture in the Southwest borderlands.\n\nHis 1986 travelogue, \"The Panama Hat Trail\" follows the making and marketing of a (misnomered) Panama hat from the straw fields of Ecuador and its weaving by Indian peasants, to its finishing in a North American hat factory, and finally to a customer in a San Diego retail hat shop.\n\nHis book \"Jack Ruby’s Kitchen Sink: Offbeat Portraits of America’s Southwest\", won the 2000 Lowell Thomas Award for \"Best Travel Book of the Year,\" given by the Society of American Travel Writers Foundation (The book was later retitled \"Revenge of the Saguaro\").\n\nIn 1987 he first visited Cuba and moved to that Caribbean Island for eight months in the summer of 1990. In 1992 his experiences there became the book, \"Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba.\" He wrote many articles about Cuba for a wide range of publications. As co-founder and co-director of Writers of the Americas (2000-2002) Miller arranged for approximately 15 American writers to mix with a like number of Cuban writers in Havana in somewhat of a literary détente. In 2008 he began leading annual one-week Literary Havana tours, introducing Americans to Cuba’s literary personalities and activities.\n\nMiller conceived and edited the book \"How I Learned English: 55 Accomplished Latinos Recall Lessons in Language and Life,\" published simultaneously in Spanish in 2007.\n\nHe has also edited anthologies about Cuba and the Mexican border and was a major contributor to the 4-volume \"Encyclopedia Latina\". His collection of over 80 versions of La Bamba led to his Rhino Records compilation \"The Best of La Bamba\".\n\nThe University of Arizona Library acquired Miller's archives and in 2004 mounted a major exhibit of his papers. He has served as adjunct research associate at the University of Arizona’s Latin American Area Center since 1990, and resides in Tucson with his wife, Regla Albarrán. In 2008 the City of Quito, at a public ceremony in its Centro Historico, proclaimed Miller “Un Huésped Ilustre” (An Illustrious Guest) for his literary contributions to Ecuador. Miller is a member of the Thornton Wilder Society and the Cervantes Society of America, as well as The Authors Guild. One of Miller's siblings is Charles A. Miller (1937), Professor Emeritus of Politics and American Studies, Lake Forest College.\n\nIn 2015 he was a guest travel writing workshop leader at the Port Townsend (Washington) Writers Conference.\n\nIn 2016, the Cultural Ministry of Mexico selected \"Revenge of the Saguaro: Portraits of America’s Southwestern Frontier\" to be translated into Spanish by the Trilce Publishing Company.\n\nIn addition to leading land-based study tours of Cuba, in 2017 Miller was the on-board lecturer on the Sea Mist, a 200 passenger cruise ship that circumnavigated the island, stopping at various port cities during the ten day journey.\n\nIn the fall of 2017 a Festschrift (literary tribute) was published in Miller’s honor, with essays about his work and writing style.\n\nMiller was the focus of a panel entitled “Tom Miller, Hot and Cold” at the 2018 Tucson Festival of Books.\n\n\"Great travel writing consists of equal parts curiosity, vulnerability and vocabulary. It is not a terrain for know-it-alls or the indecisive. The best of the genre can simply be an elegant natural history essay, a nicely writ sports piece, or a well-turned profile of a bar band and its music. A well-grounded sense of place is the challenge for the writer. We observe, we calculate, we inquire, we look for a link between what we already know and what we're about to learn. The finest travel writing describes what's going on when nobody's looking.\" \n\n\"No camera, no recording device, no laptop, none of this palm pilot nonsense or a cell phone. Paper and pencil, a book, maybe a bilingual dictionary. Anything beyond that (a) can be stolen, and (b) intimidates people you encounter. The more double-A batteries you carry, the more you distance yourself from the people you're writing about.\"\n\n\n\"A Sense of Place: Great Travel Writers Talk About Their Craft, Lives, and Inspiration\", by Michael Shapiro, pp. 325–343.\n\n"}

Western culture has an idea of the importance of law which has its roots in both Roman law and canon law. As Western culture has a Graeco-Roman Classical and Renaissance cultural influence, so does its legal systems.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Justinian Code in the early 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. Eventually, it was only in the Catholic or Frankish west, that Roman law became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence can be traced to this day in all Western legal systems (although in different manners and to different extents in the common (Anglo-American) and the civil (continental European) legal traditions). \n\nThe study of canon law, the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship. The ideas of civil rights, equality before the law, equality of women, procedural justice, and democracy as the ideal form of society, and were principles which formed the basis of modern Western culture. \n\nWestern legal culture is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include corporations, contracts, estates, rights and powers to name a few. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures. \n\nAs a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on language and symbols and any attempt to analyse non western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language. So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group's culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level. Basically the latter group represents primacy of prejudices, myths and taboo as viable means to conduct human society.\n\n"}

He edited the Brotherhood's literary magazine \"The Germ\" which published four issues in 1850 and wrote the poetry reviews for it.\n\nIt was William Michael Rossetti who recorded the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at their founding meeting in September 1848:\n\n\nAlthough Rossetti worked full-time as a civil servant, he maintained a prolific output of criticism and biography across a range of interests from Algernon Swinburne to James McNeill Whistler. He edited the diaries of his maternal uncle John William Polidori (author of \"The Vampyre\" and physician to Lord Byron), a comprehensive biography of D. G. Rossetti, and edited the collected works of D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti.\n\nRossetti edited the first British edition of the poetry of Walt Whitman, which was published in 1868; however, this edition was bowdlerized.\nAnne Gilchrist, who became one of the first to write about Whitman, first read his poetry from Rossetti's edition, and Rossetti helped initiate their correspondence.\n\nIn 1874 he married Lucy Madox Brown, daughter of the painter Ford Madox Brown. They honeymooned in France and Italy. Their first child, Olivia Frances Madox, was born in September 1875, and her birth was celebrated in an ode of Swinburne's. A son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by another daughter, Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Their son Michael died in infancy. Rossetti and his wife did not have the children baptized, nor were they raised in a Christian household. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of Ezra Pound, and the two corresponded frequently.\n\nGabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904.\n\nWilliam Michael Rossetti was a major contributor to the 1911 edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"; his contributions on artistic subjects were criticised by many reviewers at the time and since, as showing little evidence of having absorbed the mounting body of work by academic art historians, mostly writing in German. Below is a quotation from his article on Fra Angelico demonstrating his literary and art-historical style.\n\nThe \"pietistic\" quality of Fra Angelico's work is in fact its predominant characteristic. The faces of his figures have an air of rapt suavity, devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is intensely attractive to some minds ... the faces becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; because of this, there are some who are not moved by his work. Even so, Fra Angelico is a notable artist within his sphere... . \n\n\n\n"}
