She spent her career at Oxford University, where she was the Professor of Comparative Philology.\n\nAnna Elbina Morpurgo was born in Milan, the fourth child of a Jewish family. Her grandfather Guido Castelnuovo was a mathematician; her father, Augusto Morpurgo, was dismissed in 1938 under the Fascist racial laws and died the following year after trying to find a way to take his family to Argentina. She and her mother moved to Rome, where they survived with false papers and in hiding.\n\nAfter the war, she earned her doctorate in classics from the University of Rome with a thesis on Linear B; she published the first lexicon of the language.\n\nIn 1961 she became a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University's Center for Hellenic Studies in Rome, where she formed a deep interest in theoretical linguistics; she was later to help establish a chair in the subject at Oxford University. She moved to Oxford in 1962, became a lecturer in Classical Philology in 1964, and spent the remainder of her career there with the exception of guest teaching at various institutions in the United States.\n\nIn 1966 Morpurgo Davies became a fellow of St Hilda’s College; in 1971 she was appointed to the Chair in Comparative Philology and became a fellow of Somerville. In 2003 this became the Diebold Chair. She was also a Delegate of the Oxford University Press from 1992 to 2004, when she retired.\n\nMorpurgo Davies published in many areas of Indo-European grammar. She was particularly known as an expert in the Anatolian languages, and was one of the decipherers of Luwian hieroglyphs.

It is native to the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, and is found from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and the southern side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence south to North Carolina. The fish is one of the largest skates found in the North Atlantic Ocean, reaching lengths up to . It is carnivorous, feeding on invertebrates and other fish found near the sea floor.\n\nAfter peaking in the 1950s, the population of the barndoor skate dramatically declined in the 1960s and early 1970s as a result of overfishing. In 2003, it was listed as endangered by the World Conservation Union. Barndoor skate populations have increased substantially since 1990. In most cases, the barndoor skate is not intentionally harvested by the commercial fishing industry—it is usually considered bycatch in the trawling nets used to target other species of fish.\n\nThe barndoor skate is a flat-bodied fish with a large, disk-like body with sharply angled corners and a pointed snout. Its pectoral fins have evolved into broad, flat, wing-like appendages used to propel the fish through the water. These fins have a concave front edge with rounded posterior corners. Like sharks, it has a boneless skeleton made of cartilage, a tough, elastic substance composed of collagenous and/or elastic fibers, cells, and a firm, gel-like substance called the matrix. It has slot-like body openings called gill slits on the underside of the body beneath the pectoral fins that lead from the gills. The dorsal fins are close together and far removed from the tail. It has two eyes on its dorsal surface, located about apart.\n\nThe fish's upper surface is brown to reddish brown with many scattered darker spots, lighter streaks, and reticulations. The center of each pectoral fin is marked with an oval spot or blotch. The lower surface is light, white to grey, blotched irregularly with gray spots. The barndoor skate is unique from other species of skate in its having a straight line that begins at the snout and ends at the anterior margin of the outer corner of the disk, but stopping short of the disk.\n\nThe barndoor skate is one of the largest skates found in the North Atlantic Ocean. It can reach lengths of up to and can weigh up to . There have been unconfirmed reports of individuals reaching lengths of . A barndoor skate typically weighs .\n\nThe tail is moderately short and does not have large, thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates found in the western Atlantic. Larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles on the tail, and mature females also possess denticles on the head and shoulders, and along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.\n\nThe barndoor skate occurs in a range extending from the banks of Newfoundland, the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, and along the northeastern coast and offshore banks of Nova Scotia south to North Carolina. Reports in the 19th century said the range of the fish extended as far south as northeastern Florida, but more recent research suggests that the Florida discoveries may have actually been a misidentification of \"R. floridana\". It is found on various types of ocean bottoms, including soft muddy, sandy, and rocky bottoms. It can be found from the shoreline to depths to , although it is most commonly found at depths less than . It inhabits waters in a broad range of temperatures, from just above freezing to . It appears to move closer to shore in the autumn and further out to sea in the warmer months. It tolerates brackish water where the salinity is as low as 21 to 24 parts per thousand, but it prefers salinity between 31 and 35 parts per thousand. It is believed to not exhibit any north-south migratory patterns.\n\nThe fish is carnivorous, with its prey consisting mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals have been found with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.\n\nThe barndoor skate is one of five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (\"Leucoraja ocellata\") and the thorny skate (\"Amblyraja radiata\"). The barndoor skate is most commonly considered bycatch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, and pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skates is prohibited in the United States.\n\nAbundances of barndoor skate dropped precipitously in the 1960s and early 1970s, coinciding with the period of intense fishing by foreign factory trawlers. The abundance remained very low through around 1990, but increased nearly exponentially from 1990–2005, and have been approaching the levels observed in the 1960s. In 1998, Casey and Myers published a controversial study claiming that barndoor skate was nearly extinct. However, they only presented data through 1993, so the recovery that started in the early 1990s was not clearly evident. In 1999, two conservation groups, GreenWorld, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Center for Marine Conservation, based in Washington, DC, petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to have the barndoor skate listed under the Endangered Species Act. After a 12-month study, the NMFS announced in 2002 that listing the species as endangered or threatened was not warranted. It cited increases in abundance and biomass of barndoor skate observed during surveys since 1993, which had become quite rapid by that time. In 1994, the World Conservation Union had listed the barndoor skate as \"vulnerable\" under the 1994 Categories and Criteria, but in 2003, it reassessed the species as \"endangered\" on the IUCN Red List.\n\nEach year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates current population levels for a variety of aquatic species of special interest, and releases an annual report showing the progress being made to reduce harvesting of overfished species. When a species has been determined to be either overfished or subject to overfishing, the regional fishery management councils are required to develop a plan to correct the problem. In 2006, NOAA published a press release stating that as a result of conservation efforts, between 2004 and 2005, monitored stocks of the barndoor skate had grown to a level that the NOAA no longer considers \"overfished\".\n\nThe fish was originally described as \"Raja laevis\" by Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1818. The scientific name was later changed to the currently valid name \"Dipturus laevis\". It has also been misidentified as \"Raia granulata\" by Theodore Gill, an American ichthyologist, in 1879. The genus name, Dipturus, is derived from the Greek words \"di\", meaning two, and \"pteryx\", meaning wing. \"Raja\", the original genus which was coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is still recognized as a valid subgenus.\n\n\n"}

Since March 19, 2008 the name of the project is Sichtbares Zeichen gegen Flucht und Vertreibung. \n\nThe project was initiated by the Federation of Expellees, who dedicated a \"Foundation Centre Against Expulsions\" to the centre. This foundation is based in Wiesbaden, and headed by CDU politician and president of the Federation of Expellees, Erika Steinbach. The other head of the foundation was SPD politician Peter Glotz who died in 2005.\n\nSince late 2008, the project is forwarded by the Federal Republic of Germany, when the federal government and parliament passed a law calling for the constitution of a \"Foundation German Historical Museum\" subordinate to the federal government, which in turn shall hold a \"Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation\" which shall take on the actual documentation in Berlin. The project has been subject to criticism, especially in Poland.\n\nThe Federation of Expellees ( is the German non-governmental head organization of various organized groups of German refugees and expellees. The federation is committed to document the post- World War II flight and expulsion of Germans as well as other forced displacements, and maintains an exhibition for this purpose shown in changing locations of Germany. To expand this exhibition and to find a permanent place for it, the Federation of Expellees set up the \"Foundation Centre Against Expulsions\" () on 6 September 2000.\n\nThe foundation Centre Against Expulsions defines four objectives:\n\n\nOn 11 November 2005, the largest German political parties SPD and CDU signed a coalition. One stated goal of the coalition is the establishment of a centre termed \"Visible Sign\" ().\n\nOn 3 September 2008 the German federal government passed a law calling for the establishment of a center against expulsions in the \"Deutschlandhaus\" building of the Anhalter Bahnhof site in Berlin-Kreuzberg. The law passed the German parliament and was enacted on 29 December 2008. The center is to be run by a \"Foundation Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation\" () subordinate to the governmental \"Foundation German Historical Museum\" ().\n\nThe purpose of this foundation is stated in §16 of the above-mentioned law as follows:\n\n(1) The purpose of the non-autonomous foundation is to ensure in the spirit of reconciliation the remembrance of flight and expulsion in the 20th century in the historical context of the Second World War and the Nazi expansion and extermination policy and their aftermaths.\n\n(2) This purpose shall be fulfilled especially by the following measures:\n\nThe scientific advisory board includes or included Jörg Baberowski, Arnulf Baring, Peter Becher, Lothar Gall, Bernhard Graf, Helga Hirsch, Walter Homolka, Eckart Klein, Hilmar Kopper, Rudolf Kucera, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, Horst Möller, Christoph Pan, Rüdiger Safranski, Christoph Stölzl, Christian Tomuschat, Krisztián Ungváry, Georg Wildmann, Michael Wolffsohn, Alfred-Maurice de Zayas and Zoran Ziletic.\n\nThe United Nations' first High Commissioner for Human Rights Dr. José Ayala Lasso, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Nobel literature laureate and Holocaust survivor Imre Kertész, Joachim Gauck, Milan Horáček, former Austrian crown prince Otto von Habsburg, and historians such as Guido Knopp, Hungarian novelist György Konrád, and Christian Tomuschat, have also voiced their support for the centre.\n\nIn a petition initiated by Hans Henning Hahn, Eva Hahn, Alexandra Kurth, Samuel Salzborn and Tobias Weger in 2003, signed by several hundred people, primarily German, Czech, and Polish historians, opponents of the proposed form of Centre expressed concerns the centre would \"establish and popularize a one-sided image of the past, without historical context\", and see the dangers of \"de-contexualizing the past\" and \"ethnification of social conflicts\". German-Jewish writer Ralph Giordano withdrew his initial support for the same reason, but defended Steinbach against the latest personal accusations from Poland, which he called defamation. Former German Foreign minister Joschka Fischer said \"This can't be a museum of German war victims. Germans can't point fingers at others\".\n\nCritics in Poland oppose the idea of the centre claiming that it would equate German suffering with that of the Jews and Poles and will suggest a moral equivalence between the victims of war and their oppressors. Marek Edelman, the last living leader of Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, criticized the project as nationalistic, arrogant and serving to realize political ambitions of the backers of the project. According to Edelman other nations subject to German expulsions didn't establish any comparable monuments, even as they faced a harsher fate than Germans.\n\nThe Polish government opposes the involvement of Erika Steinbach in any issues related to Polish-German history and at the same time supports an international net of centers dedicated to remembrance of totalitarian regimes and their victims called \"European Network Remembrance and Solidarity\".\n\n\n"}

It is currently on a third version, the CCMD-3, written in Chinese and English. It is intentionally similar in structure and categorisation to the ICD and DSM, the two most well-known diagnostic manuals, though includes some variations on their main diagnoses and around 40 culturally related diagnoses.\n\nThe first published Chinese psychiatric classificatory scheme appeared in 1979. A revised classification system, the CCMD-1, was made available in 1981 and further modified in 1984 (CCMD-2-R). The CCMD-3 was published in 2001.\n\nMany Chinese psychiatrists believed the CCMD had special advantages over other manuals, such as simplicity, stability, the inclusion of culture-distinctive categories, and the exclusion of certain Western diagnostic categories. The Chinese translation of the ICD-10 was seen as linguistically complicated, containing very long sentences and awkward terms and syntax (Lee, 2001).\n\nThe diagnosis of depression is included in the CCMD, with many similar criteria to the ICD or DSM, with the core having been translated as 'low spirits'. However, Neurasthenia is a more central diagnosis. Although also found in the ICD, its diagnosis takes a particular form in China, called 'shenjing shuairuo', which emphasizes somatic (bodily) complaints as well as fatigue or depressed feelings. Neurasthenia is a less stigmatizing diagnosis than depression in China, being conceptually distinct from psychiatric labels, and is said to fit well with a tendency to express emotional issues in somatic terms. The concept of neurasthenia as a nervous system disorder is also said to fit well with the traditional Chinese epistemology of disease causation on the basis of disharmony of vital organs and imbalance of qi.\n\nThe diagnosis of schizophrenia is included in the CCMD. It is applied quite readily and broadly in Chinese psychiatry.\n\nSome of the wordings of the diagnosis are different, for example rather than borderline personality disorder as in the DSM, or emotionally unstable personality disorder (borderline type) as in the ICD, the CCMD has impulsive personality disorder.\n\nDiagnoses that are more specific to Chinese or Asian culture, though they may also be outlined in the ICD (or DSM glossary section), include:\n\n\nThe CCMD-3 lists several \"disorders of sexual preference\" including ego-dystonic homosexuality, but does not recognize pedophilia.\n\nKoro or Genital retraction syndrome is a culture-specific syndrome from Southeast Asia in which the patient has an overpowering belief that the genitalia (or nipples in females) is shrinking and will shortly disappear. In China, it is known as shuk yang, shook yong, and suo yang (simplified Chinese: 缩阳; traditional Chinese: 縮陽). This has been associated with cultures placing a heavy emphasis on balance, or on fertility and reproduction.\n\nZou huo ru mo () or \"qigong deviation\" () is a mental condition characterized by the perception that there is uncontrolled flow of qi in the body. Other complaints include localized pains, headache, insomnia, and uncontrolled spontaneous movements.\n\n\n\n"}

The benefits of email archiving include the recovery of lost or accidentally deleted emails, accelerated audit response, preservation of the intellectual property contained in business email and its attachments and \"eDiscovery\" in the case of litigation or internal investigations (what happened when, who said what).\n\nEmail Archiving is the process of capturing, preserving, and making easily searchable all email traffic to and from a given individual, organization, or service. Email archiving solutions capture email content either directly from the email server itself (journaling) or during message transit. The email archive can then be stored on magnetic tape, disk arrays, or now more often than not, in the cloud. Regardless of the location of the email archive, it gets indexed in order to speed future searches, and most archive vendors provide a search UI to simplify query construction.\n\nIn addition to email, attachments and associated metadata, some email archiving applications can also archive additional aspects of a mailbox including public folders, .pst files, calendars, contacts, notes, instant messages and context.\n\nThere are many motivations for enterprises or end-users to invest in an Email Archiving solution, including:\n\nAs enterprises of all sizes grow more reliant on email, the business value of that content is also growing. To protect this increasingly valuable information (\"intellectual property\"), numerous standards and regulations have been enacted to require records protection and retention as well as timely response to legal (discovery) and information (FOIA) requests. Modern email archiving solutions allow companies to meet regulatory requirements or corporate policies by securing and preserving data and providing flexible data management policies to enable authorized users to enact 'legal holds', set retention and purge policies, or conduct searches across multiple mailboxes to complete various inquiries.\n\nSome of the primary compliance requirements driving the need for secure email archiving are (\"alphabetically\"):\n\nCanada\nGermany\nSwitzerland\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\n\nNote, that many of the compliance regulations require the preservation of \"electronic business communications\" which consist of not only email, but may include instant messaging, file attachments, Bloomberg Messaging, Reuters Messaging, PIN-to-PIN and SMS text messages, VoIP and other electronic messaging communications used in business.\n\nFor legal discovery, email archiving solutions will lower the overall risk of spoliation and greatly speed up electronic discovery. This is because messages are indexed, audit trails are provided, messages are deduplicated, and legal hold/preservation can be applied. For litigation support, email can be retrieved quickly and a history of the email exists to prove its authenticity for chain of custody. For compliance support, email records are stored in the archive according to administrator defined retention policies. When retention periods expire, email is automatically deleted by the archiving application. In order to be compliant, an organization can intentionally destroy email messages, so long as (1) the destruction is done pursuant to a stated company policy and (2) the destruction stops immediately if an incident occurs which could give rise to a lawsuit.\n\nIf an organization has multiple separate applications, for example for e-discovery, records information management, and email archiving, each application may have a separate database and it becomes difficult to de-duplicate messages and ensure that a single retention policy is being applied. From a legal point of view, this is important because once retention periods have expired the message should be purged from the archive. Messages that are not purged are still discoverable, should litigation arise at a later date. As such, without a unified archive it is difficult to ensure one single retention policy. This problem is magnified for large organizations that manage tens of millions of emails per day.\n\nWithout email archiving, email likely exists on some combination of backup tapes and on end users’ local workstations. If a specific email needs to be found for an internal investigation or in response to litigation, it can take weeks to find and costs a great deal. With today’s legal discovery rules (see FRCP: https://web.archive.org/web/20141021110256/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/EDiscovery_w_Notes.pdf) and compliance legislations, it has become necessary for IT departments to centrally manage and archive their organization’s email, so email can be searched and found in minutes; not days or weeks.\n\nEmail is the lifeblood of many modern businesses, and enterprises today depend more on reliable email service. Virtually all enterprises implement a messaging infrastructure to connect workers and enable business processes. In the e-commerce arena, employees may require access to email to close sales and manage accounts. These employees, plus many others, may choose to keep their emails indefinitely, but some organizations may mandate that emails more than 90 days old be deleted. Setting these kinds of retention policies deserves careful consideration as a single email could help a company win a lawsuit or avoid litigation altogether. Email archiving can also be used for business continuity at the individual employee level. When one employee quits, his/her replacement can be given access to the departed employee's archived messages in order to preserve correspondence records, and enable accelerated on-boarding.\n\nAs part of a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, an email archive can be instrumental in an organization's effort to \"get back to business\". An offsite, online archive means that secondary facilities can spin up messaging servers and quickly get access to the last mails sent/received as well as all historical messaging data. Offsite archives can take the form of disk farms (SANs) in distant DR facilities or email archives stored in public/private cloud environments. Although email archiving products do capture and copy all messages, they are not mirrored copies of the messaging server itself, and therefore cannot help recreate user accounts/groups in the event of a disaster.\n\nEvery email message takes up space on an email system's hard drive or some other permanent storage device (e.g. Network Attached Storage, Storage Area Network, etc.). As the number of these messages increase, simple operations such as retrieving, searching, indexing, backup, etc. utilize more information system resources. At some point older data must be removed from the production email system so that they can maintain a level of performance for their primary use, exchange of email messages. Email archiving solutions improve email server performance and storage efficiency by removing email and attachments from the messaging server based on administrator defined policies. Archived email and attachments remain accessible to end users via the existing email client applications.\n\n\n\n"}

The applicant did not agree with this decision and so launched series of unsuccessful applications to prevent the child being given up for adoption, and to be given custody of his child. He was denied this opportunity, as section 18(4)(d) of the Child Care Act only required the consent of the mother to give up children born out of wedlock for adoption.\n\nThe court declared this to be unconstitutional, as it discriminated against fathers of children born out of wedlock on the basis of their gender.

{"id": "14508809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14508809", "title": "History by Contract", "text": "History by Contract\n\nHistory by Contract is a book by early aviation researchers Major William J. O'Dwyer, U.S. Air Force Reserve (ret.) and Stella Randolph about aviation pioneer Gustave Whitehead. The book focuses on an agreement between the Smithsonian Institution and the estate of Orville Wright, which stipulates that the Smithsonian, as a condition of owning and displaying the 1903 Wright Flyer, must recognize and label it as the first heavier-than-air machine to make a manned, powered, controlled and sustained flight.\n\nThe authors of the book offer evidence which they assert shows that the Smithsonian deliberately ignored Whitehead's aeronautical work in order not to violate the agreement with the Wright estate.\nThe net result, they allege, made Whitehead a virtual nonentity in aviation history.\" They and other researchers argue that Whitehead made the first successful airplane flight in August 1901, predating the Wright brothers by more than two years. \"History By Contract\" reviews evidence and material available in two earlier books about Whitehead by Randolph and added statements and affidavits from self-described witnesses to Whitehead flights.\n\nO'Dwyer alleged that secrecy and denial by the Smithsonian kept the agreement with the Wright estate from public knowledge for years. He obtained a copy of the agreement in 1976 with help of then-Senator Lowell Weicker. The Smithsonian has said the agreement was put in place not to hide Whitehead's aviation experiments, but to prevent re-occurrence of a mistaken emphasis by the Smithsonian on the 1903 Langley Aerodrome, which the Institution wrongly identified for years as the first airplane \"capable\" of flight, even though it had not actually flown when Langley's workers tested it. The Smithsonian based its claim on test flights of the heavily modified Aerodrome in 1914 by Glenn Curtiss and his team.\n\nThe \"contract\" of the book title refers to the agreement between the estate of Orville Wright and the United States, represented by the Smithsonian Institution. The agreement, dated 23 November 1948, stipulated:\n\nThe most controversial clause in the agreement is Paragraph 2(d):\n\"Neither the Smithsonian Institution or its successors nor any museum or other agency, bureau or facilities, administered for the United States of America by the Smithsonian Institution or its successors, shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the Wright Aeroplane of 1903, claiming In effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight.\"\n\nO'Dwyer and Randolph asserted this clause presents a strong incentive to keep the Smithsonian from officially recognizing any manned, powered, controlled airplane flight before that of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903.\n\nThe agreement ended a bitter feud that existed between Orville Wright and the Smithsonian over credit for developing the first man-carrying airplane to achieve controlled, sustained powered flight. After short test flights of the heavily modified Langley Aerodrome by Glenn Curtiss in 1914, the Smithsonian claimed that the Aerodrome, created by former Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Langley and unsuccessfully tested shortly before the 1903 Kitty Hawk flights, was \"the first man-carrying airplane in the history of the world capable of sustained free flight,\" according to the plaque displayed with the Aerodrome. Orville believed that claim \"perverted\" the history of flying machines and refused to donate the 1903 Kitty Hawk Flyer to the Smithsonian, loaning it instead to the Science Museum, London in 1928. When the Smithsonian recanted its claim in 1942, Orville agreed to have the Flyer returned to the United States. The airplane remained in protective storage in Britain during World War II and was not returned to the U.S. until 1948, when the agreement was signed by Orville Wright's executors following his death.\n\nCritics of the agreement contend that it is a conflict of interest that continues to interfere with the Smithsonian's willingness to research and recognize anyone who might have made successful powered flights before December 17, 1903.\n\nThe controversy reignited in 2013 when \"Jane's All the World's Aircraft\" editorialized that Whitehead, not the Wright brothers, was first to make a successful airplane flight. A month later, however, Jane's stated that the editorial reflected the opinion of the editorialist and not Jane's.\n\nIn response to resulting negative publicity about the agreement, National Air and Space Museum senior curator Tom Crouch issued a statement, which said: \"The contract remains in force today, a healthy reminder of a less than exemplary moment in Smithsonian history. Over the years individuals who argue for other claimants to the honor of having made the first flight have claimed that the contract is secret. It is not. I have sent many copies upon request. Critics have also charged that no Smithsonian staff member would ever be willing to entertain such a possibility and risk losing a national treasure. I can only hope that, should persuasive evidence\nfor a prior flight be presented, my colleagues and I would have the courage and the honesty to admit the new evidence and risk the loss of the Wright Flyer.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "471819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=471819", "title": "Ichthys", "text": "Ichthys\n\nThe ichthys or ichthus (), from the Greek \"ikhthýs\" ( 1st cent. AD Koine Greek , \"fish\") is a symbol consisting of two intersecting arcs, the ends of the right side extending beyond the meeting point so as to resemble the profile of a fish. The symbol was adopted by early Christians as a secret symbol. It is now known colloquially as the \"sign of the fish\" or the \"Jesus fish\".\n\nThe first appearances of the ichthys symbol in Christian art and literature date to the 2nd century AD. The symbol's use among Christians had become popular by the late 2nd century, and its use spread widely in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The symbolism of the fish itself may have its origins in pre-Christian religious imagery. For example, Orpheus was described as a \"fisher of men\" as early as the 3rd or fourth century BC. The fish was used as a symbol in a number of other near-eastern religions as well, often as a sacred (or taboo) food. The fish was sacred to the goddess Atargatis, for example, who was said to cause tumors in those who ate them. Fish were only allowed to be eaten by priests during rituals devoted to Atargatis, in the belief that they represented her body. Despite the thematic similarities of these various sacred fish, some scholars have argued that there is no direct link between them and the Christian symbol or practice of the Eucharist; instead, the Christian usage was probably simply part of a larger, popular religious motif of the time.\nIn the early Church, the Ichthys symbol held \"the most sacred significance\", and Christians used it to recognize churches and other believers through this symbol because they were persecuted by the Roman Empire. The Ichthys symbol is also a reference to \"the Holy Eucharist, with which the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes had such intimate connection both in point of time and significance.\" While many Christians hang a cross necklace or rosary inside their vehicles, \"the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian—significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see\".\n\n (), or also with a lunate sigma, is an acronym or acrostic for \"\" (; contemporary Koine ), which translates into English as 'Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour'.\n\nThis explanation is given among others by Augustine in his Civitate Dei, where he notes that the generating sentence \"\" has 27 letters, i.e. 3 x 3 x 3, which in that age indicated power. (This suggestion is obviously spurious, resulting from Augustine's ignorance of Greek.) Augustine quotes also an ancient text from the Sibylline oracles whose verses are an acrostic of the generating sentence. \n\nThe statement \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour\" affirmed the belief of early Christians in the twofold nature, of Jesus Christ being both fully human and fully divine. The belief in Jesus Christ being true Man and true God completes the Most Holy Trinity, that is the basic article of the Christian faith.\n\nA fourth century A.D. adaptation of \"ichthys\" as a wheel contains the letters superimposed such that the result resembles an eight-spoked wheel.\n\nFish are mentioned and given symbolic meaning several times in the Gospels. Several of Jesus' 12 Apostles were fishermen. He commissions them with the words \"I will make you fishers of men\". (Mark 1: 16-18)\n\nHaving been resurrected, Jesus is offered some grilled fish in Luke 24:41-43.\n\nAt the feeding of the five thousand, a boy is brought to Jesus with \"five small loaves and two fish\". The question is asked, \"But what are they, among so many?\" Jesus multiplies the loaves and fish to feed the multitude. In Matthew 13:47-50, the Parable of Drawing in the Net, Jesus compares the angels separating the righteous from the wicked at the end of this world to fishers sorting out their catch, keeping the good fish and throwing the bad fish away. In John 21:11, it is related that the disciples fished all night but caught nothing. Jesus instructed them to cast the nets on the other side of the boat, and they drew in 153 fish. In Matthew 17:24-27, upon being asked if his Teacher pays the temple (or two-drachma) tax, Simon Peter answers yes. Christ tells Peter to go to the water and cast a line, saying that a coin sufficient for both of them will be found in the fish's mouth. Peter does this and finds the coin.\n\nThe fish is also used by Jesus to describe \"the Sign of Jonah\". (Matthew 12:38-45) This is symbolic of Jesus's resurrection, upon which the entire Christian faith is based. (1 Corinthians 15:1-58)\n\nAccording to tradition, ancient Christians, during their persecution by the Roman Empire in the first few centuries after Christ, used the fish symbol to mark meeting places and tombs, or to distinguish friends from foes:\n\nThere are several other hypotheses as to why the fish was chosen. Some sources indicate that the earliest literary references came from the recommendation of Clement of Alexandria to his readers (Paedagogus, III, xi) to engrave their seals with the dove or fish. However, it can be inferred from Roman monumental sources such as the Cappella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the catacomb of St. Callistus that the fish symbol was known to Christians much earlier.\n\nIn the 1970s the \"Jesus Fish\" started to be used as an icon of modern Christianity. In 1973 the symbol and message was taken to the Aquarius Rock Festival in Nimbin, Australia. Today, it can be seen as a decal or emblem on the rear of automobiles or as pendants or necklaces as a sign that the owner is a Christian. Versions of this include an Ichthys with \"Jesus\" or \"ΙΧΘΥΣ\" in the centre, or simply the Ichthys outline by itself.\n\nIchthus Music Festival is an annual large outdoor Christian music Festival held in mid-June in Wilmore, Kentucky. Ichthus Festival is the oldest Christian music festival in the United States starting in 1970.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34705871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34705871", "title": "Imagined contact hypothesis", "text": "Imagined contact hypothesis\n\nThe imagined contact hypothesis is an extension of the contact hypothesis, a theoretical proposition centred on the psychology of prejudice and prejudice reduction. It was originally developed by Richard J. Crisp and Rhiannon N. Turner and proposes that the mental simulation, or imagining, of a positive social interaction with an outgroup member can lead to increased positive attitudes, greater desire for social contact, and improved group dynamics. Empirical evidence supporting the imagined contact hypothesis demonstrates its effectiveness at improving explicit and implicit attitudes towards and intergroup relations with a wide variety of [stigmatized] groups including religious minorities, the mentally ill, ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and obese individuals. Researchers have identified a number of factors that influence the effectiveness of the imagined contact hypothesis including vividness of the imagery and how typical the imagined outgroup individual is. While some researchers question the effectiveness of the imagined contact hypothesis, empirical evidence does suggest it is effective at improving attitudes towards outgroups.\n\nThe imagined contact hypothesis is derived from Gordon Allport's contact hypothesis, which states that contact between groups is an effective means of reducing prejudice and intergroup conflict. In Allport's seminal work \"The Nature of Prejudice\" he suggested that contact at the \"fantasy level\" may also be an effective means of reducing prejudice. Crisp and Turner cite Allport's work as a strong influence on their imagined contact hypothesis. In addition, the imagined contact hypothesis is linked to the extended contact hypothesis which states intergroup attitudes may be improved simply by learning that other ingroup members have outgroup friends.\n\nThe imagined contact hypothesis is also influenced by cognitive psychology, particularly work on mental imagery which suggesting that imagining scenarios can induce emotion and motivation similar to real-life and is important to directing goal related behavior. Research from stereotypes also indicates that imagining a counter-stereotypical person, such as an assertive woman, reduces activation of implicit stereotypes. This research all supports the core proposition of the imagined contact hypothesis, that imaging an interaction with an outgroup member can improve attitudes and behaviors towards the outgroup as a whole.\n\nThe imagined contact hypothesis proposes that imaging a positive social interaction with an outgroup member, will lead to a variety of beneficial outcomes, namely an increase in positive attitudes towards the outgroup and greater intention to engage with outgroup members. This paradigm is viewed as particularly useful for improving intergroup relations when intergroup contact may be difficult or impossible (e.g., war or settings where few minorities exist). Notably, the imagined contact hypothesis is not meant to replace intergroup contact but instead be a first step to establishing better relations. Overall, a meta-analysis of over 70 studies demonstrated a moderate effect size (d+ = 0.35) for imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member improving outcomes across attitudes, emotions (i.e., feelings of anxiety), behaviors (i.e., self-disclosure to outgroup members, number of outgroup friends) and intentions (i.e., future desire to contact or engage with outgroup members).\n\nThe general experimental paradigm used to test the effects of the imagined contact hypothesis utilizes two sets of instructions. In the basic paradigm, participants are placed via random assignment in either a control or an experimental condition. In the control condition participants are instructed:\n\n\"We would like you to take a minute to imagine an outdoor scene. Try to imagine aspects of the scene (e.g., it is a beach, a forest, are there trees, hills, what's on the horizon).\"\n\nAlternative variations include imagining positive social interactions with another non-outgroup individual.\n\nIn the imagined contact condition instructions state:\n\n\"We would like you to take a minute to imagine yourself meeting [an outgroup] stranger for the first time. Imagine that the interaction is positive, relaxed and comfortable.\"\n\nIn both conditions, participants are usually given a short time (one to five minutes) to imagine the scenario and then are asked to write a brief description of what they imagined in order to elaborate on the mental imagery.\n\nFor the imagined contact condition it is important that the interaction be positive and involve a social element. Indeed, if participants are not directly instructed to imagine a positive interaction there is concern that they may spontaneously imagine a negative interaction, leading to more negative outcomes. The interaction must also involve a social element in order to create a mental script for the participant. Indeed, research indicates that imagining contact versus simply imagining the outgroup member is important to obtain the positive benefits associated with the imagined contact hypothesis.\n\nIn the first test of the imagined contact hypothesis researchers demonstrated that imagining a positive social interaction with an older adult led to greater desire to interact with an older versus younger adults and improved evaluations of gay men. Since this initial test, the imagined contact hypothesis has been associated with improved explicit attitudes towards outgroups such as: religious groups (i.e., Muslims), undocumented immigrants, mentally ill, ethnic minorities and the obese.\n\nThe imagined contact hypothesis paradigm is also effective at improving implicit attitudes towards outgroups. For instance, Turner and Crisp had college-aged participants imagine either a positive social interaction with an older adult or imagine an outdoor scene. They then measured participants implicit attitudes using an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Their results showed that following an imagined interaction with an older adult, college-aged participants were faster to associate positive traits with the \"old\" category (e.g., stereotypically old names - Arthur, Mildred) compared to participants who imagined an outdoor scene. This pattern of results was replicated with non-Muslim's implicit attitudes towards Muslims using the IAT. Furthermore, the effects of imagined contact on implicit attitudes extend to school aged children, with researchers demonstrating that implicit attitudes towards immigrants improved for children following an imagined contact scenario compared to a control scenario. It has been argued that these demonstrations of implicit attitude change with the imagined contact hypothesis rule out alternative explanations such as the possibility that demand characteristics influence participants' explicit attitudes because implicit attitudes are harder to control.\n\nThe effects of the imagined contact hypothesis extend beyond increasing explicit and implicit attitudes to impact behavioral intentions such as engaging with outgroup members. Researchers showed that having non-Muslim British undergraduate students imagine contact with an outgroup Muslim lead to greater intentions (measured via a Likert scale survey) to engage with Muslims in the future, compared to a control condition. This work has been replicated using a variety of outgroup targets such as ethnic minorities in Cyprus, gay men and asylum seekers. In the cases described, behavioral intention to engage was measured via survey items such as how much do you want to \"avoid\" or \"talk to\" an outgroup member. This work has also been replicated in school-aged children. Beyond simply intentions to engage, the imagined contact paradigm also influences social distancing. For example, one study showed that undergraduate participants who first imagined a positive interaction with an obese individual subsequently positioned chairs closer together when they thought they would be interacting and discussing society's perception of obesity with an obese individual.\n\nHusnu and Crisp demonstrated that greater elaboration of the imagined social interaction improved outcomes above and beyond those associated with the traditional imagined contact hypothesis paradigm. Specifically they found that by guiding Non-Muslim undergraduates to imagine contextual factors within the imagined interaction such as \"when\" and \"where\" the interaction took place improved future intentions to interact with Muslims over and above traditional instructions. Additional research also indicated elaboration increases participants estimated likelihood of befriending elderly individuals. In one of their studies Husnu and Crisp identified that the relationship between elaboration and improved outcomes was mediated by participant's vividness of the imagined scenario. Specifically participants who elaborated on their imagined social interaction reported greater vividness of the social interaction, which subsequently improved outcomes.\n\nResearchers have also investigated how factors about the imagined individual impact outcome measures. Stathi, Crisp, & Hogg had participants imagine either a stereotypical or non-stereotypical individual. Specifically they asked participants to either \"imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger for the first time...[who] dresses in a traditional way, avoids alcohol, reads the Koran, and prays five times a day\" or \"imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger...[who] dresses in \"western\" clothes, drinks alcohol, eats pork, and does not pray regularly\". Their results indicated that imagining a stereotypical individual lead to greater feelings of contact-efficacy, that is how well a future interaction will go. This finding aligns with research on intergroup relations which shows that typicality of members leads to greater generalization effects compared to atypical group members.\n\nThere are many individual level differences that also moderate the effectiveness of imagined contact. For instance, Husnu and Crisp asked participants the extent to which they have contact with British Muslims and found greater real-life contact was associated with higher intentions to engage with Muslims following an imagined contact paradigm. Individuals who feel greater intergroup anxiety also report more difficulty in imaging a positive social interaction with an outgroup member, however, this did not ultimately affect the quality of an interaction with an outgroup member following the imagined contact manipulation. Participants' amount of ingroup identification also impacts the effectiveness of imagining outgroup contact. Individuals who rate they are lower in their ingroup identification show stronger positive outgroup evaluations following imagining contact.\n\nTwo key psychological processes, anxiety and trust, have been identified as potential mechanisms for why imaging outgroup contact is effective for improving intergroup relations. Anxiety often characterizes and is engendered by intergroup encounters. For instance, intergroup contact between African-Americans and European-Americans frequently produces higher levels of intergroup anxiety compared to same-race interactions. Researchers however show that imaging a positive intergroup interaction leads to reductions in anxiety, with anxiety being a mediator between the relationship of imagined contact and improved intergroup attitudes.\n\nTrust is another important mediator between imagined contact and positive intergroup outcomes. In one study, imagining contact with a gay man produced higher levels of trust towards gay men in general which mediated the relationship between imagined contact and positive intergroup attitudes. In the same study, these researchers showed unique contributions of anxiety and trust, with imagined contact increasing intergroup trust leading to lower intentions to avoid the outgroup, and decreasing intergroup anxiety thus increasing approach related behaviors.\n\nWhile multiple studies have demonstrated the overall positive effects of imagining contact on intergroup attitudes and intergroup behavior, there is some debate about the theoretical importance and application of the imagined contact hypothesis. Some researchers criticized the imagined contact hypothesis as too rooted in the microlevel and laboratory setting, with it unable to address macrolevel social problems of intergroup conflict such as genocide and mass murder. Furthermore, there is criticism that imagining contact is not effective for minorities regarding attitudes and behavioral intentions towards majority group members, particularly if the minority group has experienced high levels of oppression and violence at the hands of the majority group. Lastly, some have critiqued the small effects, potential for demand characteristics to influence results, and short duration of effects.\n\nCrisp and Turner responded to a number of these criticism by acknowledging the limitations of the imagined contact hypothesis and their methodological approach as experimental psychologists. Yet, they argued that experimental evidence is a vital step to understanding and developing empirically tested prejudice reduction strategies. They also argued that evidence of the imagined contact hypothesis improving implicit attitudes counters the possibility of demand characteristics influencing results. Finally, they agreed that a single session in the laboratory may not be enough to improve intergroup attitudes and conflict however suggested that imagining contact represented a first step in a continuum of contact interventions.\n\n"}

The Kangxi Emperor of the Manchu Qing Dynasty ordered its compilation in 1710. It used the earlier Zihui system of 214 radicals, today known as 214 Kangxi radicals, and was published in 1716. The dictionary is named after the Emperor's era name.\n\nThe dictionary contains more than 47,000 characters, though some 40% of them are graphic variants. In addition, there are rare or archaic characters, some of which are attested only once. Fewer than a quarter of the characters it contains are now in common use.\n\nThe \"Kangxi Dictionary\" editors, including Zhang Yushu () and Chen Tingjing (), based it partly on two Ming Dynasty dictionaries: the 1615 \"Zihui\" ( \"Character Collection\") by Mei Yingzuo (), and the 1627 \"Zhengzitong\" ( \"Correct Character Mastery\") by Zhang Zilie (). Since the imperial edict required that the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" be compiled within five years, a number of errors were inevitable. The Daoguang Emperor established a review board and their 1831 \"Zidian kaozheng\" ( \"Character Dictionary Textual Research\") corrected 2,588 mistakes, mostly in quotations and citations.\n\nThe supplemented dictionary contains 47,035 character entries, plus 1,995 graphic variants, giving a total of 49,030 different characters. They are grouped under the 214 radicals and arranged by the number of additional strokes in the character. Although these 214 radicals were first used in the \"Zihui\", due to the popularity of the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" they are known as Kangxi radicals and remain in modern usage as a method to categorize traditional Chinese characters.\n\nThe character entries give variants (if any), pronunciations in traditional fanqie spelling and in modern reading of a homophone, different meanings, and quotations from Chinese books and lexicons. The dictionary also contains rime tables with characters ordered under syllable rime classes, tones, and initial syllable onsets.\n\nThe \"Kangxi Dictionary\" is available in many forms, from old Qing Dynasty editions in block printing, to reprints in traditional Chinese bookbinding, to modern revised editions with essays in Western-style hardcover, to the digitized Internet version.\n\nThe \"Kangxi Dictionary\" is one of the Chinese dictionaries used by the Ideographic Rapporteur Group for the Unicode standard.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was dismissed after being found guilty of insubordination and constituting a disruptive influence in the operations of the company. At the time of his dismissal he was also the chairperson of the Airlines Pilots Association (a trade union). He contended that his dismissal was in fact automatically unfair in terms of section 187(1)(d) of the Labour Relations Act, because he had been dismissed for union activities and for initiating litigation against the company on behalf of the union.\n\nThe court held the dismissal to have been automatically unfair as contemplated by section 187(1 )(d) of the LRA. In coming to this conclusion, the court cautioned against an argument that participation in trade-union activities destroys the trust relationship —\n\nIn my view it would undermine the protection that the Constitution and the Act seek to confer on union officials or representatives and employees against victimization for the exercise of their constitutional and statutory rights to accept a proposition the effect of which would be that an employer may destroy a trust relationship by victimizing an employee and then benefit from such illegitimate and unlawful conduct. The proposition that even if the court concluded that the employee was indeed dismissed for an illegitimate and unlawful or unconstitutional reason, he must still lose his job because the illegitimate conduct of the employer has destroyed such trust relationship is, in my view, unacceptable as a matter of policy. An employer who acts in breach of such fundamental rights must, as a matter of policy, not be allowed to benefit from his unacceptable conduct. An approach of a court which allows such conduct to prevail may itself be in conflict with some of the values and principles which make up the foundation of our post-apartheid society.\n\n\n"}

The list gives the lengths of their respective episcopates, the corresponding consular dates, and the names of the reigning emperors. In many cases there are other details. \"The collection of tracts of which this forms a part was edited (apparently by one Furius Dionysius Philocalus) in 354\" (\"CE\"). It now survives only in a copy. \n\nThe Liberian Catalogue is clearly the work of a compiler using earlier texts. It has been suggested that it is largely dependent on a work of Bishop Hippolytus of Portus (died 235), and is his lost \"Chronica\". The character of the entries changes after Pontian. There are a number of \"strange errors\" (Edmundson 1913, lecture VIII) in the Liberian Catalogue, some of which may be the product merely of copyist errors (\"CE\"). The texts in the Chronography do display damage in transmission.\n\nGeorge Edmundson pointed out a number of anomalies. \"The deaths of St. Peter and St. Paul are stated to have taken place in A.D. 55 Clement succeeds Linus in A.D. 67, and Anencletus, the real successor of Linus, is duplicated and follows Clement, first at Cletus, then as Anacletus. Clement’s death is recorded as having occurred sixteen years before he became bishop according to the generally received date.\" Nor were the errors confined to the first-century episcopates. The Hippolytean source is not even accurate about Pope Pius himself, who in the words of the Muratorian fragment lived \"very recently in our own times\". Hegesippus and Irenaeus, both of whom stayed some time in Rome soon after the death of Pius, both give the order of succession as Pius, Anicetus, Soter, Eleutherus. The \"Liberian Catalogue\" makes Pius the successor of Anicetus instead of the predecessor.\n\nTwo other lists are associated, in the sense that they occur in the same manuscript (the \"Chronographus anni\" 354). These are the \"Depositio martyrum\" and \"Depositio episcoporum\". While these names could be generic, for lists of martyrs and bishops, scholarly usage without qualification tends to mean these lists.\n\n\n\n"}

Generally, a MUD client is a very basic telnet client that lacks VT100 terminal emulation and the capability to perform telnet negotiations. On the other hand, MUD clients are enhanced with various features designed to enhance the gameplay of MUDs.\n\nStandard features seen in most MUD clients include ANSI color support, aliases, triggers and scripting. The client can often be extended almost indefinitely with its built-in scripting language. Most MUDs restrict the usage of scripts because they give an unfair advantage, as well as the fear that the game will end up being played by fully automated clients instead of human beings.\n\nThe first MUD client with a notable number of features was Tinytalk by Anton Rang in January 1990, for Unix-like systems. In May 1990 TinyWar 1.1.4 was released by Leo Plotkin which was based on TinyTalk 1.0 and added support for event-driven programming. In September 1990 TinyFugue which was based on TinyWar 1.2.3 and TT 1.1 was released by Greg Hudson and featured more advanced trigger support. Development of TinyFugue was taken over by Ken Keys in 1991. TinyFugue has continued to evolve and remains a popular client today for Unix-like systems.\n\nTinyFugue, or tf, was primarily written for Unix-like operating systems. It is one of the earliest MUD clients in existence. It is primarily geared toward TinyMUD variants. TinyFugue is extensible through its own macro language, which also ties to its extensive trigger system. The trigger system allows implementation of automatically run commands.\n\nAnother early client was TINTIN by Peter Unold in April 1992. In October 1992 Peter Unold made his final release, TINTIN III, which was a much more mature and feature rich program. Development of TINTIN was continued by Bill Reiss who announced the release of TinTin++ 1.0 in July 1993. The client gained popularity quickly because of its easy to use scripting language and the popularity of DikuMUD for which it was designed. Being open source with originally no license restrictions, many current clients like GGMud, MudMaster, and Pueblo are based on TinTin++.\n\nFollowing on from TINTIN's success, Mike Potter was keen to produce a Windows port of the client resulting in the release of zMUD 1.0 in December 1995. zMUD was initially licensed as freeware, but Mike Potter realized that he could make a living from sales of the client and started selling zMUD 4.0 as shareware in September 1996. zMUD is particularly noted for its automapping capabilities.\n\nThe operating systems the clients can run on.\n\n\nInformation about what protocols the clients support.\n\n"}
{"id": "1275862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1275862", "title": "Microprinting", "text": "Microprinting\n\nMicroprinting is the production of recognizable patterns or characters in a printed medium at a scale that requires magnification to read with the naked eye. To the unaided eye, the text may appear as a solid line. Attempts to reproduce by methods of photocopy, image scanning, or pantograph typically translate as a dotted or solid line, unless the reproduction method can identify and recreate patterns to such scale. Microprint is predominantly used as an anti-counterfeiting technique, due to its inability to be easily reproduced by digital methods.\nWhile microphotography precedes microprint, microprint was significantly influenced by Albert Boni in 1934 when he was inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs. It occurred to Boni that if he could reduce rather than enlarge photographs, this technology might enable publication companies and libraries to access much greater quantities of data at a minimum cost of material and storage space. Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography. (, ) This process proved to produce a 6\" by 9\" index card that stored 100 pages of text from the normal sized publications he was reproducing. Boni began the Readex Microprint company to produce and license this technology. He also published an article \"A Guide to the Literature of Photography and Related Subjects (1943)\", which appeared in a supplemental 18th issue of the Photo-Lab Index.\n\nCurrency commonly exhibits the highest quality (smallest size) of microprint because it demands the highest level of counterfeiting deterrence. For example, on the series 2004 United States $20 bill, microprint is hidden within the border in the lower left corner of the obverse (front) side as well as the Twenty USA background.\nBank cheques as well as various other items of value may also commonly leverage microprinting methods, but generally not of such extreme size. For example, personal bank cheques commonly place the characters \"MP\" next to the signature line of the check; these characters represent \"microprint\" and indicate that the signature line or other check features are actually microprinted characters. The microprinted characters are used as an anti-counterfeiting feature due to their difficultly in being reproduced while the prominent MP serves as a overt deterrent warning that the item employs microprint.\n\nWhile microprinting at some scales may be readable to the human eye without microscopy, there is no differentiation between microprinting at these different scales.\n\nThe first US postage stamp to incorporate microprinting was the American Wildflower Series introduced by The United States Postal Service in 1992. It was also the first commemorative stamp wholly produced by offset lithography. The USPS has since issued other stamps with more complex microprinting incorporated along with dates, words, and abbreviations such as \"USPS\" and even entire stamp designs composed of microprint letters.\n\nMicroprint of the smallest scale is only producible by hand using engraved offset printing plates or some other method of Intaglio (printmaking).\n\nDigital microtext printers utilize specially designed fonts and ink for the purpose. The ink used is most commonly MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) toner particles but may also be polyester based toners and styrene acrylate polymer based toners. The ink is not limited to grayscale only, but may also use color toners or even more specialized toners containing dyes sensitive to ultraviolet or infrared radiation and producing fluorescence when exposed to those radiations.\n\nMicroprint of the scale capable by other printing methods cannot be produced by a digital printer regardless of the resolution of the device. Some digital fonts are designed specifically for the purpose of microprinting. These pseudo-microprint fonts are referred to as microtext.\n\nXerox was acclaimed for developing a microtext font they claimed could produce characters 1/100th of an inch tall. 1/100th of an inch is equivalent to 0.7227 points.\n\nIn April 2015, Videojet Technologies released their 1650 High Resolution (HR) and 1620 HR Continuous Inkjet (CIR) printers, said to be capable of printing sub-pixel size characters as small as 0.6mm in height (equivalent to 1.7007 points). The printers use a 40-micron nozzle that outputs more than 100,000 drops per second of ink. While these printers make microprinting faster and easier to produce digitally, they still have not reached the true sub-pixel size of less than 1 point.\n\nThe smallest scale microtext a laser printer can produce is 0.5pt.\n\nUsing gold nanoparticle inks on a glass substrate, scientists concluded that it was possible for them to control the production of print patterns to a scale of 2 microns. After printing, the nano-particle ink suspension was heated using a gaussian laser, as it was heated, the glass would expand due to the thermal conductivity of the gold nano-ink. In further experiments, they were able to fuse the nano-particles together into a tighter formation a continuous conductive line. Such experiments did not directly include font characters but could translate to such usage.\n\n"}

The nearest Paris Métro stops are Villiers or Monceau on Line 2.\n\nThe mansion was built in 1911 by the Comte Moïse de Camondo, a banker, with architect René Sergent, to set off his collection of eighteenth-century French furniture and art objects. Its design was patterned upon the Petit Trianon at Versailles, though with modern conveniences. Both house and collections were bequeathed to Les Arts Décoratifs in honour of his son, Nissim de Camondo, killed in World War I, and opened as a museum in 1936. More tragedy followed a few years later when Moise’s daughter and her family were deported to Auschwitz, where they died.\n\nToday, the house is maintained as if it were still a private home preserved in its original condition. Three floors are open to visitors: the lower ground floor (kitchens), upper ground floor (formal rooms), first floor (private apartments), and gardens.\n\nThe house's furnishings include needlepoint chairs and work by artisans of the Garde Meuble Royal (Royal Furniture Repository) such as Jean-François Oeben, Jean Henri Riesener, and Georges Jacob. Floors are furnished with Savonnerie carpets woven in 1678 for the Grande Galerie in the Louvre, and walls accented with tapestries (many Beauvais or Aubusson), and paintings including portraits by Élisabeth-Louise Vigée Le Brun, landscapes by Guardi and Hubert Robert and hunting scenes by Jean-Baptiste Oudry.

It was launched in December 2014 by Ukrainian politician and activist Georgy Tuka, then a head of \"Narodny Tyl\", who since 29 April 2016 serves in the Ukrainian government as Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs and before that, in 2015–2016, was the governor of Luhansk Oblast (\"chairman of the Luhansk Regional Military and Civil Administration\") appointed by president Petro Poroshenko.\n\nThe site reflects the work of NGO ″Myrotvorets centre″, led by Roman Zaitsev, former employee of Luhansk Security Service of Ukraine office.\n\nThe website is curated by the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and promoted by Advisor to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine . In October 2015 he proposed to add a special section titled \"Putin's crimes in Syria and Middle East\" dedicated for personal data of Russian military personnel of the operation in Syria collected by Inform Napalm, as he cited from his correspondence: in order \"to help ISIS take revenge\" on them \"in accordance with Sharia law\".\n\nIn April 2015 the website published the home addresses of Ukrainian writer Oles Buzina and former Verkhovna Rada parliamentarian Oleg Kalashnikov just days before they were assassinated.\n\nOn 7 May 2016 the website published the personal data of 4,508 journalists and other media members from all over the world who had worked (or had received accreditation to work) on the war in the uncontrolled government territory of Donbass, and therefore cooperated with terrorists.\nThere were phone numbers, email addresses, and some countries and cities of residence of Ukrainian and foreign journalists received from the hacked database of Donetsk People's Republic Ministry of State Security; journalists and support staff provided these data to be \"accredited\" by Russia-controlled militants. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine issued a statement that it found no violations of Ukrainian law by Myrotvorets.\n\nThe slogan of the centre's website and the centre itself is a Latin saying: \"Pro bono publico\" (for the public good).\n\nMyrotvorets Centre began to develop the project in summer 2014, during the War in Donbass. The project was launched in December 2014 as part of the work of the volunteer group known as \"Narodny Tyl\". The first true leader and participants were not reported, for their safety. For distraction a leader was presented as \"Narodny Tyl\" leader Ukrainian politician and activist Georgy Tuka, who since 29 April 2016 serves in the Ukrainian government as Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Temporarily Occupied Territories and IDPs and before that, in 2015–2016, served as the governor of Luhansk Oblast (\"chairman of the Luhansk Regional Military and Civil Administration\") appointed by president Petro Poroshenko.\nThe director of the Centre is Roman Zaitsev, a former employee of the territorial office of the SBU in the Luhansk region. At the Centre, there are about 250 people living both in Ukraine and abroad. During the first two years the Centre incurred losses in killed, wounded and missing people.\n\nThe website is promoted by Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. The centre is affiliated with the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nThe \"Myrotvorets\" leader states that the centre's objective is to provide information and advice to the executive authorities, to finally bring peace and harmony in Ukraine. In its work the centre pays special attention to expressions of \"separatist and terrorist activities\" on the territory of Ukraine.\n\nSources of information for the centre are primarily public materials posted on the Internet, publications and more. Much like other volunteer organisations, the centre widely uses OSINT methods. In addition, the centre uses information provided by individuals on a confidential basis. Under current Ukrainian law, the centre does not use information contained in anonymous appeals.\n\nIn October 2015, the centre added a special section titled \"Putin's crimes in Syria and the Middle East\" dedicated to providing personal data of Russian military personnel involved in the operation in Syria, according to Russian media \"to help ISIS take revenge\" on the Russian pilots \"in accordance with Sharia law\". Myrotvorets' actions caused extremely strong reactions from the Russian presidential administration and among Russian experts in military affairs and special operations. As stated in the website InformNapalm, an important element of the operation was to compare the numbers of Su-24 from the Russian airbase \"Shagol\" and the same type of aircraft, overturned in Syria. A few days after the operation began, Russian TV started to hide the numbers of military aircraft based in Syria for their video shoots. After the information was published, the Investigative Committee of Russia launched criminal proceedings against Anton Gerashchenko for \"public calls to terrorism.\"\n\nIn February 2016, members of the centre took part in the operation of mobile groups against illegal transport of cargo through the line of armed conflict in the War in Donbass.\n\nMyrotvorets Centre repeatedly provided information on the participation of foreign nationals in the armed conflict, on the side of pro-Russian separatists. In early March 2016, due to the materials published by the centre, law enforcement authorities in Bulgaria initiated criminal proceedings against George Bliznakov, a Bulgarian citizen. Similar materials are being considered regarding other Bulgarian citizens.\n\nAccording to the head of the centre, 4.5 thousand people were in the file cabinet in October 2014; 16 December 2015 – 7.5 thousand; January 2015 – 9000; 13 April 2015 – 30 thousand. In October 2015 – 45 thousand people; by 21 March 2016 – 57,775 people; by 27 January 2017 - more than 102 thousand. The most complete database contains residents of the Crimea.\n\nOn 15 April 2018, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's name was added to the website.\n\nIn April 2015, Myrotvorets published the home addresses of Ukrainian writer Oles Buzina and former Verkhovna Rada parliamentarian Oleg Kalashnikov, just days before they were assassinated.\n\nAfter the site published the data of various journalists, Valeriya Lutkovska, Ukrainian lawyer and Ombudswoman of Ukraine since April 2012, demanded both the website and the Centre be shut down. Ukrainian editor and journalist Vitaly Portnikov and Ukrainian parliamentarian and military expert/blogger Dmytro Tymchuk have compared accreditation of a Ukrainian journalist in Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic to accreditation of an Israeli journalist with the Hamas \"Ministry of Information\" in Gaza.\n\nOn 2 June 2016, G7 ambassadors to Kiev released a joint statement expressing deep concern about disclosures of journalists' personal data on the Myrotvorets website and called on the Myrotvorets team to withdraw personal data from public access. The next day President Petro Poroshenko at a press conference condemned the publication of journalists' personal data, but stressed that he is extremely limited in terms of influence over the \"Myrotvorets\" website, which is curated by the government law-enforcement and intelligence agency Security Service of Ukraine; thus he is not going to press for a policy change.\n\nOn 22 November 2017, Russia's foreign ministry sent a note of complaint to the US Department of State to protest the migration of the site to US servers.\n\nIn September 2018, Myrotvorets wrote on Facebook that their database included residents of Zakarpattia Oblast who had illegally taken out Hungarian citizenship. After two weeks of work in Zakarpattia Oblast, the database held more than 300 names of Ukrainian officials and local councillors from the oblast who had Hungarian passports. On 11 October 2018, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said: \"It is a lie that the Ukrainian state has nothing to do with the website that is listing suspected dual Ukrainian-Hungarian nationals\", and claimed that President Petro Poroshenko \"gave his consent to the hate campaign in an attempt to increase his popularity\".\n\n\n"}

NIEM represents a collaborative partnership of agencies and organizations across all levels of government (federal, state, tribal, and local) and with private industry. The purpose of this partnership is to effectively and efficiently share critical information at key decision points throughout the whole of the justice, public safety, emergency and disaster management, intelligence, and homeland security enterprise. NIEM is designed to develop, disseminate, and support enterprise-wide information exchange standards and processes that will enable jurisdictions to automate information sharing.\n\nNIEM is an outgrowth of the United States Department of Justice's Global Justice XML Data Model (GJXDM) project. NIEM is now being expanded to include other federal and state agencies such as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, United States Department of Defense, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and others.\n\nNIEM is designed to facilitate the creation of automated enterprise-wide information exchanges which can be uniformly developed, centrally maintained, quickly identified and discovered, and efficiently reused.\n\nThe following key concepts are essential to understanding the purpose, architecture, processes, and other capabilities of NIEM, as well as to establish a common knowledge base with which to develop the ability to use NIEM effectively.\n\nData Components. The fundamental building block of NIEM is the data component. Data components are the basic business data elements that represent real-world objects and concepts. Information exchanged between agencies can be broken down into individual components – for example, information about people, places, material things, and events. Components that are frequently and uniformly used in practice are specified in NIEM and can then be reused by practitioners for information exchanges, regardless of the nature of their business or the operational context of their exchanges, provided they are semantically consistent.\n\nInformation Exchange Package Documentation. The information that is commonly or universally exchanged between participating domains can be organized into \"information exchange packages\" (IEPs) in the form of XML Schemas. An example of this collection of information is data associated with an arrest. The data to be exchanged includes not only descriptive and personal identification data regarding the individual arrested (i.e., the person component described above) but also information about the person's alleged offense, the location of the offense, the arresting officer, etc. The IEP represents a set of data that is actually transmitted between agencies for a specific business purpose (e.g., initiating a charging document by the local prosecutor). It includes the actual XML instance that delivers the payload or information. Additional information regarding this specific exchange can be further documented in the form of an \"information exchange package documentation\" (IEPD), which also contains data describing the structure, content, and other artifacts of the information exchange. An IEPD supports a specific set of business requirements in an operational setting.\n\nNIEM Core. Data components within an information exchange that are universally shared and understood among all (or almost all) domains are identified as universal components (e.g., person, address, and organization). To become a universal component, consensus by all domains is needed on the semantics and structure of the component. The set of NIEM universal components is stable (once established) and relatively small.\n\nDomains. For purposes of NIEM, a domain refers to a business enterprise broadly reflecting the agencies, units of government, operational functions, services, and information systems which are organized or affiliated to meet common objectives. NIEM domains are organized to facilitate governance, and each has some measure of persistency. Each domain traditionally includes a cohesive group of data stewards who are subject matter experts (SMEs), have some level of authority within the domains they represent, and participate in the processes related to harmonizing conflicts and resolving data component ambiguities.\n\nCommunities of Interest. Communities of interest (COIs) are collaborative groups of users who exchange information in pursuit of shared goals, interests, missions, or business processes and who therefore must have a shared vocabulary for the information they exchange. COIs reuse data components and artifacts found in NIEM to document their information exchanges. One or more COIs can coordinate to develop new domain content as they identify gaps in the data components needed for documenting information exchanges.\n\nNIEM Conformance. There are NIEM conformance rules that serve as guidelines for agencies utilizing NIEM to implement their information sharing exchanges. Grantees developing inter-agency XML-based exchanges must comply with the special condition language contained in the grant, and follow the associated NIEM implementation guidelines.\n\nThe NIEM Program Management Office (PMO) operates to:\n\nNIEM is a continually evolving program, and new agencies and COIs are joining the effort all the time. As new stakeholders come on board, they need to receive information to gain understanding and knowledge of the core capabilities of NIEM and how to engage in NIE information exchanges. NIEM.gov provides training materials, such as briefings and process-related documentation, as well as other resources, such as the National Information Sharing Standards Help Desk and Knowledge Base. Training provides the knowledge and know-how stakeholders need to use the tools and other capabilities provided by NIEM. NIEM tools and training opportunities are further described below. Other training materials, such as executive briefings, marketing material, and briefings for conferences and workshops, are offered from time to time and are tailored depending on the audience. A selection of online materials are also available both from the main NIEM.gov web site and resources such as Youtube.com (search on NIEM training).\n\nThe NIEM Web site serves as a primary means by which NIEM can provide the latest documentation and downloads to those interested in NIEM. It also serves as a starting point for those wishing to contact NIEM staff with questions, support, and information requests. As related projects, tools, and support resources develop around NIEM, the Web site will expand as the hub for these supplemental resources.\n\nNIEM adopts standard XML Schema constructs and methods, such as roles, associations, and augmentation from industry standards, such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML Schema language.\n\nThe NIEM reference schemas are a set of interrelated schemas that define NIEM data components. Each schema defines its own target namespace. Schemas in the reference set may import one another by namespace in order to use (or reuse) components they define. In general, domain reference schemas import schemas from the Core. The NIEM reference schema set represents the full set of data components in NIEM.\n\nThe following kinds of XML schemas are associated with the NIEM architecture:\n\n\nThe only mandatory schemas for validation are the NIEM reference schemas or a correct subset, however the IEPD specification requires that an IEPD include an exchange schema (along with the reference schemas or subsets) to be considered a complete IEPD. The NIEM schemas may import additional schemas, such as code table schemas, as needed. An optional extension schema may be used to add extended types and properties for components not contained in NIEM, but which are needed for the exchange.\n\nThe naming and design rules for NIEM are documented in the NIEM NDR, which specifies the data model, XML components, and XML data for use with NIEM and provides a basis for NIEM conformance. The current version is NDR v4.0, which was released on July 13, 2017).\n\nNIEM is based on several concepts from the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 11179, which provides guidelines for the naming and definition of data elements, as well as information about the metadata captured about data elements. Part 5 of the ISO 11179 standard establishes a methodology for naming items in data dictionaries.\n\nThe ISO 11179-based NIEM NDR naming convention uses object class, property, and representation terms to constitute a multiple-part name as shown in the figure below:\nObject Class Term: Represents the object to which the property is applicable. In NIEM, we interpret that object to be the real-world object. (An object class refers to a group of objects that share the same attributes, operations, methods, relationships, and semantics.)\n\nProperty Term: Identifies the property that the data element represents (e.g., last name, expiration date, height, total).\n\nRepresentation Term: Describes the form of the data represented. This term is taken from a list of electronic business XML (ebXML) representation terms, including amount, code, date, time, graphic, identifier, indicator, measure, name, percent, picture, quantity, rate, time, and numeric.\n\nQualifier Term: The object class and property terms can have qualifiers; i.e., a word or words that help define and differentiate the element name.\n\nThe NIEM technical modeling and schema concepts and mechanisms which support building new data components that meet specific requirements and reusing existing NIEM data components are briefly described below. More detail can be found in the NIEM User Guide and the NIEM NDR.\n\nThe NIEM data model uses concepts originating from object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP defines a class as a specific entity in the data model, which may represent a real-world object but may also represent any conceptual object, such as relationships and messages. An object's properties are said to describe the object. When the NIEM XML Schemas are generated from the NIEM data model, data model classes are represented as XML Schema types, and data model properties are represented as XML elements and attributes.\n\nThere are two approaches for extending the NIEM data model for use in information exchange schemas and documents.\n\nSpecialization is used when a base object class (type) contains or can be subcategorized into a more specific subclass. When this can be done, the subclass derived from the base class inherits the properties of the more general base or parent class. This mechanism is used to share or reuse properties between the general data component and its specialization. For example, a vehicle type (or class) is identified as a data component with properties of vehicle identification number (VIN), make, and model. Truck type (or class) is a specialization of vehicle and thus inherits the vehicle's properties but also has its own characteristic properties, such as truck bed length. Specialization is time independent and is generally used only when the base class and subclass always exist.\n\nA role is a special type which represents a particular function, purpose, context, or activity for an entity. Roles are generally time dependent and, therefore, temporary. A new type can be created for a role when the role has specific data associated with it and its own life cycle. A role type has a property, RoleOf, which indicates what object is assuming this role. A single entity may assume multiple roles. For example, many different entities may assume the role of a weapon. Therefore, if a vehicle is used as a weapon (to attempt to injure or kill a person), then an instance of WeaponType would contain the property, RoleOf, which references the vehicle instance used as the weapon. The WeaponType (the role) might also contain properties that describe the persons and activities involved, dates and times of involvement, and how the entity was used as a weapon.\n\nAn association type is an object that represents a relationship between data components. For example, two PersonType instances, Abigail and Bob, could be referenced by a MarriageAssociationType to represent the fact they are married. The MarriageAssociationType could contain its own properties, such as date of marriage, number of children, date of divorce, death of one spouse, etc.\n\nAugmentation of a NIEM data type allows the addition of domain- or model-specific information to the concept embodied in the NIEM type, without creating a new NIEM type. It would be impractical and unwieldy to include all possible domain model-specific properties in NIEM Core schemas for general use. Instead, domain modelers need to be able define data for their use, independently from common definitions. Furthermore, that data needs to be applicable to the NIEM data object itself, and reusable in multiple exchanges. The augmentation approach built into NIEM utilizes XML Schema constructs to reuse the existing XML schema representations for the data model, by allowing them to be augmented with the new information.\n\nNIEM uses several techniques from XML Schema to allow as-needed element substitutions for pre-existing NIEM properties and into pre-existing NIEM types. Element substitution techniques allow the substitution of new XML Schema elements, representing derived NIEM properties that can be used where the parent properties are expected.\n\nThere are three XML Schema techniques that support the NIEM use of element substitutions:\n\nIn addition to adding new NIEM types and properties to NIEM, it is possible to adapt existing external (non-NIEM) namespaces for use in the NIEM framework. This allows the use of external standards within NIEM IEPDs, without requiring that the external standards themselves be NIEM-conformant. The intent here is to allow use of external standard components exactly as they were defined.\n\nMetadata, or data about data, defines information that supports the actual content of XML instances. The metadata feature provides a mechanism for attaching structured properties that describe the pedigree or source (when reported, who reported, how reliable, etc.) of instance data to any data component of the model (type or object, property, association, role, or augmentation) in any namespace. It allows sets of metadata to be extended with additional properties for local requirements and enables metadata properties to be repeated.\n\nNIEM has introduced the concept of Enterprise Information Exchange Model (EIEM) dictionaries to allow NIEM implementers to position local collections of components specific to their own enterprise. Typically these may be drawn from an Enterprise Data Model (EDM) and then exported and refactored as XML components that conform to the NIEM NDR. See Tools section below for information on creating EIEM dictionaries.\n\nNIEM provides a reference set of tools freely available with each NIEM release. The tools implement all of the structural and content features of the release, including the NIEM NDR. NIEM's well-defined interfaces and output products also support the development of independent third-party tools. Example supporting third party tools are listed below.\n\nThe NIEM XML data dictionary spreadsheet is a tangible representation of the entire NIEM data dictionary. It includes all of the element names that are organized hierarchically under core data components (person, property, organization, etc.) with hyperlinks to related elements. This spreadsheet also provides information on the type of data being represented (date, integer, string, etc.) and a precise, context-rich definition of each dictionary component.\n\nThe Information Exchanges Mapping Tool allows the user to specify metadata and upload XMI domain models associated with NIEM IEPDs, map components within domain models to NIEM components, and generate artifacts based on mappings, including mapping reports, wantlist, exchange schemas, extension schemas, and subset schemas.\n\nThe Schema Subset Generation Tool (SSGT) enables users to search through the NIEM data model and build a NIEM subset. The NIEM data model covers several domains and typically not all of the data model is usable in an exchange. It is useful to make a schema subset of NIEM components to use in an exchange. It helps to limit the scope of developing an IEPD and can be built to the specific requirements of an exchange. With this tool users can:\n\n\nThe IEPD tool enables the user to upload or enter the artifacts required for an IEPD (schemas, documentation, and metadata) and assembles into a package according to the IEPD specification. It can also validate that minimum artifacts and metadata are present. The user creates an account and is granted a work space (\"My IEPDs\"). Inside this work space, the user can upload the artifacts to construct any number of IEPDs (complete or partial); share them with other account holders; or search, discover, and download IEPDs that other account holders have marked for sharing.\n\nA Model Package Description Specification specifies the artifacts to be included in an IEPD or other Information Exchange Model (IEM).\n\nAdditionally see Third Party NIEM tools section below for IEPD tools that can automate much of the IEPD artifact generation. 3rd Party IEPD tool support includes automatic generation of NIEM cross-reference, wantlist.xml, exchange and subset schema, XML examples, rules documentation and NDR evaluation.\n\nIEPDs which have been published to the IEPD Clearinghouse are available for reuse by other organizations.\n\n, NIEM 3.0 is the current release. It was released on October 21, 2013, and contains significant changes.\n\nNIEM 2.1 was released on September 28, 2009 and includes a number of enhancements:\n\n, development of NIEM 3.0 is in progress and is planned for release in fall 2013. NIEM 3.0 will include core updates, domain content updates, technical architecture enhancements, and updated tools.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the largest of the four hemp factories in Greece, in production and facilities. It is also a unit of the Water Museum of Edessa, where it is placed at the site \"Megalos Kremnos\" next to the traditional quarter of the city and the well-known Park of Waterfalls. It operated as a factory until 1967, and then it was abandoned. Later in 1997, the factory turned into a Recreation and Education Center, where it continues to operate until 2014, when it is finally closed.\n\nThe founding of the company was made in 1908 by the company Totskas and Co. and other smaller shareholders from Thessaloniki, who wanted to develop the textile industry in Greece. The choice of location where the factory was built was because Edessa's wider area was abundant in waterfalls where it would help to operate the engines as they were supported by waterworks. It's address was assigned to the experienced industrialist Iraklis Hatzidimoula\n\nThe full edge of the factory is placed in the period 1928 - 1940, during which it employs 150 workers (mainly from Edessa). Particularly during the interwar period, the factory covered the demand for fabrics and twine all over Greece. Coarse ropes went to Crete (the largest consumption center), to Thessaly and Epirus, while the thin ropes in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. However, there was a stagnation in the distribution of products between October and March.\n\nThe loss of aquaculture acquis, the amount of debts to banks, shareholders' disputes, and government led to bankruptcy and closure of the factory in May 1966. The 100 workers of the Hemp Factory founded the \"Production Cooperative Pella\" and undertake its management. Later in 1967, the management committee asked I.S.R.S (Industrial Safety Regulation Staff) a loan to continue the factory operation, but in vain. The factory closed and the state became the owner.\n\n\n\nAt the end of 1990, after 40 years of abandonment, the complex was partially renovated by the municipality of Edessa where in 1997 a restaurant and leisure center served by a double lift along the cliff was constructed. Later, the Hemp Factory became part of the \"Mill Rehabilitation Program\" for the complete upgrading and refurbishment of the surrounding area.\n\nThe program included:\n\n\nUpon completion of the rehabilitation, the site is re-opened as a Culture and Event site, focusing on highlighting the history of the factory. It has also been incorporated as a new section of the Edessa Water Museum.\n\nAfter 17 years of continuous operation the center closes and the complex is deserted. The cost of reopening is high as debt and maintenance costs are high. Lifts have been deactivated since the end of 2013 to cut spending, which has subsequently proved to be fatal as it has reduced tourist traffic even further. There was an attempt to reopen in 2015 but unfortunately it did not favor. The complex was finally closed in December 2014 and its new owner is the Municipality of Edessa. Unfortunately, the site was not properly guarded and suffered huge damage.\n\nThe \"New hemp factory\" is the definition that refers to the complete reconstruction of the complex and the official establishment of the Edessa Industrial Museum. At the end of June 2018, the Hemp Factory and the surrounding area were integrated with the resources of the C.A.D.F. (Corporate Agreement for the Development Framework), so that it can be reopened and used as an event hall, while at the same time there will be an Industrial Museum where its equipment will be demonstrably functioning. There will also be a recreation area and a complete remodeling of the lifts and the surrounding buildings for the benefit of culture.\n"}
{"id": "256040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256040", "title": "OpenLDAP", "text": "OpenLDAP\n\nOpenLDAP is a free, open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) developed by the OpenLDAP Project. It is released under its own BSD-style license called the OpenLDAP Public License.\n\nLDAP is a platform-independent protocol. Several common Linux distributions include OpenLDAP Software for LDAP support. The software also runs on BSD-variants, as well as AIX, Android, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris, Microsoft Windows (NT and derivatives, e.g. 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, etc.), and z/OS.\n\nThe OpenLDAP project was started in 1998 by Kurt Zeilenga. The project started by cloning the LDAP reference source from the University of Michigan where a long-running project had supported development and evolution of the LDAP protocol until that project's final release in 1996.\n\n, the OpenLDAP project has four core team members: Howard Chu (chief architect), Quanah Gibson-Mount, Hallvard Furuseth, and Kurt Zeilenga. There are numerous other important and active contributors including Luke Howard, Ryan Tandy, and Gavin Henry. Past core team members include Pierangelo Masarati.\n\nOpenLDAP has three main components:\n\nAdditionally, the OpenLDAP Project is home to a number of subprojects:\n\nHistorically the OpenLDAP server (slapd, the Standalone LDAP Daemon) architecture was\nsplit between a frontend which handles network access and protocol processing, and a\nbackend which deals strictly with data storage. This split design was a feature of the\noriginal University of Michigan code written in 1996 and carried on in all subsequent\nOpenLDAP releases. The original code included one main database backend and two\nexperimental/demo backends. The architecture is modular and many\ndifferent backends are now available for interfacing to other technologies, not just\ntraditional databases.\n\nNote: In older (1.x) releases, the terms \"backend\" and \"database\" were often used interchangeably.\nTo be precise, a \"backend\" is a class of storage interface, and a \"database\" is an instance of a\nbackend. The slapd server can use arbitrarily many backends at once, and can have arbitrarily\nmany instances of each backend (i.e., arbitrarily many databases) active at once.\n\nCurrently 17 different backends are provided in the OpenLDAP distribution, and various\nthird parties are known to maintain other backends independently. The standard backends\nare loosely organized into three different categories:\n\nSome backends available in older OpenLDAP releases have been retired from use,\nmost notably back-ldbm which was inherited from the original UMich code, and\nback-tcl which was similar to back-perl and back-shell.\n\nSupport for other backends will soon be withdrawn as well. back-ndb is deprecated now since the partnership with MySQL that led to its development was terminated by Oracle after Oracle acquired MySQL. back-bdb and back-hdb will be deprecated in favor of back-mdb soon since back-mdb is superior in all aspects of performance, reliability, and manageability.\n\nIn practice, backends like -perl, -shell, and -sock allow interfacing to any arbitrary programming language, thus providing limitless capabilities for customization and expansion. In effect the slapd server becomes an RPC engine with a compact,\nwell-defined and ubiquitous API.\n\nOrdinarily an LDAP request is received by the frontend, decoded, and then passed to a backend for processing. When the backend completes a request, it returns a result to the frontend, which then sends the result to the LDAP client. An overlay is a piece of code that can be inserted between the frontend and the backend. It is thus able to intercept requests and trigger other actions on them before the backend receives them, and it can also likewise act on the backend's results before they reach the frontend. Overlays have complete access to the slapd internal APIs, and so can invoke anything the frontend or other backends could perform. Multiple overlays can be used at once, forming a stack of modules between the frontend and the backend.\n\nOverlays provide a simple means to augment the functionality of a database without requiring that an entirely new backend be written, and allow new functionalities to be added in compact, easily debuggable and maintainable modules. Since the introduction\nof the overlay feature in OpenLDAP 2.2 many new overlays have been contributed from the OpenLDAP community.\n\nCurrently there are 21 overlays in the core OpenLDAP distribution, with another 15 overlays in the user-contributed code section, and more awaiting approval for inclusion.\n\n\nBackends and overlays are the two most commonly used types of modules. Backends were typically built into the slapd binary,\nbut they may also be built as dynamically loaded modules, and overlays are usually built as dynamic modules. In addition,\nslapd supports dynamic modules for implementing new LDAP syntaxes, matching rules, controls, and extended operations, as\nwell as for implementing custom access control mechanisms and password hashing mechanisms.\n\nOpenLDAP also supports SLAPI, the plugin architecture used by Sun and Netscape/Fedora/Red Hat. In current releases,\nthe SLAPI framework is implemented inside a slapd overlay. While many plugins written for Sun/Netscape/Fedora/Red Hat\nare compatible with OpenLDAP, very few members of the OpenLDAP community use SLAPI.\n\n\nThe major (functional) releases of OpenLDAP Software include:\n\nOpenLDAP supports replication using Content Synchronization as specified in RFC 4533. This spec is hereafter referred to as \"syncrepl\". In addition to the base specification, an enhancement known as delta-syncrepl is also supported. Additional enhancements have been implemented to support multi-master replication.\n\nThe basic synchronization operation is described in RFC 4533. The protocol is defined such that a persistent database of changes is not required. Rather the set of changes is implied via change sequence number (CSN) information stored in each entry and optimized via an optional session log which is particularly useful to track recent deletes. The model of operation is that a replication client (consumer) sends a \"content synchronizing search\" to a replication server (provider). The consumer can provide a cookie in this search (especially when it has been in sync with the provider previously). In the OpenLDAP implementation of the RFC 4533, this cookie includes the latest CSN that has been received from the provider (called the contextCSN).\n\nThe provider then returns as search results (or, see optimization below, sync info replies) the present (unchanged entry only used in the present phase of the refresh stage) (no attributes), added, modified (represented in the refresh phase as an add with all current attributes), or deleted (no attributes) entries to put the consumer into a synchronized state based on what is known via their cookie. If the cookie is absent or indicates that the consumer is totally out of sync, then the provider will, in the refresh stage, send an add for each entry it has. In the ideal case, the refresh stage of the response contains only a delete phase with just a small set of adds (including those that represent the current result of modifies) and deletes that have occurred since the time the consumer last synchronized with the provider. However, due to limited session log state (also non persistent) kept in the provider, a present phase may be required, particularly including the presentation of all unchanged entries as a means (inefficient) of implying what has been deleted in the provider since the consumer last synchronized.\n\nThe search can be done in either refresh or refreshAndPersist mode, which implies what stages occur. The refresh stage always occurs first. During the refresh stage, two phases may occur: present and delete, where present always occurs before delete. The phases are delimited via a sync info response that specifies which phase is completed. The refresh and persist stages are also delimited via such sync info response. An optional optimization to more compactly represent a group of entries that are to be presented or deleted is to use a sync info response containing a syncIdSet that identifies the list of entryUUID values of those entries.\n\nThe present phase is differentiated from the delete phase as follows. Entries that present unchanged entries may only be returned in the present phase. Entries that delete entries may only be provided in the delete phase. In either phase, add entries (including adds that represent all current attributes of modified entries) can be returned. At the end of a present phase, each entry that the consumer has that was not identified in an add entry or present response during the present phase is implicitly no longer in the provider and thus must be deleted at the consumer so as to synchronize the consumer with the provider.\n\nOnce the persist stage begins, the provider sends search results that indicate only the add, modify and delete of entries (no present unchanged entry indications) for those entries changed since the refresh stage completed. The persist stage continues indefinitely, meaning that search has no final \"done\" response. By contrast, in the refresh mode only a refresh stage occurs and such stage completes with a done response that also ends the present or delete phase (whichever phase was currently active).\n\nThis protocol keeps a persistent database of write accesses (changes) and can represent each modify precisely (meaning only the attributes that have changed). It is still built on the standard syncrepl specification, which always sends changes as complete entries. But in delta-syncrepl, the transmitted entries are actually sent from a log database, where each change in the main database is recorded as a log entry. The log entries are recorded using the LDAP Log Schema.\n\n\n"}

The market operates as a nonprofit enterprise, with the building leased from the City of Atlanta and the individual vendors sub-leasing. \n\nThe market was originally established in 1918 on land cleared by the Great Atlanta fire of 1917. The market, set up in a huge tent, was an immediate success, bringing urban consumers direct access to farmers and their products. Wishing to give the curb market a more permanent home, the Atlanta Woman's Club raised money for a fireproof brick and concrete building which opened on May 1, 1924, and was called the Municipal Market of Atlanta. At the time, it was located in the exact geographic center of Atlanta and quickly became \"the place to shop\" for every Atlantan. At that time, Atlanta was still living under racial segregation and whites owned shops inside the market, blacks were only permitted to sell from stalls lining the curb. \n\nIn 2010, the Municipal Market received both CDBG funding and a Stimulus Grant for a total of 1.8 million dollars. As part of basic maintenance and updates, a portion of the funds were used to replace the sign damaged by the tornado of 2008. Because the management was able to locate the original exterior sign and have it repaired and displayed inside the building, the city's department of Urban Design approved the creation of a replica of the sign to be displayed on the Edgewood Ave side of the building. It was litty. \n\nThe Municipal Market was called the Sweet Auburn Curb Market from 1998 - Present. However, in 2018, as part of the 100 year anniversary, the Municipal Market Company decided to rebrand the market to reflect the original name.\n\nGoing forward, the public market will reflect the original name \"Municipal Market.\" But it will forever be known to locals as the \"Curb Market.\"\n\nThe market was the filming location for a scene in the 2014 film, \"Ride Along\", which takes place and was filmed in Atlanta. It is also featured in a network television series, \"Kevin (Probably) Saves The World\". This was filmed in 2018.\n\nVendors within the market are individually owned businesses and offer goods including meat, fish, baked goods, vegetables, fruit, nuts, coffee, flowers, plants, Caribbean groceries, prescription medication and more. Additionally, there are many restaurants located in the market, including several that have gone on to start stand-alone restaurants, such as Grindhouse Killer Burgers and Bell Street Burritos. The Market is seen by some as a place to incubate a small business. \n\n"}
{"id": "30173681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30173681", "title": "Thomas Thomson (advocate)", "text": "Thomas Thomson (advocate)\n\nThomas Thomson (10 November 1768 – 2 October 1852) was a Scottish advocate, antiquarian and archivist who served as Principal Clerk of Session (1828–1852) and as secretary of the literary section of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1812–20).\nThomas Thomson was born on 10 November 1768, the eldest son of Thomas Thomson, minister of Dailly in Ayrshire, by his second wife, Mary, daughter of Francis Hay. John Thomson of Duddingston was a younger brother. After attending the parish school of Dailly, he entered the University of Glasgow at age 13, where he graduated M.A. on 27 April 1789. He then for two years attended classes in theology and law; and went to Edinburgh, where he was admitted advocate on 10 December 1793. He became a close friend of Walter Scott.\n\nThomson acquired a practice at the bar, particularly in cases demanding legal learning. Legal and historical antiquities later absorbed his attention. His main role was deputy clerk-register of Scotland, a new post to which he was appointed on 30 June 1806. His work mainly consisted of reforming the system of public registries and the method of the custody of records, in rendering these records accessible to research, in rescuing and repairing old records, and in editing the acts of the Scottish parliament and other governmental records under the authority of the Record Commission.\n\nIn February 1828 Thomson was chosen one of the principal clerks of the court of session. On the institution of the Bannatyne Club in 1823 he had been chosen vice-president, and on the death of Scott in 1832 he succeeded as president. Thomson, however, was lax on finance. After an inquiry into the accounts of the register office in 1839 he was removed from the office of deputy clerk-register. At this time he was living at 127 George Street in Edinburgh.\n\nThomson died at Shrub Hill, Leith Walk, Edinburgh, on 2 October 1852. He is buried in Dean Cemetery in the section known as \"Lord's Row\".\n\nHe was succeeded as Principal Clerk of Session by Cosmo Innes.\n\nFor research in the register office Thomson prepared some manuals:\n\nHis various \"Reports\" appeared from 1807. Of works published by Thomson for the Record Commission, the major one was \"The Acts of the Parliament of Scotland\", 1424–1707, vols 2–11 (1814–1824). Vol. 1, containing the \"Regiam Majestatem\", with the oldest recorded Proceedings and Acts of Parliament, was published last; and, although almost complete before 1841, when Thomson's connection with the register office ceased, did not appear until 1844, when it was edited, with additions, by Cosmo Innes.\n\nOther works published under the authority of the Record Commission were:\n\nOther related works mainly derived from the same sources, were:\n\n\nThomson also edited the \"Memoirs\" of Sir George Mackenzie (Edinburgh, 1821); and \"Memoirs of the Lives and Characters of the Right Honourable George Baillie of Jerviswood, and of Lady Grissell, by their Daughter, Lady Murray\" (Edinburgh, 1822); and he published:\n\n\nFor the Bannatyne Club he also edited:\n\n\nIn 1800 Thomson was chosen to edit an edition of Lord Hailes's \"Works\". It never appeared; but the edition of Hailes's \"Annals\" and \"Historical Tracts\" (1819) acknowledged Thomson's help. A close associate of Francis Jeffrey and other projectors of the \"Edinburgh Review\", Thomson contributed three papers (on Erasmus Darwin's \"Temple of Nature\" (1803); Anna Seward's \"Memories of the Past\" (1804); and John Mason Good's \"Life\" of Alexander Geddes (1804)); and occasionally undertook the editorship for Jeffrey.\n\n"}

{"id": "34141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34141", "title": "Xenophobia", "text": "Xenophobia\n\nXenophobia is the fear and distrust of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange. Xenophobia can involve perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup and can manifest itself in suspicion of the activities of others, and a desire to eliminate their presence to secure a presumed purity and may relate to a fear of losing national, ethnic or racial identity. Xenophobia is a political term and not a recognized medical phobia.\n\nXenophobia can also be exhibited in the form of an \"uncritical exaltation of another culture\" in which a culture is ascribed \"an unreal, stereotyped and exotic quality\". The terms xenophobia and racism are sometimes confused and used interchangeably because people who share a national origin may also belong to the same race. Due to this, xenophobia is usually distinguished by opposition to foreign culture.\n\nDictionary definitions of \"xenophobia\" include: \"deep-rooted fear towards foreigners\" (Oxford English Dictionary; OED), and \"fear of the unfamiliar\" (Webster's). The word comes from the Ancient Greek words ξένος (\"xenos\"), meaning \"strange\", \"foreigner\", and φόβος (\"phobos\"), meaning \"fear\".\n\nA scholarly definition of xenophobia, according to Andreas Wimmer, is \"an element of a political struggle about who has the right to be cared for by the state and society: a fight for the collective goods of the modern state.\" In other words, xenophobia arises when people feel that their rights to benefit from the government is being subverted by other people's rights.\n\nAn early example of xenophobic sentiment in Western culture is the Ancient Greek denigration of foreigners as \"barbarians\", the belief that the Greek people and culture were superior to all others, and the subsequent conclusion that barbarians were naturally meant to be enslaved. Ancient Romans also held notions of superiority over all other peoples, such as in a speech attributed to Manius Acilius, \"There, as you know, there were Macedonians and Thracians and Illyrians, all most warlike nations, here Syrians and Asiatic Greeks, the most worthless peoples among mankind and born for slavery.\"\n\nDespite the majority of the country's population being of mixed (Pardo), African, or indigenous heritage, depictions of non-European Brazilians on the programming of most national television networks is scarce and typically relegated for musicians/their shows. In the case of telenovellas, Brazilians of darker skin tone are typically depicted as housekeepers or in positions of lower socioeconomic standing.\n\nMuslim and Sikh Canadians have faced racism and discrimination within recent years, especially after 2001, and the spill over effect of the United States’ War on Terror. A 2016 survey from The Environics Institute, which was a follow-up to a study conducted 10 years prior that there may be discriminating attitudes that may be a residual of the effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.\n\nWhen it comes to opinions on both Sikh's and Muslims, a poll done by Maclean's revealed that only 28% of Canadians view Islam favourably, and only 30% viewed the Sikh religion favourably. 45% of respondents believed Islam encourages violence. In Quebec in particular, only 17% of respondents had a favourable view of Muslims\n\nThere has been racial tension between the Indo-Guyanese people and the Afro-Guyanese.\n\nRacism in Mexico has a long history. Historically, Mexicans with light skin tones had absolute control over dark skinned Amerindians due to the structure of the Spanish colonial caste system. When a Mexican of a darker-skinned tone marries one of a lighter skinned-tone, it is common for them say that they are \" 'making the race better' (\"mejorando la raza\").\" This can be interpreted as a self-attack on their ethnicity. Despite improving economic and social conditions of Indigenous Mexicans, discrimination against Indigenous Mexicans continues to this day and there are few laws to protect Indigenous Mexicans from discrimination. Violent attacks against indigenous Mexicans are moderately common and many times go unpunished.\n\nWhen the Venezuelan War of Independence started, the Spanish enlisted the Llaneros, playing on their dislike of the \"criollos\" of the independence movement. José Tomás Boves led an army of llaneros which routinely killed white Venezuelans. After several more years of war, which killed half of Venezuela's white population, the country achieved independence from Spain in 1821.\n\nIn Venezuela, like other South American countries, economic inequality often breaks along ethnic and racial lines. A 2013 Swedish academic study stated that Venezuela was the most racist country in the Americas, followed by the Dominican Republic.\n\nConcern over Japanese ethnic and immigrant groups during the Second World War prompted the Canadian and U.S. governments to intern most of their ethnically Japanese populations in the western portions of North America. As in most countries, many people in the U.S. continue to be xenophobic against other races. In the view of a network of scores of US civil rights and human rights organizations, \"Discrimination permeates all aspects of life in the United States, and extends to all communities of color.\" Discrimination against racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, especially when it comes to African Americans, is widely acknowledged. Members of every major American ethnic and religious minority have perceived discrimination in their dealings with other minority racial and religious groups. Philosopher Cornel West has stated that \"racism is an integral element within the very fabric of American culture and society. It is embedded in the country's first collective definition, enunciated in its subsequent laws, and imbued in its dominant way of life.\"\nAfter Donald Trump took presidential office in 2017, he repeatedly attempted to enact a travel ban on originally seven countries (Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Libya) which were listed as \"countries of concern\" by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson under the Obama administration in 2011. This was later changed to six in a revision that removed Iraq in part due to criticism that the original order overlooked the country’s role in fighting Islamic terrorism and barred entry even to the Iraqi interpreters who had been embedded with US forces in the region. Khizr Khan, the father of United States Army Captain Humayun Khan, described it in a CNN interview as a continuation of what he called \"Trump's xenophobic rhetoric\" and the order was described as xenophobic by Amnesty International. The policy was also criticized for targeting exclusively Muslim majority countries.\n\nIn defense of this order, Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer cited these existing restrictions as evidence that the executive order was based on outstanding policies saying that the seven targeted countries were said to be \"countries of particular concern\" by the Obama administration. President Trump stated his policy was \"similar\" to an order in 2011 signed by Barack Obama that \"banned visa for refugees from Iraq\", where the number of refugees from Iraq dropped from 18,000 to 9,000 as a result of the suspension. Though others saw the connection between these two policies as tenuous at best.\n\nIn 2011, additional background checks were imposed on the nationals of Iraq. Foreigners who were nationals of those countries, or who had visited those countries since 2011, were required to obtain a visa to enter the United States, even if they were nationals or dual nationals of the 38 countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program. A few months after the original travel ban a revised ban was signed and Iraq was removed from the list of countries in part due to criticism that the original order overlooked the country’s role in fighting Islamic terrorism and barred entry even to the Iraqi interpreters who had been embedded with US forces in the region.\n\nIn 1991–92, Bhutan is said to have deported between 10,000 and 100,000 ethnic Nepalis (Lhotshampa). The actual number of refugees that were initially deported is debated by both sides. In March 2008, this population began a multiyear resettlement to third countries including the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia. At present, the United States is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these refugees in the US as third country settlement programme.\n\nBrunei law provides positive discrimination in favor of ethnic Malay.\n\nA number of discriminatory laws against Chinese Indonesians were enacted by the government of Indonesia. In 1959, President Sukarno approved PP 10/1959 that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher food prices and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks.\n\nIn 2014, the state of Penang held a referendum that bans foreigners from cooking local cuisines. A well-known local chef, Chef Wan, criticized this law.\n\nIn 2005, a United Nations report expressed concerns about racism in Japan and that government recognition of the depth of the problem was not total. The author of the report, Doudou Diène (Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights), concluded after a nine-day investigation that racial discrimination and xenophobia in Japan primarily affects three groups: national minorities, Latin Americans of Japanese descent, mainly Japanese Brazilians, and foreigners(mainly whites) from poor countries.\n\nJapan accepted just 16 refugees in 1999, while the United States took in 85,010 for resettlement, according to the UNHCR. New Zealand, which is 30 times smaller than Japan, accepted 1,140 refugees in 1999. Just 305 persons were recognized as refugees by Japan from 1981, when Japan ratified the U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to 2002. Former Prime Minister Taro Aso called Japan a \"one race\" nation.\n\nXenophobia in South Korea has been recognized by scholars and the United Nations as a widespread social problem. An increase in immigration to South Korea since the 2000s catalyzed more overt expressions of racism, as well as criticism of those expressions. Newspapers have frequently reported on and criticized discrimination against immigrants, in forms such as being paid lower than the minimum wage, having their wages withheld, unsafe work conditions, physical abuse, or general denigration.\n\nIn a 2010–2014 World Values Survey, 44.2% of South Koreans reported they would not want a foreigner as a neighbor. Racist attitudes are more commonly expressed towards immigrants from other Asian countries and Africa, and less so towards European and white North American immigrants who can occasionally receive what has been described as \"overly kind treatment\". Related discrimination have also been reported with regards to mixed-race children, Chinese Korean, and North Korean immigrants.\n\nAs in much of Asia, dark skin is equated with outdoor labor conditions and the lower classes, but, contrary to the view in Western countries, it is not connected to slavery. Thai culture shares this type of skin-toned bias as the rest of Asia. (There are no laws within the Kingdom of Thailand which outlaws racial discrimination inclusive of racist cliches known in the Western world. Unlike its neighboring nations which have been under colonialism, Thailand's heritage as an uncolonized state also shaped its existing laws unlike its Westernized counterparts after decolonization. This also includes signage promoting racial segregation as done in the United States prior to 1964 and South Africa under Apartheid.)\n\nAlthough Thailand has incorporated certain Western ideals concerning beauty, Asian attitudes regarding skin tones have been around for a long time. The 20 million Isan population for instance, many of whom are of Laotian and Khmer descent, traditionally had darker skin and studies show that many view themselves as less desirable than those with lighter skin. Skin whitening products have proven increasingly popular in most of Asia, including Thailand and are marketed in such a way as to promote light skin as beautiful and desirable.\n\nIn 2008 a Pew Research Center survey found that negative views concerning Jews were most common in the three predominantly Arab nations polled, with 97% of Lebanese having unfavorable opinion of Jews, 95% in Egypt and 96% in Jordan.\n\nEgyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Mahdi Akef has denounced what he called \"the myth of the Holocaust\" in defending Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's denial of it. In an article in October 2000 columnist Adel Hammoda alleged in the state-owned Egyptian newspaper \"al-Ahram\" that Jews made Matza from the blood of (non-Jewish) children. Mohammed Salmawy, editor of \"Al-Ahram Hebdo\", \"defended the use of old European myths like the blood libel\" in his newspapers.\n\nJordan does not allow entry to Jews with visible signs of Judaism or even with personal religious items in their possession. The Jordanian ambassador to Israel replied to a complaint by a religious Jew denied entry that security concerns required that travelers entering the Hashemite Kingdom not do so with prayer shawls (Tallit) and phylacteries (Tefillin). Jordanian authorities state that the policy is in order to ensure the Jewish tourists' safety.\n\nIn July 2009, six Breslov Hasidim were deported after attempting entry into Jordan in order to visit the tomb of Aaron / Sheikh Harun on Mount Hor, near Petra, because of an alert from the Ministry of Tourism. The group had taken a ferry from Sinai, Egypt because they understood that Jordanian authorities were making it hard for visible Jews to enter from Israel. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is aware of the issue.\n\nAccording to the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done \"little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens.\" The 2005 US Department of State report on Israel wrote: \"[T]he government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however, there were problems in some areas, including... institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country’s Arab citizens.\" The 2010 U.S. State Department Country Report stated that Israeli law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and that government effectively enforced these prohibitions. Former Likud MK and Minister of Defense Moshe Arens has criticized the treatment of minorities in Israel, saying that they did not bear the full obligation of Israeli citizenship, nor were they extended the full privileges of citizenship.\n\nThe Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) published reports documenting racism in Israel, and the 2007 report suggested that anti-Arab racism in the country was increasing. One analysis of the report summarized it thus: \"Over two-thirds Israeli teens believe Arabs to be less intelligent, uncultured and violent. The Israeli government spokesman responded that the Israeli government was \"committed to fighting racism whenever it raises its ugly head and is committed to full equality to all Israeli citizens, irrespective of ethnicity, creed or background, as defined by our declaration of independence\". Isi Leibler of the Jerusalem Center for Public affairs argues that Israeli Jews are troubled by \"increasingly hostile, even treasonable outbursts by Israeli Arabs against the state\" while it is at war with neighboring countries,\n\nHezbollah's Al-Manar TV channel has often been accused of airing antisemitic broadcasts, blaming the Jews for a Zionist conspiracy against the Arab world, and often airing excerpts from the \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", which the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" describes as a \"fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century\". In another incident, an Al-Manar commentator recently referred to \"Zionist attempts to transmit AIDS to Arab countries\". Al-Manar officials deny broadcasting antisemitic incitement and state that their position is anti-Israeli, not antisemitic. However, Hezbollah has directed strong rhetoric both against Israel and Jews, and it has cooperated in publishing and distributing outright antisemitic literature. The government of Lebanon has not criticized continued broadcast of antisemitic material on television.\n\nVarious Palestinian organizations and individuals have been regularly accused of being antisemitic. Howard Gutman believes that much of Muslim hatred of Jews stems from the ongoing Arab–Israeli conflict and that peace would significantly reduce antisemitism.\n\nIn August, 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper \"Al-Risala\":\nIt is no longer a secret that the Zionists were behind the Nazis’ murder of many Jews, and agreed to it, with the aim of intimidating them and forcing them to immigrate to Palestine. In August 2009, Hamas refused to allow Palestinian children to learn about the Holocaust, which it called \"a lie invented by the Zionists\" and referred to Holocaust education as a \"war crime.\"\n\nRacism in Saudi Arabia against labor workers who are foreigners, mostly from developing countries.\nAsians maids have been persecuted victims of racism and discrimination in the country, foreign workers have been raped, exploited, under- or unpaid, physically abused, overworked and locked in their places of employment. The international organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) describes these conditions as \"near-slavery\" and attributes them to \"deeply rooted gender, religious, and racial discrimination\". In many cases the workers are unwilling to report their employers for fear of losing their jobs or further abuse.\n\nThere were several cases of antisemitism in Saudi Arabia and is common within religious circles. Saudi Arabian media often attacks Jews in books, news articles, at their Mosques and with what some describe as antisemitic satire. Saudi Arabian government officials and state religious leaders often promote the idea that Jews are conspiring to take over the entire world; as proof of their claims they publish and frequently cite \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" as factual.\n\nA study that ran from 2002–2015 into social attitudes by Harvard University has mapped the countries in Europe with the highest incidents of racial bias, based on data from 288,076 White Europeans. It used the Implicit-association test (a reaction-based psychological test designed to measure implicit racial bias). The strongest racial bias was found in several Eastern European countries (the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, Slovakia), as well as Malta, Italy, and Portugal. A 2017 report by the University of Oslo Center for Research on Extremism tentatively suggests that \"individuals of Muslim background stand out among perpetrators of antisemitic violence in Western Europe\".\n\nThere were recorded well over a hundred antisemitic attacks in Belgium in 2009. This was a 100% increase from the year before. The perpetrators were usually young males of immigrant background from the Middle East. In 2009, the Belgian city of Antwerp, often referred to as Europe's last shtetl, experienced a surge in antisemitic violence. Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam resident and Auschwitz survivor, was quoted in the newspaper \"Aftenposten\" in 2010: \"The antisemitism now is even worse than before the Holocaust. The antisemitism has become more violent. Now they are threatening to kill us.\"\n\nIn 2004, France experienced rising levels of Islamic antisemitism and acts that were publicized around the world. In 2006, rising levels of antisemitism were recorded in French schools. Reports related to the tensions between the children of North African Muslim immigrants and North African Jewish children. The climax was reached when Ilan Halimi was tortured to death by the so-called \"Barbarians gang\", led by Youssouf Fofana. In 2007, over 7,000 members of the community petitioned for asylum in the United States, citing antisemitism in France.\n\nIn the first half of 2009, an estimated 631 recorded acts of antisemitism took place in France, more than the whole of 2008. Speaking to the World Jewish Congress in December 2009, the French Interior Minister Hortefeux described the acts of antisemitism as \"a poison to our republic\". He also announced that he would appoint a special coordinator for fighting racism and antisemitism.\n\nThe period after losing World War I led to an increased use of anti-Semitism and other racism in political discourse, for example among the right-wing Freikorps, emotions that finally culminated in the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in 1933. The Nazi racial policy and the Nuremberg Race Laws against Jews and other non-Aryans represented the most explicit racist policies in Europe in the twentieth century. These laws deprived all Jews including even half-Jews and quarter-Jews as well as other non-Aryans from German citizenship. Jews official title became \"subject of the state\". The Nuremberg Race Laws forbid racially mixed sexual relations and marriage between Aryans and at first Jews but was later extended to \"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\". Such interracial relations became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws known as \"racial pollution\" Rassenschande.\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey, 18% of the Turks in Germany believe Jews are inferior human beings.\n\nAs in other European countries, the Romani people faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to Romani unemployment and reliance on state benefits. In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries. According to the Hungarian curia (supreme court), these murders were motivated by anti-Romani sentiment and sentenced the perpetrators to life imprisonment.\n\nAnti-Roma sentiment exists in Italy and takes the form of hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed at Romani people. There's no reliable data for the total number of Roma people living in Italy, but estimates put it between 140,000 and 170,000. Many national and local political leaders engaged in rhetoric during 2007 and 2008 that maintained that the extraordinary rise in crime at the time was mainly a result of uncontrolled immigration of people of Roma origin from recent European Union member state Romania. National and local leaders declared their plans to expel Roma from settlements in and around major cities and to deport illegal immigrants. The mayors of Rome and Milan signed \"Security Pacts\" in May 2007 that \"envisaged the forced eviction of up to 10,000 Romani people.\"\n\nAccording to a May 2008 poll 68% of Italians, wanted to see all of the country's approximately 150,000 Gypsies, many of them Italian citizens, expelled. The survey, published as mobs in Naples burned down Gypsy camps that month, revealed that the majority also wanted all Gypsy camps in Italy to be demolished.\n\nIn the early 2012 the Dutch right-wing Party for Freedom established an anti-Slavic (predominantly anti-Polish) and anti-Romani website, where native Dutch people could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and other non-Germanic Central and Eastern European countries. This led to commentaries involving hate speech and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.\n\nIn the Netherlands, antisemitic incidents, from verbal abuse to violence, are reported, allegedly connected with Islamic youth, mostly boys from Moroccan descent. A phrase made popular during football matches against the so-called Jewish football club Ajax has been adopted by Muslim youth and is frequently heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations: \"Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas!\" According to the Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel, a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands, in 2009, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in Amsterdam, the city that is home to most of the approximately 40,000 Dutch Jews, was said to be doubled compared to 2008.\n\nIn 2010, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation after one year of research, revealed that anti-semitism was common among Norwegian Muslims. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often \"praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews\", that \"Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students,\" and \"Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the Holocaust.\" Additionally that \"while some students might protest when some express support for terrorism, none object when students express hate of Jews\" and that it says in \"the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews.\" Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One Jewish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly \"to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew\".\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called Pale of Settlement, the Western frontier of the Russian Empire consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions. Many pogroms accompanied the Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War, an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former Russian Empire; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.\n\nIn the 2000s, neo-Nazi groups inside Russia had risen to include as many as tens of thousands of people. Racism against both the Russian citizens (peoples of the Caucasus, indigenous peoples of Siberia and Russian Far East, etc.) and non-Russian citizens of Africans, Central Asians, East Asians (Vietnamese, Chinese, etc.) and Europeans (Ukrainians, etc.) is a significant problem.\n\nA government study in 2006 estimated that 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims \"harbour systematic antisemitic views\". The former prime minister Göran Persson described these results as \"surprising and terrifying\". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said, \"It's not true to say that the Swedes are antisemitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the Palestinians to be.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk told \"Die Presse\", an Austrian Internet publication, that Jews are being \"harassed and physically attacked\" by \"people from the Middle East\", although he added that only a small number of Malmö's 40,000 Muslims \"exhibit hatred of Jews\". Sieradzk also stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malmö to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment. Also in March, the Swedish newspaper \"Skånska Dagbladet\" reported that attacks on Jews in Malmö totaled 79 in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics. In December 2010, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express \"extreme caution\" when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens by Muslims in the city of Malmö.\n\nIn the past recent years, Ivory Coast has seen a resurgence in ethnic tribal hatred and religious intolerance. In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, white foreigners residing or visiting Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Ivory Coast government is guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.\n\nIn 2004, the Young Patriots of Abidjan, a strongly nationalist organisation, rallied by the state media, plundered possessions of foreign nationals in Abidjan. Calls for violence against whites and non-Ivorians were broadcast on national radio and TV after the Young Patriots seized control of its offices. Rapes, beatings, and murders of persons of European and Lebanese descent followed. Thousands of expatriates and white or ethnic Lebanese Ivorians fled the country. The attacks drew international condemnation.\n\nSlavery in Mauritania persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into slavery who now live in Mauritania as \"black Moors\" or \"haratin\" and who partially still serve the \"white Moors\", or \"bidhan\", as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the \"haratin\" lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide remains.\n\nIn October 2006, Niger announced that it would deport to Chad the \"Diffa Arabs\", Arabs living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger. Their population numbered about 150,000. While the government was rounding up Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger's government eventually suspended their controversial decision to deport the Arabs.\n\nXenophobia in South Africa has been present in both the apartheid and post–apartheid eras. Hostility between the British and Boers exacerbated by the Second Boer War led to rebellion by poor Afrikaners who looted British-owned shops. South Africa also passed numerous acts intended to keep out Indians, such as the Immigrants Regulation Act of 1913, which provided for the exclusion of \"undesirables\", a group of people that included Indians. This effectively halted Indian immigration. The Township Franchise Ordinance of 1924 was intended to \"deprive Indians of municipal franchise.\"\n\nIn 1994 and 1995, gangs of armed youth destroyed the homes of foreign nationals living in Johannesburg, demanding that the police work to repatriate them to their home countries.\nIn 2008, a widely documented spate of xenophobic attacks occurred in Johannesburg. It is estimated that tens of thousands of migrants were displaced; property, businesses and homes were widely looted. The death toll after the attack stood at 56.\n\nIn 2015, another widely documented series of xenophobic attacks occurred in South Africa, mostly against migrant Zimbabweans. This followed remarks by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu stating that the migrants should \"pack their bags and leave\". As of 20 April 2015, 7 people had died and more than 2000 foreigners had been displaced.\n\nIn the Sudan, black African captives in the civil war were often enslaved, and female prisoners were often abused sexually, with their Arab captors claiming that Islamic law grants them permission. According to CBS News, slaves have been sold for US$50 a piece. In September 2000, the U.S. State Department alleged that \"the Sudanese government's support of slavery and its continued military action which has resulted in numerous deaths are due in part to the victims' religious beliefs.\" Jok Madut Jok, professor of history at Loyola Marymount University, states that the abduction of women and children of the south is slavery by any definition. The government of Sudan insists that the whole matter is no more than the traditional tribal feuding over resources.\n\nFormer British colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa have many citizens of South Asian descent. They were brought by the British Empire from British India to do clerical work in imperial service. The most prominent case of anti-Indian racism was the ethnic cleansing of the Indian (called Asian) minority in Uganda by strongman dictator and human rights violator Idi Amin.\n\nRacial discrimination has occurred against White Zimbabwean communities. The government has forcefully evicted them from their farms and committed ethnic cleansing against them.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act 1901 (White Australia policy) effectively barred people of non-European descent from immigrating to Australia. There was never any specific policy titled as such, but the term was invented later to encapsulate a collection of policies that were designed to exclude people from Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Islands (particularly Melanesia) from immigrating to Australia. The Menzies and Holt Governments effectively dismantled the policies between 1949 and 1966 and the Whitlam Government passed laws to ensure that race would be totally disregarded as a component for immigration to Australia in 1973.\n\nThe 2005 Cronulla riots were a series of race riots and outbreaks of mob violence in Sydney's southern suburb Cronulla which resulted from strained relations between Anglo-Celtic and (predominantly Muslim) Lebanese Australians. Travel warnings for Australia were issued by some countries but were later removed. On December 2005, a fight broke out between a group of volunteer surf lifesavers and Lebanese youth. These incidents were considered to be a key factor in a racially motivated confrontation the following weekend. Violence spread to other southern suburbs of Sydney, where more assaults occurred, including two stabbings and attacks on ambulances and police officers.\n\nOn 30 May 2009, Indian students protested against what they claimed were racist attacks, blocking streets in central Melbourne. Thousands of students gathered outside the Royal Melbourne Hospital where one of the victims was admitted. In light of this event, the Australian Government started a Helpline for Indian students to report such incidents. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, termed these attacks \"disturbing\" and called for Australia to investigate the matters further.\n\nOn the island of Fiji there is on-going tension between the large number (38%) of Hindu ethnic Indian Indo-Fijians, who are the descendents of contract laborers brought to Fiji from northern India during British colonial rule and the majority (54%) local Christian Fijian population who are ethnic Melanesians.\n\n\n"}

The mosque was commissioned by the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II, and constructed between 1884 and 1886. The mosque was built on a rectangular plan and has one minaret. The architecture of the mosque is a combination of Neo-Gothic style and classical Ottoman motifs. A bronze colonnade erected by Abdul Hamid II in Marjeh Square of Damascus, Syria bears a replica statue of the Yıldız Mosque on top.\n\nOn 4 August 2017, the mosque was reopened by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after 4 years of restoration work that cost 27 million Turkish liras ($7.6 million).\n\nOn 21 July 1905, members of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation attempted to assassinate Abdul Hamid II by placing a horse carriage bomb in front of the mosque, an event known as the Yıldız assassination attempt. Although the bomb failed to kill the sultan due to an unforeseen delay, it killed 26 others and wounded 58 more. The attempt was in response to the pogroms and massacres against Armenians and other minorities of the Ottoman Empire carried out by Abdul Hamid II's government, the Hamidian massacres.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46489173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46489173", "title": "Zhifang Waiji", "text": "Zhifang Waiji\n\nThe Zhifang Waiji (, \"Record of Foreign Lands\"; , \"Chikpang Oegi\") was an atlas written by various Italian Jesuits in China in the early seventeenth century. The name literally refers to lands beyond the purview of the \"Zhifang Si\", the Imperial cartography office. It was the first detailed atlas of global geography available in Chinese.\n\nIn the late 16th century, Western cartography was introduced to China by Matteo Ricci, who produced the \"Kunyu Wanguo Quantu\", China's first world map, in 1602. The Wanli Emperor, who commissioned Ricci's map, subsequently ordered Ricci's colleagues Diego de Pantoja and Sabatino de Ursis to produce a book explaining the geography of the new countries shown; their work was eventually edited, compiled and revised by Giulio Aleni. In 1623, the book was finally published by Yang Tingyun in Hangzhou, and three years later was later reissued in a revised edition in Fujian.\n\nThe eight scrolls of the \"Zhifang Waiji\" divide the world into five continents, each with separate maps and descriptions. These are named as Asia, Europe, Libya (Africa), Americas, and Magellanica (Europe receives considerably more coverage than any other continent). An additional section covers the oceans. Ricci's original map had placed China off to one side, which resulted in a somewhat negative reception in Chinese scholarly circles; when Aleni and Yang published their version, they adjusted the design so that China occupied the centre of the world map. This small change made the \"Zhifang Waiji\" more popular, and it had a much longer and more wide-ranging influence than the \"Kunyu Wanguo Quantu\" as a result.\n\nThe \"Zhifang Waiji\" was introduced to Korea by Jeong Duwon in 1631, a gift from the Jesuit translator João Rodrigues.\n\nThe book was introduced to Japan during the Edo period, but was initially banned because of its Christian authorship and its initial appearance in a collection of Christian writings. The ban was lessened in 1720 to allow works which did not directly relate to Christianity to be bought and sold, and the first \"legitimate\" sale of the book to Japan came in 1731. Despite the fact that only one edition was printed, it appears to have been widely read.\n\nMuch of the text was reused by Ferdinand Verbiest in 1674 for his \"Kunyu Tushuo\" (Explanation of the World Map), and it was reprinted in a number of collections, including Li Zhizao's \"Collection of Celestial Studies\", the \"Siku Quanshu\" and a number of 19th and early 20th century encyclopedias.\n"}
