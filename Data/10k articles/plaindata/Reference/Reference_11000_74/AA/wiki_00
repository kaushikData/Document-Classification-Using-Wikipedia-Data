{"id": "64107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64107", "title": "Alcatraz Island", "text": "Alcatraz Island\n\nAlcatraz Island () is located in San Francisco Bay, offshore from San Francisco, California, United States. The small island was developed with facilities for a lighthouse, a military fortification, a military prison (1828), and a federal prison from 1934 until 1963. Beginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans from San Francisco, who were part of a wave of Native activism across the nation, with public protests through the 1970s. In 1972, Alcatraz became part of a national recreation area and received designation as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n\nToday, the island's facilities are managed by the National Park Service as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area; it is open to tours. Visitors can reach the island in a little under 15 minutes by ferry ride from Pier 33, located between the San Francisco Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco. Hornblower Cruises and Events, operating under the name Alcatraz Cruises, is the official ferry provider to and from the island.\n\nAlcatraz Island is home to the abandoned prison, the site of the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States, early military fortifications, and natural features such as rock pools and a seabird colony (mostly western gulls, cormorants, and egrets). According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz, the island measures by and is at highest point during mean tide. The total area of the island is reported to be .\n\nLandmarks on the island include the Main Cellhouse, Dining Hall, Library, Lighthouse, the ruins of the Warden's House and Officers' Club, Parade Grounds, Building 64, Water Tower, New Industries Building, Model Industries Building,\nand the Recreation Yard.\n\nThe first Spaniard to document the island was Juan Manuel Diaz, who charted San Francisco Bay and named one of the three islands he identified as \"La Isla de los Alcatraces,\" which translates as \"The Island of the Gannets\" but is commonly believed to translate as \"The Island of the Pelicans (Spanish for Pelicans is Pelicanos),\" from the archaic Spanish \"\" (\"pelican\"). Over the years, the Spanish version \"Alcatraz\" became popular and is now widely used. In August 1827, French Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly wrote \"... running past Alcatraze's (Pelicans) Island ... covered with a countless number of these birds. A gun fired over the feathered legions caused them to fly up in a great cloud and with a noise like a hurricane.\" The California brown pelican (\"Pelecanus occidentalis californicus\") is not known to nest on the island today. The Spanish built several small buildings on the island and other minor structures.\n\nThe earliest recorded owner of the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by Mexican governor Pio Pico in June 1846, with the understanding that Workman would build a lighthouse on it. Julian Workman is the baptismal name of William Workman, co-owner of Rancho La Puente and personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as Military Governor of California, John C. Frémont, champion of Manifest Destiny and leader of the Bear Flag Republic, bought the island for $5,000 in the name of the United States government from Francis Temple. In 1850, President Millard Fillmore ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically as a United States military reservation, for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the Mexican–American War. Frémont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Frémont nothing. Frémont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of California by the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) which ended the Mexican–American War, and the onset of the California Gold Rush the following year, the U.S. Army began studying the suitability of Alcatraz Island for the positioning of coastal batteries to protect the approaches to San Francisco Bay. In 1853, under the direction of Zealous B. Tower, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began fortifying the island, work which continued until 1858, eventuating in Fortress Alcatraz. The island's first garrison at Camp Alcatraz, numbering about 200 soldiers and 11 cannons, arrived at the end of that year.\n\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the island mounted 85 cannons (increased to 105 cannons by 1866) in casemates around its perimeter, though the small size of the garrison meant only a fraction of the guns could be used at one time. At this time it also served as the San Francisco Arsenal for storage of firearms to prevent them falling into the hands of Confederate sympathizers. Alcatraz, built as a \"heavily fortified military site on the West Coast\", formed a \"triangle of defense\" along with Fort Point and Lime Point, and ensured security to the bay. The island was also the site of the first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States. Alcatraz never fired its guns offensively, though during the war it was used to imprison Confederate sympathizers and privateers on the west coast.\n\nBecause of its isolation from the outside by the cold, strong, hazardous currents of the waters of San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz was used to house Civil War prisoners of war (POWs) as early as 1861.\n\nFollowing the war in 1866, the army determined the fortifications and guns were being rapidly rendered obsolete by advances in military technology. Modernization efforts, including an ambitious plan to level the entire island and construct shell-proof underground magazines and tunnels, were undertaken between 1870 and 1876 but never completed (the so-called \"parade ground\" on the southern tip of the island represents the extent of the flattening effort). Instead, the army switched the focus of its plans for Alcatraz from coastal defense to detention, a task for which it was well suited because of its isolation. In 1867, a brick jailhouse was built (previously inmates had been kept in the basement of the guardhouse), and in 1868, Alcatraz was officially designated a long-term detention facility for military prisoners. The facility was later discontinued for POWs in 1946. Among those incarcerated at Alcatraz were Confederates caught on the West Coast and some Hopi Native American men in the 1870s.\n\nIn 1898, the Spanish–American War increased the prison population from 26 to over 450, and from 1905 to 1907 it was commanded by U.S. Army General George W. McIver. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, civilian prisoners were transferred to Alcatraz for safe confinement. On March 21, 1907, Alcatraz was officially designated as the Western U.S. Military Prison, later Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, 1915. In 1909 construction began on the huge concrete main cell block, designed by Major Reuben Turner, which remains the island's dominant feature. It was completed in 1912. To accommodate the new cell block, the Citadel, a three-story barracks, was demolished down to the first floor, which was actually below ground level. The building had been constructed in an excavated pit (creating a dry \"moat\") to enhance its defensive potential. The first floor was then incorporated as a basement to the new cell block, giving rise to the popular legend of \"dungeons\" below the main cell block. The Fortress was deactivated as a military prison in October 1933 and transferred to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nDuring World War I, the prison held conscientious objectors, including Philip Grosser, who wrote a pamphlet entitled \"Uncle Sam's Devil's Island\" about his experiences.\n\nThe United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz were acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a federal prison in August 1934. Alcatraz was designed to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons. At 9:40 am on August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas at Santa Venetia, California, before being escorted to Alcatraz, handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by some 60 special FBI agents, U.S. Marshals and railway security officials. Most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and murderers. The prison initially had a staff of 155, including the first warden James A. Johnston and associate warden J. E. Shuttleworth, both considered to be \"iron men\". The staff were highly trained in security, but not rehabilitation.\n\nDuring the 29 years it was in use, the jail held some of the most notorious criminals in American history, such as Al Capone, Robert Franklin Stroud (the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"), George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, Bumpy Johnson, Rafael Cancel Miranda (a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party who attacked the United States Capitol building in 1954), Mickey Cohen, Arthur R. \"Doc\" Barker, and Alvin \"Creepy\" Karpis (who served more time at Alcatraz than any other inmate). It also provided housing for the Bureau of Prisons staff and their families.\n\nDuring its 29 years of operation, the penitentiary claimed that no prisoner successfully escaped. A total of 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts, two men trying twice; 23 were caught alive, six were shot and killed during their escape, two drowned, and five are listed as \"missing and presumed drowned\". The most violent occurred on May 2, 1946, when a failed escape attempt by six prisoners led to the Battle of Alcatraz.\n\nOn June 11, 1962, Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin carried out one of the most intricate escapes ever devised.\n\nBecause the penitentiary cost much more to operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per prisoner per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta), and half a century of salt water saturation had severely eroded the buildings, then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered the penitentiary closed on March 21, 1963. In addition, citizens were increasingly protesting the environmental effects of sewage released into San Francisco Bay from the approximately 250 inmates and 60 Bureau of Prisons families on the island. That year, the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, on land, opened as the replacement facility for Alcatraz.\n\nAlcatraz Island was occupied by Native American activists for the first time on March 8, 1964. The event was reported by, among others, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and the \"San Francisco Examiner\".\n\nBeginning on November 20, 1969, a group of Native Americans called United Indians of All Tribes, mostly college students from San Francisco, occupied the island to protest federal policies related to American Indians. Some of them were children of Native Americans who had relocated in the city as part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Indian termination policy, which was a series of laws and policies aimed at the assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream American society, particularly by encouraging Native Americans to move away from the Indian reservations and into cities. A number of employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs also occupied Alcatraz at that time, including Doris Purdy, an amateur photographer, who later produced footage of her stay on the island.\n\nThe occupiers, who stayed on the island for nearly two years, demanded the island's facilities be adapted and new structures built for an Indian education center, ecology center and cultural center. The American Indians claimed the island by provisions of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) between the US and the Sioux; they said the treaty promised to return all retired, abandoned, or out-of-use federal lands to the native peoples from whom they were acquired. Indians of All Tribes then claimed Alcatraz Island by the \"Right of Discovery\", as indigenous peoples knew it thousands of years before any Europeans had come to North America. Begun by urban Indians of San Francisco, the occupation attracted other Native Americans from across the country, including American Indian Movement (AIM) urban activists from Minneapolis.\n\nDuring the nineteen months and nine days of occupation by the American Indians, several buildings at Alcatraz were damaged or destroyed by fire, including the recreation hall, the Coast Guard quarters and the warden's home. The origin of the fires is disputed. The U.S. government demolished a number of other buildings (mostly apartments) after the occupation had ended. Graffiti from the period of Native American occupation is still visible at many locations on the island.\n\nDuring the occupation, President Richard Nixon rescinded the Indian termination policy, designed by earlier administrations to end federal recognition of tribes and their special relationship with the US government. He established a new policy of self-determination, in part as a result of the publicity and awareness created by the occupation. The occupation ended on June 11, 1971.\n\nThe entire Alcatraz Island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and was further declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 1993, the National Park Service published a plan entitled \"Alcatraz Development Concept and Environmental Assessment.\" This plan, approved in 1980, doubled the amount of Alcatraz accessible to the public to enable visitors to enjoy its scenery and bird, marine, and animal life.\n\n\nToday, American Indigenous groups, such as the International Indian Treaty Council, hold ceremonies on the island, most notably, their \"Sunrise Gatherings\" every Columbus Day and Thanksgiving Day.\n\nThe Global Peace Foundation proposed to raze the prison and build a peace center in its place. During the previous year, supporters collected 10,350 signatures that placed it on the presidential primary ballots in San Francisco for February 5, 2008. The proposed plan was estimated at $1 billion. For the plan to pass, Congress would have to have taken Alcatraz out of the National Park Service. Critics of the plan said that Alcatraz is too rich in history to be destroyed. On February 6, 2008, the Alcatraz Island Global Peace Center Proposition C failed to pass, with 72% of voters rejecting the proposition.\n\nThe coastal environment of the San Francisco Bay Area has caused deterioration and corrosion of building materials throughout Alcatraz. Beginning in 2011, the National Park Service began major renovations on the island, including the installation of solar panels on the cell house roof, slope stabilization near the Warden's House and the stabilization and rehabilitation of the outer cell house walls.\nRecently, Alcatraz has been home to several art installations. The Chinese artist/dissident Ai Weiwei staged an exhibition which explored \"questions about human rights and freedom of expression\" called @Large. This 2014 exhibit included Lego portraits of famous political prisoners. In 2016, Nelson Saiers used math and prison slang as central elements in a six-month installation that addressed irrationally long prison sentences.\n\n\nGardens planted by families of the original Army post, and later by families of the prison guards, fell into neglect after the prison closure in 1963. After 40 years, they are being restored by a paid staff member and many volunteers, thanks to funding by the Garden Conservancy and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. The untended gardens had become severely overgrown and had developed into a nesting habitat and sanctuary for numerous birds. Now, areas of bird habitat are being preserved and protected, while many of the gardens are being restored to their original state.\n\nIn clearing out the overgrowth, workers found that many of the original plants were growing where they had been planted – some more than 100 years ago. Numerous heirloom rose hybrids, including a Welsh rose (Bardou Job) that had been believed to be extinct, have been discovered and propagated. Many species of roses, succulents, and geraniums are growing among apple and fig trees, banks of sweet peas, manicured gardens of cutting flowers, and wildly overgrown sections of native grasses with blackberry and honeysuckle.\n\nAlcatraz Island appears often in media and popular culture, including films dating from 1962: \"The Book of Eli\" (2010), \"\" (2006), \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002), \"The Rock\" (1996), \"Murder in the First\" (1995), \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), \"The Enforcer\" (1976), \"Point Blank\" (1967) \", Birdman of Alcatraz\" (1962) and J. J. Abrams' 2012 television series \"Alcatraz\".\n\nIt also was featured in the \"Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters\" anime, in the book \"Al Capone Does My Shirts\", in the video game \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4\" as a playable level, and in the video game \"\" in a downloadable zombie survival map called \"Mob of the Dead\". It is also featured as a playable racetrack in the 1996 arcade racing video game \"\". Alcatraz has also been portrayed often as a safe haven or base of operations in many post-apocalyptic movies, such as \"The Book of Eli\".\n\nAlcatraz even appears in \"The Alchemyst\" and \"The Sorceress\" by author \"Michael Scott\" and is depicted as a prison for the immortal \"Perenelle Flamel\".\n\nAlcatraz is featured in the episode \"Bird Mummy of Alcatraz\" in the children's program, \"Mummies Alive!\" and was also featured in a mission in the video game \"Watch Dogs 2\". Alcatraz is also featured as a downloadable map in the video game \"The Escapists.\" Alcatraz also features in the video game \"\" zombie map \"Blood of the Dead\".\n\n\n\n"}

As the number of documents exponentially increases with the proliferation of the Internet, automatic indexing will become essential to maintaining the ability to find relevant information in a sea of irrelevant information. Automatic Indexing is the process of analyzing an item to extract the information to be permanently kept in an index.\n\nThe automated process can encounter problems and these are primarily caused by two factors: 1) the complexity of the language; and, 2) the lack intuitiveness and the difficulty in extrapolating concepts out of statements on the part of the computing technology. These are primarily linguistic challenges and specific problems involve semantic and syntactic aspects of language.\n\nThere are scholars who cite that the subject of automatic indexing attracted attention as early as the 1950s, particularly with the demand for faster and more comprehensive access to scientific and engineering literature. This was highlighted by the information explosion, which was predicted in the 1960s and came about through the emergence of information technology and the World Wide Web. This phenomenon required the development of an indexing system that can cope with the challenge of storing and organizing vast amount of data and can facilitate information access. New electronic hardware further advanced automated indexing since it overcame the barrier imposed by old paper archives, allowing the encoding of information at the molecular level. The automatic indexing is also partly driven by the emergence of the field called computational linguistics, which steered research that eventually produced techniques such as the application of computer analysis to the structure and meaning of languages. Automatic indexing is further spurred by research and development in the area of artificial intelligence and self-organizing system also referred to as thinking machine.\n"}

The younger Cousinot is a major contemporary source for the episode of the Hundred Years' War that featured the career of Joan of Arc. \n\nThe careers of father and son were separated, and the two were identified in the 19th century as uncle and nephew by Auguste Vallet de Viriville (1815-1868), assistant-professor at the \"École des chartes\", who published the \"Chronique\" in 1859; however, a few years later, the two Guillaume Cousinot were correctly identified as father and son by Jules Doinel (1842-1902), archivist at the departmental archives of the Loiret in Orléans. \n\nThe father, Guillaume I Cousinot, was a distinguished lawyer (\"avocat\") at the Parlement de Paris at the beginning of the fifteenth century. In 1408, he was selected by Valentina Visconti, Duchess of Orléans to defend the memory of her late husband Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orléans, assassinated the previous year by Jean sans Peur, Duke of Burgundy. Cousinot rose to the occasion and became a chief counsellor to the House of Orléans, for which his worldly goods were confiscated during the eclipse of the Orléans faction by Jean sans Peur. Shortly before the Battle of Agincourt, Charles d'Orléans, who was taken captive by the English at Agincourt, appointed Cousinot his chancellor. Cousinot administered the affairs of the duchy during Charles' 24-year captivity in England. Eventually Charles VII compensated Cousinot for his losses with lands in Beauce and an \"hôtel particulier\", the \"hôtel du Grand-Saint-Martin\" in Orléans. \n\nThe elder Guillaume Cousinot was the author of the \"Geste des Nobles\", an historical survey that begins with the distant, legendary origins of France, and gains historical credibility with the reign of John II of France, then carries the career of Joan of Arc as far as Troyes, where the narrative breaks off suddenly and inexplicably before the coronation of Charles VII.\n\nThe younger Guillaume Cousinot studied at the University of Orléans and, in the footsteps of his father, was a counsellor to the king, \"maÎtre des requêtes\" in the king's household and, in 1442, the first president of the \"Conseil delphinal\", the future Parlement of Dauphiné. He bought the seigneurie of Montreuil, near Vincennes. An administrator and trusted diplomat of Charles VII and of his son Louis XI, his career was even more prominent than that of his father. He was taken prisoner by the English after an embassy to Scotland, and was ransomed by Charles VII.\n\nThe \"Chronique de la Pucelle\" was first published in 1661, as an anonymous work, by the historian and archivist Denis Godefroy (1615-1681). Its 19th century editor, Vallet de Viriville, kept the original title. \n\n"}

{"id": "1888028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1888028", "title": "Comparison of Scottish Gaelic and Irish", "text": "Comparison of Scottish Gaelic and Irish\n\nAlthough Scottish Gaelic and Irish are closely related as Goidelic Celtic languages (or Gaelic languages), they are different in many ways. While most dialects are not immediately mutually comprehensible (although many individual words and phrases are), speakers of the two languages can rapidly develop mutual intelligibility.\n\nScottish Gaelic in Islay and Argyll is fairly similar to Irish. The extinct dialects of northeast Ulster, particularly Rathlin Island, were also close to Scottish Gaelic. In Scotland, dialects also existed in southern Kintyre and Galloway which were probably similar to Irish, \"sliabh\" (mountain) being fairly common as an element in Galloway and Irish placenames, but quite rare in the Highlands. The dialects of these Scottish and Irish regions are also, in turn, the most similar to Manx.\n\nWhile the dialects of northern Scotland and southern Ireland tend to differ the most from one another in terms of vocabulary, they do share some features which are absent in other dialect areas lying between them. For example, in both Munster Irish and the Gaelic of the north of Scotland, historically short vowels have been diphthongised or lengthened before long sonants. An example of this is the word \"clann\" meaning \"children of the family\". In Munster Irish and northern Scottish Gaelic it is pronounced whereas in Ulster and County Mayo it is and in Connemara ; the Manx form \"cloan\" is in the north and in the south. Similarly, \"im\" meaning \"butter\" is pronounced in Munster, Southern Connacht and northern Scotland (and Manx), but in Ulster and Southern Scottish.\n\nIn addition, slender coronal stops ( and in Scottish Gaelic; and in Irish, are affricated (such as and ) in Mayo and Donegal, the southern Highlands and in Manx, but not in Munster or the northern Highlands.\n\nIn the verb \"tá\" of Standard Irish, northern Scotland and Central-Southern Munster agree in leniting the initial \"t\", thus one hears \"thá\" in County Waterford and County Tipperary, and \"tha\" in northern Scotland. West Munster also lenites the \"t\", but only after the preverb \"a\" \"that\" (\"an fear a thá ina sheasamh ag an ndoras\" \"the man that's standing at the door\", standard Irish \"an fear atá ina sheasamh ag an doras\", Scottish Gaelic \"am fear a tha na sheasamh aig an doras\").\n\nThe closest to Scottish Gaelic in modern Irish is the dialect currently spoken in County Donegal, as illustrated by the sentence \"How are you?\".\n\n\"Sibh\" is used in both Scottish Gaelic and Irish for the plural \"you\", while Scottish Gaelic [except for the far south] also uses \"sibh\" as a formal version of \"you\" (much like French uses \"vous\"; see \"T–V distinction\"). Modern Irish does not use this formal/informal distinction when addressing people. The use of \"sibh\" as 'polite' you is a retention from the Classical Irish usage of the plural personal pronouns to refer to the singular in polite communication, thus \"sinn\" \"we\" for \"mé\" \"I, me\" and \"sibh\" \"you (plural)\" for \"tú\" \"you/thou\". \"Thu\" is used in Scottish Gaelic when speaking to an individual friend, family member, or a younger person.\n\nThe negative particle in Scottish Gaelic, Manx and Northern Ulster Irish is \"cha/chan\" (\"chan eil\", \"cha bhfuil/chan fhuil\" = \"is not\"; \"chan\" is from the Old Irish emphatic negative nichon). In standard Irish the negative particle is \"ní\" (\"níl\" = \"is not\", a contraction of \"ní fhuil\"); \"ní\" is a retention of the normal Old Irish negative; these are illustrated by the sentence \"I have no money\":\n\nScottish Gaelic speakers may also sound as if they were using the Irish phrase, as \"Chan eil\" can frequently be shortened to \" 'n eil\".\n\nThe Classical Irish digraph \"éu\" [eːʷ] is still used in Scottish Gaelic spelling but is now obsolete in Irish, except in southern dialect writing, as a means to distinguish the vowel \"é\" when followed by a broad consonant from the regular dialect development \"é\" to \"i\" in the same environment, thus \"éan\" [ian] \"bird\" in comparison to \"d'éug\" [dʲe:g] \"died; passed on\"). \"Éa\" is now used instead of \"eu\" in Standard Irish. Both \"éa\" and \"éu\" existed in Classical Irish, to a large extent showing nominal case differences (with \"éu\" varying with \"éo\" in the dative of \"éa\"-words), however in both Scotland and Ireland, spelling reforms and standardisation (which took place in Ireland under the auspices of the government of Ireland during the 20th century, and much earlier in Scotland) independently went for different versions.\n\nAt times Scottish writers used the spelling \"eu\" to represent how the combination is pronounced in northern dialects, thus \"ia\", writing \"ian\" instead of \"eun\", before this sound change became the typical pronunciation. Manx spelling, based mainly on English, shows that \"ia\" is also the underlying form in Manx, the word being spelled \"eean\".\n\nThe most obvious phonological difference between Scottish Gaelic and Irish is that the phenomenon of eclipsis in Irish is diachronic (i.e. the result of an historical word-final nasal that may or may not be present in modern Irish) but fully synchronic in Scottish Gaelic (i.e. it requires the actual presence of a word-final nasal except for a tiny set of frozen forms). Eclipsis is shown in the Irish orthography but not in Scottish Gaelic as it is conditioned by the actual environment.\n\nFor example, this means that phrases like Standard Irish , standard Scottish Gaelic , Manx is pronounced as follows in different parts of the Gaelic speaking world:\n\n\nAn example of diachronic-type eclipsis are the numbers:\n\nOne example of this is the Gaelic \"joke\" of non-native speakers confusing \"the penis\" with \"the meeting/get-together\" (similar in sentiment to the English speakers' \"joke\" about non-native speakers confusing \"shit\" and \"sheet\")\n\nIn conservative speech, Scottish Gaelic feminine nouns also slenderise in the dative (prepositonal) case, giving , and so a different final consonant. This feature is uncommon today except in more formal registers and is ignored here.\n\nThere are a number of distinctive orthographical (written) differences. The spellings of both languages have been reformed in recent decades, which has led to further divergence, though conversely more recent spelling reforms in Scottish Gaelic have reduced the divergences to some extent.\n\nOne difference is that the accent is written as a grave accent (, \"heavy stroke/accent\") in Scottish Gaelic, as opposed to the acute accent (, \"length accent\"; , \"sharp stroke/accent\") used in Irish; hence the word for \"welcome\" is written as in Scottish Gaelic and in Irish as . Irish has no grave accent, only acute accents, while until recently Scottish Gaelic had both grave and acute accents which were used to differentiate between open and closed vowel sounds. However, recent spelling reform has meant that there are now only grave accents in Scottish Gaelic, the opposite of Irish.\n\nSimilarly, in Scottish Gaelic the prefix is always hyphenated, while in Irish it is attached to the beginning of the word, as illustrated by the languages' respective names for each other:\nAdditionally, while the prefixes and are usually hyphenated in both languages, in Irish they are attached to the beginning of words whose first letter is capitalised (in Scottish Gaelic they are always hyphenated).\n\nA number of letter combinations are possible in written Irish which are not found in Scottish Gaelic e.g. \"ae\", \"bhf\". Irish uses \"cht\" where Scottish Gaelic uses \"chd\", although \"chd\" itself was once common in written Irish, as was \"cht\" in Scottish Gaelic – both being used in Classical Gaelic. In the combinations \"sc\"/\"sg\" and \"st\"/\"sd\", Irish now uses \"sc\" and \"st\", while Scottish Gaelic uses \"sg\" and both \"sd\" and \"st\".\n\nMost obvious differences in spelling result from the deletion of silent lenited digraphs (mainly \"dh\", \"gh\", and \"th\") in Irish in spelling reforms, which was only sometimes done in Scottish Gaelic. Overall, Scottish Gaelic orthography is more conservative than that of Irish.\n\n"}

{"id": "55566422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55566422", "title": "Doki Doki Literature Club!", "text": "Doki Doki Literature Club!\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club! is a 2017 American visual novel developed by Team Salvato for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. The story follows a male high school student who joins the school's Literature Club and interacts with its four female members. The game features a mostly linear story, with some alternate scenes and endings depending on the choices the player makes. While it appears at first glance to be a lighthearted dating simulator, it is in fact a psychological horror game that involves heavy use of breaking the fourth wall.\n\nThe game was developed in an estimated two-year period by a team led by Dan Salvato, known previously for his modding work for \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\". According to Salvato, the inspiration for the game came from his mixed feelings toward anime, and a fascination for surreal and unsettling experiences. Upon its release, \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" received critical praise for its metafictional and horror elements, with \"PC Gamer\" calling it \"one of the most surprising games of the year.\"\n\n\"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" is a visual novel, as such, the majority of the gameplay consists of the player reading the game's story with little impact on what direction the plot takes. At certain points in the game the player is prompted to make decisions which may affect how the story progresses. The game also features a poetry writing mechanic as part of the Literature Club. The player is given a list of various words to select from that will make up their poem. Each girl in the Literature Club has different word preferences, and will react when the player picks a word that they like. The player is able to create poems for only three of the four girls, which serves as a plot point in the game. Additional scenes can be unlocked for each girl if the player writes poems targeted at that girl's tastes, and chooses the correct dialogue options. If the player goes through all of the options, they will unlock an alternate ending. At one point in the game, the player is required to access the game's files and delete a specific file in order to progress further; throughout the game, files will be added and deleted automatically from the game.\n\nThe protagonist is invited by his childhood friend, Sayori, to join their high school's literature club. The protagonist then meets the other members of the club: Natsuki, Yuri, and the club president Monika. The protagonist starts to participate in the club's activities such as writing and sharing poetry, and grows close to the four girls. Many of the poems written by the four girls foreshadow or hint at their troubled home life, or depressed state.\n\nWhilst preparing for an upcoming school festival, Sayori reveals that she suffers from depression and confesses her love for the protagonist. As the day of the festival approaches, Sayori's usually bittersweet poem is replaced with a dark and morbid note repeatedly telling someone to get out of her head. When Sayori does not answer his text messages, the protagonist leaves the club meeting and rushes to Sayori's home, where he discovers that she has hanged herself. The game begins to glitch, and as the protagonist wonders if they could have saved Sayori, the game abruptly ends.\n\nThe player is sent back to the main menu, with all previous save files erased. The game starts as usual, but what used to be Sayori's text and name is replaced with unreadable text. The game suddenly glitches and restarts; however, Sayori is absent, and any previous references to her are either completely removed or replaced by glitches and meshes of portions of other characters' sprites. Monika instead invites the protagonist to the club. Unsettling events begin occurring: the game rewinds after the protagonist finds Yuri cutting herself, features disturbing bad endings such as Natsuki’s neck snapping, and refuses to accept dialog options that do not favor Monika. Yuri becomes increasingly psychotic and obsessive towards the protagonist, brutally insulting Natsuki and Monika and trying to keep the protagonist with her. Just before the festival, Yuri presents the protagonist with a stained, illegible poem, and apparitions of a faceless Natsuki appear. Yuri later confesses her love to the protagonist, then stabs herself to death, out of grief or excitement, depending on whether the protagonist accepted her confession. Due to another glitch, the protagonist unwittingly spends the weekend sitting by her body. On Monday, Natsuki enters, vomits at the sight of Yuri's corpse, and flees. Monika then appears, apologizes, and deletes the \"character files\" for Yuri and Natsuki, causing the game to restart once again.\n\nAfter being automatically taken to a new file, the protagonist is placed in a room with Monika seated across from them. Monika explains that she is aware that she is a character in a game, and that she is able to manipulate the game's files to alter the other characters' personalities or erase them altogether. She admits to making Sayori \"more and more depressed\" and \"amplifying Yuri's obsessive personality\" to make them more unlikable so the player would focus on her instead, having had an identity crisis from not being designed as a potential love interest. She confesses her love directly not to the protagonist, but to the player. Monika will sit and talk to the player indefinitely about various topics until the player manually enters the game's directory and deletes Monika's character file. Upon doing this, the game glitches once more and Monika panics as she is deleted from the game's world. Monika initially lashes out at the player, but after a pause, she confesses that she still loves the player, and expresses regret for everything she has done. Monika then restores the other girls, and removes herself from the game.\n\nChoices the player can make in the playthrough can lead to three possible conclusions.\n\nThe first (and default) ending, following Monika's removal from the directory, the game starts over once again with Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki all alive, playing out similarly to the initial playthrough. Shortly after meeting everyone, Sayori tells the player that now that she is the president of the literature club, she knows everything about the game and what happened with Monika, and intends to do the same thing Monika did. Monika immediately intervenes once more via text prompt and deletes Sayori to save the player. Monika then speaks audibly to the player, and sings a song titled \"Your Reality\" to the player while the credits roll and Monika slowly deletes the game. After the credits, the game displays a note from Monika, stating that she has disbanded the literature club because \"there is no happiness\" in it.\n\nAnother possible ending may take place if Monika's character file is prematurely deleted before starting a new game, resulting in Sayori becoming the default leader of the club. Upon realizing the true nature of the game and her role in it, Sayori will panic and hijack the controls, deletes all the character files, and forcefully closes it. Opening the game again will result to a black end screen followed by an image of Sayori hanging herself, staying with the screen after 10 minutes will reveal a message — \"Now everyone can be happy.\" \n\nHowever, an alternate ending may occur if the player has viewed all of the optional scenes in a single playthrough, which requires saving and loading at several points before witnessing Sayori's initial suicide. Sayori instead accepts the nature of her reality and tearfully expresses her gratitude to the player for trying to make all of the girls happy. She bids goodbye, hoping that the player will visit once again sometime and concluding that the girls all love the player before deleting the game herself. After the credits, which also feature \"Your Reality\", the player is presented with a thank-you note from the game's developer, Dan Salvato.\n\nIn all outcomes, further playthroughs require the game to be re-installed or hard reset.\n\nDan Salvato spent an estimated two years working on \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" in secret before releasing it as his first game. Prior to its release, Salvato was known for creating the \"FrankerFaceZ\" extension for Twitch.tv, his modding work in the \"Super Smash Bros\" scene, and for his custom \"Super Mario Maker\" levels.\n\n\"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" was first released on September 22, 2017 on itch.io, and was later also released on Steam. The game is available as freeware with an optional pay what you want model. Paying US$10 or more unlocks a bonus \"Fan Pack\" that includes desktop and mobile wallpapers, the game's official soundtrack, and a digital concept art booklet.\n\nSalvato cited his \"love-hate relationship\" with anime as inspiration for creating \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\". Discussing the horror elements of the game, Salvato explained that he was inspired by \"things that are scary because they make you uncomfortable, not because they shove scary-looking things in your face.\"\n\nAfter its release, \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" quickly gained a cult following.\n\nGita Jackson from Kotaku described \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" as \"a truly special game,\" adding \"if you like horror games, especially ones that really get under your skin, please check out \"Doki Doki Literature Club\".\" \"GQ\"s Tom Philip called it \"one of the scariest games I have ever played.\" He went on to praise the game's writing saying it contained \"some of the most wickedly inventive narrative techniques I've ever seen,\" but commented that at times it felt like \"a slog, clicking through endless amounts of inane, flirty conversation about poetry.\"\n\nIn its first three months of release, \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\" was downloaded over one million times, and exceeded two million downloads about a month later.\n\nAt IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, the game won the People's Choice Award each for \"Best PC Game\", \"Best Adventure Game\" (for which it was also a runner-up), \"Best Story\", and \"Most Innovative\". EGMNow ranked the game 16th in their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.

The term \"ethnogeny\" is also used as a variant of \"ethnogenesis\".\n\nEthnogenesis can occur passively, in the accumulation of markers of group identity forged through interaction with the physical environment, cultural and religious divisions between sections of a society, migrations and other processes, for which ethnic subdivision is an unintended outcome. It can occur actively, as persons deliberately and directly 'engineer' separate identities to attempt to solve a political problem – the preservation or imposition of certain cultural values, power relations, etc. Since the late eighteenth century, such attempts have often been related to language revival or creation of a new language, in what eventually becomes a \"national literature\".\n\nIn the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, societies challenged by the obsolescence of those narratives which previously afforded them coherence have fallen back on ethnic or racial narratives as a means of maintaining or reaffirming their collective identity, or \"polis\".\n\nEthnogenesis can be promoted to include or exclude any ethnic minority living within a certain country. In France, the integrationalist policy of the French Republic was inclusive; their laws stated all persons born or legally residing in France proper (including overseas departments and territories) were \"Frenchmen\". The law did not make any ethnic distinctions nor racial categories in between the \"French\" people. All people in France were Frenchmen and became citizens of the French Republic as far the country's law was concerned.\n\nLanguage has been a critical asset for authenticating ethnic identities. The process of reviving an antique ethnic identity often poses an immediate language challenge, as obsolescent languages lack expressions for contemporary experiences. In Europe in the 1990s, examples of proponents of ethnic revivals were from Celtic fringes in Wales and nationalists in the Basque Country. Activists' attempts since the 1970s to revive the Occitan language in Southern France are a similar example.\n\nSimilarly, in the 19th century, the Fennoman Grand Duchy of Finland aimed to raise the Finnish language from peasant-status to the position of an official national language, which had been only Swedish for some time. The Fennoman also founded the Finnish Party to pursue their nationalist aims. The publication in 1835 of the Finnish national epic, \"Kalevala\", was a founding stone of Finnish nationalism and ethnogenesis. Finnish was recognized as the official language of Finland only in 1892. Fennomans were opposed by the Svecomans, headed by Axel Olof Freudenthal (1836–1911). He supported continuing the use of Swedish as the official language; it had been a minority language used by the educated elite in government and administration. In line with contemporary scientific racism theories, Freudenthal believed that Finland had two \"races\", one speaking Swedish and the other Finnish. The Svecomans claimed that the Swedish \"Germanic race\" was superior to the majority Finnish people. In Ireland, revival of the Irish language was part of the reclaiming of Irish identity in the republic.\n\nLanguage has been an important and divisive political force in Belgium between the Dutch and Germanic Flemings and Franco-Celtic Walloons since the kingdom was created in 1831. Switzerland is divided among Alemannic German-speaking or \"Deutschschweizer\" against the French-speaking \"Romands\" or Arpitians, and the Italian/Lombard and Romansh-speaking minorities in the south and east.\n\nIn Italy, there were ethnological and linguistic differences between regional groups, from the Lombardians of the North to the Sicilians of the south. Mountainous terrain had allowed the development of relatively isolated communities and numerous dialects and languages before unification in the 19th century.\n\nThe set of cultural markers that accompanies each of the major religions may become a component of distinct ethnic identities, but they almost never exist in isolation. Ethnic definitions are subject to change over time, both within and outside groups. For example, 19th-century Europeans classified Jews and Arabs as one 'ethnic' bloc, the Semites or Hamites. Later, the term Hamites came to be associated with Sub-Saharan Africans instead.\n\nChristian, Jewish, Hindu and Muslim followers have historically been aligned with ethnicities (and later nations) speaking different languages and having different cultures that arise on the basis of the languages that followers of each religion historically favoured: (Latin and Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit and Arabic, respectively). The sources of religious differentiation are contested among sociologists and among anthropologists, as much as between the faith groups themselves.\n\nThe line between a well-defined religious sect and a discrete ethnicity cannot always be sharply defined. Sects that most observers would accept as constituting a separate ethnicity usually have, as a minimum, a firm set of rules related to maintenance of endogamy, censuring those who 'marry out' or who fail to raise their children in the proper faith. Examples might include the Amish, Druze, Mormons, Sikhs, Yazidi and Zoroastrians\n\nGeographical factors can lead to both cultural and genetic isolation from larger human societies. Groups which settle remote habitats and intermarry over generations will acquire distinctive cultural and genetic traits, evolving from cultural continuity and through interaction with their unique environmental circumstances. Ethnogenesis in these circumstances typically results in an identity that is less value-laden than one forged in contradistinction to competing populations. Particularly in pastoral mountain peoples, social organization tends to hinge primarily on familial identification, not a wider collective identity.\n\nAnthony D. Smith notes that in general there is a lack of evidence which hampers the assessement of existence of nations or nationalisms in antiquity. The two cases where more evidence exists are those of ancient Greece and Israel. In Ancient Greece a cultural rather than political unity is observed. Yet, there were ethnic divisions within the wider Hellenic ethnic community, mainly the divisions between Ionians, Aeolians, Boeotians and Dorians. These groups were further divided into city-states. Smith postulates that there is no more than a semblance of nationalism in ancient Greece.\n\nJonathan M. Hall's work “Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity” (1997), was acclaimed as the first full-length modern study on Ancient Greek ethnicity. According to Hall, Ancient Greek ethnic identity was much based on kinship, descent and genealogy, which was reflected in elaborate genealogy myths. On his view, genealogy is the most fundamental way any population defines itself as an ethnic group. There was a change in the way Greeks constructed their ethnic identity in the Persian Wars period (first half of 5th c BC). Before that (archaic period) Greeks tended to attach themselves to one another by a process of genealogical assimilation. After the Persian invasion, they tended to define themselves against the enemy they perceived as the barbarian “other”. An indication of this disposition is the Athenians' speech to their allies in 480 BC, mentioning that all Hellenes are bound with the \"homaimon\" (“same blood”), \"homoglosson\" (same language) and common religious practices. Hall believes that Hellenic identity was clearly envisaged in the 6th c. BC as being ethnic in character, cultural forms of identification emerged in the 5th century, and there is evidence that by the 4th century this identity was conceived more in cultural terms.\n\nHerwig Wolfram offers \"a radically new explanation of the circumstances under which the Goths were settled in Gaul, Spain and Italy\". Since \"they dissolved at their downfall into a myth accessible to everyone\" at the head of a long history of attempts to lay claim to a \"Gothic\" tradition, the ethnogenesis by which disparate bands came to self-identify as \"Goths\" is of wide interest and application. The problem is in extracting a historical ethnography from sources that are resolutely Latin and Roman-oriented.\n\nWith the arrival of the Spanish in southwestern North America, the Native Americans of the Jumano cultural sphere underwent social changes partly in reaction, which spurred their ethnogenesis, Clayton Anderson has observed. Ethnogenesis in the Texas Plains and along the coast took two forms: a disadvantaged group identified with a stronger group and became absorbed into it, on the one hand, and on the other hand, cultural institutions were modified and in a sense reinvented. The 17th-century Jumano disintegration, a collapse in part by the widespread deaths from introduced diseases, was followed by their reintegration as Kiowa, Nancy Hickerson has argued. Exterior stresses that produced ethnogenetic shifts preceded the arrival of the Spanish and their horse culture: recurring cycles of drought had previously forced non-kin to band together or to disband and mobilize. Intertribal hostilities forced weaker groups to associate with stronger ones.\n\nFrom 1539 to 1543, a Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto departed Cuba for Florida and the American Southeast. Although asked to practice restraint, Soto led 600 men on a violent rampage through present-day Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and East Texas. Frustrated with not finding gold or silver in the areas suspected to contain such valuable materials, they destroyed villages and decimated native populations. Despite his death in 1542, Soto's men continued their expedition until 1543 when about half of their original force reached Mexico. Their actions introduced European diseases that further weakened native populations. The population collapse forced natives to relocate from their cities into the countryside, where smaller villages and new political structures developed, replacing the older chiefdom models of tribal governance. By 1700, the major tribal settlements Soto and his men had encountered were no more. Smaller tribes began to form loose confederations of smaller, more autonomous villages. From that blending of many tribes, ethnogenesis led to the emergence of new ethnic groups and identities for the consolidated natives who had managed to survive the invasion of European people, animals, and diseases. After 1700, most North American Indian \"tribes\" were relatively new composite groups formed by these refugees who were trying to cope with massive epidemics and violence brought by the Europeans who were exploring the area.\n\nThe bringing of disease by the Europeans redistributed the indigenous communities and this caused a lot of war, disagreements (since they were going into each other's land and sacred areas), and a rise in mortality rates. Some Aboriginal groups were destroyed while some began to band together and create new Aboriginal groups within these areas of Canada.\n\nThe separate Moldovan ethnic identification was promoted under Soviet rule when the Soviet Union set up an autonomous Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924. It was set apart from the Ukrainian SSR on part of the territory between the Dniester and Southern Bug rivers (Transnistria). The scholar Charles King concluded that this action was in part a prop to Soviet propaganda and help for a potential communist revolution in Romania. At first, a Moldovan ethnicity supported territorial claims to the then-Romanian territories of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. The claims were based on the fact that the territory of eastern Bessarabia with Chisinau had belonged to the Russian Empire between 1812 and 1918. After having been for 500 years part of the Romanian Principality of Moldova, Russia was awarded the East of Moldova as a recompensation for its losses during the Napoleonic Wars: that was the beginning of the 100 years Russian history in East Moldova. After the Soviet occupation of the two territories in 1940, potential reunification claims were offset by the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. At the establishment of the Moldaivan ASSR, Chișinău was named its capital, a role which it continued to play after the formation of the Moldavian SSR in 1940.\n\nThe recognition of Moldovans as a separate ethnicity, distinct from Romanians, remains today a controversial subject. On one side, the Moldovan Parliament adopted in 2003 \"The Concept on National Policy of the Republic of Moldova\", which states that Moldovans and Romanians are two distinct peoples and speak two different languages, Romanians form an ethnic minority in Moldova, and the Republic of Moldova is the legitimate successor to the Principality of Moldavia. However, Moldovans are recognized as a distinct ethnic group only by former Soviet states.\n\nMoreover, in Romania, people from Wallachia and Transylvania call the Romanians inhabiting western Moldavia, now part of Romania, as Moldovans. People in Romanian Moldova call themselves Moldovans, as subethnic denomination, and Romanians, as ethnic denomination (like Kentish and English for English people living in Kent). Romanians from Romania call the Romanians of the Republic of Moldova Bessarabians, as identification inside the subethnic group, Moldovans as subethnic group and Romanians as ethnic group. The subethnic groups referred to here are historically connected to independent Principalities. The Principality of Moldavia/Moldova founded in 1349 had various extensions between 1349 and 1859 and comprised Bucovina and Bessarabia as regional subdivisions. That way, Romanians of southern Bukovina (today part of Romania and formerly part of the historical Moldova) are called Bukovinans, Moldovans and Romanians.\n\nIn the 2004 Moldovan Census, of the 3,383,332 people living in Moldova, 16.5% (558,508) chose Romanian as their mother tongue, and 60% chose Moldovan. While 40% of all urban Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as their mother tongue, in the countryside, barely one out of seven Romanian/Moldovan speakers indicated Romanian as his mother tongue.\n\nWithin the historical profession, the term \"ethnogenesis\" has been borrowed as a neologism to explain the origins and evolution of so-called barbarian ethnic cultures, stripped of its metaphoric connotations drawn from biology, of \"natural\" birth and growth. That view is closely associated with the Austrian historian Herwig Wolfram and his followers, who argued that such ethnicity was not a matter of genuine genetic descent (\"tribes\").\n\nRather, using Reinhard Wenskus' term \"Traditionskerne\" (\"nuclei of tradition\"), ethnogenesis arose from small groups of aristocratic warriors carrying ethnic traditions from place to place and generation to generation. Followers would coalesce or disband around these nuclei of tradition; ethnicities were available to those who wanted to participate in them with no requirement of being born into a \"tribe\". Thus, questions of race and place of origin became secondary.\n\nProponents of ethnogenesis may claim it is the only alternative to the sort of ethnocentric and nationalist scholarship that is commonly seen in disputes over the origins of many ancient peoples such as the Franks, Goths, and Huns. It has also been used as an alternative to the Near East's \"race history\" that had supported Phoenicianism and claims to the antiquity of the variously called Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac peoples.\n\n"}

{"id": "1325485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1325485", "title": "Feast of the Ascension", "text": "Feast of the Ascension\n\nThe Feast of the Ascension of Jesus Christ, also known as Holy Thursday, Ascension Day, or Ascension Thursday, commemorates the Christian belief of the bodily Ascension of Jesus into heaven. It is one of the ecumenical (i.e., universally celebrated) feasts of Christian churches, ranking with the feasts of the Passion, of Easter, and Pentecost. Ascension Day is traditionally celebrated on a Thursday, the fortieth day of Easter (following the accounts given in , and \n), although some Christian denominations have moved the observance to the following Sunday.\n\nThe observance of this feast is of great antiquity. Eusebius seems to hint at the celebration of it in the 4th century. At the beginning of the 5th century, St. Augustine says that it is of Apostolic origin, and he speaks of it in a way that shows it was the universal observance of the Church long before his time. Frequent mention of it is made in the writings of St. John Chrysostom, St. Gregory of Nyssa, and in the \"Constitution of the Apostles\". The \"Pilgrimage of Aetheria\" speaks of the vigil of this feast and of the feast itself, as they were kept in the church built over the grotto in Bethlehem in which Christ is traditionally regarded as having been born. It may be that prior to the 5th century the event narrated in the Gospels was commemorated in conjunction with the feast of Easter or Pentecost. Some believe that the much-disputed forty-third decree of the Synod of Elvira (c. 300) condemning the practice of observing a feast on the fortieth day after Easter and neglecting to keep Pentecost on the fiftieth day, implies that the proper usage of the time was to commemorate the Ascension along with Pentecost. Representations of the mystery are found in diptychs and frescoes dating as early as the 5th century.\n\nThe Latin terms used for the feast, \"ascensio\" and, occasionally, \"ascensa\", signify that Christ was raised up by his own powers, and it is from these terms that the holy day gets its name. In the Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Communion, \"Holy Thursday\" is listed as another name for Ascension Day. William Blake's poem \"Holy Thursday\" refers to Ascension Day; Thomas Pruen used the term to refer to Ascension Day in his \"Illustration of the Liturgy of the Church of England\", published in 1820; however use of the term \"Holy Thursday\" to mean Ascension Day is rare, and the term is more generally applied by most Christian denominations to Maundy Thursday in Holy Week.\n\nIn Western Christianity, the earliest possible date is April 30 (as in 1818 and 2285), the latest possible date is June 3 (as in 1943 and 2038). In Roman Catholicism, the Ascension of the Lord is a Holy Day of Obligation and in the Anglican Communion, Holy Thursday is a Principal Feast.\n\nThe three days before Ascension Thursday are sometimes referred to as the Rogation days, and the previous Sunday — the Sixth Sunday of Easter (or the Fifth Sunday \"after\" Easter) — as Rogation Sunday.\n\nAscension has a vigil and, since the 15th century, an octave, which is set apart for a novena of preparation for Pentecost.\n\nIn traditional Methodist usage, \"The Book of Worship for Church and Home\" (1965) provides the following Collect for Ascension Day, commonly called Holy Thursday: \n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in a number of countries that do not observe the feast as a public holiday has obtained permission from the Vatican to move observance of the Feast of the Ascension from the traditional Thursday to the following Sunday, the Sunday before Pentecost. Similarly, The United Methodist Church allows the traditional celebration on Holy Thursday to be moved to Sunday. This is in keeping with a trend to move Holy Days of Obligation from weekdays to Sunday, to encourage more Christians to observe feasts considered important. The decision to move a feast is made by the bishops of an ecclesiastical province, i.e. an archbishop and the neighbouring bishops. The switch to Sunday was made in 1992 by the church in Australia; before 1996 in parts of Europe; in 1997 in Ireland; before 1998 in Canada and parts of the western United States; in many other parts in the United States from 1999; and in England and Wales from 2007-2017, but in 2018 reinstated to Thursday. The U.S. ecclesiastical provinces which retain Thursday observance in 2009 are Boston, Hartford, New York, Newark, Omaha, and Philadelphia. When celebrated on Sunday, the earliest possible date is May 3, and the latest is June 6.\n\nIn the Eastern Church this feast is known in Greek as \"Analepsis\", the \"taking up\", and also as the \"Episozomene\", the \"salvation from on high\", denoting that by ascending into his glory Christ completed the work of our redemption. Ascension is one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the Orthodox liturgical year.\nThe feast is always observed with an All-night vigil. The day before is the Apodosis (leave-taking) of Easter (i.e., the last day of the Feast of Easter). Before the Vigil, the Paschal hours are said for the last time and the Paschal greeting is exchanged.\n\nThe \"Paroemia\" (Old Testament readings) at Vespers on the eve of the Feast are ; , ; and , . A Lity is celebrated. The troparion of the day is sung, which says:\n\nDuring the Polyeleos at Matins, the Epitaphios, which was placed on the altar on Holy Saturday (either at Matins or the Midnight Office, depending on local custom) is taken from the altar and carried in procession around the church. It is then put in the place reserved for it. The Gospel is . The kontakion is sung, which announces:\n\nThe megalynarion and irmos from Ode IX of the Canon (also sung at liturgy) is:\n\nAt the Divine Liturgy, special antiphons are sung in place of Psalms 102 and 145 and the Beatitudes. The Epistle is , and the Gospel is .\n\nAscension Thursday also commemorates the Holy Georgian Martyrs of Persia (17th–18th centuries).\n\nAscension has an Afterfeast of eight days. The Sunday after Ascension is the Sunday of the Holy Fathers of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea. This council formulated the Nicene Creed up to the words, \"He (Jesus) ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and shall come again, with glory, to judge the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end.\" The Afterfeast ends on the following Friday, the Friday before Pentecost. The next day is appropriately a Saturday of the Dead (general commemoration of all faithful departed).\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church uses a different method of calculating the date of Easter, so the Eastern Orthodox commemoration of Ascension will usually be after the western observance (either one week, or four weeks, or five weeks later; but occasionally on the same day). The earliest possible date for the feast is May 13 (of the western calendar), and the latest possible date is June 16. Some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, however, observe Ascension on the same date as the Western Churches.\n\nCertain customs or rituals were connected with the liturgy of this feast, such as the blessing of beans and grapes after the Commemoration of the Dead in the Canon of the Mass, the blessing of first fruits, afterwards done on Rogation Days, the blessing of a candle, the wearing of mitres by deacon and subdeacon, the extinguishing of the paschal candle, and triumphal processions with torches and banners outside the churches to commemorate the entry of Christ into heaven.\n\nThe antiquarian Daniel Rock records the English custom of carrying at the head of the procession the banner bearing the device of the lion and at the foot the banner of the dragon, to symbolize the triumph of Christ in his ascension over the evil one (and can also be interpreted by analogy as the triumph of England over Wales). In some churches the scene of the Ascension was vividly reproduced by elevating the figure of Christ above the altar through an opening in the roof of the church. In others, whilst the figure of Christ was made to ascend, that of the devil was made to descend.\n\nIn England it was once common for churches to \"beat the bounds\" on this day, and some continue the custom (e.g. the church of St Michael at the North Gate in Oxford). Members of the parish walk round the parish boundaries, marking boundary stones (e.g. by writing on them in chalk) and hitting them with sticks. According to some, it was once the young boys of the parish that were hit with sticks instead of the stones. Knowledge of the parish boundaries was once important, since churches had certain duties such as the care of children born out of wedlock in the parish.\n\nIn some countries () it is a public holiday; Germany also holds its Fathers' Day on the same date.\n\nCoinciding with the liturgical feast is the annual commemoration by the Christian labour movement (especially syndical, in Belgium) of the encyclical \"Rerum novarum\" issued by the Roman Catholic Pope Leo XIII on May 15, 1891.\n\nIn Venice the ceremony of the Wedding with the Sea was traditionally celebrated on the Feast of the Ascension, while in Florence the Feast was observed by having a dove slide down a string from the high altar of the cathedral to ignite a large decorative container filled with fireworks in front of the main entrance of the cathedral.\n\nIn Portugal on \"Wheatstalk Thursday\", small bundles of poppies and wheatstalks are picked in the fields and placed at home until next year, for good fortune.\n\nThe feast has been associated with specific hymns and other church music. The oldest hymn in German related to the feast is the Leise \"Christ fuhr gen Himmel\", first published in 1480. Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas and the \"Ascension Oratorio\" to be performed in church services on the feast day. He first performed \"Wer da gläubet und getauft wird, BWV 37\", on 18 May 1724, \"Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein, BWV 128\", on 10 May 1725, \"Gott fähret auf mit Jauchzen, BWV 43\", on 30 May 1726 and the oratorio, \"Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen, BWV 11\", on 19 May 1735.\n\n"}

They were compiled in the kingdom of Osraige, probably in the lifetime of Donnchad mac Gilla Pátraic (died 1039), king of Osraige and of king of Leinster. A major narrative within the text is the so-called \"Osraige Chronicle\" (as proposed by Radner) which greatly focuses on the exploits of the ninth century king of Osraige, Cerball mac Dúnlainge, who was the paternal ancestor of the medieval Mac Giolla Phádraig family.\n\nThe \"Fragmentary Annals\" were copied in 1643 for the Rev. John Lynch by Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh from a lost 15th-century vellum manuscript, which belonged to Giolla na Naomh Mac Aodhagáin (Nehemias MacEgan). Mac Aodhagáin, who died around 1443, was a professor of Irish Brehon Law in Ormond. The sole surviving manuscript of the \"Fragmentary Annals\", which is currently held by the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels, is not in Mac Fhirbhisigh's hand, but in that of an anonymous scribe, who made a fair copy of Mac Fhirbhisigh's text, adding some marginal comments of his own and an index. The manuscript (MS. 7, c. n. 17) is incomplete and includes five fragments of annals beginning in 573 and ending in 914. What has survived joins the synopsis of the hypothetical Chronicle of Ireland.\n\nLittle is known of the lost exemplar from which Mac Fhirbhisigh worked. He appears to have modernized the orthography of the original text as he copied it. There are lacunae in places where the exemplar could no longer be read due to its poor condition. Mac Fhirbhisigh's copyist added dates, which he took from the \"Annals of the Four Masters\" without troubling to confirm their accuracy or correct them where they were clearly in error.\n\nThe first fragment relates mainly to the Northern Uí Néill and may have been compiled in Ulster, but the remaining fragments were evidently compiled in Osraige (Ossory), a kingdom which corresponded approximately to the later County Kilkenny and western County Laois. The original compiler evidently drew upon a variety of sources, some of which (e.g. annals) were probably more accurate and trustworthy than others (e.g. long bardic works). The fragments combine cold annalistic records with romantic tales and extravagant flights of fancy in a manner that is unique among the Irish annals.\n\nTwo modern editions of the \"Fragmentary Annals\" have been published:\n\n\n\n"}

The museum also has a document archive for genealogical research, including Census records from 1841 to 1891 and a partial record of births, marriages and deaths in the Glen and the parishes of Edzell and Lethnot. This room has computers.\n\nThe museum has a small collection of musical instruments, highlights of which include a trapezoidal Savart-style violin that was played for many years on the streets of Aberdeen by an itinerant musician, and a coach horn known to have been used locally as late as the 1930s on one of the last horse-drawn stagecoaches operating in the United Kingdom.\n\nSince its foundation, the Retreat has sold locally produced goods, and this continues in the gift shop. There is also a tearoom with home-cooked food.\n\nThe Retreat also has conference facilities, a function room, a nature trail and a children's play area.\n\nRegular craft workshops are run on-site, along with other events which have included music recitals and storytelling.\n\n"}
{"id": "46738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46738", "title": "Goliath", "text": "Goliath\n\nGoliath is described in the biblical Book of Samuel as a Philistine giant defeated by the young David in single combat. The story signified Saul's unfitness to rule, as Saul himself should have fought for the Kingdom of Israel.\n\nThe phrase \"David and Goliath\" (or \"David versus Goliath\") has taken on a more popular meaning, denoting an underdog situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary.\n\nSaul and the Israelites are facing the Philistines in the Valley of Elah. Twice a day for 40 days, morning and evening, Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in single combat, but Saul is afraid. David, bringing food for his elder brothers, hears that Goliath has defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling and five stones from a brook.\n\nDavid and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. \"The Philistine cursed David by his gods\", but David replies: \"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand.\"\n\nDavid hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites \"as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron\". David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to Jerusalem, and Saul sends Abner to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\"\n\nThe Books of Samuel, together with the books of Joshua, Judges and Kings, make up a unified history of Israel which biblical scholars call the Deuteronomistic history. The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah's King Josiah (late 7th century) and a revised second edition during the exile (6th century), with further revisions in the post-exilic period. Traces of this can be seen in the contradictions and illogicalities of the Goliath story - to take a few examples, David turns from Saul's adult shield-bearer into a child herding sheep for his father, Saul finds it necessary to send for him when as the king's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master, and then has to ask who David is, which sits strangely with David's status at his court. The Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile: \n\nGoliath's stature as described in various ancient manuscripts varies: the oldest manuscripts, the Dead Sea Scrolls text of Samuel, the 1st-century historian Josephus, and the 4th-century Septuagint manuscripts, all give his height as \"four cubits and a span\" (), whereas the Masoretic Text gives this as \"six cubits and a span\" (). Scholars generally agree that the shorter height found in the Greek text is older and more original.\n\nThe underlying purpose of the story of Goliath is to show that Saul is not fit to be king (and that David is). Saul was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, but when faced with Goliath he refuses to do so; Goliath is a giant, and Saul is a very tall man. Saul's exact height is not given, but he was a head taller than anyone else in all Israel (1 Samuel 9:2), which implies he was over tall and supposed to be the obvious challenger for Goliath, yet, David is the one who eventually defeated him. Also, Saul's armour and weaponry are apparently no worse than Goliath's (and David, of course, refuses Saul's armour in any case). \"David declares that when a lion or bear came and attacked his father's sheep, he battled against it and killed it, [but Saul] has been cowering in fear instead of rising up and attacking the threat to his sheep (i.e. Israel).\"\n\n2 Samuel 21:19 tells how Goliath the Gittite was killed by \"Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite.\" According to Baruch Halperin, \"Most likely, storytellers displaced the deed from the otherwise obscure Elhanan onto the more famous character, David.\" The fourth-century BC 1 Chronicles explains the second Goliath by saying that Elhanan \"slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath\", constructing the name Lahmi from the last portion of the word \"Bethlehemite\" (\"beit-ha’lahmi\"), and the King James Bible adopted this into 2 Samuel 21:18–19, although the Hebrew text at this point makes no mention of the word \"brother\".\n\nThe armor described in 1 Samuel 17 appears typical of Greek armor of the sixth century BCE rather than of Philistines armor of the tenth century. Narrative formulae such as the settlement of battle by single combat between champions has been thought characteristic of the Homeric epics (the \"Iliad\"), rather than of the ancient Near East. The designation of Goliath as a , \"man of the in-between\" (a longstanding difficulty in translating 1 Samuel 17) appears to be a borrowing from Greek \"man of the \"\" ()\", i.e. the space between two opposite army camps where champion combat would take place.\n\nA story very similar to that of David and Goliath appears in the Iliad, written circa 760–710 BCE, where the young Nestor fights and conquers the giant Ereuthalion. Each giant wields a distinctive weapon—an iron club in Ereuthalion's case, a massive bronze spear in Goliath's; each giant, clad in armor, comes out of the enemy's massed array to challenge all the warriors in the opposing army; in each case the seasoned warriors are afraid, and the challenge is taken up by a stripling, the youngest in his family (Nestor is the twelfth son of Neleus, David the seventh or eighth son of Jesse). In each case an older and more experienced father figure (Nestor's own father, David's patron Saul) tells the boy that he is too young and inexperienced, but in each case the young hero receives divine aid and the giant is left sprawling on the ground. Nestor, fighting on foot, then takes the chariot of his enemy, while David, on foot, takes the sword of Goliath. The enemy army then flees, the victors pursue and slaughter them and return with their bodies, and the boy-hero is acclaimed by the people.\n\nTell es-Safi, the biblical Gath and traditional home of Goliath, has been the subject of extensive excavations by Israel's Bar-Ilan University. The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. A potsherd discovered at the site, and reliably dated to the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names \"alwt\" and \"wlt\". While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath (\"glyt\"), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of late-tenth/early-ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name \"Goliath\" itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the Lydian king Alyattes, which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story. A similar name, Uliat, is also attested in Carian inscriptions. Aren Maeir, director of the excavation, comments: \"Here we have very nice evidence [that] the name Goliath appearing in the Bible in the context of the story of David and Goliath … is not some later literary creation.\"\n\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 42b) Goliath was a son of Orpah, the sister-in-law of Ruth, David's own great grandmother (Ruth → Obed → Jesse → David). Ruth Rabbah, a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the Book of Ruth, makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the Jerusalem Talmud Goliath was born by polyspermy, and had about one hundred fathers.\n\nThe Talmud stresses Goliath's ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the Ark of the Covenant and brought it to the temple of Dagon; and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening in order to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armour weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi Hanina; 120, according to rabbi Abba bar Kahana; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvellous powers. On his death it was found that his heart carried the image of Dagon, who thereby also came to a shameful downfall.\n\nIn Pseudo-Philo, believed to have been composed between 135 BC and 70 AD, David picks up seven stones and writes on them his father's name, his own name, and the name of God, one name per stone; then, speaking to Goliath, he says \"Hear this word before you die: were not the two woman from whom you and I were born, sisters? And your mother was Orpah and my mother Ruth ...\" After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies and Goliath says \"Hurry and kill me and rejoice.\" and David replies \"Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer.\" Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David's appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.\n\nGoliath appears in chapter 2 of the Qur'an (2: 247–252), in the narrative of David and Saul's battle against the Philistines. Called \" in Arabic (\"), Goliath's mention in the Quran is concise, though it remains a parallel to the account in the Hebrew Bible. Muslim scholars have tried to trace Goliath's origins, most commonly with the Amalekites. Goliath, in early scholarly tradition, became a kind of byword or collective name for the oppressors of the Israelite nation before David. Muslim tradition sees the battle with the Philistines as a prefiguration of Muhammad's battle of Badr, and sees Goliath as parallel to the enemies that Muhammad faced.\n\nAmerican actor Ted Cassidy portrayed Goliath in the TV series \"Greatest Heroes of the Bible\" in 1978. Italian actor Luigi Montefiori portrayed this nine-foot-tall giant in Paramount's 1985 live-action movie \"King David\" as part of a flashback. This movie includes the King of the Philistines saying, \"Goliath has challenged the Israelites six times and no one has responded.\" It's then on the seventh time that David meets his challenge.\n\nThe PBS series \"Wishbone\" featured Goliath in its first-season episode \"Little Big Dog\".\n\nBig Idea's popular \"VeggieTales\" episode was called \"Dave and the Giant Pickle\", where Phil Vischer voiced Goliath.\n\nIn 1972, Toho and Tsuburaya Productions collaborated on a movie called \"Daigoro vs. Goliath\", which follows the story relatively closely but recasts the main characters as Kaiju.\n\nIn 1975, Israeli band Poogy release a song called \"Golyat\" on the album \"Tzafoof BaOzen\", loosely and humorously based on the story.\n\nSuzanne Vega's song \"Rock In This Pocket (Song Of David)\" on the album \"99.9°F\" is based on the story.\n\nIn 2005, Lightstone Studios released a direct-to-DVD movie musical titled \"One Smooth Stone\", which was later changed to \"David and Goliath\". It is part of the Liken the Scriptures (now just Liken) series of movie musicals on DVD based on scripture stories. Thurl Bailey, a former NBA basketball player, was cast to play the part of Goliath in this film.\n\nIn 2009, NBC aired Kings which has a narrative loosely based on the Biblical story of King David, but set in a kingdom that culturally and technologically resembles the present-day United States. The part of Goliath is portrayed by a tank, which David destroys with a shoulder fired rocket launcher.\n\nGoliath was portrayed by Conan Stevens in the 2013 TV miniseries \"The Bible\".\n\nThe Italians used Goliath as an action superhero in a series of biblical adventure films (peplums) in the early 1960s. He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their Hercules and Maciste movies. After the classic \"Hercules\" (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 Steve Reeves film \"Terrore dei Barbari\" (\"Terror of the Barbarians\") was retitled \"Goliath and the Barbarians\" in the United States, (after Joseph E. Levine claimed the sole right to the name of \"Hercules\"); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. (The 1960 Italian film \"David and Goliath\" starring Orson Welles was not one of these, since that movie was a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical story).\n\nThe four titles in the Italian \"Goliath\" series were as follows:\n\nThe name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath movies in Italy.\n\nBoth \"Goliath and the Vampires\" (1961) and \"Goliath and the Sins of Babylon\" (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors didn't feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences. \"Goliath and the Dragon\" (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules movie called \"The Revenge of Hercules\".\n\nIn modern usage, the phrase \"David and Goliath\" has taken on a secular meaning, denoting an underdog situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary; if successful, the underdog may win in an unusual or surprising way. It is arguably the most famous underdog story.\n\nTheology professor Leonard Greenspoon, in his essay, \"David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages\", explains that \"most writers use the story for its underdog overtones (the little guy wins) ... Less likely to show up in newsprint is the contrast that was most important to the biblical authors: David's victory shows the power of his God, while Goliath's defeat reveals the weakness of the Philistine deities.\"\n\nThe phrase is widely used in news media to succinctly characterize underdog situations in many contexts without religious overtones. Recent headlines include: sports (\"Haye relishes underdog role in 'David and Goliath' fight with Nikolai Valuev\"—\"The Guardian\"); business (\"On Internet, David-and-Goliath Battle Over Instant Messages\"—\"The New York Times\"); science (\"David and Goliath: How a tiny spider catches much larger prey\"—\"ScienceDaily\"; politics (\"Dissent in Cuba: David and Goliath\"—\"The Economist\"); social justice (\"David-and-Goliath Saga Brings Cable to Skid Row\"—\"Los Angeles Times\").\n\n\n"}

The first printing was in December 1552, in the workshop of Agustín Millán in Zaragoza, published under the title \"Primera y segunda parte de la Historia General de las Indias con todo el descubrimiento y cosas notables que han acaecido dende que se ganaron hasta el año de 1551. Con la conquista de México de la Nueva España\" (\"First and Second Parts of the General History of the Indies, with the Discovery and Notable Events that have Occurred Since They Were Won until the Year 1551. With the Conquest of Mexico of New Spain\")\n\nThe work was revised and published with different titles in subsequent years. The Spanish Crown forbade publication in 1556, but it was published in other languages up to 1605. For almost one hundred and fifty years it fell out of publication. Modern editions usually focus on the portion of the text relating to the conquest of Mexico.\n\nIn 1553 the work was republished by the same publisher, and under the same name as the original. Another edition of the work published in the same year was titled \"Hispania Victrix, primera y segunda parte de la Historia General de las Indias con todo el descubrimiento y cosas notables que han acaecido dende que se ganaron hasta el año de 1551. Con la conquista de México de la Nueva España\" (\"Hispania Victrix, First and Second Parts of the General History of the Indies, with the Discovery and Notable Events that have Occurred Since it was Won until the Year 1551. With the Conquest of Mexico of New Spain\"), published in Medina del Campo, in the house of Guillermo de Millis. In this printing, the work has an introductory letter dedicated to the \"emperador de romanos y rey de España Carlos I de España, señor de las Indias y del Nuevo Mundo\" (\"Emperor of the Romans and King of Spain Carlos V, Lord of the Indies and of the New World\"):\n\nIn 1554 the author added dates, for which reason the release was titled \"La historia General de las Indias y Nuevo Mundo, con más de la conquista del Perú y de México\" (\"The General History of the Indies and the New World, with More on the Conquest of Peru and Mexico\"), published in Zaragoza in the house of Pedro Bernuz.\n\nIn the second part, the author added a dedication to \"muy ilustre señor don Martín Cortés, marqués del Valle\" (\"Very illustrious Don Martín Cortés, marquess of the Valley\") :\n\nThe book was a success and was translated into Italian, French, and English. It was published in Rome, Venice, Paris and London, with new editions outside of Spain published between 1556 until 1605.\n\nIn Spain, the publication of the book was banned by royal decree in 1556, which also ordered confiscation of copies already published.\n\nGómara never traveled to America, but he took note of news that reached Spain, aided by the limited maps of the conquered territories. His sources were manuscripts and writings of friar Toribio de Benavente \"Motolinia\", Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, Pedro de Alvarado, Andrés de Tapia and the interviews he had with Hernán Cortés.\n\nThe Peruvian writer known as \"Inca Garcilaso de la Vega\" used the book as a source for his book, \"Comentarios Reales de los Incas\". A copy of \"Historia general de las Indias\" annotated by Garcilaso de la Vega remains extant. Francisco Cervantes de Salazar copied much of Gomara's book to make his \"Crónica de la Nueva España\".\n\nOn the other side, Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who had been a soldier in the expeditions and conquests, heavily criticized the book in his \"Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España\", in particular because Gómara had never set foot in the Americas, and for the book's praising of Hernán Cortés, without giving credit to others involved. Nevertheless, he referenced the timeline of the work while composing his own account.\n\nFriar Bartolomé de las Casas detested the book for its glorification of Hernán Cortés. The Spanish Crown also disagreed with the excessive glorification of Cortés.\n\nThe publication of the book was banned by royal decree, a ban reaffirmed during the reign of Philip II of Spain and which was in effect for many years. There was never a formal explanation for the ban, but it could have been because of the excessive praise of Cortés, for the criticisms directed at the Catholic Monarchs, if not for the manner in which it referred to Francisco de los Cobos, secretary of Carlos V. The writer had the consolation that it was published in other languages.\n\n\"The Prince.

This translation greatly influenced sixteenth-century French thinkers, among whom Michel de Montaigne, who drew on Fumée's edition numerous times in writing his essay \"Des coches\" (1588, essay III, 6 of the Essais).\n\nIn 1749 Gómara's work was republished, included in the second of a three volume collection by Andrés González de Barcia, entitled \"Historiadores primitivos de las Indias Occidentales, Vol II\" (\"Primitive Historians of the Occidental Indies, Volume II\") published in Madrid.

{"id": "23700077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23700077", "title": "LGBT themes in Chinese mythology", "text": "LGBT themes in Chinese mythology\n\nChinese mythology has been described as \"rich in stories about homosexuality\", reflecting ancient Chinese perspectives toward variance in sexuality and gender, rather than modern views. Chinese myths and traditional folk tales are greatly influenced by religious beliefs, particularly Taoist, Confucian, and Buddhist.\n\nMyths include instances of changing gender and sexual activity between members of the same sex, or between humans and supernatural creatures that assume a form of the same sex.\n\nChinese mythology has been described as \"rich in stories about homosexuality\". The mythological stories and folklore of China reflect ancient Chinese perspectives toward homosexuality, rather than modern views. These myths are greatly influenced by religious beliefs, particularly Taoist and Confucian, and later incorporated Buddhist teachings. Homosexuality in Chinese myths or folk tales may involve explicit physical contact, but may also be represented by more \"profound emotions and feelings\", making it difficult to unambiguously differentiate a homoerotic relationship from other social relationships, such as a friendship or rivalry. Sexual activity in Chinese myth is often described metaphorically, for example, in military terms. This leads some readers to interpret scenes of combat figuratively, as sexual metaphors. Popular folk stories are generally more explicit about same-sex romantic encounters than later literary re-tellings. Male and female homosexuality were considered to be unrelated in ancient China, and there are very few descriptions of lesbianism in traditional Chinese texts.\n\nThe pre-Taoist, pre-Confucian tradition of China was predominantly shamanistic, with the majority of shamans being female. Male same-sex love was believed to have originated in the mythical south, thus homosexuality is sometimes still called \"Southern wind\". From this period, numerous spirits or deities were associated with homosexuality, bisexuality and transgenderism. These include Chou Wang, Lan Caihe - one of the Eight Immortals, Shan Gu, and Yu the Great, and Gun.\n\nReligious Taoism is generally considered to be polytheistic. Its many deities, although unified by the idea and practice of Tao, are often pictured as part of a heavenly hierarchy that mirrors the bureaucracy of Imperial China. According to the beliefs of Religious Taoism, Chinese deities may be promoted or demoted for their actions. Some deities are also simply exalted humans, such as Guan Yu, the god of honor and piety. The particular deities worshipped vary according to geographical regions and historical periods in China, though the general pattern of worship is more constant.\n\nSexual abstinence is seen as virtuous if it results from self-denial, allowing greater attention to spiritual or heroic matters. This is not the case if abstinence is the result of castration. Eunuchs in Chinese myths are usually portrayed as \"greedy, temperamental and cowardly\", with a similar lack of self-discipline as women.\n\nWomen's Kingdom (or Women's Country) is a country situated in Southern Tibet or on an isolated Island. The island is believed to be inaccessible to normal travel due to its being surrounded by water of less-than-usual density, causing ships to sink. Occasional travellers have found themselves transported to the island by whirlwinds and reported that it is inhabited solely by women. These women have a fully functional community without men, and the only relationships are therefore between women. These women reproduce themselves by sleeping outdoors, where they become pregnant through the action of the southern wind blowing across their bodies, or by bathing in pools of water. Any male babies that are born die before the age of three.\n\nAnother Women's Kingdom exists in folklore. This is a mythical land, in which men and women have their social roles reversed. Men are called women, and run the household while wearing traditional women's clothes. Conversely, women dress in men's boots and hats and are in charge of public affairs. The folk belief in this Women's Kingdom is best known from the eighteenth-century novel \"Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror\".\nHomosexual encounters are common in Chinese folk stories. The \"Xian\" (animal spirits or fairies) often choose same-sex partners, usually young men or boys. Some stories show Xian asking the Lord of the Fairies permission to stay with their male lovers for some time, which could be as long as years, due to time's passing differently in the fairy realm. If the Lord of the Fairies remembers, he may cut the relationship short, hence such relationships are often short, with melancholic endings as the human participant is abandoned. A Xian-human relationship is seen in the tale of \"The Scholar and the Flower Spirit\".\n\nOne exception to the age preference for younger men is shown by the dragon, a powerful mythological beast, and a phallic symbol of male potency. According to Xiaomingxiong, Chinese dragons \"consistently enjoy sexual relationships with older men\", one example being in the tale of \"Old Farmer and a Dragon\", in which a sixty-year-old farmer is forcibly sodomised by a passing dragon, resulting in wounds from penetration and bites that require medical attention.\n\nOther stories that feature homoerotic interactions or transgender figures include \"The Farmer and the Pig\" and \"Fox Fairy and a Scholar\".\n\nGuan Yu, the deified military leader, is described in legend as \"unmoved by beautiful women\". This has been read as denoting asexuality by most commentators, rather than a homosexual subtext, but in folklore his relationships with his (not blood-related) brothers are assumed to have a homoerotic component.\n\nAlthough the literature of some taoist schools included homosexuality as one of the forms of sexual misconduct, Tu Er Shen is a deity in Chinese folklore who is popularly said to manage the love and sex between homosexual men. His name literally means \"rabbit deity\". According to \"The Tale of the Rabbit God\" in the \"Zi Bu Yu\", Tu Er Shen was originally a man called Hu Tianbao, who fell in love with a handsome young imperial inspector of the Fujian Province. One day Hu Tianbao was caught peeping on the inspector, at which point he confessed his reluctant affections for the other man. The imperial inspector had Hu Tianbao sentenced to death by beating. Since his crime was one of love, underworld officials decided to right the injustice by delegating Hu Tianbao as the god and safeguarder of homosexual affections. In order to cater to the needs of modern homosexuals, worship of the Rabbit God has been resuscitated in Taiwan: a temple was founded in Yonghe City by a gay, Taoist priest.\n"}

At its dedication on October 3, 1960, the library contained a collection of 20,000 books, 17,000 manuscripts, more than fifty oil paintings, and 300 prints. Currently, the Lilly Library has 8.5 million manuscripts, 450,000 books, 60,000 comic books, 16,000 mini books, 35,000 puzzles, and 150,000 sheets of music.\n\nThe Lilly Library was founded in 1960 with the collection of Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., owner of Lilly Pharmaceuticals in Indianapolis. J.K. Lilly was a collector most of his life. From the mid-1920s until his death, he devoted a great deal of his leisure time to building his collections of books and manuscripts, works of art, coins, stamps, military miniatures, firearms and edged weapons, and nautical models. J. K. Lilly's collections of books and manuscripts, totaling more than 20,000 books and 17,000 manuscripts, together with more than fifty oil paintings and 300 prints, were given by the collector to Indiana University between 1954 and 1957. These materials form the foundation of the rare book and manuscript collections of the Lilly Library.\n\nThe extent to which J. K. Lilly realized his collecting goals was summed up by Frederick B. Adams, Jr., at the dedication of the Lilly Library on October 3, 1960: \"Mr. Lilly's books cover so many fields that it is difficult to believe that any one man's enthusiasm could encompass them all. It is equally astounding that he was able to acquire so many books of such scarcity and quality in the short space of 30 years. Money alone isn't the answer; diligence, courage, and imagination were also essential. The famous books in English and American literature, the books most influential in American life, the great works in the history of science and ideas--all these are among the 20,000 Lilly books in this building.\"\n\nThe library now contains approximately 450,000 books, 8.5 million manuscripts, 60,000 comic books, 16,000 mini books, 35,000 puzzles, and 150,000 pieces of sheet music.\n\nThe library's holdings are particularly strong in British and American history and literature, Latin Americana, medicine and science, food and drink, children's literature, fine printing and binding, popular music, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, and early printing. There are many notable items in the library's collections.\n\n\nThe library also owns the papers of Hollywood directors Orson Welles and John Ford, film critic Pauline Kael, the poets Sylvia Plath and Ezra Pound, and authors Edith Wharton and Upton Sinclair.\n\nAfter the death of Ruth E. Adomeit in 1996, her collection of miniature books was donated to the Lilly. The Adomeit collection is considered to be one of the largest collections of miniature books. The collection is titled 4000 Years of Miniature Books.\n\nThe Adomeit collection ranges the entire history of human record keeping in miniature form, from cuneiform tablets of circa 2000 B.C. to contemporary small press and artists' books.\n\nMichael Uslan, producer of the Batman movies, donated over 30,000 comics to the Lilly Library. Parts of the collection were displayed at the Lilly Library in an exhibition called \"Comics as Cultural Mythology: The Michael E. Uslan Collection of Comic Books and Graphic Novels\" from September 12, 2005 to December 17, 2005.\n\nThe Uslan Collection also contains a vast array of action figures as well as other pop culture memorabilia, which can be accessed through the Lilly Library Request System.\n\nThe collection is currently housed at the Auxiliary Library Facility (ALF) and can be accessed for use through IUCAT, the Indiana University Library catalog.\n\nIn 2006, the library received a collection of 30,000 mechanical puzzles and 4,000 puzzle related books from Jerry Slocum. The collection is the largest assemblage of its kind in the world. Mechanical puzzles are hand-held objects that must be manipulated to solve the puzzle. The collection spans multiple centuries and five continents.\n\nThe collection is on permanent display in the Slocum Puzzle Room and includes puzzles that can be handled by visitors. The Lilly Library is currently developing an online database of the collection.\n\nThe Lilly contains an extensive collection of material that centers on the French Revolution of 1789. The collection contains approximately seven thousand pieces and includes all types of printed materials, such as journals, polemical pamphlets, and many other documents. The collection consists of 3,362 legal publications. The majority of the other documents are royal and administrative acts published in pamphlet form between 1789 and 1799. There are royal edicts, arrets, addresses, declarations, reglements, lettres patentes, rapports, ordonnances, memoires, lois, and various other titled or untitled official documents.\n\nThe Mendel collection is divided into two categories: one relates to the period of geographical discovery and exploration and the other consists of additions made by the Lilly Library after the original acquisition. The geographical and discovery collection ranges from the 15th through the 19th century. It includes the great cosmographic and geographic works of Ptolemy as well as narratives of the discovery and conquest of the New World. The emphasis of the subsequent acquisitions is on Latin Americana from the 17th through the 19th century, with particular attention to Mexican history.\n\nThe Mendel Room in the Lilly was dedicated in 1964.\n\nThe Lilly Library has the personal papers of James Whitcomb Riley in a variety of manuscript collections. There are also miscellaneous uncataloged materials that includes clippings, scrapbooks, photographs, memorabilia, and other ephemera. The majority of his writings and personal correspondence are found in the Riley mss. Hundreds of Riley’s books are listed in Indiana University’s online catalog. On the 150th anniversary of his birth, the library produced an online exhibition that explores James Whitcomb Riley’s impact on American society and the 19th century literary world.\n\nThe Lilly Library has other Indiana authors in their collection as well.\n\nThe Lilly Library houses 2,000 motion picture scripts, including the second draft script for the film Chariots of Fire. In order to supplement the script material the library added to the collection material from Orson Welles, John Ford, Clifford Odets, and most recently Peter Bogdanovich. The library is home to 800 BBC radio scripts and the papers of Lance Sieveking and D. G. Bridson. The television scripts consist mostly of material from John McGreevey as well as scripts from such television shows as and .\n\nThe library houses 150,000 pieces of sheet music. The prominent collections are the Sam DeVincent Collection of American Sheet Music, the Starr Sheet Music Collection, and the Wildermuth Collection of Hoagy Carmichael Sheet Music.\n\nThe library has the original pen and ink drawings from Dale Messick's comic Brenda Starr. The collection is organized and searchable by date.\n\nThe material is made up of papers relating to meetings, correspondence, drafts, conferences, periodicals and books from the Mystery Writers of America association.\n\nThe library has 94 poems as well as 3,324 examples of correspondence, writing, and memorabilia from Sylvia Plath. The poems are arranged in chronological order and the miscellaneous items are organized by type. 150 books from Plath's only library are housed at the Lilly Library as well.\n\n\nThe Lilly Library is located on the southern side of a small square in the heart of the Indiana University Bloomington campus. Showalter Fountain is in the middle of the square. Indiana University Art Museum and Indiana University School of Fine Arts are on the opposite (northern) side of the square. Indiana University Auditorium is on the square's eastern side.\n\nThe Perkins System Libraries, of Duke University Libraries, contains the \"Lilly Library\". This was formerly the Trinity Library, and then the East campus Library. In 1990 Ruth Lilly, daughter of Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., made a substantial donation to Duke University and the library was renamed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7454874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7454874", "title": "Magic in the Graeco-Roman world", "text": "Magic in the Graeco-Roman world\n\nThe study of magic in the Greco-Roman world is a branch of the disciplines of classics, ancient history and religious studies. In classical antiquity, including the Hellenistic world of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, historians and archaeologists view the public and private rituals associated with religion as part of everyday life. Examples of this phenomenon are found in the various state and cult temples, Jewish synagogues and churches. These were important hubs for ancient peoples, representing a connection between the heavenly realms (the divine) and the earthly planes (the dwelling place of humanity). This context of magic has become an academic study, especially in the last twenty years.\n\nPervasive throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia until late antiquity and beyond, \"mágos\", \"Magian\" or \"magician\", was influenced by (and eventually displaced) Greek \"goēs\" (γόης), the older word for a practitioner of magic, to include astrology, alchemy and other forms of esoteric knowledge. This association was in turn the product of the Hellenistic fascination for (Pseudo‑)Zoroaster, who was perceived by the Greeks to be the \"Chaldean\", \"founder\" of the Magi and \"inventor\" of both astrology and magic, a meaning that still survives in the modern-day words \"magic\" and \"magician\".\n\nAuthors William Swatos and Peter Kivisto define magic as \"any attempt to control the environment or the self by means that are either untested or untestable, such as charms or spells.\"\n\nHerodotus, Xenophon, Plutarch – did use \"magos\" in connection with their descriptions of (Zoroastrian) religious beliefs or practices, the majority seem to have understood it in the sense of \"magician\". Accordingly, the more skeptical writers then also identified the \"magicians\" – i.e. individual magians – as charlatans or frauds. In Plato's \"Symposium\" (202e), the Athenian identified them as maleficent, allowing however a measure of efficacy as a function of the god Eros. Pliny paints them in a particularly bad light.\n\nAccording to one source magic in general was held in low esteem and condemned by speakers and writers. Betz notes book burnings in regards to texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri, when he cites Ephesus in the \"Acts of the Apostles\" (Acts 19: 10). And on the account of Suetonius, Augustus ordered the burning of 2,000 magical scrolls in 13 BC. Betz states: Albrecht Dieterich noted the importance of the Greek Magical Papyri for the study of ancient religions because most of the texts combine several religions, Egyptian, Greek, or Jewish, among others.\n\nAccording to Robert Parker, \"magic differs from religion as weeds differ from flowers, merely by negative social evaluation\"; magic was often seen as consisting of practices that range from silly superstition to the wicked and dangerous. However, magic seems to have borrowed from religion, adopting religious ceremonies and divine names, and the two are sometimes difficult to clearly distinguish. Magic is often differentiated from religion in that it is manipulative rather than supplicatory of the deities. Some mainstream religious rites openly set out to constrain the gods. Other rough criteria sometimes used to distinguish magic from religion include: aimed at selfish or immoral ends; and conducted in secrecy, often for a paying client. Religious rites, on the other hand, are more often aimed at lofty goals such as salvation or rebirth, and are conducted in the open for the benefit of the community or a group of followers.\n\nReligious ritual had the intended purpose of giving a god their just due honor, or asking for divine intervention and favor, while magic is seen as practiced by those who seek only power, and often undertaken based on a false scientific basis. Ultimately, the practice of magic includes rites that do not play a part in worship, and are ultimately irreligious. Associations with this term tend to be an evolving process in ancient literature, but generally speaking ancient magic reflects aspects of broader religious traditions in the Mediterranean world, that is, a belief in magic reflects a belief in deities, divination, and words of power. The concept of magic however came to represent a more coherent and self-reflective tradition exemplified by magicians seeking to fuse varying non-traditional elements of Greco-Roman religious practice into something specifically called magic. This fusing of practices reached its peak in the world of the Roman Empire, in the 3rd to 5th centuries CE. Thorndike comments: \"Greek science at its best was not untainted by magic\".\n\nThe magic papyri we have left to study, present more Graeco-Egyptian, rather than Graeco-Roman beliefs. Betz further notes: \n\nIn Greek literature, the earliest magical operation that supports a definition of magic as a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces (the sympathies and antipathies that make up these forces) of the world (\"physis\" ) is found in Book X of the \"Odyssey\" (a text stretching back to the early 8th century BCE). Book X describes the encounter of the central hero Odysseus with the Titan Circe, \"She who is sister to the wizard Aeetes, both being children of the Sun...by the same mother, Perse the daughter of the Ocean,\" on the island of Aeaea. In the story Circe's magic consists in the use of a wand against Odysseus and his men while Odysseus's magic consists of the use of a secret herb called moly (revealed to him by the god Hermes, \"god of the golden wand\") to defend himself from her attack. In the story three requisites crucial to the idiom of \"magic\" in later literature are found:\n\n\nThese are the three most common elements that characterize magic as a system in the later Hellenistic and greco-Roman periods of history.\n\nAnother important definitional element to magic is also found in the story. Circe is presented as being in the form of a beautiful woman (a temptress) when Odysseus encounters her on an island. In this encounter Circe uses her wand to change Odysseus’ companions into swine. This may suggest that magic was associated (in this time) with practices that went against the natural order, or against wise and good forces (Circe is called a witch by a companion of Odysseus). In this mode it is worth noting that Circe is representative of a power (the Titans) that had been conquered by the younger Olympian gods such as Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.\n\nThe 6th century BCE gives rise to scattered references of magoi at work in Greece. Many of these references representing a more positive conceptualisation of magic. Among the most famous of these Greek magoi, between Homer and the Hellenistic period, are the figures of Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Empedocles.\n\nOrpheus is a mythical figure, said to have lived in Thrace \"a generation before Homer\" (though he is in fact depicted on 5th-century ceramics in Greek costume). Orphism, or the Orphic Mysteries, seems also to have been central to the personages of Pythagoras and Empedocles who lived in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE. Pythagoras for example is said to have described Orpheus, as, \"the...father of melodious songs.\" Since Aeschylus (the Greek Playwright) later describes him as he who \"haled all things by the rapture of his voice,\" this suggests belief in the efficacy of song and voice in magic. Orpheus is certainly associated with a great many deeds: the most famous perhaps being his descent to the underworld to bring back his wife, Eurydice. Orpheus’ deeds are not usually condemned or spoken of negatively. This suggests that some forms of magic were more acceptable. Indeed, the term applied to Orpheus to separate him, presumably, from magicians of ill repute is \"theios aner\" or ‘divine man’.\n\nMagical powers were also attributed to the famous mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras (c. 570 – 495 BCE), as recorded in the days of Aristotle. The traditions concerning Pythagoras are somewhat complicated because the number of Vitae that do survive are often contradictory in their interpretation of the figure of Pythagoras.\n\nSome of the magical acts attributed to him include:\n\n\nEmpedocles (c. 490 – c. 430 BCE) too has ascribed to him marvelous powers associated with later magicians: that is, he is able to heal the sick, rejuvenate the old, influence the weather and summon the dead. E.R. Dodds in his 1951 book, \"The Greeks and the Irrational\", argued that Empedocles was a combination of poet, magus, teacher, and scientist. Dodds argued that since much of the acquired knowledge of individuals like Pythagoras or Empedocles was somewhat mysterious even to those with a rudimentary education, it might be associated with magic or at least with the learning of a Magus.\n\nIt is important to note that after Empedocles, the scale of magical gifts in exceptional individuals shrinks in the literature, becoming specialized. Individuals might have the gift of healing, or the gift of prophecy, but are not usually credited with a wide range of supernatural powers as are magoi like Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles. Plato reflects such an attitude in his Laws (933a-e) where he takes healers, prophets and sorcerers for granted. He acknowledges that these practitioners existed in Athens (and thus presumably in other Greek cities), and they had to be reckoned with and controlled by laws; but one should not be afraid of them, their powers are real, but they themselves represent a rather low order of humanity. An early Christian analogy is found in the 1st century CE writings of the Apostle Paul. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians conceptualizes the idea of a limitation of spiritual gifts.\n\nThe Hellenistic period (roughly the last three centuries BCE) is characterized by an avid interest in magic, though this may simply be because from this period a greater abundance of texts, both literary and some from actual practitioners, in Greek and in Latin remains. In fact many of the magical papyri that are extant were written in the 1st centuries of the Common Era, but their concepts, formulas and rituals reflect the earlier Hellenistic period, that is, a time when the systematization of magic in the Greco-Roman world seems to have taken place—particularly in the ‘melting pot’ of varying cultures that was Egypt under the Ptolemaic Kingdom and under Rome.\n\nThe ascendancy of Christianity by the fifth century had much to do with this. This is reflected by the Acts of the Apostles, where Paul the Apostle convinces many Ephesians to bring out their magical books and burn them. The language of the magical papyri reflects various levels of literary skill, but generally they are standard Greek, and in fact they may well be closer to the spoken language of the time than to poetry or artistic prose left to us in literary texts. Many terms are borrowed, in the papyri, it would seem, from the mystery cults; thus magical formulas are sometimes called teletai (literally, \"celebration of mysteries\"), or the magician himself is called \"mystagogos\" (the priest who leads the candidates for initiation). Much Jewish lore and some of the names for God also appear in the magical papyri. \"Jao\" for Yahweh, Sabaoth, and Adonai appear quite frequently for example. As magicians are concerned with secrets it must have seemed to many outsiders of Judaism that Yahweh was a secret deity, for after all no images were produced of the Jewish God and God's real name was not pronounced, as the basis of speculation on magic.\n\nThe texts of the Greek magical papyri are often written as we might write a recipe: \"Take the eyes of a bat...\" for example. So in other words the magic requires certain ingredients, much as Odysseus required the herb Moly to defeat the magic of Circe. But it is not just as simple as knowing how to put a recipe together. Appropriate gestures, at certain points in the magical ritual, are required to accompany the ingredients, different gestures it would seem produce various effects. A magical ritual done in the right way can guarantee the revealing of dreams and the rather useful talent of interpreting them correctly. In other cases certain spells allow one to send out a daemon or daemons to harm one's enemies or even to break up someone's marriage.\n\nThis self-defined negative aspect to magic (as opposed to other groups defining your practices as negative even if you don’t) is found in various ‘curse tablets,’ (tabellae defixionum) left to us from the Greco-Roman world. The term defixio is derived from the Latin verb defigere, which means literally \"to pin down,\" but which was also associated with the idea of delivering someone to the powers of the underworld. It was also possible to curse an enemy through a spoken word, either in his presence or behind his back. But due to numbers of curse tablets that have been found it would seem that this type of magic was considered more effective. The process involved writing the victim's name on a thin sheet of lead along with varying magical formulas or symbols, then burying the tablet in or near a tomb, a place of execution, or a battlefield, to give spirits of the dead power over the victim. Sometimes the curse tablets were even transfixed with various items – such as nails, which were believed to add magical potency.\n\nFor most magic acts or rituals, there existed magics to counter the effects. Amulets were one of the most common protections (or counter-magics) used in the Greco-Roman world as protection against such fearful things as curses and the evil eye; which were seen as very real by most of its inhabitants. While amulets were often made of cheap materials, precious stones were believed to have special efficacy. Many thousands of carved gems were found that clearly had a magical rather than an ornamental function. Amulets were a very widespread type of magic, because of the fear of other types of magic such as curses being used against oneself. Thus amulets were actually often a mixture of various formulas from Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek elements that were probably worn by those of most affiliations so as to protect against other forms of magic. Amulets are often abbreviated forms of the formulas found in the extant magical papyri.\n\nMagical tools were thus very common in magical rituals. Tools were probably just as important as the spells and incantations that were repeated for each magical ritual. A magician's kit, probably dating from the third century, was discovered in the remains of the ancient city of Pergamon in Anatolia and gives direct evidence of this. The find consisted of a bronze table and base covered with symbols, a dish (also decorated with symbols), a large bronze nail with letters inscribed on its flat sides, two bronze rings, and three black polished stones inscribed with the names of supernatural powers.\n\nWhat emerges then, from this evidence, is the conclusion that a type of permanence and universality of magic had developed in the Greco-Roman world by the Hellenistic period if not earlier. The scholarly consensus strongly suggests that although many testimonies about magic are relatively late, the practices they reveal are almost certainly much older. However the level of credence or efficacy given to magical practices in the early Greek and Roman worlds by comparison to the late Hellenistic period is not well known.\n\nMagical operations largely fall into two categories: theurgy ( and goetia (. Theurgy in some contexts appears simply to try and glorify the kind of magic that is being practiced – usually a respectable priest-like figure is associated with the ritual. Of this, scholar E. R. Dodds claims:\nIn a typical theurgical rite, contact with divinity occurs either through the soul of the theurgist or medium leaving the body and ascending to heaven, where the divinity is perceived, or through the descent of the divinity to earth to appear to the theurgist in a vision or a dream. In the latter case, the divinity is drawn down by appropriate \"symbols\" or magical formulae. According to the Greek philosopher Plotinus (205–270), theurgy attempts to bring all things in the universe into sympathy, and man into connection with all things via the forces that flow through them. \"Theurgia\" connoted an exalted form of magic, and philosophers interested in magic adopted this term to distinguish themselves from the \"magoi\" or \"góētes\" (, singular \"góēs\", \"sorcerer, wizard\") — lower-class practitioners. \"Goetia\" was a derogatory term connoting low, specious or fraudulent \"mageia\". \"Goetia\" is similar in its ambiguity to \"charm\": it means both \"magic\" and \"power to (sexually) attract\".\n\nThere are several notable historical personages of the 1st century CE who have many of the literary characteristics earlier associated with the Greek \"divine men\" (Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles). Of particular note are Jesus the Christ, Simon Magus and Apollonius of Tyana. From an outsider's point of view Jesus was a typical miracle-worker. He exorcised daemons, healed the sick, made prophecies and raised the dead. As Christianity grew and became seen as a threat to established traditions of religion in the Greco-Roman world (particularly to the Roman Empire with its policy of emperor worship) Jesus (and by inference his followers) were accused of being magic users. Certainly Christian texts such as the Gospels told a life story full of features common to divinely touched figures: Jesus’ divine origin, his miraculous birth, and his facing of a powerful daemon (Satan) being but a few examples. The gospel of Matthew claims that Jesus was taken to Egypt as an infant, this was actually used by hostile sources to explain his knowledge of magic; according to one rabbinical story, he came back tattooed with spells. It is also argued in rabbinical tradition that Jesus was mad, which was often associated with people of great power (dynamis). Scholars such as Morton Smith have even tried to argue that Jesus was a magician. Morton Smith, in his book, Jesus the Magician, points out that the Gospels speak of the \"descent of the spirit,\" the pagans of \"possession by a daemon,\". According to Morton Smith both are explanations for very similar phenomena. If so this shows the convenience that using the term \"magic\" had in the Roman Empire – in delineating between what \"they do and what you do\". However Barry Crawford, currently Co-Chair of the Society of Biblical Literature's Consultation on Redescribing Christian Origins, in his 1979 review of the book states that \"Smith exhibits an intricate knowledge of the magical papyri, but his ignorance of current Gospel research is abysmal\", concluding that the work has traits of a conspiracy theory.\n\nSimon is the name of a magus mentioned in the canonical book of Acts 8:9ff, in apocryphal texts and elsewhere. In the Book of Acts Simon the Magus is presented as being deeply impressed by the apostle Peter's cures and exorcisms and by the gift of the Spirit that came from the apostles’ laying on of hands; therefore, he \"believed and was baptized\". But Simon asks the apostles to sell him their special gift so that he can practice it too. This seems to represent the attitude of a professional magician. In other words, for Simon, the power of this new movement is a kind of magic that can be purchased – perhaps a common practice for magicians in parts of the Greco-Roman world. The Apostles response to Simon was emphatic in its rejection. The early church drew a strong line of demarcation between what it practiced and the practices of magic users. As the church continued to develop this demarcation Simon comes under even greater scrutiny in later Christian texts. The prominent Christian author Justin Martyr for example, claims that Simon was a magus of Samaria, and that his followers committed the blasphemy of worshiping Simon as God. The veracity of this is not certain, but proves the desire of the early Christians to escape an association with magic.\n\nThe third magus of interest in the period of the Roman Empire is Apollonius of Tyana (c. 40 AD-c. 120 AD). Between 217 and 238 Flavius Philostratus wrote his \"Life of Apollonius of Tyana\", a lengthy, but unreliable novelistic source. Philostratus was a protégé of the empress Julia Domna, mother of the emperor Caracalla. According to him, she owned the memoirs of one Damis, an alleged disciple of Apollonius, and gave these to Philostratus as the raw material for a literary treatment. Some scholars believe the memoirs of Damis are an invention of Philostratus, others think it was a real book forged by someone else and used by Philostratus. The latter possibility is more likely. In any case it is a literary fake. From Philostratus’ biography Apollonius emerges as an ascetic traveling teacher. He is usually labeled a new Pythagoras, and at the very least he does represent the same combination of philosopher and magus that Pythagoras was. According to Philostratus Apollonius traveled far and wide, as far as India, teaching ideas reasonably consistent with traditional Pythagorean doctrine; but in fact, it is most likely that he never left the Greek East of the Roman Empire. In Late Antiquity talismans allegedly made by Apollonius appeared in several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven. They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from plagues and other afflictions.\n\nJewish tradition, too, has attempted to define certain practices as \"magic\". Some Talmudic teachers (and many Greeks and Romans) considered Jesus a magician, and magical books such as the \"Testament of Solomon\" and the \"Eighth Book of Moses\" were ascribed to Solomon and Moses in antiquity. The \"Wisdom of Solomon\", a book considered apocryphal by many contemporary Jews and Christians (probably composed in the first century BCE) claims that\n\nThus Solomon was seen as the greatest scientist, but also the greatest occultist of his time, learned in astrology, plant magic, daemonology, divination, and \"physika\" ( \"science\").\nThese are the central aims of magic as an independent tradition – knowledge and power and control of the mysteries of the cosmos. Such aims can be viewed negatively or positively by ancient authors. The Jewish historian Josephus for example, writes that: \"God gave him [Solomon] knowledge of the art that is used against daemons, in order to heal and benefit men\". Elsewhere however, \"there was an Egyptian false prophet [a magician] that did the Jews more mischief... for he was a cheat\".\n\nThe idea of magic can thus be an idiom loosely defined in ancient thinking. But whether magic is viewed negatively or positively the substance of it as a practice can be drawn out. That is, that magic was a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces of the cosmos, and the sympathies and antipathies that were seen to make up these forces.\n\nThe \"Natural History\" of Pliny the Elder (CE 23/24-79) is a voluminous survey of knowledge of the late Hellenistic era, based according to Pliny on a hundred or so earlier authorities. This rather extensive work deals with an amazing variety of issues: cosmology, geography, anthropology, zoology, botany, pharmacology, mineralogy, metallurgy and many others. Pliny was convinced of the powers of certain herbs or roots as revealed to humanity by the gods. Pliny argued that the divine powers in their concern for the welfare of humanity wish for humanity to discover the secrets of nature. Pliny indeed argues that in their wisdom the gods sought to bring humans gradually closer to their status; which certainly many magical traditions seek – that is by acquiring knowledge one can aspire to gain knowledge even from the gods. Pliny expresses a firm concept is firmly being able to understand this \"cosmic sympathy\" that, if properly understood and used, operates for the good of humanity.\n\nWhile here lies expressed the central tenets of magic Pliny is by means averse to using the term \"magic\" in a negative sense. Pliny argues that the claims of the professional magicians were either exaggerated or simply false. Pliny expresses an interesting concept when he states that those sorcerers who had written down their spells and recipes despised and hated humanity (for spreading their lies perhaps?). To show this Pliny link arts of the magicians of Rome with the emperor Nero (who is often portrayed negatively), whom Pliny claims had studied magic with the best teachers and had access to the best books, but was unable to do anything extraordinary.\n\nPliny's conclusion, however, is cautious: though magic is ineffective and infamous, it nevertheless contains \"shadows of truth\", particularly of the \"arts of making poisons\". Yet, Pliny states, \"there is no one who is not afraid of spells\" (including himself presumably). The amulets and charms that people wore as a kind of preventive medicine he neither commends or condemns, but instead suggests that it is better to err on the side of caution, for, who knows, a new kind of magic, a magic that really works, may be developed at any time.\n\nIf such an attitude prevailed in the Greco-Roman world this may explain why professional magicians, such as Simon Magus, were on the lookout for new ideas. Pliny devotes the beginning of Book 30 of his work to the magi of Persia and refers to them here and there especially in Books 28 and 29. Pliny defines the Magi at times as sorcerers, but also seems to acknowledge that they are priests of a foreign religion, along the lines of the druids of the Celts in Britain and Gaul. According to Pliny, the art of the magi touches three areas: \"healing,\" \"ritual,\" and \"astrology.\"\n\nTo the Platonist philosopher Plutarch (c. 45–125) we owe the treatise \"On Superstition\". Plutarch defines \"'superstition\" as \"fear of the gods.\" Specifically, he mentions that fear of the gods leads to the need to resort to magical rites and taboos, the consultation of professional sorcerers and witches, amulets and incantations, and unintelligible language in prayers addressed to the gods.\n\nAlthough Plutarch himself takes dreams and omens seriously, he reserves superstition for those who have excessive or exclusive faith in such phenomena. Clearly, it is a matter of discrimination. He also takes for granted other magical practices, such as hurting someone by the evil eye. He also believes in daemons that serve as agents or links between gods and human beings and are responsible for many supernatural events in human life that are commonly attributed to divine intervention. Thus, a daemon, not Apollo himself, is the everyday power behind the Pythia. Some daemons are good, some are evil, but even the good ones, in moments of anger, can do harmful acts. In general then, Plutarch actually accepts much of what we today might define as superstition in itself. So what he is really defining as superstition are those practices not compatible with his own philosophical doctrine.\n\nA later Platonist, Apuleius (born c. 125), gives us a substantial amount of information on contemporary beliefs in magic, though perhaps through no initial choice of his own. Apuleius was accused of practicing magic, something outlawed under Roman law. The speech he delivered in his own defense against the charge of magic, in c. 160 CE, remains and it is from this Apologia that we learn how easy it was, at that time, for a philosopher to be accused of magical practices. Perhaps in a turn of irony or even a tacit admission of guilt, Apuleius, in his \"Metamorphoses\" (or \"The Golden Ass\"), which perhaps has autobiographical elements, allows the hero, Lucius, to dabble in magic as a young man, get into trouble, be rescued by the goddess Isis, and then finds true knowledge and happiness in her mysteries.\n\nLike Plutarch, Apuleius seems to take for granted the existence of daemons. They populate the air and seem to, in fact, be formed of air. They experience emotions just like human beings, and despite this their minds are rational. In light of Apuleuis’ experience it is worth noting that when magic is mentioned in Roman laws, it is always discussed in a negative context. A consensus was established quite early in Roman history for the banning of anything viewed as harmful acts of magic. The laws of the Twelve Tables (451–450 BCE) for example expressly forbid anyone from enticing his neighbors’ crops into his fields by magic. An actual trial for alleged violation of these laws was held before Spurius Albinus in 157 BCE. It is also recorded that Cornelius Hispallus expelled the Chaldean astrologers from Rome in 139 BCE ostensibly on the grounds that they were magicians.\n\nIn 33 BCE, astrologers and magicians are explicitly mentioned as having been driven from Rome. Twenty years later, Augustus ordered all books on the magical arts to be burned. In 16 CE magicians and astrologers were expelled from Italy, and this was reinstated by edicts of Vespasian in 69 CE and Domitian in 89 CE. The emperor Constantine I in the 4th century CE issued a ruling to cover all charges of magic. In it he distinguished between helpful charms, not punishable, and antagonistic spells. In these cases Roman authorities specifically decided what forms of magic were acceptable and which were not. Those that were not acceptable were termed \"magic\"; those that were acceptable were usually defined as traditions of the state or practices of the state's religions.\n\nJohn Middleton argues in his article \"Theories of Magic\"\" in the \"Encyclopaedia of Religion\" that:\n\n\"Magic is usually defined subjectively rather than by any agreed upon content. But there is a wide consensus as to what this content is. Most peoples in the world perform acts by which they intend to bring about certain events or conditions, whether in nature or among people, that they hold to be the consequences of those acts.\"\n\nUnder this view, the various aspects of magic that described, despite how the term \"magic\" may be defined by various groupings within the Greco-Roman world, is in fact part of a broader cosmology shared by most people in the ancient world. But it is important to seek an understanding of the way that groups separate power from power, thus \"magic\" often describes an art or practices that are much more specific. This art is probably best described, as being the manipulation of physical objects and cosmic forces, through the recitation of formulas and incantations by a specialist (that is a magus) on behalf of him/herself or a client to bring about control over or action in the divine realms. The Magical texts examined in this article, then, are ritual texts designed to manipulate divine powers for the benefit of either the user or clients. Because this was something done in secret or with foreign methods these texts represent an art that was generally looked upon as illegitimate by official or mainstream magical cults in societies.\n\n"}

The gallery is a setting for 332 portraits of generals who took part in the Patriotic War of 1812. The portraits were painted by George Dawe and his Russian assistants Alexander Polyakov (1801-1835), a serf, and Wilhelm August Golicke.\n\nThe top-lit barrel-vaulted hall in which the gallery is accommodated was designed by architect Carlo Rossi and constructed from June to November 1826. It replaced several small rooms in the middle of the main block of the Winter Palace - between the White Throne Hall and the Greater Throne Hall, just a few steps from the palace church. The gallery was opened in a solemn ceremony on 25 December 1826.\n\nLess than ten years after its completion, it was destroyed by fire in 1837. The fire burned slowly and Dawe's portraits were saved from the flames. The architect Vasily Stasov recreated the hall exactly as it had been before.\n\nAs a cadet of the Nicholas Cavalry School, Vladimir Littauer was posted in 1912 to stand night-time guard in the Military Gallery. He describes the experience as an eerie one, standing under the rows of portraits in the \"huge hall\" lit only by a single bulb over a cluster of banners. The isolation of the solitary sentry was emphasized by the two to three minutes that footsteps could be heard down halls and corridors before the replacement guard arrived in the gallery.\nDuring the Soviet era, the gallery collection was enhanced by four portraits of Palace Grenadiers, the special ceremonial unit created in 1827 from veterans of the Patriotic War of 1812 to guard the entire building. The portraits were also painted by George Dawe, in 1828. More recently, the gallery acquired two paintings by Peter von Hess from the 1840s.\n\nToday, as part of the State Hermitage Museum, this room retains its original decoration.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4543764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4543764", "title": "Moneysupermarket.com", "text": "Moneysupermarket.com\n\nMoneysupermarket.com Group PLC () is a British price comparison website-based business specialising in financial services. The website enables consumers to compare prices on a range of products, including car insurance, home insurance, travel insurance, mortgages, credit cards and loans. The company also purchased MoneySavingExpert.com for £80 million from Martin Lewis in 2012, becoming a subsidiary of Moneysupermarket. He remains a shareholder in the parent company, selling a small percentage of shares in 2015.\n\nMoneysupermarket is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.\n\nSimon Nixon founded two businesses in the mortgage market in the late 1980s, which eventually became Moneysupermarket.\n\nThis began when he established a mortgage subscription business in 1987. Nixon was a student at the University of Nottingham studying accounting, while also working a job selling mortgages. While working in the role, he noticed after a number of months there was no easy way for brokers to compare all the mortgage deals available. He worked evenings and weekends setting up best-buy tables so he could send out information to those who required it. He began it as a free service, before charging subscriptions at £11 a fortnight. After two years in business, Nixon was earning £10,000 a month from his subscription business, offering mortgage advice via post.\n\nIn 1989, he persuaded Duncan Cameron to quit is IT degree course at Liverpool University and assist him with expanding the business. Together they formed Mortgage 2000 just as computers and the Internet were becoming regular fixtures in offices across the UK. Mortgage 2000 was aimed at accounting firms and financial advisors who had access to the Internet. Instead of simply offering a fortnightly update via post, subscribers could log on and check deals real-time via Mortgage 2000. The stats were updated daily, rather than fortnightly.\n\nThis expansion was hugely successful in the financial sector in the UK. In the late 1990s, the Internet expanded from an office-based service into people's homes. Nixon spoke to The Telegraph about spotting an opportunity when Freeserve began to offer free access to the Internet for homeowners in 1999 and saw a rapid expansion in Moneysupermarket from that point forward. Initially the website focused on a number of small comparison and sourcing markets for personal loans and credit cards. Instead of providing Independent Financial Advisors with the information, Moneysupermarket.com was marketed as a business to consumer business to compliment their \"Mortgage 2000\" offering. Nixon and Duncan made commissions varying from 30p to £30 for different deals their users signed up for in the year days. As these figures began to add up, they shut Mortgage 2000 and began to offer mortgage comparisons on Moneysupermarket.com.\n\nThis caused strain between the co-founders as Duncan was brought on board to run the IT side of Mortgage 2000. Once the potential for Moneysupermarket was realised, Mortgage 2000 only had limited potential. The focus away from Mortgage 2000 led Duncan to stop getting involved in the business in early 2002, but remained as a silent partner in the business.\n\nIn 2000, Moneysupermarket announced their first major expansion with the launch of Travelsupermarket.com. The website ran in the same way as Moneysupermarket, but compared prices for a different market. Pricing for the travel market at the time wasn't consumer-friendly, often providing a \"price from\" advertisement. The initial goal of Travelsupermarket was to provide transparent pricing, describing the exact differences between the different prices provided.\n\nMoneysupermarket was recognised in 2002 by The Sunday Times' Fast Track 100, as one of the fastest growing companies in the UK. The awards measured three financial years, between 2000 and 2002, to study the growth of the business. MoneySupermarket were judged to be the 80th fastest growing tech business in the United Kingdom during the three-year period. The company's sales grew from £5.4 million in 2000 to £13.6 million in 2002.\n\nFollowing the success of Moneysupermarket, Simon Nixon was announced as Entrepreneur of the Year at the National Business Awards in 2003.\n\nBy 2006, the group earned pre-tax profits of £11.7 million on revenues of £105m. A year later, The Guardian announced that the website was processing 52% of all the price comparisons in the UK. In June 2007, Duncan Cameron sold his 47% stake in the business to co-founder Simon Nixon for £162 million. \"The Guardian\" noted that for household and car insurance, price comparison websites such as moneysupermarket.com rarely include all products on the market and that price comparisons are consequently incomplete.\n\nShortly after Simon Nixon became the main shareholder in the business, Moneysupermarket announced that the company was to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Shortly before the floatation, the Financial Times, The Guardian and The Independent, all reported that the group had been valued at around £1 billion at the time of its initial public offering. The floatation valuation was seen at the time as one of the largest tech IPOs in the United Kingdom for a long period of time.\n\nIn 2012, Moneysupermarket announced that they had purchased MoneySavingExpert.com in a deal worth £87 million. After the acquisition was completed in September of that year, MoneySavingExpert remained as an editorially independent platform, as part of the contractually binding Editorial Code. Its founder, Martin Lewis, announced that he would remain as the chief editor of the platform.\n\nMoneysupermarket announced in 2015 that Martin Lewis would be selling 1.6% of his shares in Moneysupermarket, reducing his overall holdings in the company to 1.5%. Moneysupermarket recruited a new chief executive in October 2016 to replace Peter Plumb, who would be leaving the group in May 2017. Mark Lewis was announced as the new chief executive and had previously served as retail director at John Lewis. He was tipped to become its managing director before joining Moneysupermarket. In an interview with The Guardian he stated he wanted to return to digital retail after working with both CollectPlus and eBay previously.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2017, Moneysupermarket announced slight dips in their money and home services operations, but overall saw an increase on the previous year’s figures. The group reported a total revenue of £90.2 million, a six percent increase when compared to the previous year’s Q3 revenue figures. The company's best performer was its insurance revenues, which grew by 11 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2006, Moneysupermarket underwent a ninefold growth in traffic. This resulted in them deploying an enterprise management and monitoring system to track availability and increase internal understanding of the users' experience.\n\nSites such as Moneysupermarket collect data directly from merchants used to find quotations for any given comparison market. Retailers can also supply Moneysupermarket with products and prices by manually submitting their own lists. These would then be matched up against the original database so there aren't any duplications.\n\nData feed files can also be used to collect data. In this scenario, a merchant would provide Moneysupermarket with information electronically in a set format. Like other comparison shopping websites, Moneysupermarket has previously used third-party affiliate networks to receive information and aggregate data. Another method used is to crawl the web for prices. This effectively takes away the submission aspect of smaller merchants, while Moneysupermarket still provide their clients with accurate pricing. It was estimated that this method was initially used in the early days of price comparison.\n\nIn recent years, comparison shopping websites such as Moneysupermarket have been able to use their inventory data to place retailer prices on a blog or content website as an advert. In return, the owner of that website will receive a commission percentage from Moneysupermarket. While this effects the overall commission earned by Moneysupermarket from merchants, it increases traffic and is now a common method used by comparison websites to drive traffic.\n\nSimon Nixon founded Moneysupermarket.com, which is the main source of revenue for the Moneysupermarket group. Following the amalgamation of a number of companies dating back to 1989, Nixon formed the largest UK-based comparison website for insurance, finance, energy and a number of other markets. To date, it is the largest comparison website in the UK by revenue.\n\nTravelsupermarket was founded in 2000, as a travel comparison website and subsidiary of the Moneysupermarket.com group. Initially it competed with sites such as Expedia and Skyscanner. In 2005, it was named the best online travel company in the UK.\n\nMoneySavingExpert.com is a subsidiary of the Moneysupermarket group, after it was acquired from Martin Lewis in 2012 for a deal in the region of £87 million. It was founded in February 2003, after Lewis believed the UK needed a resource to provide basic financial advice. The site had grown to attract 13 million monthly users by 2012, with 7 million subscribers opting in to receive weekly emails.\n\nIn September 2012, he sold the website while remaining editor-in-chief.\n\nIn 2013, the group announced the launch of the Cheap Energy Club by Moneysupermarket subsidiary, MoneySavingExpert.com. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, stated in a number of interviews that he believed the energy market was broken. The service monitors the users energy tariff to ensure they are on the cheapest gas and electricity deal. The scheme requires the user to input data regarding your current energy tariffs and state the amount of saving for which you would be willing to switch providers. Tariffs that are available are then reviewed every month and you are notified when switching would trigger your target saving.\n\nMoneysupermarket has a research arm, which frequently releases data about Britons and common trends they spot in their data. With energy consumption, the group released statistics suggesting that the UK wasted £1.6 billion on energy bills each year from leaving devices such as televisions on standby.\n\nOther domestic trends spotted by the groups research found that a TV subscription costing UK households £357 annually could be reduced dramatically through streaming services, often to less than £100.\n\nIn February 2018, the group's research found that 20 percent of Scotland had never switched energy provider.\n\nIn 2010, adverts featured comedian Omid Djalili as the character of \"HaggleHero\".\n\nThen from 2011 to 2013 showed adverts such as man surfing on an inflatable crocodile, another man in a jungle with gorillas and another man going into space. In August 2013 a new advert was launched showing a man named Bill running around Croydon with an army of cats whilst a spokesman played by James Lance saying that Bill is so Moneysupermarket.\n\nIn January 2014, a new advert was launched featuring Snoop Dogg and his song \"Who Am I (What's My Name)\" features on the ad.\n\nIn August 2014, another new advert was launched featuring the Epic Elephunk walks around the road of Manhattan city while Graeme is riding the Elephunk the Elephant's back, the narrator claiming he is so Money Supermarket, and the chosen soundtrack being \"Word Up!\" by Cameo on this ad.\n\nIn January 2015, another advertising campaign was launched featuring a man named Dave (played by Michael Van Schoik), walking down a street in L.A, dressed in a shirt, suit jacket, denim hot pants and high heels. He alongside two other people, struts confidently to the song \"Don't Cha\" by the Pussycat Dolls, while showing off his prominent rear to stunned onlookers, including Sharon Osbourne. It was later revealed by the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK to be the most complained about advert in 2015 with 1,513 complaints. In their ruling, the ASA found that whilst it may be distasteful to some, it did not judge the ad was offensive and the complaint was not upheld.\n\nIn July 2015, another advert was launched. It shows a chubby construction worker named Colin (played by Kyle McIntire). He dances, gryates, does a worm dance and a split in front of his co-workers and the bemused office staff at the other building. The song featured in this ad is \"Just a Little\" by British pop group Liberty X. At the end of the advert, he also swings on a wrecking ball (a reference to the video of Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball).\n\nIn January 2016, another TV campaign by agency Mother was launched featuring a bodyguard named Gary. The song featured in the ad is \"Big Bad Wolf\" by Duck Sauce, an American-Canadian DJ duo.\n\nIn April 2016, another advert was released. It showed all three of the 'epic' people having a dance off in a car park. The song featured in the advert is \"Worth It\" by Fifth Harmony featuring Kid Ink. The ad premiered during the first break of \"Britains Got Talent\". It was revealed in an article by The Telegraph that in 2016 three of Moneysupermarket's adverts made the top 10 list of most complained about commercials in the United Kingdom, a list produced by the Advertising Standards Authority. Despite the potential negativity, the company's new Chief Executive stated that he believed the 2,500 complaints showed their adverts had people talking about the brand.\n\nIn March 2017, another advert featuring Skeletor dancing to the song \"Fame\" by Irene Cara and also featuring He-Man was released, the advert returned yet again in October 2018. Later, in August 2017, the brand released another advert, this time featuring Skeletor and He-Man dancing to the song \"Time of My Life\" from the film \"Dirty Dancing\" with He-Man.\n\nIn March 2018, an advert featuring Action Man dancing to the song \"Finally\" by CeCe Peniston was released.\n\n"}

It is concerned with cosmology and the origin of the universe.\n\nThe hymn has attracted a large body of literature of commentaries both in Indian darshan and in Western philology.\n\nThe Creation Hymn begins by paradoxically stating \"not the non-existent existed, nor did the existent exist then\" ('), paralleled in verse 2 by \"then not death existed, nor the immortal\" ('). But already in verse 2 mention is made that there was \"breathing without breath, of its own nature, that one\" '). In verse 3, being unfolds, \"from heat (tapas) was born that one\" ('). Verse 4 mentions desire (kāma) as the primal seed, and the first poet-seers (kavayas) who \"found the bond of being within non-being with their heart's thought\".\n\nKarel Werner describes the author's source for the material as one not derived from reasoning, but a \"visionary, mystical or Yogic experience put into words.\" Werner writes that prior to creation, the Creation Hymn does not describe a state of \"nothingness\" but rather \"That One (\"tad ekam\")\" which is, \"Spaceless, timeless, yet in its own way dynamic and the Sole Force, this Absolute...\"\n\nBrereton (1999) argues that the reference to the sages searching for being in their spirit is central, and that the hymn's gradual procession from non-being to being in fact re-enacts creation within the listener (see ), equating poetic utterance and creation (see śabda).\n\nAccording to one source, the hymn is undoubtedly late within the Rigveda, and expresses thought more typical of later Indian philosophy.\n\nAn atheist interpretation sees the Creation Hymn as one of the earliest accounts of skeptical inquiry and agnosticism. Astronomer Carl Sagan quoted it in discussing India's \"tradition of skeptical questioning and unselfconscious humility before the great cosmic mysteries.\"\n\nNasadiya Sukta consists of seven trishtubhs, although pada 7b is defective, being two syllables short,\nBrereton (1999) argues that the defect is a conscious device employed by the rishi to express puzzlement at the possibility that the world may \"not\" be created, parallel to the syntactic defect of pada 7d, which ends in a subordinate clause without a governing clause:\nIt should be noted that Brereton's interpretation might be guided by the grammar rules applicable to the English language. The Sanskrit language does not follow the same rules.\n\n\n"}
