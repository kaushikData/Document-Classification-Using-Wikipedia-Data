The films are indexed by personal credits, production and distribution companies, year of release, and major and minor plot subjects.\n\nTo qualify for the \"Feature Films\" volumes, a film must have been commercially made by an American company, and given a theatrical release in 35 mm or larger gauge to the general public, with a running time of at least 40 minutes.\n\nThe hardcover volumes published:\n\nThe publication of the hardcover volumes was suspended due to budgetary reasons after volume F4 in 1997. Feature films released from 1951 through 1960, and from 1971 through 1973 have been cataloged only in the online database. The project estimates that additional years will be cataloged at six-month intervals. Film School students are offered the opportunity to provide plot synopses and original research, but input from other, experienced film researchers is not encouraged.\n\nThe project will also eventually catalog short films (beyond 1910) and newsreels.\n\n"}

{"id": "398493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=398493", "title": "BRD (Germany)", "text": "BRD (Germany)\n\nBRD (; English: Federal Republic of Germany); () is an unofficial abbreviation commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the communist regime of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) to refer to the Federal Republic of Germany, informally known at the time as West Germany. The East German regime previously used the term \"German Federal Republic\" to refer to its western counterpart.\n\nUnlike the English equivalent FRG, which was used as an IOC country code and a FIFA trigramme, the use of \"BRD\" was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself, because it was considered to be a derogatory communist term. The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in Western Germany. After German reunification, the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (\"\"), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany was its ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code \"DE\", which has remained the country code of reunified Germany.\n\nThe official name was and is \"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" (\"Federal Republic of Germany\"). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the Trizone, was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term \"Deutschland\" (\"Germany\"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the Basic Law, allowing all states or \"Länder\", then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and West Berlin did so. However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The Saarland joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the \"new states\" of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.\n\nTherefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the Cold War. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism \"BRD\" began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary Duden in 1967. The German Democratic Republic at first used the name \"Westdeutschland\" or \"West Germany\" (abbreviated \"WD\") for the Federal Republic of Germany, but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany \"Deutsche Bundesrepublik\" or \"German Federal Republic\" (abbreviated \"DBR\"), because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name \"Germany\".\n\nThis changed in 1968 with the new constitution of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name \"BRD\" was introduced as a propaganda counter-term to the term \"DDR\", trying to express the equality of the states. Conversely, the West would speak of the \"sogenannte DDR\" or \"so-called 'DDR'\" when it had to be belittled.\n\nAt that time, the initialism \"BRD\" had been adopted by \"Neues Deutschland\", the ruling Socialist Unity Party's daily newspaper, while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973.\n\nThe East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms \"Deutschland\" (\"Germany\") and \"deutsch\" (\"German\") in a number of terms, for example:\n\n\nHowever, the ruling party's full name, \"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" or \"Socialist Unity Party of Germany\" remained unchanged, as did that of its newspaper \"Neues Deutschland\" (\"New Germany\") .\nTherefore, using the abbreviation \"BRD\" fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the vehicle registration code \"D\", hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for \"DDR\" and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting \"BRD\". \nThis was rejected by the West, where some motorists displayed bumper stickers with the slogan \"BRD - Nein Danke!\" (\"BRD? No Thanks!\"). Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing naïve Communist sympathies.\nAs a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms \"Bundesrepublik\" or \"Bundesgebiet\" (\"Federal Republic\", or \"Federal Territory\") to refer to the country and \"Bundesbürger\" (\"Federal Citizen[s]\") as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective \"bundesdeutsch\" (federally German).\n\nTo distance themselves from the term \"BRD\", until German reunification, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany and media sometimes used the abbreviations \"BR Deutschland,\" \"BR-Dt.\", \"BRDt.\",\nWest Germany had always claimed to be \"the\" Germany, and did not like the comparison to \"DDR\", or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the Hallstein Doctrine determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after Walter Hallstein, State secretary at the Foreign Office, this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR. Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an exclusive mandate over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established \"de facto\" diplomatic relations with East Germany. Under the terms of the Basic Treaty in 1972, Bonn and East Berlin exchanged \"permanent missions\", headed by \"permanent representatives\", rather than \"de jure\" embassies headed by ambassadors. Similarly, relations with the GDR were not conducted through the Foreign Office, but through a separate Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations, to which the East German mission was accredited.\n\nIn 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs (later Intra-German Relations) issued the \"Directives for the appellation of Germany\" recommending that the use of \"BRD\" be avoided. On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the Bundestag that the West German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF agreed not to use the initialism.\n\nUnder the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of Bavaria, forbidden it. Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of Schleswig-Holstein of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be \"nicht wünschenswert\" or \"undesirable\". The conference of all the states ministers for school education decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools. with pupils being required to write \"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" in full and use of the term being deemed an error. The different usages were so ingrained that one could deduce a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using \"BRD\".\n\nHowever, as the Association for the German Language found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate.\n\nA similar ideological question was the question whether to use \"Berlin (West)\" (the officially preferred name) or \"West Berlin\", and even whether to write \"West Berlin\" in German as two hyphenated words - \"West-Berlin\" - or as one word - \"Westberlin\".\n\nMost Westerners called the Western sectors \"Berlin\", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin \"Groß-Berlin\" or \"Greater Berlin\", but changed this \"Berlin (West)\", although it also used the hyphenated \"West-Berlin\". However, the East German government commonly referred to it as \"Westberlin\". Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called \"Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR\" (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term \"Democratic Berlin\", or simply \"Berlin\", by East Germany, and \"Berlin (Ost)\" by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included \"Ost-Berlin\" and \"Ostberlin\" (both meaning \"East Berlin\") as well as \"Ostsektor\" or \"Eastern Sector\". These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" using \"Ost-Berlin\" and the centre-left \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" using \"Ostberlin\".\n\nThe naming of the German Democratic Republic was also a controversial issue, West Germans at first preferring the names \"Mitteldeutschland\" (\"Middle Germany\") and \"Sowjetische Besatzungszone\" (Soviet Occupation Zone) abbreviated as \"SBZ\". This only changed under Willy Brandt when West German authorities started using the official name, \"Deutsche Demokratische Republik\" or \"DDR\", but many conservative German newspapers, like \"Bild\", owned by the Springer company, always wrote \"DDR\" in scare quotes until 1 August 1989.\n\nIn 1995, a disagreement arose between reunified Germany and newly independent Slovakia, as Germany objected to the use of the Slovak language name \"Nemecká spolková republika\" (literally \"German Federal Republic\") owing to its Cold War connotations, instead of \"Spolková republika Nemecko\". This was almost identical to the equivalent \"Spolková republika Německo\" in Czech, a language closely related to Slovak, but the Slovak authorities claimed that \"Federal Republic of Germany\" could not be translated grammatically into Slovak. However, the Slovak government had used it until the previous year, leading to suggestions in the Bratislava newspaper \"Narodna Obroda\" that they were using \"German Federal Republic\" to show their displeasure with German attitudes to the country.\n"}
{"id": "12587155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12587155", "title": "Battle of Ain Dara", "text": "Battle of Ain Dara\n\nThe Battle of Ain Dara took place in the town of Ain Dara in 1711 between the Qaysi and Yamani tribo-political factions. The Qays were led by Emir Haydar of the Shihab dynasty and consisted of the Druze clans of Jumblatt, Talhuq, Imad and Abd al-Malik and the Maronite clan of Khazen. The Yamani faction was led by Mahmoud Abi Harmoush and consisted of the Druze Alam ad-Din, Arslan and al-Sawaf clans. The Yamani faction also had backing from the Ottoman provincial authorities of Sidon and Damascus. The battle ended in a rout for the Yamani faction and resulted in the consolidation of Qaysi political and fiscal domination over Mount Lebanon. The battle's outcome also precipitated a mass migration of pro-Yamani Druze nobility and peasants from Mount Lebanon to the eastern Hauran, in a mountainous area today known as Jabal al-Druze.\n\nIn 17th-century Mount Lebanon, the Druze were the major demographic group of the region. The Druze had been divided into political factions based on the pre-Islamic Arab tribal divisions of the Qays and Yaman. The Ma'ans, whose emirs (princes) consistently held the tax farms of Mount Lebanon's districts (Chouf, Matn, Keserwan, Gharb and Jurd), represented the Qaysi faction, along with their allies, the Druze clans of Jumblatt, Imad, Talhuq and Abu'l Lama, the Maronite Khazen clan of Keserwan, and the Sunni Muslim Shihab clan of Wadi al-Taym. Leading the Yamani faction was the Druze Alam ad-Din clan, whose members occasionally gained the tax farms of Mount Lebanon during times of conflict between the Ma'ans and the Ottoman authorities. Other families belonging to the Yamani faction were the Druze clans of Arslan and al-Sawaf.\n\nIn 1697, Emir Ahmad Ma'an died without a male heir, and as a result, the Druze sheikhs of the Qaysi faction decided to appoint a strong and unifying family to head the faction to prevent a potential Yamani rise to power. The Qaysi sheikhs ultimately chose Bashir Shihab I to succeed Emir Ahmad due to the military strength of the Shihab clan, their distance from the intra-Qaysi disputes, and their marital kinship with Emir Ahmad (Bashir was Ahmad's maternal nephew). The Ottoman authorities confirmed the Ma'an-Shihab transition, but decided to invest Emir Ahmad's tax farms to Emir Haydar Shihab (Emir Ahmad's grandson). Due to Emir Haydar's youth, Emir Bashir served as regent. Emir Bashir strengthened Qaysi dominance in Mount Lebanon and installed the Qaysi sheikh Umar al-Zaydani of the Sunni Muslim Zaydani clan as the tax farmer of Safad and its region, while securing the allegiance of the Shia Muslim Sa'ab and Munkir clans of Jabal Amil (the Wa'il clan of Jabal Amil was pro-Yamani).\n\nAfter Emir Bashir died from poisoning, allegedly on Emir Haydar's orders, the Ottomans rescinded the power of the Shihabs in Jabal Amil (the Munkirs and Sa'abs then defected to the pro-Yamani coalition) and the Galilee. Moreover, in 1709, the Ottoman governor of Sidon Eyalet, which included Mount Lebanon, Beirut Galilee and Jabal Amil, deposed Emir Haydar from the tax farm of Chouf and transferred to it Emir Haydar's erstwhile associate-turned-enemy, Mahmoud Abu Harmoush. Abu Harmoush joined forces with the Alam ad-Din-led Yamani faction and the latter soon after gained dominance in Mount Lebanon. However, the popular support for the Yamani faction in Chouf was not deep. Abu Harmoush, with the backing of Sidon's governor, pursued Emir Haydar, who had since fled to Ghazir where he found protection from the Maronite Hubaysh clan. Ghazir was plundered and Emir Haydar fled northeast to Hermel in the northern Beqaa Valley.\n\nThe Qaysi clans of Mount Lebanon sent appeals to Emir Haydar to return and restore their control over the region. Buoyed by the Qaysi rallying of support, Emir Haydar relocated to Matn in 1711 where he sought safe haven with the Abu'l Lama, who controlled the subdistrict. Emir Haydar and the Abu'l Lama mobilized their forces at the village of Ras al-Matn, where they were soon joined by the heads of the various Qaysi clans of Mount Lebanon and their forces. They included Sheikh Ali Jumblatt, Qabalan al-Qadi al-Tanukhi, Sayyid Ahmad Imad, Ali Abi Nakad, Janbulat Abd al-Malik and Muhammad Talhuq. Hearing of the Qaysi mobilization, Abu Harmoush called on the Yamani nobles of the Alam ad-Din and Arslan clans to mobilize at the Jurd village of Ain Dara, and they were also joined by the Shia Muslim Harfush clan of the Beqaa Valley.\n\nThe Ottoman governor of Sidon sent troops through Beirut to aid the Yamani coalition, while the governor of Damascus did the same, but his troops were led through the Beqaa Valley. Through these maneuvers, the Ottoman provincial authorities and the Yamani faction intended to launch a pincer assault against the Qaysi camp at Ras al-Matn. However, on 20 March, Emir Haydar launched an all-out assault against the Yamani camp at Ain Dara to preempt the arrival of Ottoman reinforcements and being subsequently attacked from different directions. In the ensuing battle, the Qaysi coalition dealt a blow to the Yamani camp, which suffered heavy casualties. Seven sheikhs of the Alam ad-Din clan were killed, while Abu Harmoush was captured. Emir Haydar subsequently sent kind-worded notices to the governors of Sidon and Damascus, who ultimately accepted the Qaysi victory and withdrew their forces.\n\nThe Harfushes appear to have been back in control of Baalbek by\n1702, when local accounts indicate that a Christian sheikh of ‘Aqura in Mt\nLebanon entered emir Husain’s (Harfush) service as yazıcı, or secretary, on account of his\nTurkish skills. In 1711, French consular reports suggest, Husayn Harfush gave shelter to\nHaydar Shihabi and then supplied 2,500 troops to help him wipe out his Druze\nrivals at ‘Ain Dara and establish himself as sole emir of the Chouf. This is\ncuriously not addressed by H. A. al-Shihabi or any other chronicles of the period.\n\nAnd professor Winter said in his Doctoral thesis:\n\n\"The Harfushes do not seem to have joined the Hamadas who had already been at war with the vali of Tripoli for nearly a year. Instead, they gave emir Haydar al-Shihabi refuge when it became clear that the state intended to replace him with a rival Druze household, and provided 2500 troops to enable him to crush his enemies and establish the Shihabi as the sole tribal ruler ship of Sidon.\"\n\nThe Qaysi victory at Ain Dara led to major political, social and demographic changes in Mount Lebanon. The Yamani faction was removed as a political force in Mount Lebanon, and Emir Haydar proceeded to reorganize the local leadership of the region, distributing \"muqata'at\" (tax collection districts, sing. \"muqata'a\") to his Qaysi partisans in the various subdistricts of Mount Lebanon. He confirmed his allies as the leaders of their home districts and promoted them to higher social ranks. Thus, the Abu'l Lama sheikhs of Matn became emirs, joining the ranks of the Shihabs and Arslans. Jumblatt authority, normally centered in the Chouf, was extended to Jezzin and southern Mount Lebanon. The Nakad, Imad, and Abd al-Malik leaders were promoted to the rank of sheikhs, and were confirmed as the \"muqata'jis\" (tax farm holders) of the Manasif, Arqub and Jurd \"muqata'at\", respectively. The Talhuq clan leaders were also promoted to the rank of sheikhs, and were given the upper part of the Arslan's \"muqata'a\" of Gharb, while the Arslans were kept in the lower Gharb. The Arslans had their \"muqata'a\" reduced because of their allegiance with the Yamani faction. However, they were permitted by Emir Haydar to remain in Mount Lebanon. Emir Haydar did not sublease his holdings at Deir al-Qamar, Ain Dara, Batloun, Niha and Ammatour, preferring to keep these key villages under his direct fiscal authority. In the northern Keserwan district of Mount Lebanon, Emir Haydar confirmed the Maronite Khazen and Hubaysh sheikhs as \"muqata'jis\".\n\nThe defeat of the Alam ad-Din clan at Ain Dara consolidated the power of the Shihab dynasty in Mount Lebanon, to the point that it became an \"established custom in the land of the Druze that no one would raise a weapon against a Shihabi emir unless he had another [Shihabi] emir with him\", according to Mishaqa. Nonetheless, Shihabi power was dependent on their alliances and patronage networks with various Druze clans. The Qaysi victory also strengthened the hand of the Shihabs' allies, the Shia Hamade of the Tripoli hinterland. The Hamade sheikhs were the landlords of the Maronite-dominant areas of Jubail, Batroun and Bsharri. Like the Shihab emirs, the Hamade muqaddams (a social rank higher than sheikh, but lower than emir) were virtually left to their own devices by the governors of Tripoli as long as the latter were paid the annual taxes of the region. Though the Yamani faction was eliminated, a new rivalry gradually emerged among the remaining Druze clans consisting of the Jumblatti and Yazbaki factions; the former was led by its namesake, Sheikh Ali Jumblatt, and the latter was led Sheikh Abd al-Salam Yazbak Imad. Each took sides with different Shihabi emirs contesting control of the emirate in the years following Emir Haydar's death in 1732. The rivalry escalated after the resignation of Haydar's eldest son and successor, Emir Mulhim Shihab.\n\nWith the exception of the Arslans, Emir Haydar forced the Yamani Druze to leave Mount Lebanon, leading to a mass exodus to the Hauran region south of Damascus, where a previous wave of Druze from Mount Lebanon had begun settling in 1685. In the Druze emigrants' place came Maronite peasants from the region of Tripoli, to the north of Mount Lebanon. While Christian growth in the region was a long-term trend, the Yamani Druze exodus significantly contributed to a demographic shift in Mount Lebanon, with Maronites and other Christians, namely from the Greek Orthodox and Melkite sects, making up a large share of the population at the expense of the Druze. Nonetheless, the Druze \"muqata'jis\" remained the major political power, and Maronites, Melkites and Greek Orthodox Christians increasingly became the tenant farmers of the mostly Druze landlords of Mount Lebanon.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the father of wrestlers Barry and Kendall Windham, father-in-law of Mike Rotunda, and the maternal grandfather of Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas.\n\nAs a young man, Windham played football at Texas Western College, now known as the University of Texas at El Paso. Windham served a tour of duty in the United States Marine Corps. He then went on to play for the New York Jets during the 1966 pre-season and received tryouts with the New Orleans Saints and Denver Broncos.\n\nAfter football, at the urging of Wahoo McDaniel, Windham trained with Joe Blanchard in Corpus Christi, Texas and later with Verne Gagne and became a professional wrestler in the American Wrestling Association. Billed as being 6' 9\" and over 300 pounds, Windham was a rawboned cowboy in the vein of Bobby Duncum or Stan Hansen.\n\nHis training complete, he prepared to move on to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) and was transformed into Blackjack Mulligan. Mulligan donned black trunks, black hat, a black fingerless glove, and used the iron claw submission hold.\n\nWhen he arrived in the WWWF, he was managed by The Grand Wizard. Early stills of the two actually identify him as Big Bob Windham. Mulligan went on to great success in the Northeast and was an early challenger to newly crowned champion Pedro Morales. His push was interrupted when he was slashed in the thigh by a fan at the Boston Garden and required hundreds of stitches to close the wound. The culprit was actually captured by Gorilla Monsoon, who threw him at the ringside police – who promptly let him go because they thought \"it was part of the show\".\n\nBefore he left to recover from his wound, Mulligan participated in a Madison Square Garden match against Bruno Sammartino, who was making his first appearance at the arena since the end of his nearly 8 year championship reign. Mulligan attacked Sammartino before the bell. Sammartino quickly recovered, slammed Mulligan twice and pinned him in 64 seconds. In wrestling terms, everybody \"got over\" - the building was sold out to the delight of promoter Vince McMahon the elder, Sammartino made a strong return to New York and Mulligan, who was in no condition to work an actual match, received a large pay-off to aid his recovery.\n\nOnce he healed, Mulligan returned to the Midwest and tagged with Lanza to form The Blackjacks. The duo went on to capture numerous tag team championships in various NWA affiliated promotions as well as the WWWF World Tag Team Championship in August 1975.\n\nBlackjack returned to singles wrestling in the Jim Crockett Promotions where he would go on to hold the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship and the Mid-Atlantic's version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Ric Flair.\n\nMulligan often battled André the Giant, feuding in many different regions in the early 1980s. When they brought their feud to the WWF (formerly the WWWF) in 1982, Windham was noted as saying Andre had no limit to his strength. Mulligan then wrestled in Florida. He often teamed with West Texas stars Dusty Rhodes, Dick Murdoch, and his son Barry Windham. Mulligan returned to the WWF as a full-time performer in 1984, hosting an interview segment titled \"Blackjack's Barbecue\" on \"WWF All-Star Wrestling\", the counterpart to Roddy Piper's \"Piper's Pit\".\n\nIn 1986, Mulligan wrestled under a mask as \"Big Machine\", part of a team with \"The Giant Machine\" (André the Giant) and \"Super Machine\" (Bill Eadie) collectively known as The Machines. They won several high-profile matches against the Heenan family, later recruiting members such as 'Hulk Machine' and 'Piper Machine'. After that angle ended, Mulligan wrestled for the WWF as himself, until he finally left in 1987. Later on, Jack traveled to Dallas and competed in World Class Championship Wrestling, wrestling against Bruiser Brody, Chris Adams and Kevin and Lance Von Erich. Mulligan also returned to Florida in 1987 to fight against the Funk brother, teaming with Kevin Sullivan.\n\nMulligan worked as a match booker and promoter all around the South, eventually co-owning the Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion with Dick Murdoch after purchasing it from Dory and Terry Funk. Mulligan and his Blackjacks partner, Jack Lanza were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 1, 2006 by their manager, Bobby Heenan.\n\nIn 1990, Blackjack Mulligan and his son Kendall Windham were arrested by the US Secret Service in a joint investigation with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) for counterfeiting. The authorities found close to $500,000 in phony $20 bills. As a result of a plea agreement, both father and son spent 24 months in a federal prison and were released in 1992.\n\nIn 2007, Windham published his book titled \"True Lies and Alibis\", which tells about his personal life and his professional wrestling career.\n\nIn 2012, Windham, a born again Christian, was ordained a minister by Divine Hearts Ministry located in Lake Saint Louis, Missouri. He was very devoted to spending the time he had remaining to spreading the word of God. He felt his ordination could help him in this endeavor.\n\nIn July 2015, Windham was named as a defendant in a 2015 lawsuit filed by WWE after they received a letter from him indicating that he intended to sue them for concussion-based injuries sustained during his tenure with them. He was represented by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who is involved in several other lawsuits involving former WWE wrestlers.\n\nAfter dealing with health issues in recent years and being hospitalized with a heart attack several months earlier, Windham was hospitalized in Florida in October 2015. He died on April 7, 2016.\n\n\n"}

Volume I: The Process of Production of Capital () is an 1867 economics book by German philosopher Karl Marx. In \"Volume I\", the only part of Marx's multi-volume \"\" to be published during his lifetime, Marx critiques capitalism chiefly from the standpoint of its production processes. After Marx's death, Friedrich Engels compiled and expanded his friend's notes into volumes \"II\" (1885) and \"III\" (1894).\n\nIn the years since its publication \"Capital. Volume I\" has come to be considered as a major work of modern economic thought, alongside the likes of Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776) and Keynes's \"General Theory\" (1936). It is the central text of the field of Marxian economics.\n\nChapters 1, 2, and 3 are a theoretical discussion of the commodity, value, exchange, and the genesis of money. As Marx writes, \"Beginnings are always difficult in all sciences ... the section that contains the analysis of commodities, will therefore present the greatest difficulty.\" The modern reader is often perplexed about Marx going on about \"one coat is equal to twenty yards of linen\". Professor John Kenneth Galbraith reminds us that \"the purchase of a coat by an average citizen was an action comparable in modern times to the purchase of an automobile or even a house.\"\n\nA \"commodity\" according to Marx is a use-value and also an exchange-value. Marx explains that, as a use-value, the commodity is something that meets a human want or need of any kind; it is a useful thing. The use-value of the commodity is determined by how useful the commodity is. The actual use-value, however, is immeasurable. He explains that use-value can only be determined \"in use or consumption\". After determining the commodity as being a use-value, he explains that a commodity is also an \"exchange-value\". He explains this as the quantity of other commodities that it will exchange for. He gives the example of corn and iron. No matter their relationship, there will always be an equation where a certain amount of corn will exchange for a certain amount of iron. He sets up this example to say that all commodities are in essence parallel in that they can always be exchanged for certain quantities of other commodities. He also explains that one cannot determine the exchange-value of the commodity simply by looking at it or examining its natural qualities. The exchange-value is not material but a measure made by humans. In order to determine the exchange-value, one must see the commodity being exchanged with other commodities. Marx explains that these two aspects of commodities are at the same time separate but also connected in that one cannot be discussed without the other. Marx explains that while the use-value of something can only change in quality, the exchange-value can only change in quantity.\n\nMarx then goes on to explain that the exchange-value of a commodity is merely an expression of its value. Value is what connects all commodities so that they can all be exchanged with each other. The value of a commodity is determined by its socially necessary labour time, defined as \"the labour time required to produce any use-value under the conditions of production, normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent in that society.\" Therefore, Marx explains, the value of a commodity does not stay constant as it advances or it varies in labour productivity, which may occur for many reasons. However, value does not mean anything unless it conjoins back to use value. If a commodity is produced and no one wants it or it has no use, then \"the labour does not count as labour,\" and therefore it has no value. He also says that one can produce use-value without being a commodity. If one produces a commodity solely for his own benefit or need, he has produced use-value but no commodity. Value can only be derived when the commodity has use-value for others. Marx calls this social use-value. He writes all of this to explain that all aspects of the commodity (use-value, exchange-value, and value) are all separate from each other, but are also essentially connected to each other.\n\nMarx in this section discusses the relationship between labour and value. He states if there is a change in the quantity of labour expended to produce an article, the value of the article will change. This is a direct correlation. Marx gives as an example the value of linen versus cloth to explain the worth of each commodity in a capitalist society. Linen is hypothetically twice as valuable as thread because more socially necessary labour time was used to create it. Use-value of every commodity is produced by useful labour. Use-value measures the actual usefulness of a commodity, whereas value is a measurement of exchange value. Objectively speaking, linen and thread have some value. Different forms of labour create different kinds of use-values. The value of the different use-values created by different types of labor can be compared because both are expenditures of human labour. One coat and twenty yards of linen take the same amount of socially necessary labour time to make, so they have the same value.\nAs we have expected in the production of the commodities, it lessen the capacity to create a high value of products.\n\nIn this section Marx explains that commodities come in double form: natural form and value form. We do not know commodities' value until we know how much human labor was put in it. Commodities are traded for one another after their values are decided socially. Then there is value-relation, which lets us trade between different kind of commodities. Marx explains value without using money. Marx uses 20 yards of linen and a coat to show the value of each other (20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat). The statement \"20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat\" label two forms of value. The first form, the relative form of value, is the commodity that comes first in the statement (the 20 yards of linen in the example). The second form, the equivalent form of value, is the commodity that comes second in the statement (the 1 coat in the example). He adds that comparing 20 yards of linen to itself (20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen, or 20 yards of linen are worth 20 yards of linen) is meaningless, because there is no expression of value. Linen is an object of utility whose value cannot be determined until it is compared to another commodity. Determining the value of a commodity depends on its position in the expression of comparative exchange value.\n\nMarx begins this section with an equation for the expanded form of value: \"z commodity A = u commodity B or = v commodity C or = w commodity D or = x commodity E or = etc.\" where the lower case letters (z, u, v, w, and x) represent quantities of a commodity and upper case letters (A, B, C, D, and E) represent specific commodities so that an example of this could be: \"20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 10 lb. tea or = 40 lb. coffee or = 1 quarter of corn or = 2 ounces of gold or = ½ ton of iron or = etc.\" Marx explains that with this example of the expanded form of value the linen \"is now expressed in terms of innumerable other members of the world of commodities. Every other commodity now becomes a mirror of linen's value.\" At this point, the particular use-value of linen becomes unimportant, but rather it is the magnitude of value (determined by socially necessary labor time) possessed in a quantity of linen which determines its exchange with other commodities. This chain of particular kinds (different commodities) of values is endless: it contains every commodity and changes constantly as new commodities come into being.\n\nMarx begins this section with the table:\n\nThen he divides this sub-set of section 3 into three parts:\n\n(1) \"The changed character of the form of value.\" After highlighting the previous two sub-sets Marx explains that these commodities now have a unified exchange-value, expressed through comparisons to one single kind of commodity. All commodities are now differentiated from their use-values and are equated to each other as exchange-values. The general value-form, which represents all products of labour, shows that it is the social resume of the world of commodities. In the world of commodities the character possessed by all labour of being human labour constitutes its specific social character.\n\n(2) \"The development of the relative and equivalent forms of value: their interdependence.\" Here Marx writes about the interrelatedness of the relative form and the equivalent form. He first explains that there is a correlation between them even though they are polar opposites. He states that we must also realize that the equivalent form is a representation and an offshoot of the relative form.\n\nThings cannot be either completely relative or completely equivalent. There must be a combination to express the magnitude and universal equivalency. That form is the expanded relative form of value, which is a \"specific relative form of value of the equivalent commodity.\"\n\n(3) \"The transition from the general form of value to the money form.\" This is the transitional idea between taking the general form (the universal equivalent form for all general commodities) and turning it into the money form. Here Marx describes how there can be a commodity so universal to all commodities that it actually excludes itself to the point of no longer being an equivalent commodity but rather a representation of a commodity. Acceptance of its commodity exchange value is so universal that it can transition into a form of money, for example, gold.\n\n\nHere Marx illustrates the shift to \"money form\". Universal equivalent form or universal exchangeability has caused gold to take the place of linen in the socially accepted customs of exchange. Once it had reached a set value in the world of commodities gold became the money commodity. Money form is distinct from Sections A, B, and C.\n\nNow that gold has a relative value against a commodity (such as linen), it can attain price form:\n\nThis illustrates the application of price form as a universal equivalent. Marx concludes this section by pointing out that \"the simple commodity-form is therefore the germ of the money-form.\" And, the simplified application of this idea is then illustrated as:\n\nx of commodity A = y of commodity B\n\nMarx's inquiry in this section focuses on the nature of the commodity, apart from its basic use-value. In other words, why does the commodity appear to have an exchange-value as if it was an intrinsic characteristic of the commodity instead of a measurement of the homogenous human labor spent to do the commodity? Marx explains that this sort of fetishism, which attributes to a thing a characteristic when it is actually a social product, originates in the fact that under a commodity based society the social labour, the social relations between producers and their mutual interdependence, solely manifest in the market, in the process of exchange. Therefore, the value of the commodity is determined independently from private producers so it seems that it is the market which determines the value apparently based on a characteristic of the commodity; it seems as if there are relations between commodities instead of relations between producers.\n\nMarx also explains that due to the historical circumstances of capitalist society, the values of commodities are usually studied by political economists in their most advanced form: money. These economists see the value of the commodity as something metaphysically autonomous from the social labor that is the actual determinant of value. Marx calls this fetishism—the process whereby the society that originally generated an idea eventually, through the distance of time, forgets that the idea is actually a social and therefore all-too-human product. This society will no longer look beneath the veneer of the idea (in this case the value of commodities) as it currently exists. The society will simply take the idea as a natural and/or God-given inevitability that they are powerless to alter it.\n\nMarx compares this fetishism to the manufacturing of religious belief: people initially create a deity to fulfill whatever desire or need they have in present circumstances, but then these products of the human brain appear as autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own and enter into a relations both with each other and with the human race. Similarly, commodities only enter into relation with each other through exchange, which is a purely social phenomenon. Before that, they are simply useful items, but not commodities. Value itself cannot come from use-value because there is no way to compare the usefulness of an item; there are simply too many potential functions.\n\nOnce in exchange, commodities' values are determined by the amount of socially useful labor-time put into them, because labor can be generalized. For example, it takes longer to mine diamonds than it does to dig quartz, so diamonds are worth more. Fetishism within capitalism occurs once labor has been socially divided and centrally coordinated, and the worker no longer owns the means of production. They no longer have access to the knowledge of how much labor went into a product, because they no longer control its distribution. The only obvious determinant of value remaining to the mass of people is the value that was assigned in the past. Thus, the value of a commodity seems to arise from a mystical property inherent to it, rather than from labor-time, the actual determinant of value.\n\nIn chapter 2 Marx explains the social and private characteristics of the process of exchange. According to Marx, owners of commodities must recognise one another as owners of commodities which embody value. He explains exchange not merely as a swapping of items, but as a contract between the two. It is this exchange which also allows the commodity in question to realise its exchange value, and he explains that the realisation of exchange value always precedes that of use value because one must obtain the item in question before its actual utility is realised. Furthermore, Marx explains that the use value in question can only be realised by he who purchases the commodity, whereas he who is selling a commodity must find no utility in the item, save the utility of its exchange value. Marx concludes the chapter with an abstraction about the necessitated advent of money wherever exchange takes place, starting between nations, and gradually becoming more and more domestic. This money form which arises out of the necessity of liquidating exchange becomes the universal equivalent form which is set aside from all commodities as a mere measure of value, creating a money-commodities dualism.Chapter 2\n\nIn chapter 3, section I Marx examines the functions of money commodities. According to Marx the main function of money is to provide commodities with the medium for the expression of their values, i.e. labor time. The function of money as a measure of value serves only in an imaginary or ideal capacity. That is, the money that performs the functions of a measure of value is only imaginary because it is society that has given the money its value. The value of one ton of iron for example, is expressed by an imaginary quantity of the money commodity, which contains the same amount of labor as the iron.\n\nAs a measure of value and a standard of price, Money performs two functions. First, it is the measure of value as the social incarnation of human labor. Second, it serves as a standard of price as a quantity of metal with a fixed weight. As in any case where quantities of the same denomination are to be measured the stability of the measurement is of the utmost importance. Hence the less the unit of measurement is subject to variations the better it fulfills its role. Metallic currency can only serve as a measure of value because it is itself a product of human labor.\n\nCommodities with definite prices appear in this form: a commodity A = x gold; b commodity B = y gold; c commodity C = z gold, etc. where a, b, c represent definite quantities of the commodities A, B, C and x, y, z definite quantities of gold.\n\nIn spite of the varieties of commodities their values become magnitudes of the same denomination: gold-magnitudes. Since these commodities are all magnitudes of gold they are comparable and interchangeable.\n\nPrice is the money-name of the labor objectified in a commodity. Like the relative form of value in general, price expresses the value of a commodity by asserting that a given quantity of the equivalent is directly interchangeable. The price form implies both the exchangeability of commodities for money and the necessity of exchange. Gold serves as an ideal measure of value only because it has already established itself as the money commodity in the process of exchange.\n\nIn this section Marx further examines the paradoxical nature of the exchange of commodities. The contradictions that exist within the process of exchange provide the structure for \"social metabolism\". The process of social metabolism \"transfers commodities from hands in which they are non-use-values to hands in which they are use-values.\" Commodities can only exist as \"values\" for a seller and \"use-values\" for a buyer. In order for a commodity to be both a \"value\" and a \"use-value\" it must be produced for exchange. The process of exchange alienates the ordinary commodity when its antithesis, the \"money commodity\" becomes involved. During exchange, the money commodity confronts the ordinary commodity disguising the true form of the ordinary commodity. Commodities as use-values, and money as exchange-value are now on the opposite poles, and exist as separate entities. In practice, in the process of exchange, gold or money functions as \"exchange-value\" while commodities function as \"use-values.\" A commodity's existence is only validated through the form of money, and money is only validated through the form of a commodity. This dualistic phenomenon involving money and commodities is directly related to Marx's concept of \"use-value\" and \"value.\"\n\nMarx examines the two metamorphoses of the commodity through sale and purchase. In this process, \"as far as concerns its material content, the movement is C-C, the exchange of one commodity for another, the metabolic interaction of social labor, in whose result the process itself becomes extinguished.\"\n\nFirst metamorphosis of the commodity, or sale.\n\nIn the process of sale, the value of a commodity, which is measured by socially necessary labor-time, is then measured by the universal equivalent, gold.\n\nThe second or concluding metamorphosis of the commodity: purchase.\n\nThrough the process of purchase all commodities lose their form by the universal alienator, money. \"Since every commodity disappears when it becomes money it is impossible to tell from the money itself how it got into the hands of its possessor, or what article has been changed into it\".\n\nA purchase represents a sale although they are two separate transformations. This process allows for the movement of commodities and the circulation of money.\n\nThe circulation of money is first initiated by the transformation of a commodity into money. The commodity is taken from its natural state and transformed into its monetary state. When this happens the commodity \"falls out of circulation into consumption.\" The previous commodity now in its monetary form replaces a new and different commodity continuing the circulation of money. In this process, money is the means for the movement and circulation of commodities. Money assumes the measure of value of a commodity, i.e. the socially necessary labor-time. The repetition of this process constantly removes commodities from their starting places, taking them out of the sphere of circulation. Money circulates in the sphere and fluctuates with the sum of all the commodities that co-exist within the sphere. The price of commodities varies by three factors: \"the movement of prices, the quantity of commodities in circulation, and the velocity of circulation of money.\"\n\nMoney takes the shape of a coin because of how it behaves in the sphere of circulation. Gold became the universal equivalent by the measurement of its weight in relation to commodities. This process was a job that belonged to the state. The problem with gold was that it wore down as it circulated from hand to hand, so the state introduced new circulating media: silver, copper, and inconvertible paper money issued by the State as a representation of gold. Marx views money as a \"symbolic existence\" which haunts the sphere of circulation and arbitrarily measures the product of labor.\n\nThe exchange of money is a continuous flow of sales and purchase. Marx writes, \"In order to be able to buy without selling, [one] must have previously sold without buying.\" This simple illustration demonstrates the essence of hoarding. In order to potentially buy without selling a commodity in your possession, you must have hoarded some degree of money in the past. Money becomes greatly desired due to potential purchasing power. If one has money, one can exchange it for commodities, and vice versa. However, while satisfying this newly arisen fetish for gold, the hoard causes the hoarder to make personal sacrifices and explains its amorality \"doing away all distinctions\" by citing \"Timon of Athens\" by Shakespeare.\n\nIn this section Marx analyzes the relationship between debtor and creditor and exemplifies the idea of the transfer of debt. In relation to this, Marx discusses how the money-form has become a means of incremental payment for a service or purchase. He states that the \"function of money as means of payment begins to spread out beyond the sphere of circulation of commodities. It becomes the universal material of contracts.\" Due to fixed payments and the like, debtors are forced to hoard money in preparation for these dates. \"While hoarding, as a distinct mode of acquiring riches, vanishes with the progress of civil society, the formation of reserves of the means of payment grows with that progress.\"\n\nCountries have reserves of gold and silver for two purposes: (1) Home Circulation, and (2) External Circulation in World Markets. Marx says that it is essential for countries to hoard, as money is needed \"as the medium of the home circulation and home payments, and in part out of its function of money of the world.\" Accounting for this hoarding in the context of hoarded money's inability to contribute to the growth of a capitalist society, Marx states that banks are the relief to this problem:\n\nIn Part II of Volume I of Capital, Karl Marx explains the three components necessary to create capital through the process of circulation: the first section of Part II, Chapter 4, explains the general formula for capital; Chapter 5 delves further by explaining the contradictions of the general formula; and the last section of Part II, Chapter 6, describes the sale and purchase of labor power within the general formula.\n\nMoney, as described by Marx, can only be transformed into capital through the circulation of commodities. Money originates not as capital, but only as means of exchange. Money becomes capital when it is used as a standard for exchange. The circulation of commodities has two forms that make up the general formula: C-M-C and M-C-M. C-M-C represents the process of first selling a commodity for money (C-M) and then using that money to buy another commodity (M-C): \"selling in order to buy\". M-C-M describes transacting money for a commodity (M-C) and then selling the commodity for more capital, (C-M).\n\nThe largest distinction between the two forms appears through the result of each. During C-M-C, a commodity sold will be replaced by a commodity bought. In this form money only acts as a means of exchange. The transaction ends there, with the exchange of use-values and the money has, according to Marx, \"been spent once and for all.\" The C-M-C form facilitates the exchange of one use-value for another. On the contrary, during M-C-M, money is essentially exchanged for more money. The person who invested money into a commodity sells it for money. The money returns to the initial starting place, so the money is not spent, as in the C-M-C form of exchange, but instead advanced. The only function of this process lies in its ability to valorize. By withdrawing more money from circulation than the amount put in, money can be reinvested in circulation creating repeated accumulation of monetary wealth—a never ending process. Thus M-C-M' becomes the objective of M-C-M. M' stands for the money returned in the circulative process (M) plus the additional surplus value gained (M∆): M'=M+M∆. Capital can only be created once the process of M-C-M has been completed and money returns to the starting point to be re-entered into circulation.\n\nKarl Marx points out that, \"in its pure form, the exchange of commodities is an exchange of equivalents, and thus it is not a method of increasing value,\" and so a contradiction reveals itself. If the participating individuals exchanged equal values, neither of the individuals would increase capital. The needs being satisfied would be the only gain. The creation of surplus-value then becomes rather peculiar for Marx, because commodities, in accordance with socially assigned necessary values, should not create surplus-value if traded fairly. Marx investigates the matter and concludes, \"surplus-value cannot arise from circulation, and therefore that, for it to be formed, something must take place in the background which is not visible in the circulation itself.\" According to Marx, labor determines the value of a commodity. Through the example of a piece of leather, Marx then describes how humans can, through the means of labor, increase the value of a commodity. Turning the leather into boots increases the value of the leather, because now more labor has been applied to the leather. Marx then explains the contradiction of the general formula. Capital cannot be created from circulation because equal exchange of commodities creates no surplus value, and unequal exchange of commodities changes the distribution of wealth, but still does not produce surplus-value. Capital cannot be created without circulation either, because labor creates value within the general formula. Marx writes, \"It must have its origin both in circulation and not in circulation.\" A \"double result\" remains: The capitalist must buy commodities at their value, sell them at their value, and yet conclude the process with more money than at the beginning. The profit seemingly originates both inside and outside the general formula.\n\nThe intricacies of the general formula relate to the role of labor-power.\n\nIn the last section of Part II, Marx investigates labor-power as a commodity. Labor-power existing on the market depends on two fulfillments: the workers must offer it for temporary sale on the market and the workers must not possess the means to their own subsistence. As long as the labor-power is sold temporarily then the worker is not considered a slave. Worker dependence for a means of subsistence ensures a large working force, necessary for the production of capital. The value of labor bought on the market as a commodity represents the definite amount of socially necessary labor objectified in the worker, or according to Marx, \"the labor-time necessary for the production [of the worker],\" which means the food, education, shelter, health, etc., required to create and maintain a worker. The capitalists need workers to combine with their means of production to create a sell-able commodity, and workers need capitalists to provide a wage that pays for a means of subsistence. Within the capitalist mode of production it is custom to pay for labor-power only after it has been exercised over a period of time, fixed by a contract (i.e. the work week).\n\nIn Part Three of Capital Volume I, Karl Marx explores the production of Absolute Surplus Value. To understand this one must first understand the labor process itself. According to Marx, the production of absolute surplus value arises directly out of the labor process.\n\nThere are two sides to the labor process. On one side there is the buyer of labor power, or the capitalist. On the other side there is the worker. For the capitalist the worker possesses only one use-value, that of labor power. The capitalist buys from the worker his labor power, or his ability to do work, and in return the worker receives a wage, or a means of subsistence.\n\nMarx says this of the labor process: \"In the labor process, therefore, man's activity, via the instruments of labor, effects an alteration in the object of labor…. The product of the process is a use-value, a piece of natural material adapted to human needs by means of change in its form. Labor has become bound up in its object: labor has been objectified, the object has been worked on\" The labor that the worker has put forth to produce the object has been transferred to the object, thus giving it value.\n\nUnder capitalism it is the capitalist who owns everything in the production process such as: the raw materials that the commodity is made of, the means of production, and the labor power (worker) itself. At the end of the labor process it is the capitalist who owns the product of their labor, not the workers who produced the commodities. Since the capitalist owns everything in the production process he is free to sell it for his own profit. The capitalist wants to produce: \"An article destined to be sold, a commodity; and secondly he wants to produce a commodity greater in value than the sum of the values of the commodities used to produce it, namely the means of production and the labor-power he purchased with his good money on the open market. His aim is to produce not only a use-value, but a commodity; not only use-value, but value; and not just value, but also surplus value.\"\n\nThe goal of the capitalist is to produce surplus value. However, producing surplus value proves to be difficult. If all goods are purchased at their full price then profit cannot be made. Surplus value cannot arise from buying the inputs of production at a low price and then selling the commodity at a higher price. This is due to the economic law of one price which states \"that if trade were free, then identical goods should sell for about the same price throughout the world\". What this law means is that profit cannot be made simply through the purchase and sale of goods. Price changes on the open market will force other capitalists to adjust their prices in order to be more competitive, resulting in one price.\n\nSo, where does surplus value originate? Quite simply, the origin of surplus value arises from the worker. To better understand how this happens consider the following example from Marx's Capital Volume I. A capitalist hires a worker to spin ten pounds of cotton into yarn. Suppose the value of the cotton is one dollar per pound. The entire value of the cotton is 10 dollars. The production process naturally causes wear and tear on the machinery that is used to help produce the yarn. Suppose this wearing down of machinery costs the capitalist two dollars. The value of labor power is three dollars per day. Now also suppose that the working day is six hours. In this example the production process yields up 15 dollars, and also costs the capitalist 15 dollars. Thus there is no profit.\n\nNow consider the process again, but this time the working day is 12 hours. In this case there is 20 dollars produced from the 20 pounds of cotton. Wear and tear on machinery now costs the capitalist four dollars. However, the value of labor power is still only three dollars per day. The entire production process costs the capitalist 27 dollars. However, the capitalist can now sell the yarn for 30 dollars. This is because the yarn still holds 12 hours of socially necessary labor time in it (equivalent to six dollars).\n\nThe key to this is that workers exchange their labor power in return for a means of subsistence. In this example, the means of subsistence has not changed; therefore the wage is still only 3 dollars per day. Notice that while the labor only costs the capitalist 3 dollars, the labor power produces 12 hours worth of socially necessary labor time. The secret of surplus value resides in the fact that there is a difference between the value of labor power and what that labor power can produce in a given amount of time. Labor power can produce more than its own value.\n\nSo, by working on materials during the production process the worker both preserves the value of the material and adds new value to the material. This value is added because of the labor that is necessary to transform the raw material into a commodity. But, according to Marx, value only exists in use-values, so how does the worker transfer value to a good? It is because \"Man himself, viewed merely as the physical existence of labor power, is a natural object, a thing, although a living, conscious thing, and labor is the physical manifestation of that power.\" In order for commodities to be produced with surplus value two things must be true. Man must be a living commodity, a commodity that produces labor power, and it must be the nature of this labor power to produce more than its own value.\n\nWhen capitalists begin production they initially spend their money on two inputs. These inputs can be represented with the capital advanced equation: formula_9; where C is capital advanced, c is constant capital, and v is variable capital. Constant capital is nothing more than the means of production (factories, machinery, raw materials, etc.). Constant capital has a fixed value which can be transferred to the commodity, though the value added to the commodity can never be more than the value of constant capital itself. The source of surplus value comes instead from Variable capital or labor power. Labor power is the only commodity capable of producing more value than it possesses.\n\nThe accumulation of capital occurs after the production process is completed. The equation for the accumulation of capital is formula_10'formula_11. Here C' is the value created during the production process. C' is equal to constant capital plus variable capital plus some extra amount of surplus value (s), which arises out of variable capital. Marx says that surplus value is \"merely a congealed quantity of surplus labor-time… nothing but objectified surplus labor.\"\n\nTo better understand the rate of surplus value one must understand that there are two parts to the working day. One part of the working day is the time necessary in order to produce the value of the workers labor power. The second part of the working day is surplus labor time, which produces no value for the laborer, but produces value for the capitalist. The rate of surplus value is a ratio of surplus labor time (s) to necessary labor time (v). The rate of surplus value (s/v) is also referred to by Marx as the rate of exploitation.\n\nCapitalists often maximize profits by manipulating the rate of surplus value, which can be done through the increase of surplus labor time. This method is referred to as the production of absolute surplus value. In this case capitalists merely increase the length of the working day. Though there are physical restrictions to the working day, such as general human needs, the working day is by no means fixed. This allows for great flexibility in the number of hours worked per day.\nThis flexibility in working hours leads to a class struggle between capitalist and worker. The capitalist argues that they have the right to extract all of the value from a day's labor, since that is what they bought. By contrast, the worker demands a limited working day. The worker needs to be able to renew his labor power so that it can be sold again anew. The capitalist sees working fewer hours as theft from capital, and the worker see working too many hours as theft from laborers. This class struggle can be seen throughout history, and eventually laws such as Factory Acts were put in place to limit the length of a working day and child labour. This forced capitalists to find a new way in which to exploit workers.\n\nPart Four of Capital, Volume I consists of four chapters: 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus-Value, 13: Co-operation, 14: Division of Labour and Manufacture, and 15: Machinery and Modern Industry. In Chapter 12, Marx explains a decrease in the value of labour power by increasing production. Chapters 13–15 examine ways in which the productivity of this labour is increased.\n\nThe section from A to B represents the necessary labour, and the section from B to C represents the surplus labour. Remember, the value of labour-power is \"the labour-time necessary to produce labour-power.\" What is of interest to Marx is, \"How can the production of surplus-value be increased, i.e. how can surplus labour be prolonged, without any prolongation, or independently of any prolongation, of the line AC?\" Marx says it is in the best interest of the capitalist to divide the working day like this:\n\nThis is showing that the amount of surplus labour is increased, while the amount of necessary labour is decreased. Marx calls this decrease in necessary labour and increase in surplus value as relative surplus-value (whereas when there is an actual lengthening in the working day and surplus value is produced, this is called absolute surplus-value.) For this to happen, the productivity of labour must increase. The perpetual drive of capital, according to Marx, is to increase the productivity of labor, leading to a decrease in the value of commodities. In this, the value of the workers means of subsistence decreases, resulting in a decrease in the value of his labour power.\n\nAccording to Marx, co-operation happens \"when numerous workers work together side by side in accordance with a plan, whether in the same process, or in different but connected processes.\" Co-operation also shortens the time needed to complete a given task. Marx says, \"If the labour process is complicated, then the sheer number of the co-operators permits the apportionment of various operations to different hands, and consequently their simultaneous performance. The time necessary for the completion of the whole work is thereby shortened.\" The effort by the capitalist to organize co-operation is simply for reasons of increasing production. While this is the case, Marx is quick to note that the collective powers of co-operation are not created by Capital. This, according to Marx, is a disguise or a fetish. Marx cites the building of the pyramids, which occurred prior to the organization of a capitalist mode of production.\n\nIn this section 1, The Dual Origin of Manufacture, Marx examines manufacture as a method of production involving specialized workers, or craftsmen, working on their own detailed task. Marx cites the assembly of a carriage as an example of the first way this is brought about. In this, multiple skilled workers are brought together to produce specialized parts once unique to their craft, contributing to the overall production of the commodity. Another way this manufacture arises is by splitting up a single handicraft into multiple specialized areas, further introducing a division of labour.\n\nIn this section, Marx argues that a worker who performs only one task throughout his life will perform his job at a faster and more productive rate, forcing capital to favor the specialized worker to the traditional craftsman. Marx also states that a specialized worker doing only one task can use a more specialized tool, which cannot do many jobs but can do the one job well, in a more efficient manner than a traditional craftsman using a multi-purpose tool on any specific task.\n\nIn this section, Marx argues that a division of labour within production produces a hierarchy of labor, skilled and unskilled, and also a variation in wages. Yet according to Marx, this division within the labour process reduces a workers skills collectively, which devalues their labour power.\n\nIn this section, Marx states that division of labour has existed in society long before the establishment of a capitalist mode of production. Marx argues that despite its existence prior to capital, division of labor is unique under capital because its goal is to increase the rate and mass of surplus value, not create a \"combined product of specialized labours.\"\n\nIn this section, Marx discusses an increased class struggle that is brought about by capital, or in this case in the division of labour. By creating such a division, it disguises the efforts and work of such a division as that of the capitalist. Division of labour under capitalism, according to Marx, is a subdivision of a workers potential and sets limitations on his mental and physical capacity, making him reliant upon the capitalist to exercise his specialized skill.\n\nIn this section, Marx explains the significance of machinery to capitalists and how it is applied to the workforce. The goal of introducing machinery into the workforce is to increase productivity. When productivity is increased, the commodity being produced is cheapened. Relative surplus value is amplified because machinery shortens the part of the day that the worker works for his or her means of subsistence and increases the time that the worker produces for the capitalist.\nMarx discusses tools and machines and their application to the process of production. Marx claims that many experts, including himself, cannot distinguish between tools and machines. Marx states that they \"call a tool a simple machine and a machine a complex tool.\" Marx continues to elaborate on this misinterpretation of definition, explaining that some people distinguish between a tool and a machine \"by saying that in the case of the tool, man is the motive power, whereas the power behind the machine is a natural force independent of man, for instance an animal, water, wind and so on.\" Marx explains a flaw with this approach comparing two examples. He points out that a plow, which is powered by an animal, would be considered to be a machine and Claussen's circular loom, which is able to weave at a tremendous speed, is in fact powered by one worker and therefore considered to be a tool. Marx gives a precise definition of the machine when he says \"The machine, therefore, is a mechanism that, after being set in motion, performs with its tools the same operation as the worker formerly did with similar tools. Whether the motive power is derived from man, or in turn from a machine, makes no difference here.\"\n\nThere are three parts to fully developed machinery:\n\n\nMarx believes the working machine is the most important part of developed machinery. It is in fact what began the industrial revolution of the eighteenth century and even today it continues to turn craft into industry.\n\nThe machine is able to replace a worker, who works at one specific job with one tool, with a mechanism that accomplishes the same task, but with many similar tools and at a much faster rate. One machine doing one specific task soon turns into a fleet of co-operating machines accomplishing the entire process of production. This aspect of automation enables the capitalist to replace large numbers of human workers with machines which creates a large pool of available workers that the capitalist can choose from to form his human workforce. The worker no longer needs to be skilled in a particular trade because their job has been reduced to oversight and maintenance of their mechanical successors.\n\nThe development of machinery is an interesting cycle where inventors started inventing machines to complete necessary tasks. The machine making industry grew larger and worker's efforts started focusing toward creating these machines, the objects which steal work from its own creator. With so many machines being developed, the need for new machines to create old machines increased. For example, the spinning machine started a need for printing and dyeing, and the designing of the cotton gin. \"Without steam engines, the hydraulic press could not have been made. Along with the press, came the mechanical lathe and an iron cutting machine. Labor assumes a material mode of existence which necessitates the replacement of human force by natural forces.\"\n\nAs seen in the previous section, the machine does not replace the tool, which is powered by man. The tool multiplies and expands into the working machine that is created by man. Workers now go to work not to handle the tools of production but to work with the machine, which handles the tools. It is clear that large-scale industry increase the productivity of labor to an extraordinary degree by incorporating its fast paced efficiency within the process of production. What is not as clear is that this new increase in productivity does not require an equal increase in expended labor by the worker. Machinery creates no new value. The machine accumulates value from the labor, which went into producing it, and it merely transfers its value into the product it's producing until its value is used up.\n\nOnly labor power, which is bought by capitalists, can create new value. Machinery transfers its value into the product at a rate, which is dependent upon how much the total value of the machinery is. \"The less value it gives up, the more productive it is, and the more its services approach those rendered by natural forces.\" The general rule of machinery is that the labor used to create it must be less than how much human work it replaces when it is used in the process of production. Otherwise, the machinery would not be effective in raising surplus value and instead depreciate it. This is why some machinery is not chosen to replace actual human workers because it would not be cost effective.\n\n\nSection Three examines some of the effects of the industrial revolution on the individual worker. It is divided into three subsections, the first of which discusses how the use of industrial equipment enables capitalists to appropriate supplementary labor. Marx notes that, since machinery can reduce the reliance upon a worker's physical strength, it enables the employment of women and children to carry out work that could previously only be done by men. It thus depreciates an individual's labour-power by introducing many more potential workers into the exploitable pool of laborers.\n\nThe second subsection describes how mechanisation, by increasing labor productivity, can effectively shorten the working-time needed to produce an individual commodity item. However, because of the need to recoup the capital outlay required to introduce a given machine, it must be productively operated for as long as possible every day.\n\nIn the third subsection, Marx discusses how mechanization influences the intensification of labor. Although the introduction of the Factory Acts limited the allowable length of the work day, it did nothing to halt the drive for more efficiency. Control over workers' tools is transferred to the machine, which prevents them from setting their own work pace and rhythm. As the machines are continuously adapted and streamlined, the effect is an ever-increasing intensification of the laborer's work activity.\n\nMarx begins this section with two descriptions of the factory as a whole.\n\n\"Combined co-operation of many orders of workpeople, adult and young, in tending with assiduous skill, a system of productive machines, continuously impelled by a central power\" (the prime mover); on the other hand, as \"a vast automaton, composed of various mechanical and intellectual organs, acting in uninterrupted concert for the production of a common object, all of them being subordinate to a self-regulated moving force.\"\n\nThis twofold description shows the characteristics of the relationship between the collective body of labor power and the machine. In the first description, the workers, or collective labor power, are viewed as separate entities from the machine. In the second description, the machine is the dominant force, with the collective labor acting as mere appendages of the self operating machine. Marx uses the latter description to display the characteristics of the modern factory system under capitalism.\n\nIn the factory, the tools of the worker disappear, and the worker's skill is passed on to the machine. The division of labor and specialization of skills re-appear in the factory, only now as a more exploitative form of capitalist production (work is still organized into co-operative groups.) Work in the factory usually consists of two groups, people who are employed on the machines and those who attend to the machines. The third group, outside of the factory, is a superior class of workers, trained in the maintenance and repair of the machines.\n\nFactory work begins at childhood to ensure that a person may adapt to the systematic movements of the automated machine, therefore increasing productivity for the capitalist. Marx describes this work as being extremely exhausting to the nervous system and void of intellectual activity. Factory work robs workers of basic working conditions like clean air, light, space, and protection. Marx ends this section by asking if Fourier was wrong when he called factories ‘mitigated jails'?\n\n\nThis section opens with a historical summary of workers' revolts against the imposition of mechanical instruments of production, such as ribbon weaving. Marx notes that, by the early nineteenth century, the introduction of power looms and other manufacturing equipment resulted in widespread destruction of machinery by the Luddite movement. These attacks in turn gave the government at the time a pretext for severe crackdowns. \"It took both time and experience before workers learned to distinguish between machinery and their employment by capital, and therefore to transfer their attacks from the material instruments of production to the form of society which utilizes those instruments.\"\n\nMarx describes the machine as the instrument of labor for the capitalists' material mode of existence. The machine competes with the worker, diminishing the use-value of the worker's labor-power. Marx also points out that with the advance in technology of machines led to the substitution of less skilled work for more skilled work which ultimately led to a change in wages. During the progression of machinery the numbers of skilled workers decreased, while child labor flourished, increasing profits for the capitalist.\n\nIn this section, Marx sets forth to illuminate the error within the compensation theory of the political economists. According to this theory, the displacement of workers by machinery will necessarily \"set free\" an equal stable, amount of variable capital previously used for the purchase of labor-power and remains available for the same purpose. However, Marx argues that the introduction of machinery is simply a shift of variable capital to constant capital. The capital \"set free\" cannot be used for compensation since the displacement of variable capital available becomes embodied in the machinery purchased.\n\nThe capital that may become available for the compensation will always be less than the total amount of capital previously used to purchase labor-power before the addition of machinery. Furthermore, the remainder of variable capital available is directed towards hiring workers with the expertise skills to operate new machinery. Therefore, the conversion of the greater part of the total capital is now used as constant capital, a reduction of variable capital necessarily follows. As a result of machinery, displaced workers are not so quickly compensated by employment in other industries but are forced into an expanding labor-market at a disadvantage and available for greater capitalist exploitation without the ability to procure the means of subsistence for survival.\n\nFurthermore, Marx argues that the introduction of machinery may increase employment in other industries, yet this expansion \"has nothing in common with the so-called theory of compensation.\" Greater productivity will necessarily generate an expansion of production into peripheral fields that provide raw materials. Conversely, machinery introduced to industries that produce raw materials will lead to an increase in those industries that consume them. The production of greater surplus-value leads to greater wealth of the ruling classes, an increase in the labor-market, and consequently the establishment of new industries. As such Marx cites the growth of the domestic service industry equated to greater servitude by the exploited classes.\n\nThe political economist apology for the displacement of workers by machinery asserts that there is a corresponding increase in employment. Marx is quick to cite the example of the silk industry in which an actual decrease of employment appears simultaneously with an increase of existing machinery. On the other hand, an increase in the number of factory workers employed is the result of \"the gradual annexation of neighboring branches of industry\" and \"the building of more factories or the extension of old factories in a given industry.\"\n\nFurthermore, Marx argues that an increase in factory workers is relative since the displacement of workers creates a proportionately wider gap between the increase of machinery and a proportionate decrease of labor required to operate that machinery. The constant expansion of capitalism and ensuing technical advances leads to extension of markets until it reaches all corners of the globe thus creating cycles of economic prosperity and crisis. Finally, the \"repulsion and attraction\" of workers therefore results as a cycle in which there is a constant displacement of workers by machinery which necessarily leads to increased productivity followed by a relative expansion of industry and higher employment of labor. This sequence renews itself as all components of the cycle lead to novel technological innovation for \"replacing labor-power.\"\n\nChapters 16-18 examine how the capitalist strategies for the production of both absolute and relative surplus-value are combined and can function simultaneously.\n\nMarx describes the process of taking the worker's individual productive actions and making them a collective effort of many workers. This action takes the worker further away from the actual production of the commodity and then allows the capitalist to use the worker only to create surplus value. The surplus value is increased first through absolute methods, such as extending the work day, then through relative methods, such as increasing worker productivity. These actions are the general foundations of capitalism as described by Marx.\n\nThe worker's transformation from producer of commodities for use in survival to producer of surplus value is necessary in the progression to capitalism. In production outside the capitalist system the worker produces everything they need to survive. When the worker moves beyond producing what they need to survive, they can provide their work for a wage and create part of some product in return for a wage to buy what they need to survive. Capitalism takes advantage of this extra time by paying the worker a wage that allows them to survive but is less than the value the same worker creates. Through large scale manufacturing and economies of scale the workers are placed progressively further away from manufacturing products themselves and only function as part of a whole collective that creates the commodities. This changes the concept of productive labor from the production of commodities to the production of surplus value. The worker is only productive to the capitalist if they can maximize the surplus value the capitalist is earning.\n\nNot simply content with the transformation of the worker from a creator of commodities to creator of surplus value, capitalist must devise new ways to increase the surplus that he is receiving. The first, or absolute, way the capitalist can increase surplus value is through the prolongation of the working day so the worker has more time to create value. The second, or relative, way the capitalist can increase surplus value is to revolutionize changes in the production method. If the worker can only produce the means for himself in the time he works during the day there would be no extra time for him to create surplus value for the capitalist. The capitalist must then either enable the worker to complete the paid work time more quickly through relative means, or he must increase the work day in absolute terms. Without enabling unpaid work to exist the capitalist system would not be able to sustain itself.\n\nWith surplus labor resting on a natural basis, there are no natural obstacles preventing one man from imposing his labor burden on another. As a worker looks into the possible options of getting out of capitalist exploitation or the initial \"animal condition\", one of the obvious options is becoming a capitalist himself. This is called socialized labor which exists when the surplus labor of one worker becomes necessary for the existence of another.\n\nMarx mentions two natural conditions of wealth that are helpful in understanding the progression of socialized labor over time. The two conditions are natural wealth in the means of subsistence and natural wealth in the instruments of labor. Over time, society has moved more from the former to the latter. It was not that long ago that the majority of society produced for themselves and did not have to be concerned about producing surplus labor for others. We did labor for others, but it was not in effort to create surplus value, it was to help others.\n\nMarx uses the Egyptians as an example to illustrate a society's potential when there is extra time that does not have to be used toward creating surplus value. The Egyptians lived in a very fertile land (natural subsistence wealth) so could raise children at a very low cost. This is the main reason why the population grew so large. One might think all the great Egyptian structures were possible because of the large population, but is due to the availability of labor time.\n\nIn regards to capitalism, you might think that a greater natural wealth of subsistence would result in greater growth and capitalist production (like the Egyptians), but that is not the case. So why is capitalism so strong in many countries that do not have excess natural resources? The answer is the necessity of bringing a natural force under the control of society (irrigation in Persia and India, flow of water in Egypt, etc.) As Marx says, \"favourable conditions provide the possibility, not the reality of surplus labour.\"\n\nMarx displays an example of surplus labor occurring in these favorable conditions in the case of the East Indies. The inhabitants would be able to produce enough to satisfy all of his needs with only twelve working hours per week. This provides for more than enough leisure time until capitalist production takes hold. Then he may be required to work six days per week to satisfy his needs—there can be no explanation of why it is necessary for him to provide the extra five days of surplus labor.\n\nMarx then critiques famed economist David Ricardo and the lack of addressing the issue of surplus-value. Ricardo does not take the time to discuss the origin of surplus-value and sidestepped the entire issue altogether. Agreeing with classical economists, John Stuart Mill finds that the productive power, surplus value, is the source of profits, but adds that the necessities of life take less time to produce than is required by society. Therefore, this becomes the reason capital will realize a profit. Mill goes on to assert that profit can only be gleaned from productive power and not exchange which falls in line with Marx's theories.\n\nThe next critique of Mill goes on to the percentage that is gained from the laborer. Marx finds it to be \"absolutely false\" in the fact that the percentage of surplus labor will always be more than the profits. This is due to the amount of capital invested. Following his conclusions, Marx calls Mill's ideas an optical illusion as he looks into the advancing of capital. Mill looks at laborers and considers them to be a form of capitalist—they are advancing the capitalist their labor ahead of time and receiving it at the end of the project for more of a share. Marx hits the idea out with the analogy of the American peasant being his own slave as he is doing forced labor for himself.\n\nKarl Marx examined surplus value and showed it to be a necessity in capitalism. This surplus value is derived from the difference between the value the worker creates and the wage he earns. Chapter 16 looked into the ways in which the capitalist is able to increase surplus-value and takes a direct attack against economists David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill.\n\nThe Value of Labor power, also known as wage, is the first thing that Marx begins to re-explain in the opening of the chapter, stressing that it is equal to the quantity of the \"necessaries of life habitually required by the average laborer.\" By re-stressing the importance of this concept he is building a foundation on which he can begin to elaborate his argument on the changing price of labor. In order to make his argument, Marx states that he will leave out two certain factors of change (the expenses of labor power that differ with each mode of production and the diversity of labor power between men and women, children and adults) and that he will also be making two assumptions. The two assumptions made are first, the commodities are sold at their values, and second, the price of labor-power occasionally rises above its value, but never falls beneath it.\n\nGiven these assumptions Marx begins to formulate his argument by first establishing the three determinants of the price of labor power. These three determinants, or circumstances as Marx calls them, are: the length of the working day, the normal intensity of labor, and the productiveness of labor. Formulating these three circumstances into different combinations of variables and constants Marx begins to clarify the changes in magnitude in the price of labor-power. The majority of Chapter XVII is dedicated to the chief combinations of these three factors.\n\n\nStarting out with these assumptions Marx explains that there are three laws that determine the value of labor-power. The first of these three laws states that a working day of given number of hours will always produce the same amount of value. This value will always be a constant, no matter the productiveness of labor, or the price of the commodity produced. The second states that the surplus-value and labor-power are negatively correlated or that when surplus-value increases a unit and value stays the same labor-power must decrease one unit also. The third of these laws is that a change in surplus-value presupposes a change in that of the labor-power.\n\nGiven these three laws Marx explains how the productiveness of labor, being the variable, changes the magnitude of labor-value. Marx explains saying \"a change in the magnitude of surplus-value, presupposes a movement in the value of labour-power, which movement is brought about by a variation in the productiveness of labour.\" This variation in the productiveness of labor is what eventually leads to the developing change in value, which is then divided by either the laborers, through extra labor-value, or the capitalist, through extra surplus value.\n\n\nThe Intensity of labor is the expenditure that the laborer puts into a commodity. The increase in the intensity of labor results in the increase of value that the labor is producing. This increase that the laborer is producing is again divided amongst the capitalist and laborer in the form of either surplus-value or an increase in the value of labor power. Though they may both increase simultaneously the addition to the labor may not be an addition if the extra payment received from his increase in intensity does not cover the wear and tear it has on the laborer.\n\n\nIn this example it is possible to change the length of the working day by either lengthening of shortening the time spent at work. Leaving the other two variables constant, reducing the length of the work day leaves the labor-power's value the same as it was before. This reducing of the length of the work day will reduce the surplus labor and surplus value dropping it below its value.\n\nThe other option in changing the workday is to lengthen it. If the labor-power stays the same with a longer workday then the surplus-value will increase relatively and absolutely. The relative value of labor-power will fall even though it will not absolutely. With the lengthening of the workday and the nominal price staying the same, the price of labor-power possibly could fall below its value. The value is estimated to be what is produced by the worker and a longer workday will affect the production and therefore the value.\n\nIt is fine to assume the other variables stay constant, but a change in the work day with the others constant will not result in the outcomes supposed here. A change in the work day by the capitalists will most definitely affect the productivity and intensity of the labor.\n\n\nIn the real world it is almost never possible to isolate each of the aspects of labor. Two or even three of the variables may vary and in different aspects. One may move up while another moves down, or in the same direction. The combinations are endless, but may be characterized by the first three examples. However, Marx limits his analysis to two cases.\n\n\nThe price of labor-power is affected by many things that can be broken down. The three main elements of intensity, productivity and length of workday were broken down and analyzed separately and then together. From the examples presented it is possible to see what would happen in any and all situations.\n\nIn part six, Chapters from 19 to 22, Marx examines the ways in which capital manipulates the money wage as ways of both concealing exploitation and of extorting increased amounts of unpaid labor from workers.\n\nIn this Chapter, Marx discusses how the \"value of labor-power is represented in its converted form as wages.\" The form of wages is intended to disguise the division of the working day into \"necessary labor\" (labor that is for the value of labor-power) and \"surplus labor\" (labor that is totally toward the profit of the capitalist). In other words, paid and unpaid labor for the worker. The worker in this situation feels as though he is using his labor as means of producing surplus for his own consumption, when in reality his labor-power has already been purchased by the capitalist and he merely works as a means to produce surplus value for the capitalist.\n\nThere are two distinct forms of wages that is used in the production of capital: Time-wages and Piece-wages. These forms facilitate the illusion of the actual value of labor-power and the increase of productivity from the worker employed.\n\nMarx presents the unit for measurement of time-wages to be the value of the day's labour-power divided by the number of hours in the average working day. However, an extension in the period of labour produces a fall in the price of labour, culminating in the fall in the daily or weekly wage. Yet as Marx specifies this is to the advantage of the capitalist, as more hours of production leads to surplus value for the capitalist. \"If one man does the work of 1½ or 2 men, the supply of labor increases, although the supply of labor-power on the market remains constant. The competition thus created between the workers allows the capitalist to force down the price of labor, while the fall in price allows him, on the other hand, to force up the hours of work even further.\" To make the worker feel his extra time and labour is well spent, the capitalist employs the trick of \"overtime\".\n\nMarx explains the exploitative nature of the piece-wage system. Under this system workers are paid a pre-determined amount for each piece they produce, creating a modified form of the time-wage system. A key difference is in the fact that the piece-wage system provides an exact measure of the intensity of labor. Meaning that the capitalists' know about how long it takes to produce one piece of finished product. Those who cannot meet these standards of production will not be allowed to keep their jobs. This system also allows for middlemen (wholesaler or reseller) to usurp positions between the capitalists and laborers. These middlemen make their money solely from paying labor less than capitalists are actually allotting, thus, bringing about worker on worker exploitation.\n\nLogic would lead a laborer to believe that straining one's labor power \"as intensely as possible\" works in one's own interests because the more efficiently they produce the more they will be paid. Therefore, the workday will lengthen to the extent that worker's allow and necessitate. However, prolongation in the workday requires the price of labor to fall. Marx elucidates that, \"the piece-wage therefore has a tendency, while raising the wages of individuals above the average, to lower this average itself,\" and \"it is apparent that the piece-wage is the form of wage most appropriate to the capitalist mode of production.\" Marx gives examples of the weaving industry around the time of the Anti-Jacobin War where \"piece-wages had fallen so low that in spite of the very great lengthening of the working day, the daily wage was then lower than it had been before.\" So in this example we are able to see how piece-wages do nothing but decrease the value of labor and better disguise the true way the workers are exploited.\n\nIn Part Seven, Chapters from 23 to 25, Marx explores the ways in which profits are used to recreate capitalist class relations on an ever expanding scale and the ways in which this expansion of capitalism creates periodic crises for capitalist accumulation. For Marx, these crises in accumulation are also always crises in the perpetuation of the class relations necessary for capitalist production and so are also opportunities for revolutionary change.\n\n\"The economic character of capitalist becomes firmly fixed to a man only if his money constantly functions as capital.\" - 711\n\"surplus-value acquires the form of a revenue arising out of capital. If this revenue serves the capitalist only as a fund to provide for his consumption, and if it is consumed as periodically as it is gained, then, other things being equal, simple reproduction takes place.\" - 712\n\n\"When a person consumes the whole of his property, by taking upon himself debts equal to the value of that property, it is clear that his property represents nothing but the sum total of his debts. And so it is with the capitalist; when he has consumed the equivalent of his original capital, the value of his present capital represents nothing but the total amount of surplus-value appropriated by him without payment. Not a single atom of the value of his old capital continues to exist.\" - 715\n\n\"The fact that the worker performs acts of individual consumption in his own interest, and not to please the capitalist, is something entirely irrelevant to the matter. The consumption of food by a beast of burden does not become any less a necessary aspect of the production process because the beast enjoys what it eats.\" - 718\n\n\"The reproduction of the working class implies at the same time the transmission and accumulation of skills from one generation to another.\" - 719\n\n\"In reality, the worker belongs to capital before he has sold himself to the capitalist. His economic bondage is at once mediated through and concealed by, the periodic renewal of the act by which he sells himself, his change of masters, and the oscillations in the market-price of his labour.\" - 723-4\n\n- Capitalist production on a progressively increasing scale. The inversion which converts the property laws of commodity production into laws of capitalist appropriation\n\n\"surplus-value can be transformed into capital only because the surplus product, whose value it is, already comprises the material components of a new quantity of capital.\" - 727\n\n\"All capital needs to do is to incorporate this additional labour-power, annually supplied by the working class in the shape of labour-powers of all ages, with the additional means of production comprised in the annual product\" - 727\n\n\"the working class creates by the surplus labour of one year the capital destined to employ additional labour in the following year. And this is what is called creating capital out of capital.\" - 729\n\n\"The constant sale and purchase of labour-power is the form;the content is the constant appropriation by the capitalist, without equivalent, of a portion of the labour of others which has already been objectified, and his repeated exchange of this labour for a greater quantity of the living labour of others.\" - 730\n\n- The political economists' erroneous conception of reproduction on an increasing scale\n\n\"The classical economists are therefore quite right to maintain that the consumption of surplus product by productive, instead of unproductive, workers is a characteristic feature of the process of accumulation.\" - 736\n\n\"The movements of the individual capitals and personal revenues cross and intermingle, and become lost in a general alternation of positions, i.e. in the circulation of society's wealth.\" - 737\n\n- Division of surplus-value into capital and revenue. The abstinence theory\n\n\"One part of the surplus-value is consumed by the capitalist as revenue, the other part is employed as capital, i.e. it is accumulated...the ratio of these parts determines the magnitude of accumulation.\" - 738\n\n\"the development of capitalist production makes it necessary constantly to increase the amount of capital laid out in a given industrial undertaking, and competition subordinates every individual capitalist to the immanent laws of capitalist production as external and coercive laws. It compels him to keep extending his capital, so as to preserve it, and he can only extend it by means of progressive accumulation.\" - 739\n\n\"Accumulation is the conquest of the world of social wealth.\" - 739\n\n\"Accumulation for the sake of accumulation, production for the same of production: this was the formula in which classical economics expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie in the period of its domination.\" - 742\n\n- The circumstances which, independently of the proportional division of surplus-value into capital and revenue, determine the extent of accumulation:\n\n\nThe accumulation of capital, though originally appearing as its quantitative extension only, is effected, as we have seen, under a progressive qualitative change in its composition, under a constant increase of its constant, at the expense of its variable constituent.\n\nCapitalist production can by no means content itself with the quantity of disposable labour-power which the natural increase of population yields. It requires for its free play an industrial reserve army independent of these natural limits.\n\nUp to this point it has been assumed that the increase or diminution of the variable capital corresponds rigidly with the increase or diminution of the number of labourers employed.\n\nThe number of labourers commanded by capital may remain the same, or even fall, while the variable capital increases. This is the case if the individual labourer yields more labour, and therefore his wages increase and this although the price of labour remains the same or even falls, only more slowly than the mass of labour rises. Increase of variable capital, in this case, becomes an index of more labour, but not of more labourers employed. It is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers, if the cost is about the same. In the latter case, the outlay of constant capital increases in proportion to the mass of labour set in action; in the former that increase is much smaller. The more extended the scale of production, the stronger this motive. Its force increases with the accumulation of capital.\n\nWe have seen that the development of the capitalist mode of production and of the productive power of labour—at once the cause and effect of accumulation—enables the capitalist, with the same outlay of variable capital, to set in action more labour by greater exploitation (extensive or intensive) of each individual labour-power. We have further seen that the capitalist buys with the same capital a greater mass of labour-power, as he progressively replaces skilled labourers by less skilled, mature labour-power by immature, male by female, that of adults by that of young persons or children.\n\nOn the one hand, therefore, with the progress of accumulation, a larger variable capital sets more labour in action without enlisting more labourers; on the other, a variable capital of the same magnitude sets in action more labour with the same mass of labour-power; and, finally, a greater number of inferior labour-power by displacement of higher.\n\nThe production of a relative surplus-population, or the setting free of labourers, goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the technical revolution of the process of production that accompanies, and is accelerated by, the advances of accumulation; and more rapidly than the corresponding diminution of the variable part of capital as compared with the constant. If the means of production, as they increase in extent and effective power, become to a less extent means of employment of labourers, this state of things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness of labour increases, capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for labourers. The over-work of the employed part of the working class swells the ranks of the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit to over-work and to subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation of one part of the working-class to enforced idleness by the over-work of the other part, and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the individual capitalists,17 and accelerates at the same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale corresponding with the advance of social accumulation. How important is this element in the formation of the relative surplus-population, is shown by the example of England. Her technical means for saving labour are colossal. Nevertheless, if to-morrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational amount, and proportioned to the different sections of the working-class according to age and sex, the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient for the carrying on of national production on its present scale. The great majority of the labourers now \"unproductive\" would have to be turned into \"productive\" ones.\n\nThis is the place to return to one of the grand exploits of economic apologetics. It will be remembered that if through the introduction of new, or the extension of old, machinery, a portion of variable capital is transformed into constant, the economic apologist interprets this operation which “fixes” capital and by that very act sets labourers “free,” in exactly the opposite way, pretending that it sets free capital for the labourers. Only now can one fully understand the effrontery of these apologists. What are set free are not only the labourers immediately turned out by the machines, but also their future substitutes in the rising generation, and the additional contingent, that with the usual extension of trade on the old basis would be regularly absorbed. They are now all “set free,” and every new bit of capital looking out for employment can dispose of them. Whether it attracts them or others, the effect on the general labour demand will be nil, if this capital is just sufficient to take out of the market as many labourers as the machines threw upon it. If it employs a smaller number, that of the supernumeraries increases; if it employs a greater, the general demand for labour only increases to the extent of the excess of the employed over those “set free.” The impulse that additional capital, seeking an outlet, would otherwise have given to the general demand for labour, is therefore in every case neutralised to the extent of the labourers thrown out of employment by the machine. That is to say, the mechanism of capitalistic production so manages matters that the absolute increase of capital is accompanied by no corresponding rise in the general demand for labour. And this the apologist calls a compensation for the misery, the sufferings, the possible death of the displaced labourers during the transition period that banishes them into the industrial reserve army out of antagonism of capital accumulation. The demand for labour is not identical with increase of capital, nor supply of labour with increase of the working class. It is not a case of two independent forces working on one another. Les dés sont pipés.\n\nCapital works on both sides at the same time. If its accumulation, on the one hand, increases the demand for labour, it increases on the other the supply of labourers by the “setting free” of them, whilst at the same time the pressure of the unemployed compels those that are employed to furnish more labour, and therefore makes the supply of labour, to a certain extent, independent of the supply of labourers. The action of the law of supply and demand of labour on this basis completes the despotism of capital. As soon, therefore, as the labourers learn the secret, how it comes to pass that in the same measure as they work more, as they produce more wealth for others, and as the productive power of their labour increases, so in the same measure even their function as a means of the self-expansion of capital becomes more and more precarious for them; as soon as they discover that the degree of intensity of the competition among themselves depends wholly on the pressure of the relative surplus population; as soon as, by Trades’ Unions, &c., they try to organise a regular co-operation between employed and unemployed in order to destroy or to weaken the ruinous effects of this natural law of capitalistic production on their class, so soon capital and its sycophant, Political Economy, cry out at the infringement of the “eternal” and so to say “sacred” law of supply and demand. Every combination of employed and unemployed disturbs the “harmonious” action of this law. But, on the other hand, as soon as (in the colonies, e.g.) adverse circumstances prevent the creation of an industrial reserve army and, with it, the absolute dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class, capital, along with its commonplace Sancho Panza, rebels against the “sacred” law of supply and demand, and tries to check its inconvenient action by forcible means and State interference.\n\nIn order to understand the desire for and techniques utilized by the bourgeoisie to accumulate capital before the rise of capitalism itself, one must look to the notion of primitive accumulation as the main impetus for this drastic change in history. Primitive accumulation refers to the essential lucrative method employed by the capitalist class that brought about the transition in to the capitalist mode of production following the end of the feudal system. Karl Marx states that the means of production and a bare level of subsistence must be stripped from the common producer to allow for this to take place. The means of production refers to the tools or processes used to create a product or provide a service.\n\nThe central process for and secret behind primitive accumulation involved the expropriation of agricultural lands and any form of wealth from the population of commoners by the capitalists, which typically was characterized by brutal and violent struggles between the two opposing classes. Since the peasantry was not subjected to the laws of feudalism any longer, they were ultimately freed from their lords and the land to assimilate into this new mode of production as a wage laborer. Every freed proletariat as a result had only their labor power to sell to the bourgeoisie to meet their needs to simply survive.\n\nMarx refers to the Inclosure Act 1489, the Inclosure Act 1533, and the Poor Relief Act 1601.\n\nUnfortunately, the integration process into this new mode of production came at a cost to the proletariat since the strenuous demands of finding alternative work proved to be too much of a burden for most. As a result, the working class often initially resorted to thievery and begging to meet their needs under this new form of human existence. To make matters worse, harsh legislation seen in England and France as Marx points out declared these individuals to be vagabonds and rogues subject to the laws of the state. Furthermore, the working class also suffered due to legislative measures taken in England to keep working wages astonishingly low while the cost of living rose.\n\nMarx refers, in particular, to the Vagabonds Act of 1530, the Act for Punishment of Sturdy Vagabonds and Beggars 1536, the Vagabonds Act 1547, the Vagabonds Act 1572, the Poor Act 1575, the Vagabonds Act 1597, and the Vagabonds Act 1603. which was only repealed by the Vagrants Act 1713.\n\nMarx also recounts wage fixing legislation, including the Statute of Labourers 1351, the Statute of Apprentices (which was extended to weavers by James I), the Journeymen Tailors, London Act 1720, the Silk Manufacturers Act 1772, and the Colliers (Scotland) Act 1799.\n\nThe origin of the capitalists in England spawned out of the \"great landed proprietors\" who reaped the benefits of the surplus value made from the expropriated land they had acquired at practically no cost. The progressive fall of the value of precious metals and money brought more profit to the capitalist farmers as the wage laborers beneath them were forced to accept lower wages. It comes as no surprise that the class of capitalist farmers in England became enormously wealthy given the circumstances of the time.\n\nThe British Agricultural Revolution (17th–19th centuries) not only caused many changes in the way people worked but in social structure as well. When industrialization provided the cheapest and most efficient tools for agricultural production, it caused a reduced need for the peasant farm workers, which displaced most of the working class from the countryside. Faced with the choice of selling their labor for a wage or becoming a capitalist, there emerged a class of entrepreneurs who through the exploitation of wage laborers became the capitalist class. As the system grew, there became a need for cheaper and more readily available materials. Thus colonization was born. By expanding into new territories and enslaving indigenous cultures, primitive accumulation became a source of quick and easy capital. Famine even became a tool for capitalists in 1769–1770 when England raised the price of rice in India so that only the rich could afford it. National debt soon became a tool of control for capitalists who turned unproductive money into capital through lending and exchange. Encouraged to participate in the creation of debt, each worker participates in the creation of \"joint-stock companies, the stock-exchange, and modern bankocracy.\" The international credit system conceals the source of its generation; the exploitation of slave and wage laborers.\n\nThe shift in the ownership of the means of production from the proletariat to the bourgeoisie left the common producer with only his labor power to sell. This means they are free proprietors of the conditions of their labor. During this process of transference, private property was replaced by capitalist private property through the highest form of exploitation, and the shift from the days of free labor to wage labor had taken place. Capitalist private property was formed from the capital mode of appropriation, which dwindled away the once existent private property founded on the personal labor of workers.\n\nMarx states that as capitalism grows the number of wage laborers grows exponentially. Therefore, ultimately there will be a revolution in which the capitalists are expropriated from their means of wealth by the majority. In other words, the seeds of destruction are already implanted within capitalism. Marx stresses that the demise of capitalism does not necessarily mean the return of feudalism and private property, but rather \"it does indeed establish individual property on the basis of the achievements of the capitalist era: namely co-operation and the possession in common of the land and the means of production produced by labor itself\". That is to say that the transformation will revert to the time where private property is seen as social property.\n\nMarx claims that two types of private property exist in a political economy. The first form is the labor of the producer himself and the other form rests in a capitalist's exploitation of others. In the industrialized capitalist world of Western Europe, this is easily attained through the usage of laws and private property. However, capitalists constantly find obstacles in the colonies where workers work for their own enrichment rather than that of the capitalist. Capitalists overcome this obstacle by the use of force and by the political backing of the \"mother land\". If domination over the workers free will cannot be achieved, Marx then asks, \"how did capital and wage-labour come into existence?\" This comes about through the division of workers into owners of capital and owners of labor. This system causes workers to essentially expropriate themselves in order to accumulate capital. This self-expropriation served as primitive accumulation for the capitalists, and therefore, was the catalyst for capitalism in the colonies.\n\n\n"}

They are associated with the \"devadasis\", girls who were dedicated to a Hindu temple god and were often treated as temple prostitutes. Women who die an unnatural death, such as in childbirth or by suicide, and prostitutes may become chedipes. Chedipes are sometimes characterized as being undead.\n\nThe chedipe is described as a vulgar woman riding on a tiger in the moonlit night. The typical chedipe story carries out with them choosing a house and magically forcing the closed doors of the house open, to which she enters naked. She casts a spell on the residents of the home, putting them in a deep sleep. She then sucks the blood of all of the men in the house through their toes. Some traditions say that she feasts only on the strongest man of the house. Others suggest that the chedipe targets only the man whom she dislikes. In the morning, the victim of the chedipe will awaken from their sleep with no memory of the chedipe's visit. He will be sapped of his virility and will feel uneasy and slightly intoxicated for the entirety of the following day. If he does not receive medical treatment, the chedipe will return. In another narrative, she is described as returning repeatedly before the victim can recover from the blood and energy loss, thus weakening him further. If he is not treated, the man withers away and dies.\n\nThe chedipe also has sexual intercourse with the sleeping victim in many cases, resulting in suspicions of infidelity in the mind of the victim's wife. This shatters the marital concord of the household, ending love and trust in the family. The chedipe feasts on the resulting sadness and pain. She may also pluck out the tongue of her victim, instantaneously killing him. The chedipe may also inflict wounds on the skin and insert sticks in the body of the man, which will burn like fire.\n\nSometimes, the chedipe undresses and turns into a tiger with one human leg and attacks men in the forest. This form is known as \"Murulupuli\" (\"enchanting tiger\"). If the man retaliates with a weapon, she flees. If someone recognizes her in the tiger form, she assumes her real form and pretends to be digging for roots in the jungle.\n"}
{"id": "34475196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34475196", "title": "Colorsport", "text": "Colorsport\n\nColorsport Images Ltd is a sports photographic archive and agency, containing around 10 million images covering almost 150 years of sport, serving all forms of media outlets. The Colorsport partnership was set up in the late 1960s by photographers Colin Elsey and Stewart Fraser, and they were soon joined by Andrew Cowie.\n\nThe agency – as its name suggests - was among the earliest to cover sport in colour as well as black and white, especially football, rugby union and the Olympics.\n\nThe business was established in the late 1960s when two sports photographers, Colin Elsey and Stewart Fraser, started to work together. They were initially based in Kings Cross before the business became established at St Peter’s Street in Islington for many years as it continued to expand. During that time Colorsport was the official photographer for the Rugby Football Union and Arsenal Football Club, as well as many sporting publications.\n\nIn 2003 the business, which had moved to Crouch End, lost Colin Elsey who died suddenly. At around the same time Stewart Fraser retired.\n\nColorsport gained new owners in late 2005, notably Nigel Wray, the owner of Saracens rugby club, and David Norrie, a former editor of Rugby World magazine and cricket and rugby correspondent of the News of the World, who became chairman. The business was moved to extensive new head offices in Surrey.\n\nAndrew Cowie, who joined the business in 1972, is still active as a sports photographer and also now heads up Colorsport's library operations.\n\nJames Pinniger joined as Chief Executive at the start of 2009 from Reuters. Since that time Colorsport has revamped their online presence and developed a network of international partners. Colorsport photographers were nominated in two categories at the 2012 SJA British Sport Photography Awards, while Cowie's shot of Tony Woodcock's try for the All Blacks in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final was voted the Sports Picture of the Year at the 2012 NAPA Awards.\n\nColorsport Images has acquired a number of older photo archives, principally the Albert Wilkes Collection, The Provincial Press Archive, and the Barrett Collection.\n\nColorsport has digitised these collections, enabling online distribution. They now operate a large commercial website which allows clients to search and browse for images, purchase usage rights and download images, in addition to a separate website that enables selected images from the archive to be ordered as consumer prints.\n\nThe Wilkes Collection, which contains many thousands of glass plates (mainly football and cricket), had been set up in the 1890s by Albert Wilkes, who played football for Aston Villa and England. Wilkes, and later his son, ran the business from West Bromwich for over sixty years.\n\nProvincial Press had been based in Southport from the 1940s through to the 1970s, covering many FA Cup Finals, including the 1953 Matthews Final, as well as having contracts with Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle United and Arsenal football clubs among others.\n\nColin Elsey’s reputation as one of rugby union's leading photographer was established with his work on the all-conquering 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa and confirmed on the next Lions tour to New Zealand three years later when he took the iconic “Mudman” image of Fran Cotton peering out of the Wellington mud, considered by many to be among the greatest rugby photos ever taken.\n\nStewart Fraser, a winner of the 1967 World Press Photo sports award, became a specialist in covering winter and summer Olympic sports.\n\nAndrew Cowie took up the mantle as Colorsport's soccer specialist - in 2010 in South Africa he covered his eighth World Cup for the company.\n\nSeveral other distinguished photographers learnt their trade and came through the Colorsport ranks, such as Stuart McFarlane and Matthew Impey.\n\nCurrent Colorsport photographers include Dan Rowley, Ian MacNicol, and Shaun Boggust.\n\n"}

POSIX 1003.1-2001 describes the functions codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3.\n\nAnother 3rd party library, uthash, also creates associative arrays from C structures. A structure represents a value, and one of the structure fields acts as the key.\n\nFinally, the GLib library also supports associative arrays, along with many other advanced data types and is the recommended implementation of the GNU Project.\n\nSimilar to GLib, Apple's cross-platform Core Foundation framework provides several basic data types. In particular, there are reference counted CFDictionary and CFMutableDictionary.\n\nThe dictionary can also be initialized with all entries during construction. This is called \"object initialization\".\nA foreach loop can enumerate through the entire collection. There is no guarantee of order. If order matters the programmer could choose to use a SortedDictionary or use a .Sort linq extension method.\nC++ also has a form of associative array called codice_4 (see Standard Template Library#Containers). One could create a map with the same information as above using C++ with the following code:\n\nOr less efficiently as it creates temporary codice_5 values:\nWith the extension of initialization lists in C++11, entries can be added during a map's construction as shown below:\n\nYou can iterate through the list with the following code (C++03):\n\nThe same task in new C++11:\n\nUsing the structured binding available in C++17:\n\nIn C++, the codice_4 class is templated which allows the data types of keys and values to be different for different codice_7 instances. For a given instance of the codice_7 class the keys must be of the same base type. The same must be true for all of the values. Although codice_4 is typically implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree, C++11 defines a second map called codice_10 with the algorithmic characteristics of a hash table. This is a common vendor extension to the STL as well, usually called codice_11, being available from such implementations as SGI and STLPort.\n\nA structure in CFML is equivalent to an associative array:\n\nInitializing an empty dictionary and adding items:\n\nAlternatively, a dictionary can be initialized with all items during construction:\n\nThe dictionary can be enumerated by a for-loop, but there is no guaranteed order:\n\nD offers direct support for associative arrays\nin the core language – they are implemented as a chaining hash table with binary trees. The equivalent example would be:\n\nKeys and values can be any types, but all the keys in an associative array\nmust be of the same type, and the same for values.\n\nYou can also loop through all properties and associated values, i.e. as follows:\n\nA property can be removed as follows:\n\nDelphi supports several standard generic containers, including TDictionary<T>:\nVersions of Delphi prior to 2009 do not offer direct support for associative arrays. However, you can simulate associative arrays using the TStrings class. Here's an example:\n\nErlang offers many approaches to represent mappings, two of the most common in the standard library are keylists and dictionaries.\n\nKeylists are lists of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is a key, and the second is a value. Functions for operating on keylists are provided in the codice_12 module.\n\nAccessing an element of the keylist can be done with the codice_13 function:\n\nDictionaries are implemented in the codice_14 of the standard library. A new dictionary is created using the codice_15 function and new key/value pairs are stored using the codice_16 function:\n\nSuch a serial initialization would be more idiomatically represented in Erlang with the appropriate function:\n\nThe dictionary can be accessed using the codice_17 function:\n\nIn both cases, any Erlang term can be used as the key. Variations include the codice_18 module, implementing ordered dictionaries, and codice_19, implementing general balanced trees.\n\nF# constructs maps from lists, sequences or arrays of tuples, using functions provided by the Map module. F# represents a tuple as two or more elements separated by a comma, and a list as a sequence of elements enclosed in square brackets, separated by semi-colons.\n\nValues can be looked up via one of the codice_20 functions, such as codice_21. This returns an option type with a value of codice_22, for a successful lookup, or codice_23, for an unsuccessful one. Pattern matching can then be used to extract the raw value, or a default, from the result.\n\nIn this example, the codice_24 value will now contain the string codice_25.\n\nBecause F# is a .NET language, it also has access to all of the features of the .NET Framework, including the codice_26 objects and codice_27 objects that are used for the same purpose in both C# and Visual Basic. These objects may be preferred when writing code that is intended by be linked to from other languages on the .NET framework.\n\nVisual FoxPro implements mapping with the Collection Class.\n\nGetKey returns 0 if the key is not found.\n\nSee Collection in FoxPro Help for all the details.\n\nGo has built-in, language-level support for associative arrays, called \"maps\". A map's key type may only be a boolean, numeric, string, array, struct, pointer, interface, or channel type. A map type is written like this: map[keytype]valuetype.\n\nAdding elements one at a time:\nA map literal:\nIterating over a map:\nThe Haskell programming language's report only provides one kind of associative container: a list of pairs:\noutput:\n\nNote that the lookup function returns a \"Maybe\" value, which is \"Nothing\" if not found, or \"Just \"result\"\" when found.\n\nGHC, the most commonly used implementation of Haskell, provides two more types of associative containers. Other implementations might also provide these.\n\nOne is polymorphic functional maps (represented as immutable balanced binary trees):\noutput:\n\nA specialized version for integer keys also exists as Data.IntMap.\n\nFinally, a polymorphic hash table:\noutput:\n\nLists of pairs and functional maps both provide a purely functional interface, which is more idiomatic in Haskell. In contrast, hash tables provide an imperative interface in the IO monad.\n\nIn Java associative arrays are implemented as \"maps\"; they are part of the Java collections framework. Since J2SE 5.0 and the introduction of generics into Java, collections can have a type specified; for example, an associative array mapping strings to strings might be specified as follows:\n\nThe method is used to access a key; for example, the value of the expression codice_28 is codice_25.\n\nThis code above uses a hash map to store the associative array, by calling the constructor of the class; however, since the code only uses methods common to the interface , one could also use a self-balancing binary tree by calling the constructor of the class (which implements the subinterface ), without changing the definition of the codice_30 variable or the rest of the code, or use a number of other underlying data structures that implement the codice_31 interface.\n\nThe hash function in Java, used by HashMap and HashSet, is provided by the method . Since every class in Java inherits from , every object has a hash function. A class can override the default implementation of codice_32 to provide a custom hash function based on the properties of the object.\n\nThe codice_33 class also contains the method that tests the object for equality with another object. Hashed data structures in Java rely on objects maintaining the following contract between their codice_32 and codice_35 methods:\n\nFor two objects \"a\" and \"b\",\nIn order to maintain this contract, a class that overrides codice_35 must also override codice_32, and maybe vice versa, so that codice_32 is based on the same properties (or a subset of the properties) as codice_35.\n\nA further contract that hashed data structures has with the object is that the results of the codice_32 and codice_35 methods will not change once the object has been inserted into the map. For this reason, it is generally a good practice to base the hash function on immutable properties of the object.\n\nAnalogously, TreeMap, and other sorted data structures, requires that an ordering be defined on the data type. Either the data type must already have defined its own ordering, by implementing the interface; or a custom must be provided at the time the map is constructed. As with HashMap above, the relative ordering of keys in a TreeMap should not change once they have been inserted into the map.\n\nJavaScript (and its standardized version: ECMAScript) is a prototype-based object-oriented language. In JavaScript an object is a mapping from property names to values—that is, an associative array with one caveat: since property names are strings, only string and (coerced) integer keys are allowed. Other than that difference, objects also include one feature unrelated to associative arrays: a prototype link to the object they inherit from. Doing a lookup for a property will forward the lookup to the prototype if the object does not define the property itself.\n\nAn object literal is written as codice_42. For example:\n\nIf the property name is a valid identifier, the quotes can be omitted, e.g.:\n\nLookup is written using property access notation, either square brackets, which always works, or dot notation, which only works for identifier keys:\n\nYou can also loop through all enumerable properties and associated values as follows:\n\nA property can be removed as follows:\n\nAs mentioned before, properties are strings. However, since every native object and primitive can be implicitly converted to a string, you can do:\n\nAny object, including built-in objects such as Array, can be dynamically extended with new properties. For example:\n\nIn modern JavaScript it's considered bad form to use the Array type as an associative array. Consensus is that the Object type is best for this purpose. The reasoning behind this is that if Array is extended via prototype and Object is kept pristine, 'for(in)' loops will work as expected on associative 'arrays'. This issue has been drawn into focus by the popularity of JavaScript frameworks that make heavy and sometimes indiscriminate use of prototype to extend JavaScript's inbuilt types.\n\nSee JavaScript Array And Object Prototype Awareness Day for more information on the issue.\n\nDeclare dictionary:\n\nAccess element:\n\nAdd element:\n\nDelete element:\n\nGet keys and values as iterables:\n\nDefinition:\n\nDereference:\nLisp was originally conceived as a \"LISt Processing\" language, and one of its most important data types is the linked list, which can be treated as an association list (\"alist\").\n\nThe syntax codice_43 is used to indicate a codice_44ed pair. Keys and values need not be the same type within an alist. Lisp and Scheme provide operators such as codice_45 to manipulate alists in ways similar to associative arrays.\n\nBecause of their linear nature, alists are used for relatively small sets of data. Common Lisp also supports a hash table data type, and for Scheme they are implemented in SRFI 69. Hash tables have greater overhead than alists, but provide much faster access when there are many elements.\n\nIt is easy to construct composite abstract data types in Lisp, using structures and/or the object-oriented programming features, in conjunction with lists, arrays, and hash tables.\n\nLPC implements associative arrays as a fundamental type known as either map or mapping, depending on the driver. The keys and values can be of any type. A mapping literal is written as codice_46. Procedural use looks like:\n\nMappings are accessed for reading using the indexing operator in the same way as they are for writing, as shown above. So phone_book[\"Sally Smart\"] would return the string \"555-9999\", and phone_book[\"John Smith\"] would return 0. Testing for presence is done using the function member(), e.g. codice_47\n\nDeletion is accomplished using a function called either m_delete() or map_delete(), depending on the driver, used like: codice_48\n\nLPC drivers of the \"Amylaar\" family implement multivalued mappings using a secondary, numeric index. (Drivers of the MudOS family do not support multivalued mappings.) Example syntax:\n\nLPC drivers modern enough to support a foreach() construct allow iteration over their mapping types using it.\n\nIn Lua, table is a fundamental type that can be used either as array (numerical index, fast) or as associative array.\nThe keys and values can be of any type, except nil. The following focuses on non-numerical indexes.\n\nA table literal is written as codice_49. For example:\n\nIf the key is a valid identifier (not a keyword), the quotes can be omitted. They are case sensitive.\n\nLookup is written using either square brackets, which always works, or dot notation, which only works for identifier keys:\n\nYou can also loop through all keys and associated values with iterators or for loops:\n\nAn entry can be removed by setting it to nil:\n\nLikewise, you can overwrite values or add them:\n\nMathematica uses the Association expression to represent associative arrays.\n\nTo access\n\nIf the keys are strings, the \"Key\" keyword is not necessary, so:\n\nTo list keys and values\n\nIn MUMPS every array is an associative array. The built-in, language-level, direct support for associative arrays\napplies to private, process-specific arrays stored in memory called \"locals\" as well as to the permanent, shared arrays stored on disk which are available concurrently by multiple jobs. The name for globals is preceded by the circumflex \"^\" to distinguish it from local variable names.\n\nTo access the value of an element, simply requires using the name with the subscript:\n\nYou can also loop through an associated array as follows:\n\nCocoa (API) and GNUstep handle associative arrays using codice_50 (a mutable version of codice_51) class cluster. This class allows assignments between any two objects to be made. A copy of the key object is made before it is inserted into codice_50, therefore the keys must conform to the codice_53 protocol. When being inserted to a dictionary, the value object receives a retain message to increase its reference count. The value object will receive the release message when it will be deleted from the dictionary (both explicitly or by adding to the dictionary a different object with the same key).\n\nTo access assigned objects this command may be used:\n\nAll keys or values can be simply enumerated using codice_54\n\nOn Mac OS X 10.5+ and iPhone OS, dictionary keys can also be enumerated more concisely using this NSFastEnumeration construct:\n\nWhat is even more practical, structured data graphs may be easily created using [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], especially codice_51 (codice_50). This can be illustrated with this compact example:\n\nAnd relevant fields can be quickly accessed using key paths:\n\nThe OCaml programming language provides three different associative containers. The simplest is a list of pairs:\n\nThe second is a polymorphic hash table:\n\nThe code above uses OCaml's default hash function codice_57, which is defined automatically for all types. If you wanted to use your own hash function, you can use the functor interface codice_58 to create a module, like with codice_31 below.\n\nFinally, functional maps (represented as immutable balanced binary trees):\n\nNote that in order to use codice_31, you have to provide the functor codice_61 with a module which defines the key type and the comparison function. The third-party library ExtLib provides a polymorphic version of functional maps, called PMap, where you provide the comparison function when creating the map.\n\nLists of pairs and functional maps both provide a purely functional interface. In contrast, hash tables provide an imperative interface. For many operations, hash tables are significantly faster than lists of pairs and functional maps.\n\nThe OptimJ programming language is an extension of Java 5. As java, Optimj provides maps. But, OptimJ also provides true associative arrays: java arrays are indexed with 0-based integers; associative arrays are indexed with any collection of keys.\n\nOf course, it is possible to define multi-dimensional arrays, to mix java array and associative arrays, to mix maps and associative arrays.\n\nPerl 5 has built-in, language-level support for associative arrays. Modern Perl vernacular refers to associative arrays as \"hashes\"; the term \"associative array\" is found in older documentation, but is considered somewhat archaic. Perl 5 hashes are flat: keys are strings and values are scalars. However, values may be [[reference (computer science)|references]] to arrays or other hashes, and the standard Perl 5 module Tie::RefHash enables hashes to be used with reference keys.\n\nA hash variable is marked by a codice_62 [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]], to distinguish it from scalar, array and other data types. A hash literal is a key-value list, with the preferred form using Perl's codice_63 token, which is mostly semantically identical to the comma and makes the key-value association clearer:\n\nAccessing a hash element uses the syntax codice_64 – the key is surrounded by \"curly braces\" and the hash name is prefixed by a codice_65, indicating that the hash element itself is a \"scalar\" value, even though it is part of a hash. The value of codice_66 is codice_67. The codice_62 sigil is only used when referring to the hash as a whole, such as when asking for codice_69.\n\nThe list of keys and values can be extracted using the built-in functions codice_70 and codice_71, respectively. So, for example, to print all the keys of a hash:\n\nOne can iterate through (key, value) pairs using the codice_72 function:\n\nA hash \"reference\", which is a scalar value that points to a hash, is specified in literal form using curly braces as delimiters, with syntax otherwise similar to specifying a hash literal:\n\nValues in a hash reference are accessed using the dereferencing operator:\n\nWhen the hash contained in the hash reference needs to be referred to as a whole, as with the codice_70 function, the syntax is as follows:\n\nPerl 6 also has built-in, language-level support for associative arrays, which are referred to as \"hashes\" or as objects performing the \"Associative\" role. By default, Perl 6 hashes are flat: keys are strings and values are scalars. One can define a \"hash\" to not coerce all keys to strings automatically: these are referred to as \"object hashes\", because the keys of such hashes remain the original object rather than a stringification thereof.\n\nA hash variable is typically marked by a codice_62 [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]], to visually distinguish it from scalar, array and other data types, and to define its behaviour towards iteration. A hash literal is a key-value list, with the preferred form using Perl's codice_63 token, which makes the key-value association clearer:\n\nAccessing a hash element uses the syntax codice_76 – the key is surrounded by \"curly braces\" and the hash name (note that the sigil does not change, contrary to [[Perl 5]]). The value of codice_77 is codice_67.\n\nThe list of keys and values can be extracted using the built-in functions codice_70 and codice_71, respectively. So, for example, to print all the keys of a hash:\n\nBy default, when iterating over a \"hash\", one gets key/value \"Pair\"s.\n\nIt's also possible to get alternating key and value values by using the \"kv\" method:\n\n[[Perl 6]] doesn't have any references. Hashes can be passed around as single parameters that do not get flattened. If you want to make sure that a subroutine only accepts hashes, use the \"%\" sigil in the \"Signature\".\n\nPHP's built-in array type is in reality an associative array. Even when using numerical indexes, PHP internally stores it as an associative array. This is why one in PHP can have non-consecutive numerically indexed arrays. The keys have to be integer or string (floating point numbers are truncated to integer), while values can be of arbitrary types, including other arrays and objects. The arrays are heterogeneous; a single array can have keys of different types. PHP's associative arrays can be used to represent trees, lists, stacks, queues and other common data structures not built into PHP.\n\nAn associative array can be declared using the following syntax:\n\nPHP can loop through an associative array as follows:\n\nPHP has an extensive set of functions to operate on arrays.\n\nIf you want an associative array that can use objects as keys instead of strings and integers, you can use the SplObjectStorage class from the Standard PHP Library (SPL).\n\nPike has built-in support for Associative Arrays, which are referred to as mappings. Mappings are created as follows:\n\nAccessing and testing for presence in mappings is done using the indexing operator. So codice_81 would return the string codice_25, and codice_83 would return 0.\n\nIterating through a mapping can be done using either foreach:\n\nOr using an iterator object:\n\nElements of a mapping can be removed using m_delete, which returns the value of the removed index:\n\nIn [[PostScript]], associative arrays are called dictionaries. In Level 1 PostScript they must be created explicitly, but Level 2 introduced direct declaration using the double-brace syntax:\nDictionaries can be accessed directly using get or implicitly by placing the dictionary on the dictionary stack using begin:\n\nDictionary contents can be iterated through using forall, though not in any particular order:\nMay well output:\nDictionaries can be augmented (up to their defined size only in Level 1) or altered using put, and entries can be removed using undef:\n\nSome versions of [[Prolog]] include \"dicts\".\n\nIn Python, associative arrays are called \"[[Python syntax and semantics#Collection types|dictionaries]]\". Dictionary literals are marked with curly braces:\n\nTo access an entry in Python simply use the array indexing operator. For example, \n\nAn example loop [[iterator#Python|iterating]] through all the keys of the dictionary:\n\nIterating through (key, value) tuples:\n\nDictionary keys can be individually deleted using the del statement. The corresponding value can be returned before the key-value pair are deleted using the pop method of dict types:\n\nPython 2.7 and 3.x also supports dictionary comprehensions, a compact syntax for generating a dictionary from any iterator:\nStrictly speaking, a dictionary is a super-set of an associative array since neither the keys or values are limited to a single datatype. One could think of a dictionary as an \"associative list\" using the nomenclature of Python. For example the following is also legitimate:\n\nThe dictionary keys must be of an [[Immutable object|immutable]] data type. In Python, strings are immutable due to their method of implementation.\n\nIn REXX, associative arrays are called \"Stem variables\" or \"Compound variables\".\n\nStem variables with numeric keys typically start at 1 and go up from there. The 0 key stem variable\nis used (by convention) as the count of items in the whole stem.\n\nREXX has no easy way of automatically accessing the keys for a stem variable and typically the\nkeys are stored in a separate associative array with numeric keys.\n\nIn Ruby a [[hash table|hash]] is used as follows:\n\nRuby supports hash looping and iteration with the following syntax:\n\nRuby also supports many other useful operations on hashes, such as merging hashes, selecting or rejecting elements that meet some criteria, inverting (swapping the keys and values), and flattening a hash into an array.\n\nS-Lang has an associative array type.\n\nFor example:\n\nYou can also loop through an associated array in a number of ways.\nHere is one\n\nTo print a sorted-list, it is better to take advantage of S-lang's strong\nsupport for standard arrays:\n\nScala provides an immutable Map class as part of the scala.collection framework:\n\nScala's [[type inference]] will work out that this is a codice_84. To access the array:\n\nThis returns an Option type, Scala's equivalent of a [[Monad (functional programming)#The Maybe monad|the Maybe monad]] in Haskell.\n\nIn Smalltalk a dictionary is used:\n\nTo access an entry the message codice_85 is sent to the dictionary object.\n\ngives\nDictionary hashes/compares based on equality and holds \n[[Garbage collection (computer science)#Strong and weak references|strong references]] to both key and value. Variants exist which hash/compare on identity (IdentityDictionary) or keep [[Garbage collection (computer science)#Strong and weak references|weak references]] (WeakKeyDictionary / WeakValueDictionary).\nBecause every object implements #hash, any object can be used as key (and of course also as value).\n\nSNOBOL is one of the first (if not the first) programming languages to use associative arrays.\nAssociative arrays in [[SNOBOL]] are called Tables.\n\nThe SML'97 standard of the Standard ML programming language does not provide any associative containers. However, various implementations of Standard ML do provide associative containers.\n\nThe library of the popular [[Standard ML of New Jersey]] implementation provides a signature (somewhat like an \"interface\"), codice_86, which defines a common interface for ordered functional (immutable) associative arrays. There are several general functors, codice_87, codice_88, codice_89, and codice_90, that allow you to create the corresponding type of ordered map (the types are a [[self-balancing binary search tree]], sorted [[association list]], [[red-black tree]], and [[splay tree]], respectively) using a user-provided structure to describe the key type and comparator. The functor returns a structure that follows the codice_86 interface. In addition, there are two pre-defined modules for associative arrays with integer keys: codice_92 and codice_93.\n\nSML/NJ also provides a polymorphic hash table:\n\nMonomorphic hash tables are also supported using the codice_94 functor.\n\nAnother Standard ML implementation, [[Moscow ML]], also provides some associative containers. First, it provides polymorphic hash tables in the codice_95 structure. Also, some functional maps from the SML/NJ library above are available as codice_96, codice_97, and codice_98 structures.\n\nThere are two Tcl facilities that support associative array semantics. An array is a collection of \"variables\". A dict is a full implementation of associative arrays.\n\ndict\n\nTo look up an item:\n\nTo iterate through a dict:\n\narray\n\nIf there is a literal space character in the variable name, it must be grouped using either curly brackets (no substitution performed) or double quotes (substitution is performed).\n\nAlternatively, several array elements can be set in a single command by providing their mappings as a list (words containing whitespace are braced):\n\nTo access one array entry and put it on standard output\n\nThe result is here\n\nTo retrieve the entire array as a dictionary:\n\nThe result can be (order of keys is unspecified, not because the dictionary is unordered, but because the array is):\n\nThere is no standard implementation common to all dialects. Visual Basic can use the Dictionary class from the [[Windows Scripting Host|Microsoft Scripting Runtime]] (which is shipped with Visual Basic 6):\n\n[[Visual Basic .NET]] relies on the collection classes provided by [[.NET Framework]]:\n\nUnlike many other [[command line interpreter]]s, PowerShell has built-in, language-level support for defining associative arrays.\n\nFor example:\n\nLike in JavaScript, if the property name is a valid identifier, the quotes can be omitted, e.g.:\n\nEntries can be separated by either a semicolon or a newline, e.g.:\n\nKeys and values can be any [[.NET Framework|.NET]] object type, e.g.:\n\nIt is also possible to create an empty associative array and add single entries or even other associative arrays to it later on.\n\nNew entries can also be added by using the array index operator, the property operator or the codice_99 method of the underlying .NET object:\n\nTo dereference assigned objects the array index operator, the property operator or the parameterized property codice_100 of the .NET object can be used:\n\nYou can loop through an associative array as follows:\n\nAn entry can be removed using the codice_101 method of the underlying .NET object:\n\nHash tables can be added, e.g.:\n\nMany data serialization formats also support associative arrays (see [[Comparison of data serialization formats#Syntax comparison of human-readable formats|this table]])\n\nIn JSON, associative arrays are also referred to as objects. Keys can only be strings.\n\nYAML associative arrays are also called map elements or key-value pairs. YAML places no restrictions on the type of keys; in particular, they are not restricted to being scalar or string values.\n\n[[Category:Associative arrays|Programming language comparison]]\n[[Category:Programming language comparisons|*Mapping]]"}

The Constitutional Court held that precluding the applicant from inheriting unfairly discriminated on the grounds of religion, marital status and gender, and was therefore inconsistent with section 9 of the Constitution. Accordingly, it was held that the applicant could inherit. The ambit of this judgment extended the ruling in \"Daniels v Campbell\" to polygamous Muslim marriages.\n\nThe question was whether or not the benefits provided by the Intestate Succession Act) and the Maintenance Act accrue to surviving spouses of polygynous Muslim marriages.

There, he met promoter Toots Mondt, who taught him to wrestle. While waiting to get the proper paperwork to move to the United States, he relocated to the Dominican Republic to wrestle in the meantime.

It was part of the United Nations' mission to promote world peace. The founding conferences were held in Basel and Florence in 1949, in Lüneburg in 1950, and in Paris in 1951, the last one conducted by UNESCO. \n\nThe Accademia Nazionale Luigi Cherubini celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, an event that brought around 60 music librarians, musicologists, and museum professionals from twelve countries to Florence. This was the first meeting of music librarians from around the world; plans for a separate organization had been discussed since the founding of the International Musicological Society in 1927, but the Second World War prevented anything from taking shape. The war had caused heavy losses at many libraries, and international cooperation was of utmost importance. \n\nThe goals of the Florence conference included updating the status and locations of the musical sources described in \"Biographisch-Bibliographisches Quellen-Lexikon der Musiker und Musikgelehrten der christlichen Zeitrechnung bis zur Mitte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts\" (Leipzig, 1900–1904), establishing a central office in each country responsible for microfilming musical sources from before 1800, and addressing issues related to music cataloging. The first goal was realized in 1952 with the founding of the Répertoire International des Sources Musicales.\n\nIn 1952, IAML had 224 members in 20 countries. Membership grew to about 1,100 members in 39 countries in 1969 and 1,850 members in 40 countries in 1991, with national branches in 26 countries as of 2017.\n\nIAML has professional sections, subject sections, study group, and project groups that focus on particular aspects of music librarianship and documentation. Two professional organizations, the International Association of Music Information Centres and the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives began as IAML groups but later formed their own organizations.\n\nThe IAML board of directors is made up of the president, past president, secretary general, treasurer, and vice presidents. The board governs IAML together with a Council (which includes representatives from national branches and professional sections) and the General Assembly.\n\nIAML is affiliated with the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), the International Music Council, and the IMS.\n\nIAML holds annual conferences and has implemented four main programmes, together known as the \"R projects\" of musicology: \"Répertoire international des sources musicales\" (RISM), \"Répertoire international de littérature musicale\" (RILM), \"Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale\" (RIdIM) and \"Répertoire international de la presse musicale\" (RIPM). IAML publishes a journal, \"Fontes Artis Musicae\", with articles on music librarianship and bibliography as well as reports on IAML conferences and on the progress of the \"R projects\".\n\nIAML holds annual meetings in different locations around the world. Occasionally, meetings are held jointly with other professional organizations. After the founding meetings held from 1949-1951, annual meetings commenced in 1954.\n\n\nRISM was founded in 1953 and deals with the bibliography of sources in music and music literature from Greek antiquity up to 1800.\n\nRILM, founded in 1966, covers music literature through two online databases: RILM Abstracts of Music Literature, which extends from 1967 to the present, and RILM Retrospective Abstracts of Music Literature (RILM Retro), which covers literature from before 1967.\n\nRIdIM, founded in 1971, deals with visual materials relating to music.\n\nRIPM, founded in 1980, preserves, reconstructs, and makes available music periodicals originally published from ca. 1760 to 1966. By 2014, RIPM has indexed 215 music periodicals, published 306 printed volumes and a database of more than 726,000 annotated citations. Furthermore, through the RIPM Online Archive and e-Library, RIPM has made available 166 music journals in full-text.\n\n"}
{"id": "6235121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6235121", "title": "Josh Wolf (journalist)", "text": "Josh Wolf (journalist)\n\nJoshua Selassie \"Josh\" Wolf (born June 8, 1982) is an American freelance journalist and internet videoblogger who was jailed by a Federal district court on August 1, 2006, for refusing to turn over a collection of videotapes he recorded during a July 2005 demonstration in San Francisco, California. Wolf served 226 days in prison at the Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin, California, longer than any other journalist in U.S. history has served for protecting source materials. After Wolf released his video outtakes to the public, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered his release on April 3, 2007. In 2007, Wolf ran for mayor of San Francisco against incumbent Gavin Newsom (finishing in 8th place with about 1 percent of the vote). The next year Wolf accepted a position at the \"Palo Alto Daily Post\" where he reported on the San Mateo County government and that of several cities within the county. In 2011, Wolf graduated from the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism and his thesis film \"Police Tape\" received the Reva and David Logan Prize for Excellence in Investigative Reporting.\n\nWolf was born in Santa Rosa, California. His parents, Len Harrison and Liz Wolf, divorced when he was a young child; he grew up in Wrightwood, California with his mother, an elementary school teacher. Wolf's middle name, Selassie, is in honor of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I. His mother was born into a Jewish family, and converted to Christianity, becoming a Messianic Jew and raising Wolf a Christian.\n\nWolf attended Wrightwood Elementary School in Wrightwood, California and Pinon Mesa Middle School in Phelan, California. He graduated from Serrano High School in Phelan, California in 2000. Wolf received a bachelor's degree from San Francisco State University in 2006, and finished a master's degree at the University of California Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism in 2011.\n\nWolf, a video blogger who reported on numerous protest and progressive events, videotaped an anti-G8 anarchist protest in San Francisco on July 8, 2005 in which some of the protesters wore masks and vandalized property. Later that same night, and over the next few days, Wolf edited his footage and posted the video to a local activist news website, Bay Area Indymedia, or Indybay. Wolf also sold the video to the television broadcast station KRON the day after the protest. In the process of documenting protest actions, Wolf had recorded a tense scene of a protester being choked by a police officer and another officer threatening passersby with stun guns. The only other recording that was broadcast nearly as much was a still photograph of a bloody police officer who was injured during the protest, not taken by Wolf. Other activists who posted video and photographs to the Bay Area Indymedia website were contacted by the FBI seeking their original source materials, but it is unknown how many, if any, turned over their recordings to Federal authorities. Wolf's videotape is the only known source material from the protest to have been sought by subpoena after refusal to turn it over. On April 3, 2007, Wolf posted the unpublished footage on his blog after being assured that he would not have to testify about the footage.\n\nThe US District Court empaneled a grand jury to determine whether arson charges should be brought against some of the protesters on the suspicion that they may have intended to damage a police car by firing a bottle rocket under it, even though the only official damage reported was a broken tail light. The premise for Federal intervention in a case involving a city police car was that the car was funded in part by Federal dollars. Josh Wolf did not shoot any footage of the car incident. But because he shot other video footage elsewhere during the protest, and the identities of some of the protesters were allegedly known to him, Wolf was targeted by Federal officials. Wolf was subpoenaed by the court, requiring him to turn over his footage and submit to testifying before the grand jury. Specifically, the FBI subpoenaed him to provide \"all documents, writings and recordings related to protest activities conducted in San Francisco\" between 6:30 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on July 8 as well any cameras, recording devices, and his computer.\n\nWolf refused to comply with the subpoena. His case was picked up by the National Lawyers Guild who asked a federal magistrate in San Francisco to block the grand jury subpoena, arguing that taking such action would have a chilling effect on other journalists covering future protests. U.S. District Judge William Alsup rejected this argument and ordered Wolf be jailed on August 1, 2006 for contempt of court until he complied.\n\nA federal appeals court granted him bail on August 31, 2006 and he was released on September 1, although Wolf again refused to comply with the district court order that he produce the videotape. On September 18, 2006 his bail was revoked and Wolf returned to prison on September 22, 2006. The entire en banc Court of Appeals refused Wolf's subsequent appeals.\n\nFebruary 7, 2007 marked the 169th day of Wolf's imprisonment, surpassing the time served by Vanessa Leggett, a Houston-based freelancer who was imprisoned for 168 days in 2001 and 2002 for declining to reveal unpublished material about a murder case. Wolf remained in jail for a total of 226 days, the longest time a U.S. journalist has been held in contempt for refusing to divulge sources or unpublished material.\n\nOn April 3, 2007, according to Wolf's lawyer David Greene, prosecutors dropped their insistence that Wolf testify before a grand jury after he posted the unaired video online. With permission from the prosecution, U.S. District Judge William Alsup signed an order requiring Wolf's release from the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California.\n\nThere were a number of important legal issues at dispute in this case, including:\n\nWolf argued that first amendment protections allow journalists to refuse to comply when a grand jury is not conducted in good faith. Specifically, Wolf believes that the government wants his video tapes to help them identify people who were participating in the protests, not for actual footage of a crime that was committed. He has also argued that the federal prosecutor's claim for standing is tenuous (based on the fact that federal funds helped to pay for a police car that was damaged), and that the case was brought before a federal grand jury in order to avoid California's shield laws. There is no Federal Shield Law at this time.\n\nThe Federal prosecutor argued that Wolf does not meet the statutory definition of a journalist (under California law) or a common law journalist's privilege based on the Federal Rules of Evidence. Further, they argued that even if he did, the protections afforded to journalists would not cover his activities in this case because he merely observed the incidents he recorded in a public place. He did not prompt them, nor did he offer anyone anonymity or confidentiality.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Alsup refused to address any of these issues in his written ruling. He simply signed an order written by the Federal prosecutor that ordered Wolf be jailed because it had been established that he was not complying with a grand jury subpoena.\n\nIn their written ruling, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against Wolf on all three issues.\n\nQuestions of Wolf's legitimacy as a journalist have been answered by support from various journalist groups. For example, on August 23, 2006 (22 days \"after\" Wolf was incarcerated), The Society of Professional Journalists awarded him their Journalist of the Year \"for upholding the principles of a free and independent press.\" The SPJ described Wolf as \"...a California blogger and freelance journalist...\" Josh Wolf was the only journalist jailed for his professional activities in the United States in 2006, according to Committee to Protect Journalists (this organization is a member of International Freedom of Expression Exchange). Support in the journalistic community is not uniform, however. On February 28, 2007, syndicated columnist Debra Saunders attacked the credibility of Wolf's arguments, namely the lack of an expectation of privacy of those he was filming.\n\nIn a televised interview on February 9, 2007, Wolf and his attorney, Martin Garbus, responded to the question of the legitimacy of federal involvement, by claiming that the legal efforts against Wolf were part of a broader attempt by the government to learn the identity of people within the video who are critical of the Bush administration and to suppress American journalism at large.\n\nWolf stated during his portion of the interview via phone from prison that he has offered to allow the judge to review \"in camera\" the raw footage to determine if there's any applicable evidence within the video and the U.S. Attorney's office refused the offer based on a legal technicality. Wolf also said that the raw video does not offer any more applicable evidence of the arson or assault charges.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's office declined to participate in the interview but a spokesperson sent a statement saying they were obligated to gather evidence and that six separate judges have \"... ruled that this office has issued a lawful subpoena for legitimate investigative purposes ...\".\n\nThe Rise Up Network Legal Fund held a benefit to help free Josh Wolf and the media in general on September 21, 2006. Featured speakers included Ross Mirkarimi, Chris Daly, and Judith Miller.\n\nAfter Josh Wolf took a job as a general assignment reporter at the Palo Alto Daily Post in 2008, he had some choice words for critics who have questioned his claim of being a journalist.\n\n\"If the haters who said I wasn't a real journalist, are still lurking,\" Wolf wrote on his blog, \"I hope you don't have too much indigestion after eating your words.'\n\nOn July 4, 2007, Wolf announced his candidacy for the office of Mayor of San Francisco, against incumbent Gavin Newsom. Promising an \"open and transparent government\", Wolf stated he would wear a video camera everywhere he does his mayoral business. His platform also discussed homelessness, crime, transportation, public works, gay marriage, medical marijuana and other issues.\n\nWolf finished in 8th place with 1.24% of votes cast.\n\n\n\n"}

A phrase such as \"See Wendy on Tuesday 3pm\" can be entered as is without any pre-processing.\n\nIts distinguishing feature was the ability to allow users to input data before the creation of database tables, giving the program flexibility to accommodate the myriad pieces of information a person may need to keep track of.\n\nThe program was an attempt to create a \"spreadsheet\" for words. The computing industry was at first quite taken by its audacious goal and the power it brought to users as they were given a tool that allowed them to structure \"real life\" information in any way they wished.\n\nIts flexibility proved to be its weakness. New users confronted with so much flexibility were often overpowered by the steep learning curve required to use the program. Attempts to overcome this through packaging pre-built databases with the program were insufficient to lift sales to adequate levels. In the end only several hundred thousand copies were sold.\n\nThe program reached version 2.0b. Instead of porting Agenda to Windows, Lotus stopped development on this program and introduced a new PIM, Lotus Organizer, that uses the paper-based organizer metaphor, in its place.\n\nThe following jargon is used to describe Agenda's concepts:\n\nAn \"Item\" is a piece of free-form text\n\nA \"Category\" is a way of organizing information and was the original smart folder concept used by Microsoft Outlook 2003 and by the Spotlight utility in Mac OS X v10.4. Items can be automatically or manually assigned (linked) to one or more Categories.\n\nCategories can be organized hierarchically and viewed as a tree network. \"Parent\" categories could inherit assignments from \"child\" categories. Agenda performs automatic categorization after it learns your associations. For example, if you link Project A to Mary, then every time you enter an item about Project A, the item is automatically assigned to Mary.\n\nThe information is presented in \"views\": in effect spreadsheet-like grids with items forming the rows and categories forming the columns. Users can create as many views as they like, selecting columns to include and how to sort the items. For example, you can create a People view that displays items sorted by the people to whom they are assigned and columns such as Project Name, Status and Due Date.\n\n\"Conditions\" and \"actions\" allow users to set up assignment rules.\n\nOnce an item is entered, the program can interpret the text to assign it to various categories. In every database a \"When\" category is included automatically so that if a date is embedded within the text, it is interpreted and an assignment is made. For example, the item \"See Wendy on Tuesday 3pm\" is automatically assigned to the following Tuesday at 3pm. If a category \"Wendy\" had also been created then an assignment could also have been made as well. You create a Wendy category by adding a Column called People and typing Wendy as a column entry. Then any time you type Wendy in any item, that item is also assigned to the Wendy category without your needing to make the assignment in a people column (and even if the view in which you enter the new item about Wendy does not include a People column).\n\nThis gives the user a quick ability to find every item that has an association to Wendy.\n\nThe program can be used for:\n\n\nAgenda has some novel technical features. Most notably, database views support item addition and modification, which means that Agenda must infer item attributes from the view. For example, if a view contains the category \"Home,\" and the user creates an item \"paint bathroom\" in this view, then Agenda attaches the \"Home\" attribute to the item. In some cases, assignment cannot be exactly determined and Agenda uses a set of heuristics to make reasonable assignment choices.\n\nAgenda's designers described these core concepts in a 1990 CACM paper \n, and patented some of its internal data structures \n\nThe program has been released as freeware. It can be downloaded from the links below.\n\nLotus Agenda can still be used on Windows 3.x/9x/ME/2000/XP computers and there are still many active users around the world (see the Pimlist email list on Yahoo groups).\n\nIt suffers from:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "230962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230962", "title": "Museo del Prado", "text": "Museo del Prado\n\nThe Prado Museum (; ) is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It is widely considered to have one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and the single best collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and it is considered one of the greatest art museums in the world. The numerous works by Francisco Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Hieronymus Bosch, El Greco, Peter Paul Rubens, Titian, and Diego Velázquez, are some of the highlights of the collection.\n\nThe collection currently comprises around 8,200 drawings, 7,600 paintings, 4,800 prints, and 1,000 sculptures, in addition to a large number of other works of art and historic documents. As of 2012, the museum displayed about 1,300 works in the main buildings, while around 3,100 works were on temporary loan to various museums and official institutions. The remainder were in storage. The museum received 2.8 million visitors in 2012. It is one of the largest museums in Spain.\n\nThe best-known work on display at the museum is \"Las Meninas\" by Velázquez. Velázquez and his keen eye and sensibility were also responsible for bringing much of the museum's fine collection of Italian masters to Spain, now the largest outside Italy.\n\nThe museum is planning a 16% extension in the nearby Salón de Reinos, to be opened in 2019.\n\nThe building that is now the home of the Museo Nacional del Prado was designed in 1785 by architect of the Enlightenment in Spain Juan de Villanueva on the orders of Charles III to house the Natural History Cabinet. Nonetheless, the building's final function was not decided until the monarch's grandson, Ferdinand VII, encouraged by his wife, Queen María Isabel de Braganza, decided to use it as a new Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures. The Royal Museum, which would soon become known as the National Museum of Painting and Sculpture, and subsequently the Museo Nacional del Prado, opened to the public for the first time in November 1819. It was created with the double aim of showing the works of art belonging to the Spanish Crown and to demonstrate to the rest of Europe that Spanish art was of equal merit to any other national school.\nThe first catalogue of the Museum, published in 1819 and solely devoted to Spanish painting, included 311 paintings, although at that time the Museum housed 1,510 from the various royal residences, the Reales Sitios, including works from other schools. The exceptionally important royal collection, which forms the nucleus of the present-day Museo del Prado, started to increase significantly in the 16th century during the time of Charles V and continued under the succeeding Habsburg and Bourbon monarchs. Their efforts and determination led to the Royal Collection being enriched by some of the masterpieces now to be seen in the Prado. These include \"The Descent from the Cross\" by Rogier van der Weyden, \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\" by Hieronymous Bosch, \"Knight with his Hand on his Breast\" by El Greco, \"The Death of the Virgin\" by Mantegna, \"The Holy Family\", known as \"La Perla\", by Raphael, \"Charles V at Mülhberg\" by Titian, \"Christ Washing the Disciples’ Feet\" by Tintoretto, Dürer's \"Self-portrait\", \"Las Meninas\" by Velázquez, \"The Three Graces\" by Rubens, and \"The Family of Charles IV\" by Goya.\n\nIn addition to works from the Spanish royal collection, other holdings increased and enriched the Museum with further masterpieces, such as the two Majas by Goya. Among the now closed museums whose collections have been added to that of the Prado were the Museo de la Trinidad in 1872, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1971. In addition, numerous legacies, donations and purchases have been of crucial importance for the growth of the collection. Various works entered the Prado from the Museo de la Trinidad, including \"The Fountain of Grace\" by the School of Van Eyck, the Santo Domingo and San Pedro Martír altarpieces painted for the monastery of Santo Tomás in Ávila by Pedro Berruguete, and the five canvases by El Greco executed for the Colegio de doña María de Aragón. Most of the Museum's 19th-century paintings come from the former Museo de Arte Moderno, including works by the Madrazos, José de Madrazo y Agudo and Federico de Madrazo, Vicente López, Carlos de Haes, Eduardo Rosales and Sorolla.\n\nUpon the deposition of Isabella II in 1868, the museum was nationalized and acquired the new name of \"Museo del Prado\". The building housed the royal collection of arts, and it rapidly proved too small. The first enlargement to the museum took place in 1918. Since the creation of the Museo del Prado more than 2,300 paintings have been incorporated into its collection, as well as a large number of sculptures, prints, drawings and works of art through bequests, donations and purchases, which account for most of the New Acquisitions. Numerous bequests have enriched the Museum's holdings, such as the outstanding collection of medals left to the Museum by Pablo Bosch; the drawings and items of decorative art left by Pedro Fernández Durán as well as Van der Weyden's masterpiece, \"The Virgin and Child\"; and the Ramón de Errazu bequest of 19th-century paintings. Particularly important donations include Barón Emile d'Erlanger's gift of Goya's Black Paintings in 1881. Among the numerous works that have entered the collection through purchase are some outstanding ones acquired in recent years including two works by El Greco, \"The Fable\" and \"The Flight into Egypt\" acquired in 1993 and 2001, Goya's \"Countess of Chinchón\" bought in 2000, Velázquez's portrait of \"The Pope's Barber\", acquired in 2003 and Fra Angelico's \"Madonna of the Pomegranate\" purchased in 2016.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1900, the Prado helped decorate city halls, new universities, and churches. During the Second Spanish Republic from 1931 to 1936, the focus was on building up provincial museums. During the Spanish Civil War, upon the recommendation of the League of Nations, the museum staff removed 353 paintings, 168 drawings and the Dauphin's Treasure and sent the art to Valencia, then later to Girona, and finally to Geneva. The art had to be returned across French territory in night trains to the museum upon the commencement of World War II. During the early years of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, many paintings were sent to embassies.\nThe main building was enlarged with short pavilions in the rear between 1900 and 1960. The next enlargement was the incorporation of two buildings (nearby but not adjacent) into the institutional structure of the museum: the Casón del Buen Retiro, which is equipped to display up to 400 paintings and which housed the bulk of the 20th-century art from 1971 to 1997, and the Salón de Reinos (Throne building), formerly the Army Museum.\n\nIn 1993, an extension proposed by the Prado's director at the time, Felipe Garin, was quickly abandoned after a wave of criticism. In the late 1990s, a $14 million roof work forced the Velázquez masterpiece \"Las Meninas\" to change galleries twice. In 1998, the Prado annex in the nearby Casón del Buen Retiro closed for a $10 million two-year overhaul that included three new underground levels. In 2007, the museum finally executed Rafael Moneo's project to expand its exposition room to 16,000 square meters, hoping to increase the yearly number of visitors from 1.8 million to 2.5 million. \n\nA glass-roofed and wedge-shaped foyer now contains the museum's shops and cafeteria, removing them from the main building to make more room for galleries. The 16th-century Cloister of Jerónimo has been removed stone by stone to make foundations for increased stability of surrounding buildings and will be re-assembled in the new museum's extension. Hydraulic jacks had to be used to prevent the basement walls from falling during construction.\n\nIn November 2016, it was announced that British architect Norman Foster, in a joint project with Carlos Rubio Carvajal, is to renovate the Hall of Realms, which once formed part of the Buen Retiro palace and transform it into a $32 million extension of the Prado. The museum announced the selection of Foster and Rubio after a jury reviewed the proposals of the eight competition finalists – including David Chipperfield, Rem Koolhaas and Eduardo Souto de Moura –, who had already been shortlisted from an initial list of 47 international teams of architects. The building was acquired by the Prado in 2015, after having served as an army museum until 2005. The project is designed to give the Prado about 61,500 square feet of additional available space, of which about 27,000 square feet will be used to exhibit works.\n\nThe Museo del Prado is one of the buildings constructed during the reign of Charles III (Carlos III) as part of a grandiose building scheme designed to bestow upon Madrid a monumental urban space. The building that lodges the Museum of the Prado was initially conceived by José Moñino y Redondo, count of Floridablanca and was commissioned in 1785 by Charles III for the \"reurbanización\" of the Paseo del Prado. To this end, Charles III called on one of his favorite architects, Juan de Villanueva, author also of the nearby Botanical Garden and the City Hall of Madrid.\n\nThe \"prado\" (\"meadow\") that was where the museum now stands gave its name to the area, the Salón del Prado (later Paseo del Prado), and to the museum itself upon nationalisation. Work on the building stopped at the conclusion of Charles III's reign and throughout the Peninsular War and was only initiated again during the reign of Charles III's grandson, Ferdinand VII. The premises had been used as headquarters for the cavalry and a gunpowder-store for the Napoleonic troops based in Madrid during the war.\n\nBetween 8 November 2011 and 25 March 2012, a group of 179 works of art were brought to the Museo del Prado from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Notable works included:\n\nConversely, for the first time in its 200-year history, the Museo del Prado has toured an exhibition of its renowned collection of Italian masterpieces at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, from 16 May 2014 until 31 August 2014. Many of the works have never before left Spain.\n\nThe Prado, with the nearby Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museo Reina Sofía, forms Madrid's Golden Triangle of Art.\n\nNearby is the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. The Museo Arqueológico houses some art of Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome formerly in the collection of the Prado.\n\nThe Naval Museum, managed by the Ministry of Defence, is also nearby.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, the Prado's annual income was approximately $18 million, $15 million of which came from the government and the remainder from private contributions, publications, and admissions. In 2001, the conservative government of José María Aznar decided to change the museum's financing platform, ushering in a public-private partnership. Under its new bylaws, which the Cortes Generales approved in 2003, the Prado must gradually reduce its level of state support to 50 percent from 80 percent. In exchange, the museum gained control of the budget — now roughly €35 million — and the power to raise money from corporate donations and merchandising. However, its recent €150 million expansion was paid for by the Spanish state.\n\nIn 1991, Manuel Villaescusa bequeathed his fortune of nearly $40 million in Madrid real estate to the Prado, to be used solely for the acquisition of paintings. The museum subsequently sold Villaescusa's buildings to realize income from them. The bequest suddenly made the Prado one of the most formidable bidders for paintings in the world.\n\nThe first four directors were drawn from nobility. From 1838 to 1960, the directors were mostly artists. Since then, most of them have been art historians.\n\nIn 2009, the Prado Museum selected 14 of its most important paintings to be displayed in Google Earth and Google Maps at extremely high resolution, with the largest displayed at 14,000 megapixels. The images' zoom capability allows for close-up views of paint texture and fine detail.\n\n\n"}

Open to the public and free of charge, the museum was privately established in 1937 for the American people by a joint resolution of the United States Congress. Andrew W. Mellon donated a substantial art collection and funds for construction. The core collection includes major works of art donated by Paul Mellon, Ailsa Mellon Bruce, Lessing J. Rosenwald, Samuel Henry Kress, Rush Harrison Kress, Peter Arrell Browne Widener, Joseph E. Widener, and Chester Dale. The Gallery's collection of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, medals, and decorative arts traces the development of Western Art from the Middle Ages to the present, including the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Americas and the largest mobile created by Alexander Calder.\n\nThe Gallery's campus includes the original neoclassical West Building designed by John Russell Pope, which is linked underground to the modern East Building, designed by I. M. Pei, and the Sculpture Garden. The Gallery often presents temporary special exhibitions spanning the world and the history of art. It is one of the largest museums in North America.\n\nPittsburgh banker (and Treasury Secretary from 1921 until 1932) Andrew W. Mellon began gathering a private collection of old master paintings and sculptures during World War I. During the late 1920s, Mellon decided to direct his collecting efforts towards the establishment of a new national gallery for the United States.\n\nIn 1930, partly for tax reasons, Mellon formed the A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, which was to be the legal owner of works intended for the gallery. In 1930–1931, the Trust made its first major acquisition, 21 paintings from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg as part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, including such masterpieces as Raphael's \"Alba Madonna,\" Titian's \"Venus with a Mirror\", and Jan van Eyck's \"Annunciation\".\n\nIn 1929 Mellon had initiated contact with the recently appointed Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Charles Greeley Abbot. Mellon was appointed in 1931 as a Commissioner of the Institution's National Gallery of Art. When the director of the Gallery retired, Mellon asked Abbot not to appoint a successor, as he proposed to endow a new building with funds for expansion of the collections.\n\nHowever, Mellon's trial for tax evasion, centering on the Trust and the Hermitage paintings, caused the plan to be modified. In 1935, Mellon announced in \"The Washington Star\", his intention to establish a new gallery for old masters, separate from the Smithsonian. When asked by Abbot, he explained that the project was in the hands of the Trust and that its decisions were partly dependent on \"the attitude of the Government towards the gift\".\n\nIn January 1937, Mellon formally offered to create the new Gallery. On his birthday, 24 March 1937, an Act of Congress accepted the collection and building funds (provided through the Trust), and approved the construction of a museum on the National Mall.\n\nThe new gallery was to be effectively self-governing, not controlled by the Smithsonian, but took the old name \"National Gallery of Art\" while the Smithsonian's gallery would be renamed the \"National Collection of Fine Arts\" (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum).\n\nDesigned by architect John Russell Pope, the new structure was completed and accepted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on behalf of the American people on March 17, 1941. Neither Mellon nor Pope lived to see the museum completed; both died in late August 1937, only two months after excavation had begun. At the time of its inception it was the largest marble structure in the world. The museum stands on the former site of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad station, where in 1881 a disgruntled office seeker, Charles Guiteau, shot President James Garfield (see James A. Garfield assassination).\n\nAs anticipated by Mellon, the creation of the National Gallery encouraged the donation of other substantial art collections by a number of private donors. Founding benefactors included such individuals as Paul Mellon, Samuel H. Kress, Rush H. Kress, Ailsa Mellon Bruce, Chester Dale, Joseph Widener, Lessing J. Rosenwald and Edgar William and Bernice Chrysler Garbisch.\n\nThe Gallery's East Building was constructed in the 1970s on much of the remaining land left over from the original congressional action. Andrew Mellon's children, Paul Mellon and Ailsa Mellon Bruce, funded the building. Designed by architect I. M. Pei, the contemporary structure was completed in 1978 and was opened on June 1 of that year by President Jimmy Carter. The new building was built to house the Museum's collection of modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints, as well as study and research centers and offices. The design received a National Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 1981.\n\nThe final addition to the complex is the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden. Completed and opened to the public on May 23, 1999, the location provides an outdoor setting for exhibiting a number of pieces from the Museum's contemporary sculpture collection.\n\nThe National Gallery of Art is supported through a private-public partnership. The United States federal government provides funds, through annual appropriations, to support the museum's operations and maintenance. All artwork, as well as special programs, are provided through private donations and funds. The museum is not part of the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nNoted directors of the National Gallery have included David E. Finley, Jr. (1938-1956), John Walker (1956–1968), and J. Carter Brown (1968–1993). Earl A. \"Rusty\" Powell III (since 1993) is the current director.\n\nEntry to both buildings of the National Gallery of Art is free of charge. From Monday through Saturday, the museum is open from 10 a.m. – 5 p.m.; it is open from 11 – 6 p.m. on Sundays. It is closed on December 25 and January 1.\n\nThe museum comprises two buildings: the West Building (1941) and the East Building (1978) linked by an underground passage. The West Building, composed of pink Tennessee marble, was designed in 1937 by architect John Russell Pope in a neoclassical style (as is Pope's other notable Washington, D.C. building, the Jefferson Memorial). Designed in the form of an elongated H, the building is centered on a domed rotunda modeled on the interior of the Pantheon in Rome. Extending east and west from the rotunda, a pair of skylit sculpture halls provide its main circulation spine. Bright garden courts provide a counterpoint to the long main axis of the building.\n\nThe West Building has an extensive collection of paintings and sculptures by European masters from the medieval period through the late 19th century, as well as pre-20th century works by American artists. Highlights of the collection include many paintings by Jan Vermeer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nIn contrast, the design of the East Building by architect I. M. Pei is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one isosceles and the other a smaller right triangle. The space defined by the isosceles triangle came to house the museum's public functions. The portion outlined by the right triangle became the study center. The triangles in turn became the building's organized motif, echoed and repeated in every dimension.\n\nThe building's central feature is a high atrium designed as an open interior court that is enclosed by a sculptural space spanning . The atrium is centered on the same axis that forms the circulation spine for the West Building and is constructed in the same Tennessee marble.\n\nHowever, in 2005 the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk that panels might fall onto visitors below. In 2008, NGA officials decided that it had become necessary to remove and reinstall all of the panels. The renovation was completed in 2016.\n\nThe East Building focuses on modern and contemporary art, with a collection including works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Alexander Calder, a 1977 mural by Robert Motherwell and works by many other artists. The East Building also contains the main offices of the NGA and a large research facility, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA). Among the highlights of the East Building in 2012 was an exhibition of Barnett Newman's \"The Stations of the Cross\" series of 14 black and white paintings (1958–66). Newman painted them after he had recovered from a heart attack; they are usually regarded as the peak of his achievement. The series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nThe two buildings are connected by a walkway beneath 4th street, called \"the Concourse\" on the museum's map. In 2008, the National Gallery of Art commissioned American artist Leo Villareal to transform the Concourse into an artistic installation. Today, \"Multiverse\" is the largest and most complex light sculpture by Villareal featuring approximately 41,000 computer-programmed LED nodes that run through channels along the entire -long space. The concourse also includes the food court and a gift shop.\n\nThe final element of the National Gallery of Art complex, the Sculpture Garden was completed in 1999 after more than 30 years of planning. To the west of the West Building, on the opposite side of Seventh Street, the Sculpture Garden was designed by landscape architect Laurie Olin as an outdoor gallery for monumental modern sculpture.\n\nThe Sculpture Garden contains plantings of Native American species of canopy and flowering trees, shrubs, ground covers, and perennials. A circular reflecting pool and fountain form the center of its design, which arching pathways of granite and crushed stone complement. (The pool becomes an ice-skating rink during the winter.) The sculptures exhibited in the surrounding landscaped area include pieces by David Smith, Mark Di Suvero, Roy Lichtenstein, Sol LeWitt, Tony Smith, Roxy Paine, Joan Miró, Louise Bourgeois, and Hector Guimard.\n\nThe NGA's West Building was renovated from 2007 to 2009. Although some galleries closed for periods of time, others remained open.\n\nAfter congressional testimony that the East Building suffered from \"systematic structural failures\", NGA adopted a Master Renovations Plan in 1999. This plan established the timeline for closing the building, and planned for the renovation of the electronic security systems, elevators, and HVAC. Space between the ceilings of existing galleries and the building's skylights (which was never completed when the building was constructed in 1978) would be renovated into two, high, hexagonal Tower Galleries. The galleries would have a combined of space and will be lit by skylights. A rooftop sculpture garden would also be added. NGA officials said that the Tower Galleries would probably house modern art, and the creation of a distinct \"Rothko Room\" was possible.\n\nBeginning in 2011, NGA undertook an $85 million restoration of the East Building's façade. The East Building is clad in thick pink marble panels. The panels are held about away from the wall by stainless steel anchors. Gravity holds the panel in the bottom anchors (which are placed at each corner), while \"button head\" anchors (stainless steel posts with large, flat heads) at the top corners keep the panel upright. Mortar was used on the gravity anchors to level the stones. Joints of flexible colored neoprene were placed between the panels. This system was designed to allow each panel to hang independent of its neighbors, and NGA officials say they are not aware of any other panel system like it.\n\nHowever, many panels were accidentally mortared together. Seasonal heating and cooling of the façade, infiltration of moisture, and shrinkage of the building's structural concrete by over time caused extensive damage to the façade. In 2005, regular maintenance showed that some panels were cracked or significantly damaged, while others leaned by more than out from the building (threatening to fall).\n\nThe NGA hired the structural engineering firm Robert Silman Associates to determine the cause of the problem. Although the Gallery began raising private funds to fix the issue, eventually federal funding was used to repair the building. In 2012, the NGA chose a joint venture, Balfour Beatty/Smoot, to complete the repairs. Anodized aluminum anchors replaced the stainless steel ones, and the top corner anchors were moved to the center of the top edge of each stone. The neoprene joints were removed and new colored silicone gaskets installed, and leveling screws rather than mortar used to keep the panels square. Work began in November 2011, and originally was scheduled to end in 2014. By February 2012, however, the contractor said work on the façade would end in late 2013, and site restoration would take place in 2014. The East Building remained open throughout the project.\n\nIn March 2013, the National Gallery of Art announced a $68.4 million renovation to the East Building. This included $38.4 million to refurbish the interior mechanical plant of the structure, and $30 million to create new exhibition space. Because the angular interior space of the East Building made it impossible to close off galleries, the renovation required all but the atrium and offices to close by December 2013. The structure remained closed for three years. The architectural firm of Hartman-Cox oversaw both aspects of the renovation.\n\nA group of benefactors — which included Victoria and Roger Sant, Mitchell and Emily Rales, and David Rubenstein — privately financed the renovation. The \"Washington Post\" reported that the donation was one of the largest the NGA had received in a decade. NGA staff said that they would use the closure to conserve artwork, plan purchases, and develop exhibitions. Plans for renovating conservation, construction, exhibition prep, groundskeeping, office, storage, and other internal facilities were also ready, but would not be implemented for many years.\n\nThe NGA's collection galleries and Sculpture Garden display European and American paintings, sculpture, works on paper, photographs, and decorative arts. The permanent collection of paintings extends from the Middle Ages to the present day. The Italian Renaissance collection includes two panels from Duccio's \"Maesta\", the tondo of the \"Adoration of the Magi\" by Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi, a Botticelli work on the same subject, Giorgione's \"Allendale Nativity\", Giovanni Bellini's \"The Feast of the Gods\", \"Ginevra de' Benci\" (the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Americas) and groups of works by Titian and Raphael.\n\nOther European collections include examples of the work of many of the masters of western painting, including a version of \"Saint Martin and the Beggar,\" by El Greco, and works by Matthias Grünewald, Cranach the Elder, Rogier van der Weyden, Albrecht Dürer, Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer, Francisco Goya, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and Eugène Delacroix, among others. The collection of sculpture and decorative arts includes such works as the \"Chalice\" of Abbot Suger of St-Denis and a collection of work by Auguste Rodin and Edgar Degas. Other highlights of the permanent collection include the second of the two original sets of Thomas Cole's series of paintings titled \"The Voyage of Life\", (the first set is at the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York) and the original version of \"Watson and the Shark\" by John Singleton Copley (two other versions are in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Detroit Institute of Arts).\n\nThe National Gallery's print collection comprises 75,000 prints, in addition to rare illustrated books. It includes collections of works by Albrecht Dürer, Rembrandt, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, William Blake, Mary Cassatt, Edvard Munch, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. The collection began with 400 prints donated by five collectors in 1941. In 1942, Joseph E. Widener donated his entire collection of nearly 2,000 works. In 1943, Lessing Rosenwald donated his collection of 8,000 old master and modern prints; between 1943 and 1979, he donated almost 14,000 more works. In 2008, Dave and Reba White Williams donated their collection of more than 5,200 American prints.\n\nIn 2013, the NGA purchased from a private French collection Gerard van Honthorst's 1623 painting, \"The Concert\", which had not been publicly viewed since 1795. After initially displaying the \"The Concert\" in a special installation in the West Building, the NGA moved the painting to a permanent display in the museum's Dutch and Flemish galleries. Although the NGA did not reveal the amount that it had paid for \"The Concert\",\nart experts estimated the sale price at $20 million.\n\n\n\n"}

They make this pledge because of the power of words, believing that only when all of Jah's children make the pledge together, the oppressors will be destroyed. In addition, they are often non-violent or follow the just war theory.\n\nNyabinghi was a legendary Ugandan/Rwandan tribe queen, who was said to have possessed a Ugandan woman named Muhumusa in the 19th century. Muhumusa inspired a movement, rebelling against African colonial authorities. Although she was captured in 1913, alleged possessions by Nyabinghi continued (mostly afflicting women).\nBloodline of the true Nyabinghi warriors rightfully settled in the heart of Dzimba dze Mabwe now known as Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Nyabinghi resistance inspired a number of Jamaican Rastas, who incorporated what are known as Nyabinghi chants (\"binghi\") into their celebrations (grounations). The rhythms of these chants were an influence on popular ska, rocksteady and reggae music. Three kinds of drums are used in Nyabinghi music: bass, \"funde\" and \"keteh\". The \"keteh\" plays an improvised syncopation rooted in Ashanti dance and drumming, the \"funde\" plays a regular one-two beat and the bass drum strikes loudly on the first beat, and softly on the third (of fourth) beat. Count Ossie was the first to record nyabinghi and helped to establish and maintain Rasta culture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46377130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46377130", "title": "Penal bond", "text": "Penal bond\n\nA penal bond is a written instrument executed between an obligor and an obligee designed to secure the performance of a legal obligation through the \"in terrorem\" effect of the threat of a penalty for nonperformance.\n\nAt its simplest, a bond need only state who is to be paid, what sum, when, and where (for example: \"'Know all men etc. that I, \"AB\", am firmly bound to \"CD\" in [$]\"n\" to be paid at Michaelmas next following'\"). At common law, these bonds were nearly impossible to contest from the perspective of the obligor (the debtor). A simple bond can properly be considered a penal bond if it calls for the payment of a sum that is punitive in relation to the damages that would be caused by nonperformance.\n\nHistorically, the most significant type of penal bond was the penal bond with conditional defeasance. A penal bond with conditional defeasance combined in one document the bond (the promise to pay a specified amount of money) with the contractual obligation. It did this in what the historian Brian Simpson called a ‘topsy-turvy’ fashion by printing the bond on the front of the document and the condition, whose performance by the obligor would render the bond void (referred to as the indenture of defeasance), on the back.\n\nAt early common law, the penal obligations of bonds were enforced through an action of debt which was concerned with that penal obligation rather than the underlying agreement. In this sense, the enforcement of bonds in the period preceding the modern simplification of pleading was not concerned with contracts principles at all; rather, the enforcement of bonds was a question of \"the law of deeds and conditions.\" \n\nThe penal bond with conditional defeasance (hereinafter referred to as a conditional bond, conditional penal bond, or penal bond) first arose in England during the 1340s/1350’s. The conditional bond has been characterized as the dominant method for “framing substantial contracts in the later medieval and early modern periods.” In fact, during the Tudor Period, actions of debt were the most numerous single class of actions in the Common Pleas rolls (and would continue to be so for the next 300 years).\n\nAlthough an innovation in its structure, the conditional penal bond was not the first English attempt to impose “fixed monetary penalties” for failure to perform on an agreement. Penalty clauses inserted into written contracts, a mainstay in civil law jurisdictions, as well as penal bonds with separate indentures of defeasance were commonly used to secure the performance of a contract until well into the fifteenth century.\n\nPutting the acquittance on the reverse of the bond itself, however, had a number of advantages over its competitors:\n\n\nJoseph Biancalana has argued that there was no real advantage inherent in a conditional penal bond as against its competitors, and that therefore its later dominance was attributable to custom and trade practice. Robert Palmer, on the other hand, has argued that “[t]he morality that allowed the extension of penal bonds after the Black Death . . . was part of the governmental concern to preserve traditional society by harshly coercing the upper classes to abide by their obligations.” Irrespective of its merits, the conditional bond did overtake other forms of imposing a penalty for nonperformance of an obligation by the fifteenth century.\n\nAt common law, the simple bond “was almost irresistible,” the only defenses available to the debtor being forgery or the production of a sealed acquittance in court. Debtors were not permitted to argue any other defenses including, “payment without taking of a sealed acquittance, payment at another time or place then specified in the bond, failure of consideration, impossibility of performance, or fraud in the underlying transaction.” The debtor who was wrongly made to pay twice, however, could win damages in a writ of trespass for the taking.\n\nConditional bonds were somewhat easier to contest from the perspective of the obligor. Courts considered performance of the condition a valid defense to the bond. By the mid-sixteenth century, the common law began to recognize a range of limited circumstances “in which non-performance of the condition was excused or a variant performance was held a sufficient defense against the bond.”; see, for example, \"Abbot of Cerle’s Case\". Before the mid-sixteenth century, however, substantial performance (unless accepted as sufficient by the obligee), partial payment, and late payment were not accepted defenses.\n\nThe common law was eventually made to compete with the Court of Chancery, which began to pass upon the enforceability of penal bonds. \"Barrantyne v. Jeckett\" (1553/54) has been cited as the earliest example of the Court of Chancery giving relief from a penal bond, but by the middle of the sixteenth century, “Chancery was already intervening against penal bonds quite frequently” (34 cases being reported for study in the years 1544-1568, with probably as many passed over as routine, and some falling through the cracks as not recognizable as penal bonds in the records). “By 1582 Chancery’s intervention was even more frequent,” including some 16 bond cases under consideration in the Michaelmas term alone.\n\nAlthough Chancery was more favorable to the debtor, it still maintained a relatively strict line in these cases: injunctions were not routinely granted “simply on the ground that the penal sum was outrageously disproportionate to the underlying debt.” The 1557 case of \"Chamberlayn v. Iseham\", illustrates this point. In that case, the debtor (now plaintiff in equity) had given a bond to pay a sum of £400, “defeasible if 20 marks (£13 s. 8d.) was paid by a certain date.” Rather than grant an injunction barring the enforcement of the bond on the ground that the sum was grossly disproportionate to the underlying debt, Chancery “felt it necessary to mention special circumstances in the debtor’s favor,” namely that “he was in the service of the king and queen on the day appointed for payment, and had since paid the twenty marks into Chancery to be held for the obligee.” \n\nDuring the mid-sixteenth century, Chancery sometimes viewed substantial performance of the condition as sufficient reason to justify intervention. This was the outcome in the cases of \"Rowse v. Wade\", \"Fabyan v. Fuliambe\", \"Atkinson v. Harman\", \"Longe v. Awbery\", and \"Walaston v. Mower\".\n\nBeyond these cases, “by about 1562 Chancery was beginning to feel that the law of harsh penalties for small defaults was wrong in principle,” having held on a number of occasions that the defendant obligee could not recover more than his damages, notwithstanding the fact that he could have recovered at common law the entire penal sum irrespective of the amount he had been harmed (“damnified” in the verbiage of the time). This shift led Chancery to grant relief “routinely in a whole class of cases,” rather than just in exceptional cases. Arguably as a result of this routinizing of chancering penal bonds, Chancery’s willingness to intervene regularly in penal bonds (starting sometime in the 1580s/90’s) shifted from giving injunctions without regard to whether the common law court had passed on the matter (which was the prior practice) to granting injunctions only during a set period of time.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this caused friction between the common law courts and the Court of Chancery, which came to a head in 1614 over whether the Chancery Court could properly issues injunctions in cases upon which the common law courts had already passed judgment. In the case of \"Courtney v. Glanville and Allen\", which grew out of a particularly egregious example of fraud underlying a debt, Chief Justice Coke, judge and leading advocate of the common law, sought to challenge the authority of the Chancery Court to review decisions already made by the common law courts. As the common law courts had already given judgment for Glanville and Allen, Coke argued that the Chancery Court could not properly rule on the case so as to give an injunction which ran contrary to the action of the common law court. Eventually, this particular dispute became wrapped up in a wider rift between common law and Chancery in the \"Earl of Oxford’s case\", culminating in a stinging rebuke of the common law courts delivered by King James I, re-affirming the Chancery Court’s right and duty to the people to review those decisions of the common law courts which may have been manifestly unjust.\n\nChancery’s dim view of penalties in excess of damages eventually won out. In 1696, Parliament passed a law, the Administration of Justice Act, which said that “a plaintiff suing upon a bond was allowed to execute on property only up to the value of the damages suffered as a result of the breach.” In 1705, the law was amended to say that “payment of damages” was to be considered “a full substitute for the stipulated penalty under the bond.” The penal bond, nonetheless, remained popular in the ensuing century \"mainly because of procedural advantages – such as a longer statute of limitations – for actions on specialty contracts like bonds, vis-à-vis simple contracts.” For bonds, in fact, there was no limitation period before 1833, although payment was presumed after a period of 20 years (reduced to 12 years in 1939). As penal bonds were under seal, preference was also given to them over simple debts in the event of debtor insolvency. Despite these minor advantages, the core fact remained that after “the limitation of the early eighteenth century, regardless of the penalty specified in the bond, the value of the underlying promise represented a ceiling on the plaintiff’s recourse against the defendant.” \n\nCurtis Nyquist reports that “[b]y the eighteenth century, chancering bonds was a regular practice on both sides of the Atlantic, even in common law courts.” In Massachusetts, the practice was to give “judgment for only one-half the amount of the bond.” This trend, unsurprisingly, “undermined” the “in terrorem quality of penal bonds,” and therefore penal bonds were “used less frequently and no longer played a major role in business practice by [1819].” Despite this fact, \"until the beginning of the nineteenth century,\" \"virtually all large business transactions\" in the United States were conducted via the mutual exchange of two independent penal bonds.\n\nOver time in the United States, not only were penal bonds regarded as invalid insofar as they imposed liability in excess of damages, all contractual mechanisms that purported to impose a penalty in excess of damages (rather than valid liquidated damages) were regarded as invalid. By 1895, the rule limiting relief to actual damages, and disfavoring penal bonds insofar as they purported to grant more than actual damages, was regarded a positive “[amelioration] of the severity of the common law,” and is aptly described in the case of \"Kelley v. Seay\", spinning a story of progress in the law to the point where it was then regarded as a “settled rule that no other sum can be recovered under a penalty than that which shall compensate the plaintiff for his actual loss.” \n\nAlthough penal bonds have not been used for hundreds of years, their influence on English jurisprudence continued through the development of the common law rules in relation to penalty clauses. During their review of this area of the law in \"Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi\" the Supreme Court reviewed the relevant history and its effect on subsequent jurisprudence (noting that \"[t]he penalty rule in England is an ancient, haphazardly constructed edifice which has not weathered well\". With the decline of the use of defeasible bonds the procedural mechanics developed in case law and Administration of Justice Act 1696 and later the Administration of Justice Act 1705 to protect parties became increasingly applied to liquidated damages clauses, which evolved into the common law doctrine of penalties.\n"}

Both as a writer and as a lawyer, he was a champion of the downtrodden, from seamen to fugitive slaves and freedmen.\n\nDana was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 1, 1815 into a family that had settled in colonial America in 1640, counting Anne Bradstreet among its ancestors. His father was the poet and critic Richard Henry Dana Sr. As a boy, Dana studied in Cambridgeport under a strict schoolmaster named Samuel Barrett, alongside fellow Cambridge native and future writer James Russell Lowell. Barrett was infamous as a disciplinarian who punished his students for any infraction by flogging. He also often pulled students by their ears and, on one such occasion, nearly pulled Dana's ear off, causing the boy's father to protest enough that the practice was abolished.\n\nIn 1825, Dana enrolled in a private school overseen by Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom Dana later mildly praised as \"a very pleasant instructor\", though he lacked a \"system or discipline enough to ensure regular and vigorous study.\" In July 1831, Dana enrolled at Harvard College, where in his freshman year his support of a student protest cost him a six-month suspension. In his junior year, he contracted measles, which in his case led to ophthalmia.\n\nFatefully, the worsening vision inspired him to take a sea voyage. But rather than going on a fashionable Grand Tour of Europe he decided, despite his high-class birth, to enlist as a merchant seaman. On August 14, 1834 he departed Boston aboard the brig \"Pilgrim\", captained by Frank Thompson, bound for Alta California, at that time still a part of Mexico. This voyage would bring Dana to a number of settlements in California (including Monterey, San Buenaventura, San Pedro, San Juan Capistrano, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara and San Francisco). After witnessing Thompson's sadistic practices, including a flogging on board the ship, he vowed that he would try to help improve the lot of the common seaman. The \"Pilgrim\" collected hides for shipment to Boston, and Dana spent much of his time in California at San Diego's Point Loma curing hides and loading them onto the ship.\n\nTo return home sooner, he was reassigned by the ship's owners to a different ship: the \"Alert\". Of the return trip around Cape Horn in the middle of the Antarctic winter, Dana gives the classic account. He describes terrifying storms and incredible beauty, giving vivid descriptions of icebergs, which he calls incomparable. The most incredible part perhaps is the weeks and weeks it took to negotiate passage against winds and storms—all the while having to race up and down the ice-covered rigging to furl and unfurl sails. At one point he has an infected tooth, and his face swells up so that he is unable to work for several days, despite the need for all hands. After the Horn has been rounded he describes the scurvy that afflicts members of the crew. In \"White-Jacket\", Herman Melville wrote, \"But if you want the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana's unmatchable \"Two Years Before the Mast\". But you can read, and so you must have read it. His chapters describing Cape Horn must have been written with an icicle.\"\n\nOn September 22, 1836, Dana arrived back in Massachusetts.\n\nHe thereupon enrolled at what is now Harvard Law School, then called the Dane Law School. Graduated in 1837, he was admitted to the bar in 1840 and went on to specialize in maritime law. In the October 1839 issue of a magazine, he took a local judge, one of his own instructors in law school, to task for letting off a ship's captain and mate with a slap on the wrist for murdering the ship's cook, beating him to death for not \"laying hold\" of a piece of equipment. The judge had sentenced the captain to ninety days in jail and the mate to thirty days.\n\nIn 1841, Dana published \"The Seaman's Friend,\" which became a standard reference on the legal rights and responsibilities of sailors. He defended many common seamen in court.\n\nDuring his voyages he had kept a diary, and in 1840 (coinciding with his admission to the bar) he published a memoir, \"Two Years Before the Mast\". The term, \"before the mast\" refers to sailors' quarters, which were located in the forecastle (the ship's bow), officers' quarters being near the stern. His writing evidences his later sympathy for the oppressed. With the California Gold Rush later in the decade, \"Two Years Before the Mast\" would become highly sought after as one of the few sources of information on California.\n\nDana became a prominent abolitionist, helping to found the anti-slavery Free Soil Party in 1848 and represented the fugitive slave Anthony Burns in Boston in 1854. He was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that assisted fugitive slaves.\n\nIn 1853 Dana represented William T. G. Morton in Morton's attempt to establish that he discovered the \"anaesthetic properties of ether\".\n\nIn 1859, while the U.S. Senate was considering whether the United States should try to annex the Spanish possession of Cuba, Dana traveled there and visited Havana, a sugar plantation, a bullfight, and various churches, hospitals, schools, and prisons, a trip documented in his book \"To Cuba and Back\".\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Dana served as a United States Attorney, and successfully argued before the Supreme Court that the United States Government could rightfully blockade Confederate ports. After the close of the war he resigned his office, as he did not approve of President Andrew Johnson's policy of Reconstruction, which was denounced by \"Radical Republicans\" as being too moderate in terms of African American civil rights and punishment of former Confederates, and entered private practice. During 1867–1868 Dana was a member of the Massachusetts legislature and also served as a U.S. counsel in the trial of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.\n\nIn 1876, his nomination as ambassador to Great Britain was defeated in the Senate by political enemies, partly because of a lawsuit for plagiarism brought against him for a legal textbook he had edited, Henry Wheaton's \"Elements of International Law\" (8th ed., 1866). Immediately after the book's publication, Dana had been charged by the editor of two earlier editions, William Beach Lawrence, with infringing his copyright, and was involved in litigation which continued for thirteen years. In such minor matters as arrangement of notes and verification of citations the court found against Dana, but in the main Dana's notes were vastly different from Lawrence's.\n\nIn 1877, Dana was one of the counsel for the Government of the United States, appearing before the Halifax Fisheries Commission, appointed under the Treaty of Washington (1871) to resolve outstanding issues, including fishing rights. The Commission gave an award directing the United States to pay $5,500,000 to the British Government. Towards the end of his life he went to Europe to devote himself to the preparation of a treatise on international law; but the actual composition of this work was little more than begun when he died in Rome, January 6, 1882.\n\nHis son, Richard Henry Dana III, married Edith Longfellow, daughter of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\nThere is additional biographical information and insights into the life of Richard Henry Dana Jr. in the \"Introductory Note\" to the Harvard Classics edition of \"Two Years Before the Mast\", edited by Charles W. Eliot, L.L.D. and published by P. F. Collier & Son in 1909. Here is an excerpt:\n\nRichard Henry Dana, the second of that name, was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, August 1, 1815. He came of a stock that had resided there since the days of the early settlements; his grandfather, Francis Dana, had been the first American minister to Russia and later became chief justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts; his father was distinguished as a man of letters. He entered Harvard College in 1831; but near the beginning of his third year an attack of measles left his eyesight so weak that study was impossible. Tired of the tedium of a slow convalescence, he decided on a sea voyage; and choosing to go as a sailor rather than a passenger, he shipped from Boston on August 14, 1834, on the brig \"Pilgrim\", bound for the coast of California. His experiences for the next two years form the subject of the present volume.\n\nIn the December following his return to Boston in 1836, Dana re-entered Harvard, the hero of his fellow students, graduating in the following June. He next took up the study of law, at the same time teaching elocution in the College, and in 1840 he opened an office in Boston. While in the law school he had written out the narrative of his voyage, which he now published; and in the following year, 1841, issued \"The Seaman's Friend\". Both books were republished in England and brought him an immediate reputation.\n\nAfter several years of the practice of law, during which he dealt largely with cases involving the rights of seamen, he began to take part in politics as an active member of the Free-Soil Party. [Note: the Free-Soil Party was founded in 1847–48 in opposition to the extension of slavery into the western U.S. territories newly acquired from Mexico.] During the operation of the Fugitive-Slave Law he acted as counsel in behalf of the fugitives Shadrach, Sims and Burns, and on one occasion suffered a serious assault as a consequence of his zeal. His prominence in these cases, along with his fame as a writer, brought him much social recognition on his visit to England in 1856. Three years later, his health gave way from overwork, and he set out on a voyage round the world, revisiting California, where he made the observations which appear in the postscript to this book. [Note: The postscript is entitled: \"Twenty-Four Years After,\" and is included in Dana's list of works, below.]\n\nOn his return, Dana was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as United States District Attorney for Massachusetts; and in his arguments before the Supreme Court in Washington in connection with the \"Prize cases,\" dealing with the capture of private property at sea in time of war, he greatly increased an already brilliant legal reputation. He spoke out in favor of African American voting, education, property and firearms ownership, stating:\n\nHis sentiments were echoed by future U.S. President James A. Garfield in his speeches, who wholeheartedly agreed with Dana's message.\n\nThe record of Dana's life agrees with the picture of his temperament which he unconsciously painted in his first and greatest book. The ready sympathy for the suffering and the oppressed, the courage, unselfishness, and fair-mindedness which he exhibited on the merchant vessel when a boy of twenty, continued to characterize him throughout his long and distinguished career as lawyer and citizen.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1658891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1658891", "title": "Rikidōzan", "text": "Rikidōzan\n\nRikidōzan was born Kim Sin-rak in South Hamgyong, in Korea, on November 14, 1924.\n\nHe was the youngest son of Kim Soktee, the owner of a Korean farm with a Confucian tradition and his wife Chon Gi. When his father fell ill, Sin-rak tended to his father, while his mother and older brothers tended to the farm. His father died in 1939.\n\nHe became the adopted son of the farmer \"Momota family\" of Nagasaki Prefecture when he was young and trained to be a sumo wrestler. He joined Nishonoseki stable, and made his debut in May 1940. Due to the discrimination against Koreans by the Japanese, Sin-rak claimed that his name was Mitsuhiro Momota (Momota being the surname of the family which adopted, but later disowned, him) and listed his birthplace as Omura, Nagasaki. He was given the \"shikona\" of Rikidōzan. He reached the top \"makuuchi\" division in 1946 and was runner-up to \"yokozuna\" Haguroyama in the tournament of June 1947, losing a playoff for the championship. He fought in 23 tournaments in total, with a win-loss record of 135–82. His highest rank was \"sekiwake\".\n\nRikidōzan gave up sumo in 1950. Although he claimed it was for financial reasons, discrimination against Koreans may have been a contributory factor. He made his professional wrestling debut in 1951 with a ten-minute draw against Bobby Bruns. He established himself as Japan's biggest wrestling star by defeating one American wrestler after another. This was shortly after World War II, and the Japanese needed someone who could stand up to the Americans. Rikidōzan thus became immensely popular in Japan. His American opponents assisted him by portraying themselves as villains who cheated in their matches. Rikidōzan himself was booked as a villain when he wrestled in America early on but went on to become one of the first Japanese wrestlers to be cheered as a baby face in post World War II America. \n\nRikidōzan gained worldwide renown when he defeated Lou Thesz for the NWA International Heavyweight Championship on August 27, 1958 in Japan. In another match, Thesz willingly agreed to put over Rikidōzan at the expense of his own reputation. This built up mutual respect between the two wrestlers, and Rikidōzan never forgot what Thesz did. He would go on to capture several NWA titles in matches both in Japan and overseas. Rikidōzan also trained professional wrestling students, including soon-to-be wrestling legends Kanji \"Antonio\" Inoki, Ooki Kintaro, and Shohei \"Giant\" Baba.\n\nHis signature move was the karate chop, which was actually based on sumo's \"harite\", rather than actual karate. It is rumoured that he had been coached by fellow Korean Masutatsu Oyama, but he is more likely to have been coached by another Korean karateka, Nakamura Hideo.\n\nWith his success in pro wrestling, Rikidōzan began acquiring properties such as nightclubs, hotels, condominiums and boxing promotions. He established the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA), Japan's first professional wrestling promotion, in 1953. His first major feud was against Masahiko Kimura, the famous judoka who had been invited by Rikidōzan to compete as a professional wrestler. Other famous feuds included those against Thesz in 1957–58, against Freddie Blassie in 1962, and against The Destroyer in 1963. In wrestling journalist John M. Molinaro's 2002 book \"Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time\", it is noted that two of Rikidōzan's matches are rated in the top ten television programs of all time in Japan. His October 6, 1957 sixty-minute draw with Lou Thesz for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship drew an 87.0 rating, and his May 24, 1963 sixty-minute two out of three falls draw with The Destroyer drew a 67.0 rating, but a larger viewing audience (the largest in Japanese history) than the previous match, since more people had television sets by 1963.\n\nOn December 8, 1963, while partying in a Tokyo nightclub, Rikidōzan was stabbed with a urine-soaked blade by a man named Katsuji Murata who belonged to the ninkyō dantai (Yakuza) Sumiyoshi-ikka. Reportedly, Rikidōzan threw Murata out of the club and continued to party, refusing to seek medical help. Another report states that Rikidōzan did indeed see his physician shortly after the incident, and was told the wound was not serious. He died a week later of peritonitis on December 15. It was rumored by Masahiko Kimura that his murder was in retaliation for when Rikidōzan attacked Kimura during a wrestling match, after Kimura delivered an errant kick to Rikidōzan's groin, ignoring a pre-match arrangement and attacking Kimura for real.\n\nMurata served seven years in prison for manslaughter. Murata claimed that on December 15 of every year he would call up Rikidōzan’s sons, Mitsuo and Yoshi Momota, apologize and then visit Rikidōzan’s grave.\n\nOne of his sons, Mitsuo Momota, followed his father into the ring in 1970 and still works as a freelancer, but was never able to earn the recognition that once made his father famous, despite winning the World Junior Heavyweight Championship in 1989. Mitsuo's son, Chikara Momota, made his in-ring debut on December 16, 2013, the day after the fiftieth anniversary of the death of his grandfather. Rikidōzan's other son, Yoshihiro Momota, was also a pro wrestler.\n\nRikidōzan's son-in-law, Bak Myeong-cheol (박명철), has been a member of the National Defence Commission of North Korea since around early 2009, while Bak Myeong-cheol's younger sister is the vice secretary of the Light Industry Division of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nRikidōzan posthumously became one of the first members of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996 and he was posthumously inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2006, as well as the \"Legacy Wing\" of the WWE Hall of Fame for the 2017 class. In 2002, Rikidōzan was named the 3rd greatest pro wrestler of all time behind Ric Flair and rival Lou Thesz in the magazine article 100 Wrestlers of All Time by John Molinaro, edited by Dave Meltzer and Jeff Marek.\n\nRikidōzan appeared in 29 films, including:\n\nIn 2004, A South Korean film, \"Rikidōzan\" was made about the life of the wrestler, with Sol Kyung-gu playing the titular role.\n\n\n"}

It was heard in the Appellate Division on 18 September 1961, with judgment handed down on 23 November. Hoexter ACJ, Beyers JA, Van Blerk JA, Rumpff JA and Wessels AJA presided. It is significant for its articulation of the contrast between a mere pecuniary interest on the one hand and an actual legal right on the other:\n\nThe fact that the shareholder is entitled to an \"aliquot\" share in the distribution of the surplus assets when the company is would up proves that he is financially interested in the success or failure of the company but not that he has any right or title to any assets of the company.\n\nThe court found that, in enacting section 166(v) of the Liquor Act, as amended by section 42 of the Liquor Further Amendment Act, the legislature had not intended to use the phrase \"financial interest in a business\" in any restricted sense, such as, for example, in reference to a proprietary interest or a controlling interest. A \"financial interest,\" within the meaning of section 166(v), is acquired, in any business conducted by a company, by a person who acquires shares in that company or in any other company which is by shareholding on its part linked with the former company, either directly or through an intermediate shareholding company or companies.\n\n\"Goldberg v PJ Joubert\" was thus overruled and the decision in the Cape Provincial Division, in \"Distillers Corporation v Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery\", thus confirmed.\n\n\n\n"}

To the Movies is a 2018 American animated superhero fantasy comedy film based on the television series \"Teen Titans Go!\", which is adapted from the DC Comics superhero team of the same name. This film is written and produced by series developers Michael Jelenic and Aaron Horvath, and directed by series producer Peter Rida Michail and Horvath. The events of the film take place during the fifth season of \"Teen Titans Go!\".\n\nThe film features the voices of Greg Cipes, Scott Menville, Khary Payton, Tara Strong and Hynden Walch reprising their respective roles from the series, while Will Arnett (who also produced the film) and Kristen Bell join the cast. It was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on July 27, 2018, by Warner Bros. The film has grossed over $51 million worldwide against a $10 million budget and received positive reviews from critics, with praise toward the cast and humor.\n\nIn Jump City, the Teen Titans arrive to stop the Balloon Man. When he cannot figure out who they are, the Teen Titans jump into a rap song to introduce themselves and become distracted, forcing the Justice League to intervene. They criticize the Titans for being childish, not taking anything seriously, and bring up the fact that they do not have a movie of their own to prove their legitimacy.\n\nWhile at the premiere of \"Batman Again\" after Raven sent the Challengers of the Unknown to another dimension, Robin humiliates himself, after assuming that there will be a movie about him, and is laughed out by the audience. At the rest of the team's suggestion, Robin resolves that in order to get a movie made about him and the Titans, they need an arch-nemesis.\n\nNearby, Slade breaks into S.T.A.R. Labs to steal a crystal. The Titans arrive and attempt to stop him, but he swiftly defeats and insults them. The next day, Beast Boy, Starfire, Cyborg and Raven create a movie to cheer up Robin, but he turns it off prematurely declaring that they will go to Hollywood to have a movie made about them. Upon arriving, they encounter director Jade Wilson, who is responsible for all the superhero movies being made. She turns down the Titans' request to be in a movie, but explains that the only way she would make one about them is if they were the only superheroes in the world. The Titans take her words literally by going back in time to prevent the origins of the other superheroes, but only end up ruining the present, forcing them to go and undo their blunder.\n\nSlade next arrives at Wayne Tech to infuse the crystal's power and the Titans arrive to stop him, this time putting up an actual fight. They secure the crystal, but Slade escapes, resolving to split Robin from his teammates. The next day, Jade invites the Titans back to Hollywood and announces that she will make a movie about them due to their recent fight with Slade. While Robin is given a tour of the premises, Raven, Beast Boy, Starfire and Cyborg venture out and cause mischief. They find a Doomsday Machine that is heavily guarded by the heroes and try to destroy it, but Jade arrives and reveals that D.O.O.M.S.D.A.Y., is just a terrible acronym for a new streaming service for the new movie she is making. She resolves to drop the rest of the Titans from the film and make it solely about Robin, which he happily accepts, much to the consternation of his team, who wish him luck.\n\nRobin finishes making the movie, but during a scene where he interacts with a prop version of the Titan Tower door panel, a light falls and knocks him out. He awakens and finishes the scene where Jade reveals that they are now in the tower for real, and that she is actually Slade himself in disguise. He gets the crystal back, restrains Robin, and tells Robin that his making so many superhero movies was a plan to keep the heroes busy while he invaded their cities to build his D.O.O.M.S.D.A.Y. Device to take over the world. Robin escapes from the shackles with his baby hands, and runs out of the exploding tower. The next morning in the wreckage, Robin calls his friends back, who join him with open arms.\n\nAt the premiere of \"Robin: The Movie\", the Titans arrive and unmask Slade, but Slade unleashes the crystal's power to control the other heroes and sends them after the Titans. Robin goes after Slade while the rest of the team leads off the heroes. However, Slade uses his new power to control Robin, and tells him to attack his friends, who show him the rest of the movie they made for him. Robin comes to his senses. Using one of their songs, the team takes out Slade together, defeating him and his giant robot, which also destroys the crystal, snapping the heroes out of their trance.\n\nThe heroes all congratulate the Titans for their heroic efforts with Robin admitting that he has learned to be himself. When he tries to go on, everyone demands that they cut to the credits immediately with Robin attempting to stall so that \"kids can ask their parents questions.\" Starfire breaks the fourth wall to say to go right to the credits, but Robin stops just before the film ends telling kids to \"ask [their] parents where babies come from.\"\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Teen Titans from the 2003-2006 series show up on a distorted screen telling the viewers that they \"found a way back.\"\n\nIn a post-credits scene, the Challengers of the Unknown are still trapped with their leader postulating that they missed the movie.\n\nOn September 25, 2017, Warner Bros. Pictures announced the film and its release date of July 27, 2018, with the show's cast reprising their roles. A month later, the film's title and teaser poster debuted, and it was announced that Will Arnett and Kristen Bell had joined the cast.\n\nOn March 12, 2018, it was announced that musicians Lil Yachty and Halsey were part of the cast, as Green Lantern and Wonder Woman, respectively, with Nicolas Cage revealed as Superman the same day. Cage himself was originally slated to portray Superman in Tim Burton's canceled Superman film, \"Superman Lives\", in the 1990s. Jimmy Kimmel was announced to voice Batman in the film through an extended cut of the trailer.\n\nThe \"Teen Titans GO! To The Movies\" soundtrack was released on July 20, 2018, approximately one week before the film's release. The soundtrack consists of songs that the cast sing throughout the movie and the musical score composed by Jared Faber.\n\n\nThe film was released in theaters on July 27, 2018, by Warner Bros., followed by a United Kingdom bow a week later. It was released in Australian theaters on September 13, 2018. An early screening was held on June 22 at Vidcon 2018, for both badge members and YouTubers. The film was also shown at the San Diego Comic-Con International on July 20, 2018.

However, after making $4.6 million on its first day (including $1 million from Thursday night previews), estimates were lowered to $10 million, and it ended up debuting to $10.5 million, finishing 5th at the box office.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 110 reviews and an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Teen Titans Go! To the Movies\" distills the enduring appeal of its colorful characters into a charmingly light-hearted adventure whose wacky humor fuels its infectious fun -- and belies a surprising level of intelligence.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nLaura Prudom of IGN gave the film a score of 8.0/10, calling it a \"gleefully unhinged deconstruction of superhero tropes that isn't afraid to take aim at the rest of DC's cinematic roster\". Owen Glieberman of \"Variety\" said \"\"Teen Titans GO!\" is fun in a defiantly super way, and that's a recommendation.\" Frank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote that \"Considering the somberness that afflicts so many DC universe releases, the tongue-in-cheek, albeit admittedly juvenile humor of \"Teen Titans Go! To the Movies\" should come as a welcome relief to fans.\"\n\nDavid Betancourt of \"The Washington Post\" opined, \"\"Teen Titans Go! To the Movies\" is a laugh-a-minute ride that hits you with the jokes from the very first frame. From the cute shots at Marvel Studios to the self-deprecating tone on the state of DC movies, you’ll leave the theater with a new set of superhero abs from laughing so hard.\"\n\nBrandon Katz of \"The New York Observer\" said that the film is \"a fun parody of sorts that gently skewers our superhero obsessed culture, and while there may be one too many gags thrown in there which can get a bit tiresome after awhile, it's an enjoyable movie for both kids and adults.\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com rated the film 3/4 stars, saying \"It's not a film designed to break ground or even offer too much social commentary on the role of superheroes in modern culture. It's built with the primary goal of making you laugh and forget your problems for just under 90 minutes, and it does exactly that.\"\n\nGameSpot's Chris Hayner, while finding fault with what he deemed excessive toilet humor and some dragging in the film, said that \"In a superhero movie landscape where the world is constantly being destroyed by massive CGI abominations, this is a refreshing change... it doesn't forget how funny and exciting these types of movies can be.\"\n\n"}

He was educated at a private boarding school at Buckhurst Hill in Essex, and matriculated with honours at London University in 1848.\n\nBrushfield studied medicine and surgery at London Hospital, which he entered in 1845, and won three gold medals besides other honours. He became member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1850 and graduated M.D. at St Andrews University in 1862. After serving as house surgeon at the London Hospital he joined Dr. John Millar at Bethnal House Asylum, London.\n\nIn 1852 Brushfield was appointed house surgeon to Chester County Lunatic Asylum, and was first resident medical superintendent from 1854 until 1865. In 1865 he was appointed medical superintendent of the then planned Surrey County Asylum at Brookwood. The buildings there were planned in accordance with his suggestions, and later on he helped to design the Cottage Hospital there. Brushfield was a pioneer of the non-restraint treatment of lunatics, and he sought to lighten the patients' life in asylums by making the wards cheerful and by organising entertainments. He retired on a pension in 1882.\n\nOn his retirement Brushfield settled at Budleigh Salterton, living in a Georgian house known as The Cliff, Cliff Road in Budleigh Salterton on the east Devon coast, near Hayes Barton, the birthplace of Sir Walter Ralegh. Brushfield made the career of Ralegh his main study for the rest of his life. He became a member of the Devonshire Association in 1882, was elected to the council in 1883, and was president in 1893–4.\n\nBrushfield was a freemason, was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1899 and was a founder of the Devon and Cornwall Record Society. He was a popular lecturer in the West Country. He died at Budleigh Salterton on 28 November 1910, and was buried there.\n\nBrushfield's lantern slides went to the Exeter Public Library, with some of the major Ralegh items from his library. The rest of his library of about 10,000 volumes and manuscripts was dispersed after his death. As reader for the \"New English Dictionary\", he contributed over 72,000 slips.\n\nBrushfield's contribution to the literature of lunacy included \"Medical Certificates of Insanity\" (\"The Lancet\", 1880) and \"Practical Hints on the Symptoms, Treatment and Medico-Legal Aspects of Insanity\", read before the Chester Medical Society in 1890. A paper, 'Notes on the Ralegh Family,' which he read before the 1883 meeting of the Devonshire Association, began a series of papers \"Raleghana\", research into Walter Ralegh's life and literary work, which were published in the Association's \"Transactions\" between 1896 and 1907. \"Ralegh Miscellanea\" (pts. i. and ii.) followed in 1909-10. He contributed other papers on similar themes to other journals. A bibliography of Ralegh, which was published in book form in 1886 (2nd edition 1908), first appeared serially in the \"Western Antiquary\", vol. 5, 1885–6.\n\nBrushfield married, on 5 August 1852, Hannah, daughter of John Davis of London, who survived him with three sons and three daughters.

The \"USP\" is published in a combined volume with the \"National Formulary\" (a formulary) as the USP-NF. If a drug ingredient or drug product has an applicable \"USP\" quality standard (in the form of a \"USP-NF\" monograph), it must conform in order to use the designation \"USP\" or \"NF\". Drugs subject to \"USP\" standards include both human drugs (prescription, over-the-counter, or otherwise) and animal drugs. \"USP-NF\" standards also have a role in U.S. federal law; a drug or drug ingredient with a name recognized in \"USP-NF\" is considered adulterated if it does not satisfy compendial standards for strength, quality or purity. USP also sets standards for dietary supplements and food ingredients (as part of the \"Food Chemicals Codex\"). USP has no role in enforcing its standards; enforcement is the responsibility of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other government authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\n\"USP\" establishes written (documentary) and physical (reference) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products, and ingredients. These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency.\n\nPrescription and over-the-counter medicines available in the United States must, by federal law, meet \"USP-NF\" public standards, where such standards exist. Many other countries use the \"USP-NF\" instead of issuing their own pharmacopeia, or to supplement their government pharmacopeia.\n\nUSP's standards for food ingredients can be found in its \"Food Chemicals Codex\" (\"FCC\"). The \"FCC\" is a compendium of standards used internationally for the quality and purity of food ingredients like preservatives, flavorings, colorings and nutrients. While the \"FCC\" is recognized in law in countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand, it currently does not have statutory recognition in the United States, although \"FCC\" standards are incorporated by reference in over 200 FDA food regulations. USP obtained the \"FCC\" from the Institute of Medicine in 2006. The IOM had published the first five editions of the \"FCC\".\n\nUSP also conducts verification programs for dietary supplement products and ingredients. These are testing and audit programs. Products that meet the requirements of the program can display the USP Verified Dietary Supplement Mark on their labels. This is different from seeing the letters \"USP\" alone on a dietary supplement label, which means that the manufacturer is claiming to adhere to USP standards. \"USP\" does not test such products as it does with USP Verified products.\n\nIn the past, Congress authorized the Secretary of HHS to request USP to develop a drug classification system that Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit plans may use to develop their formularies, and to revise such classification from time to time to reflect changes in therapeutic uses covered by Part D drugs and the addition of new covered Part D drugs. USP has developed six versions of the Model Guidelines, the last issued early in 2014 for the 2015–2017 benefit years.\n\nSince 1992, USP has worked cooperatively with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to help developing countries address critical issues related to poor quality medicines. This partnership operated as the Drug Quality and Information (DQI) program until 2009, when, to better meet growing global needs, USAID awarded USP a five-year, $35 million cooperative agreement to establish a new, expanded program: Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM). In 2013 USAID extended the PQM program for five years (through September 2019), increased its funding to $110 million, and expanded the geographical reach of the program.\n\nPQM serves as a primary mechanism to help USAID-supported countries strengthen their quality assurance and quality control systems to better ensure the quality of medicines that reach patients. PQM has four key objectives:\n\nUSP-USAID collaborative efforts have helped communities improve drug quality in more than 35 countries. PQM currently works in Africa, Asia, Europe/Eurasia, and the Caribbean/Latin America.\n\nUSP works internationally, largely through agreements with other pharmacopeias, as well as regulatory bodies, manufacturer associations and others. In recent years, USP signed a series of Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with groups including the Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, nine countries belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Federal Service on Surveillance in Healthcare and Social Development of the Russian Federation (Roszdravnadzor). USP also operates an international office in Switzerland, and offices and laboratories in Brazil, India and China. In November 2014, a delegation from Global LifeSci Development Corporation, as part of Montgomery County's business visit to India visited US Pharmacopeial Convention at IKP Knowledge Park at Hyderabad in India.\n\n"}
{"id": "473985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=473985", "title": "White Aryan Resistance", "text": "White Aryan Resistance\n\nWhite Aryan Resistance (WAR) is a white supremacist neo-Nazi organization in the United States founded and led by former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon Tom Metzger. It is based in Warsaw, Indiana, and is incorporated as a business.\n\nIt holds views that are self-described as racist, as seen in its website sections \"Racist Jokes\" and \"Racist Videos,\" and in the tagline for its newspaper \"The Insurgent\": \"the most racist newspaper on earth.\" WAR uses the slogan \"White Revolution is the Only Solution\".\n\nMetzger's first group was known as the White Brotherhood, which he led in the mid-1970s until joining David Duke's Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1975. By 1979 he had risen to Grand Dragon of the California realm. During these years the California realm conducted unauthorized border patrols at the Mexican border and kept a blackshirted security detail that would engage in skirmishes with anti-Klan demonstrators and police. One incident in Oceanside, California, in the spring of 1980, involved 30 members of this squad and left seven people injured. In the summer of 1980 Metzger left the national organization and founded his own California Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The group continued to harass Hispanics and Vietnamese refugees.\n\nFrom 1980 to late 1982, Metzger headed the California Knights, while also pursuing various electoral offices. In 1982 he left the Klan to found a new group, the White American Political Association, a group dedicated to promoting \"prowhite\" candidates for office. After losing the 1982 California Senate Democratic primary, Metzger abandoned the electoral route and reorganized WAPA as White American Resistance in 1983 and then to White Aryan Resistance, to reflect a more \"revolutionary\" stance.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Tom Metzger began \"Race and Reason\", a public-access cable television show, airing WAR propaganda and interviewing other neo-Nazis. The show caused much controversy, and its guests included anti-abortion speakers, Holocaust deniers and pro-segregation lawyers. WAR members gained attention through appearances on talk shows throughout the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1988 Metzger, recorded this message on his \"WAR HOTLINE\",\n\nYou have reached WAR Hotline. White Aryan Resistance. You ask: What is WAR? We are an openly white-racist movement—Skinheads, we welcome you into our ranks___The federal government is the number one enemy of our race. When was the last time you heard a politician speaking out in favor of white people? ... You say the government is too big; we can't organize. Well, by God, the SS did it in Germany, and if they did it in Germany in the thirties, we can do it right here in the streets of America_We need to cleanse this nation of all nonwhite mud-races for the survival of our own people and the generations of our children.\n\nOn November 13, 1988, three white Aryan supremacists who were members of East Side White Pride, which allegedly had ties to WAR, beat to death Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian man who had moved to the United States to attend college. In October 1990, the Southern Poverty Law Center won a civil case on behalf of the deceased's family against Tom and John Metzger, for a total of US$12.5 million. The SPLC did not charge for their work, and the Seraw family did not share any money won with the SPLC. The Metzgers did not have millions of dollars, so the Seraw family only received assets from the Metzger's $125,000 house and a few thousand dollars. The Metzgers declared bankruptcy, but WAR continued to operate. WAR continued to publish a newspaper despite the verdict. Metzger launched a website in 1997 and had an Internet radio program. The cost of trial, in the hundreds of thousands of dollars was absorbed by the SPLC and the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nWAR has been associated with dangerous individuals throughout its existence. WAR was mentioned in the press when it was revealed that a member threatened video stores in Rhode Island which carried \"Jungle Fever\". In 1994, Richard Campos, a WAR sympathizer, was convicted of racially motivated bombing plots. Calls were made stating that the bombings were perpetrated by an organization called the \"Aryan Liberation Front\", of which Campos was the only member. In early 1995, Campos was sentenced to the maximum term of 17 years in prison.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53969045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53969045", "title": "White Racial Identity Development", "text": "White Racial Identity Development\n\nThe White Racial Identity Model was developed by psychologist Janet Helms in 1990. It is a racial and ethnic identity model created specifically for people who identify as White. This theory, heavily influenced by William Cross, has become a widely referenced and studied theory on white racial identity development. This model was created “to raise the awareness of White people about their role in creating and maintaining a racist society, and the need for them to act responsibly by dismantling systemic racism through a framework of power and privilege,”. In addition, Helms presented the idea that all people have a racial identity in some way that is influenced by power and privilege.\n\nThe White Racial Identity Model is broken into five stages, split into two groups: Abandonment of Racism and the Evolution of a non-racist identity. White individuals transition from understanding themselves as racial beings and the privilege associated with being White, to taking ownership of and abandoning racial privilege, and finally learning about other racial groups.\n\nIn phase one, the abandonment of racism, White identifying individuals have no consciousness of their race and privilege until they are met with a disruption related to race. This disruption then challenges the individual’s ideas of whiteness and how they play a role in a racist society. Following this encounter, the individual then begins to understand the salience of race and its relevance to power. In this stage, a person moves through three other sub-stages: Contact, Disintegration, and Reintegration.\n\nOnce an individual has experienced phase one, they move to phase two, the evolution of a non-racist identity, where they begin to reflect more seriously on their identity and how they interact with their surroundings. They begin to make more efforts to interact and learn from different racial groups. Helms wrote that people in this phase are working to “be White without also being bad, evil, or racist”. The stages a person moves through in this phase includes Pseudo-independence, Immersion/Emersion, and Autonomy.\n\nThe White Racial Identity Model has been measured using the White Racial Identity Attitudes Scale (WRIAS) developed originally in 1990 by Helms and Carter. Helms has said that this scale can be used to quantify the “multidimensional aspect” of the identity statues. Although this scale has been critiqued, it has been replicated in several studies and the scales in this measure are highly correlated in measuring this construct. Helms and Cook, however, recommend using qualitative analysis in conjunction with the WRIAS to develop a racial profile for these individuals.\n\nOne of the main critiques of this model is that it is outdated and not as applicable as it once was. The theory was created in 1990 and revised in 1995. Although it has been updated, there are many other white identity development and consciousness models that have been adapted from this that some researchers and practitioners see as more relevant. Row, Bennett, and Atkinson created their own theory in response to concerns they had with Helm’s model. These critiques included the singular focus on blacks and the white-black relationship, the developmental stage focus of the model, and the similarities to ethnic identity models. They created the White Racial Consciousness Theory to address these concerns.\n\n"}

Tatham (1838) is a famous Exchequer Court decision on the use of hearsay within a trial. The case was further one of the main inspirations for Dickens' Bleak House. The decision was later upheld by the House of Lords in \"R v Kearly\" (1992).\n\nTatham was the claimant and heir to the fortune of the deceased. The will, however, had devised a portion of the property to Wright, a former servant. The main issue was whether the deceased had the required testamentary capacity when he wrote his will. Three letters written to the testator were submitted as circumstantial evidence that the author believed the testator was of sound mind and the issue was whether these letters could be admitted as evidence to prove competence or whether they constituted hearsay. Wright had argued that the letters were admissible because they showed that the testator was seen and treated as a competent in the eyes of those who knew him. Tatham argued that they were inadmissible and so would have to sworn under oath before they could be admissible.\n\nThe House of Lords held that the letters were inadmissible as hearsay because the letters implied the statement \"Marsden was of sound mind.\"\n\nThe case appears in numerous treatises and evidence text books because of the difficult hearsay issue it raised. Baron Parke held that conduct consistent with a belief in a fact is hearsay when offered to prove the existence of that fact. The approach taken by Federal Rules of Evidence 801(a) does not yield the same result, as it requires that there be an intention to assert, which was absent from the \"statement\" in Wright v. Doe d. Tatham.\n"}
