Assignment of accession numbers typically occurs at the point of accessioning or cataloging. The term is something of a misnomer, because the form accession numbers take is often alpha-numeric.\n\nIf an item is removed from the collection, its number is usually not reused for new items.\n\nIn libraries, this numbering system is usually in addition to the library classification number (or alphanumeric code) and to the ISBN or International Standard Book Number assigned by publishers.\n\nAccession numbers are also used in botany, by institutions with living collections like arboreta, botanic gardens, etc., to identify plants or groups of plants that are of the same taxon, are of the same propagule type (or treatment), were received from the same source, were received at the same time. Herbaria and other botanic institutions collecting non living material also use accession numbers.\n\nAn accession number may include the year acquired, sometimes the full date (as at the British Museum), and a sequential number separated by a period. In addition, departments or art classifications within the collection or museum may reserve sections of numbers. For example, objects identified by the numbers 11.000 through 11.999 may indicate objects obtained by the museum in 1911; the first 300 numbers might be used to indicate American art, while the next fifty (11.301–350) might be used for African art. In some cases, they also include letters and other punctuation, such as commas, hyphens or slashes.\n\nIn older institutions, simpler numbering systems are sometimes maintained alongside, or incorporated within, newer systems. Where the objects are unique, institutions normally need to retain the original number in some form as it will have been used in old references that are still of use in scholarship. In particular, collections of manuscripts use the prefix \"MS\", and many well known manuscripts are known by their old MS numbers, often incorporating a prefix for a particular collection within a library. These collections may be divided by former owners, as with several British Library , or by language, as with Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF MS Fr. 2643-6), indicating a two volume manuscript in French at the .\n\n"}

{"id": "1546513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1546513", "title": "Atlantic blue marlin", "text": "Atlantic blue marlin\n\nThe Atlantic blue marlin (\"Makaira nigricans\") is a species of marlin endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. It is closely related to, and usually considered conspecific with, the Indo-Pacific blue marlin, then simply called blue marlin. Some authorities still consider both species distinct.\n\nThe Atlantic blue marlin (hereafter, blue marlin) feeds on a wide variety of organisms near the surface. It uses its bill to stun, injure, or kill while knifing through a school of fish or other prey, then returns to eat the injured or stunned fish. Marlin is a popular game fish. The relatively high fat content of its meat makes it commercially valuable in certain markets. It is the national fish of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and is featured on its coat of arms.\n\nBlue marlin are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. A bluewater fish that spends the majority of its life in the open sea far from land, the blue marlin preys on a wide variety of marine organisms, mostly near the surface, often using its bill to stun or injure its prey.\n\nFemales can grow up to four times the weight of males. The maximum published weight is and length .\n\nAdult blue marlin have few predators apart from killer whales, sharks, and humans. They are sought after as a highly prized game fish by anglers and are taken by commercial fishermen, both as a directed catch and as bycatch in major industrial tuna fisheries. Blue marlin are currently considered a threatened species by the IUCN due to overfishing , particularly in the international waters off the coast of Portugal where they migrate to breed in the June/July months.\n\nSome other historic English names for the blue marlin are Cuban black marlin, ocean gar, and ocean guard.\n\nThe blue marlin is placed in the genus \"Makaira\". This name is derived from the Greek word \"machaira\", meaning \"a short sword or bent dagger\", and the Latin \"machaera\", \"sword\".\nThe specific epithet \"nigricans\" is Latin for \"becoming black\".\nThe blue marlin is part of the billfish family Istiophoridae and is in the perch-like order Perciformes. In addition, it is in the suborder Xiphioidei and is a member of the subclass Neopterygii, which means \"new wings\". It is also in the class of Actinopterygii, which includes ray-finned fishes and spiny-rayed fishes, and the superclass Osteichthyes, which includes all of the bony fishes.\n\nThe classification of the Atlantic blue marlin (\"M. nigricans\") and the Indo-Pacific blue marlin (\"M. mazara\") as separate species is under debate. Genetic data suggest, although the two groups are isolated from each other, they are both the same species, with the only genetic exchange occurring when Indo-Pacific blue marlin migrate to and contribute genes to the Atlantic population. A separate study by V. P. Buonaccorsi, J. R. Mcdowell, and Graves indicated that both Indo-Pacific and Atlantic show \"striking phylogeographic partitioning\" of mitochondrial and microsatellite loci.\n\nSynonyms of \"M. nigricans\" are:\n\nThe biggest females are more than four times as heavy as the biggest males, which rarely exceed in weight. The longest females can reach a length of with the bill, from eye to tip, constituting about 20% of the total body length.\n\nBody mass in the largest female specimens has been reported from , depending on the source (few large specimens are scientifically verified). The largest blue marlin caught by IGFA angling rules is from Vitoria, Brazil, which weighed .; fishermen often refer to individual marlins that reach or exceed 1,000 pounds as \"granders\".\n\nBoth sexes have 24 vertebrae, of which 11 are precaudal and 13 are caudal.\n\nThe marlin has two dorsal fins and two anal fins. The fins are supported by bony spines known as rays. Its first dorsal fin has 39 to 43 rays from front to back. Its second dorsal fin has six or seven rays. Its first anal fin, which is similar in shape and size to the second dorsal fin, has 13 to 16 rays, and the second anal fin has six or seven rays. The pectoral fins, which have 19 to 22 rays, are long and narrow and can be drawn in to the sides of the body. The pelvic fins are shorter than the pectorals, have a poorly developed membrane, and are depressible into ventral grooves. Its first anal fin, along with its pectoral and caudal fins, can be folded into grooves. This streamlines the fish and thereby reduces drag.\n\nBlue marlin, like other billfish, can rapidly change color, an effect created by pigment-containing iridophores and light-reflecting skin cells.\n\nMost often, however, the body is blue-black on top with a silvery white underside. It has about 15 rows of pale, cobalt-colored stripes, each of which has round dots and/or thin bars, located on both sides of the fish. The first dorsal fin membrane is dark blue or almost black and has no dots or marks. Other fins are normally brownish-black, sometimes with a hint of dark blue. The bases of the first and second anal fins have a hint of silvery white.\n\nThe body is covered with thick, bony, elongated scales that have one, two, or three posterior points, with one being the most common form.\n\nThe bill is long and stout. Both the jaws and the palatines (the roof of the mouth) are covered with small, file-like teeth. The lateral line system is a group of neuromasts rooted in lateral line canals that can sense weak water motions and large changes in pressure. It has the appearance of a net. It is obvious in immature specimens but unclear in adults, becoming progressively embedded in the skin. The anus is just in front of the origin of the first anal fin.\n\nBlue marlin are found year-round in tropical oceanic waters of the Atlantic. The range expands into temperate waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres during the warmer months and contracts towards the Equator during colder months. Warm currents such as the Gulf Stream in the western Atlantic have a major influence on their seasonal distribution.\n\nThe blue marlin's latitudinal range extends from about 45°N to about 35°S. It is less abundant in the eastern Atlantic, where it mostly occurs off Africa between the latitudes of 25°N and 25°S. The largest numbers are usually found in waters warmer than 24 °C (75 °F), but blue marlin have been found at surface water temperatures as high as 30.5 °C (86.9 °F) and as low as 21.7 °C (71.1 °F).\n\nTagging studies, using conventional \"spaghetti\" tags, and more recently pop-up satellite tags, have given researchers a glimpse into blue marlin migration patterns and habits. Recaptures of tagged fish have shown multiple movements between the Caribbean Islands and Venezuela and the Bahamas, as well as between the Caribbean Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and West Africa, and interocean travel. Most notably, a blue marlin tagged off the coast of Delaware was recovered near the island of Mauritius off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean – a voyage of 9,254 miles. Several fish have been recaptured in the same general area where they were tagged, implying reverse migration after/over several years, but the data are insufficient to accurately determine seasonality.\n\nOnce blue marlin reach maturity, they have few predators, with the most important probably being large pelagic sharks such as the shortfin mako and great white shark.\n\nBlue marlin have many parasites, including from these groups: Digenea (flukes), Didymozoidea (tissue flukes), Monogenea (gillworms), Cestoda (tapeworms), Nematoda (roundworms), Acanthocephala (spiny-headed worms), copepods, barnacles, and cookiecutter sharks.\n\nGrowth and maturity\n\nAtlantic blue marlin reach sexual maturity at the age of two to four years. Males reach sexual maturity at a weight of and females at .\nBlue marlin breed in late summer and fall. Females may spawn as many as four times in one season. They often release over seven million eggs at once, each about in diameter. Few reach sexual maturity. The planktonic young drift freely in the ocean's pelagic zone. Larvae inhabit the west central Atlantic off Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Jamaica, Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, and also the southwest Atlantic off Brazil.\nThe larvae may grow as much as in a day. On their sides and dorsal surfaces, they are blue-black in color, while ventrally they are white. Both the caudal fin and the caudal peduncle (the narrow part of the fish's body to which the caudal or tail fin is attached) are clear. Two iridescent blue patches occur on the head, and some individuals have darker spots on their backs. In adolescents, the first dorsal fin is large and concave, gradually reducing in proportion to body size with continued growth. Males may live for 18 years, and females up to 27.\n\nDiet and feeding\n\nThe larvae feed upon a variety of zooplankton along with drifting fish eggs and other larvae. They progress to feeding on a wide range of fishes, particularly scombrids, such as mackerel and tuna, squid, and especially near oceanic islands and coral reefs, on juvenile inshore fish. Studies of stomach contents have found that smaller schooling scombrids such as frigate mackerel, bullet tuna, and skipjack tuna make up a substantial proportion of their diet. Squid and deep-sea fishes such as pomfret and snake mackerel are also important prey items in certain areas. Blue marlin have been recorded to take prey as large as white marlin, as well as yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the 100-lb range. Conversely, they are also capable of feeding on small but numerous prey such as filefish and snipefish.\n\nScientists and fishermen have long debated the extent to which blue marlin and other billfish use their elongated upper jaw in feeding. A 2007 Japanese study of stomach contents of fish captured in a commercial trolling fishery found that 130 undigested prey items obtained from 227 blue marlin had spearing, slashing, and other injuries that were judged to have been inflicted by the bill.\n\nBioaccumulation\n\nHeavy metals have been known to accumulate in the Atlantic blue marlin, a process known as bioaccumulation. In 2017, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department issued a consumption advisory for all blue marlin caught along the coast of Texas based on the presence of mercury.\n\nMarlin has commercial value throughout the world, with landings totalling 3,064 metric tons in 2000. It is particularly valued in Japan for sashimi. Blue marlin meat is sometimes smoked and sold by roadside vendors.\n\nBlue marlin are often caught as bycatch in tuna longline fisheries.\n\nSport fishermen first encountered blue marlin in the Bahamas in the 1920s and early 1930s, when pioneering big-game fishermen such as Van Campen Heilner and S. Kip Farrington began exploring the waters offshore of Bimini and Cat Cay. Since then, blue marlin have been renowned as one of the world's greatest game fishes. The sportfishing pursuit of marlin and other billfish has developed into a multimillion dollar industry that includes hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs for boat operators, boat builders, marinas, dealerships, and fishing tackle manufacturers and dealers.\n\nThe most established sport fisheries for blue marlin are found along the eastern seaboard and the Gulf Coast of the United States, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and several other Caribbean islands (notably St Thomas and Puerto Rico). Recreational fishing for blue marlin also takes place in Hawaii, Brazil, Venezuela, and the Atlantic coast of Mexico, particularly the Yucatan peninsula. In the eastern Atlantic, blue marlin sport fisheries exist from the Algarve coast of Portugal in the north to Angola in the south and include the islands of the Azores, Canaries, Cape Verde, Madeira, and Ascension Island.\n\nThe International Game Fish Association all-tackle world record for blue marlin currently stands at 1,402 lb 2 oz (636 kg). This fish was captured in Vitoria, Brazil.\n\nThe blue marlin is under intense pressure from longline fishing. In the Caribbean region alone, Japanese and Cuban fishermen annually take over a thousand tons. All vessels within of the U.S. coastline are required to release any billfish caught. However, the survival rate of released fish is low because of damage during capture.\n\n\"Makaira nigricans\" is listed as a threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the blue marlin to its seafood red list. \n\nSport fishermen have been at the forefront of efforts to conserve blue marlin populations. The initial efforts to develop electronic tags for tracking highly migratory fish were carried out on marlin in Hawaii, in collaboration with anglers in the Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament.\n\nBoth Zane Grey and Ernest Hemingway, who fished for blue marlin off the Florida Keys, the Bahamas, and most famously in Cuba, wrote extensively about their pursuit.\n\nIn Hemingway's novella \"The Old Man and the Sea\", a fisherman named Santiago battles a blue marlin for three days off the coast of Cuba.\n\n"}

It commemorated the centenary of the outbreak of World War I and consisted of 888,246 ceramic red poppies, each intended to represent one British or Colonial serviceman killed in the War. The ceramic artist was Paul Cummins, with conceptual design by the stage designer Tom Piper. The work's title was taken from the first line of a poem by an unknown soldier in World War I.\n\nThe work's title came from a poem discovered by Cummins and was used by Piper as the inspiration for his conceptual design. It was written by an unknown World War I soldier from Derbyshire, who joined up in the early days of the war and died in at the Front of the First World War. The poem begins: \"The blood swept lands and seas of red,/ Where angels dare to tread / ... \". The poem was contained in the soldier's unsigned will, found by Cummins among old records in Chesterfield, Derbyshire.\n\nThe work was created by Paul Cummins Ceramics in conjunction with Historic Royal Palaces to be displayed in the moat of the Tower of London, which was used in the early days of the war as a training ground for City of London workers who had enlisted to fight – the \"Stockbrokers' Battalion\".\n\nThe work consisted of a sea of ceramic red poppies, in a design which appeared to flow out of the Tower itself and ripple across the moat. There were a series of designed elements which added drama, height and movement to the installation: the \"Weeping Window\" flowing out of a window in Legge's Mount in the West Moat, (which became the iconic image), \"Over the Top\", a cascade of poppies down the wall on the wharf side of the moat and the \"Wave\", a free-standing twisted metal sculpture covered in poppies which curled over the main causeway into the Tower. \n\nThe ceramic poppies were individually hand-made at Cummins's ceramics works in Derbyshire and at Johnson Tiles in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent. The poppies were added to the installation progressively by volunteers. The 497,000 kg of the Etruria Marl-based Etruscan red earthenware used, as well as the majority of the manufacturing equipment and materials, were supplied by Potclays Limited in Stoke-on-Trent. There were eventually 888,246 of the flowers, representing one count of the number of British and Colonial military fatalities in World War I.\nThe first poppy was planted on 17 July 2014, and the work was unveiled on 5 August (the centenary of Britain's entry into the war). A team of about 17,500 volunteers put the poppies in place, overseen by Piper and YW Jim Duncan, making this a true public artwork. The last one was planted on 11 November 2014 (Remembrance Day), by a 13-year-old cadet, Harry Hayes, from the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) of Reading Blue Coat School. After that day a team of about 8,000 volunteers began removing the flowers. Members of the public had been able to pre-order the ceramic poppies for £25 each, with a share of the proceeds (estimated at more than £15 million) going to six service charities: COBSEO, Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion and SSAFA.\n\nAt around sunset each day between 1 September and 10 November, the names of 180 World War I service personnel, nominated by members of the public to appear on a Roll of Honour, were read aloud by a Yeoman Warder or guest reader, followed by the \"Last Post\" bugle call.\n\nThe installation was visited by the Princes William and Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge on the day of its opening, and by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on 16 October. The Queen later spoke about the memorial in her annual Christmas Message, broadcast on 25 December 2014.\n\nIn all, an estimated 5 million people saw the installation, and the huge visitor demand saw the Prime Minister David Cameron and other politicians join calls to try and extend the period for which the installation remained at the Tower so that more visitors would be able to pay their respects. Historic Royal Palaces and the artist Paul Cummins resisted such calls, stating that the transience of the installation was a key part of the artistic concept, and that the poppies would be removed as planned and distributed to their purchasers. On 8 November it was announced that \"Wave\", which rose up over the Tower's entrance, would remain in place until the end of the month and that following this, the sculptures \"Wave\" and \"Weeping Window\" would be taken on a tour of the UK, organised by 14-18 NOW. This tour would last until the centenary of the armistice of World War I in November of 2018 and visit 19 locations; after the tour the sculptures would enter the Imperial War Museum's collection. A campaign was launched in December 2014 to bring the sculptural elements to Stoke-on-Trent during the tour itinerary as the majority of materials and much of the piece itself were manufactured in the city. In April 2016, about halfway through the tour, \"Weeping Windows\" was installed at St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, Orkney, Britain's most northerly cathedral, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Jutland, the biggest naval engagement of the First World War.\n\nIn recognition of the work, Paul Cummins and Tom Piper were both awarded the MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2015 New Year Honours.\n\nAlthough the installation struck a chord with the public, it received negative reactions from some critics in the press. A. A. Gill of \"The Sunday Times\" called it \"impressive\" but \"curiously bland\". \"The Guardian's\" art critic Jonathan Jones described it as having a \"false nobility\" and being a \"prettified and toothless\" memorial. Tom Piper said in response that \"... it is a remarkably good thing that it is so accessible. We should not be trying to create something that is difficult to understand.\"\n\nIn November 2014, it was announced that two sculptures from the installation, \"Wave\" and \"Weeping Window\", would tour venues around the UK until 2018. This was organised by 14-18 NOW. The scheduled venues were as follows: \n\nAfter the end of the UK-wide 14-18 NOW tour \"Wave\" and \"Weeping Window\" will enter the Imperial War Museum's collection.\n\nA similar tribute also designed by Piper, \"Beyond the Deepening Shadow\", in which 10,000 flames were lit, again at the Tower of London, was installed to mark the centenary of the end of the war. It ran nightly, ending on Armistice Day (11 November) 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5047122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5047122", "title": "Bode Museum", "text": "Bode Museum\n\nThe Bode Museee is one of the group of museums on the Museum Island in Berlin, Germany. It was designed by architect Ernst von Ihne and completed in 1904. Originally called the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum after Emperor Frederick III, the museum was renamed in honour of its first curator, Wilhelm von Bode, in 1956.\n\nClosed for repairs since 1997, the museum was reopened on October 18, 2006 after a €156 million refurbishment. True to the ethos of its founding director, Wilhelm von Bode, who believed in mixing art collections, it is now the home for a collection of sculptures, Byzantine art, and coins and medals. The presentation of the collections is both geographic and chronological, with the Byzantine and Gothic art of northern and southern Europe displayed separately on the museum’s first floor and a similar regional division of Renaissance and Baroque art on its second floor.\n\nThe sculpture collection shows art of the Christian Orient (with an emphasis on Coptic Egypt), sculptures from Byzantium and Ravenna, sculptures of the Middle Ages, the Italian Gothic, and the early Renaissance. Late German Gothic works are also represented by Tilman Riemenschneider, the south German Renaissance, and Prussian Baroque art up to the 18th century. In the future selected works of the Gemäldegalerie will be integrated into the sculpture collection. This is reminiscent of William von Bode's concept of \"style rooms\", in which sculptures, paintings, and crafts are viewed together, as was usual in upper middle-class private collections.\n\nThe \"Münzkabinett\" (\"coin cabinet\") is one of the world's largest numismatic collections. Its range spans from the beginning of minting in the 7th century BC in Asia Minor up to the present day. With approximately 500,000 items the collection is a unique archive for historical research, while its medal collection makes it an important art exhibition at the same time.\n\nWriting in \"The Financial Times\" on the occasion on the museum's reopening in 2006, Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, hailed “the most comprehensive display of European sculpture anywhere.” He added: “It is no exaggeration to say that in the new Bode Museum, Europe will be able for the first time to read its history — aesthetic and religious, intellectual and political — in a three-dimensional form.”\n\nIn 1910, it was revealed that a bust of \"Flora\", which had been purchased by the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin, under the belief that it was by Leonardo da Vinci, may have actually been created by the English sculptor, Richard Cockle Lucas. Wilhelm von Bode, the general manager of the Prussian Art Collections for the Berlin Museum, had spotted the bust in a London gallery and purchased it for a few pounds. Bode was convinced that the bust was by Leonardo and the Berlin Museum authorities, and the German public, were delighted to have \"snatched a great art treasure from under the very noses\" of the British art world.\n\nShortly afterwards, \"The Times\" ran an article claiming that the bust was the work of Lucas, having been commissioned to produce it from a painting. Lucas's son, Albert, then came forward and swore under oath that the story was correct and that he had helped his father to make it. Albert was able to explain how the layers of wax had been built up from old candle ends; he also described how his father would stuff various debris, including newspapers, inside the bust. When the Berlin museum staff removed the base they found the debris, just as Albert had described it, including a letter dated in the 1840s.\n\nDespite this evidence, Bode continued to claim that his original attribution was correct. To support this, he displayed the Flora bust among a selection of Lucas's lesser work – this exhibition rather backfired, however, as it showed that Lucas had been regularly making wax sculptures inspired by the great works of previous times.\n\nVarious claims and counter-claims have been put forward about the bust, from its being an outright forgery to being a genuine 16th-century piece (albeit not by Leonardo). Scientific examination has been inconclusive and unhelpful in dating the bust, although it is accepted as having at least some connection with Lucas. The bust remains on display in what is now the Bode Museum labelled \"England\", \"19th Century\" with a question mark.\n\nOn 27 March 2017, a solid gold coin called the Big Maple Leaf, issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2007 as a commemorative piece, was stolen from the museum. The coin, at 53 cm in diameter and 3 cm in thickness, is made of 24-carat gold and is worth around €3.7 million. A ladder was found on the train tracks nearby, leading German police to speculate that the thief entered the building by breaking open a window in the back of the museum next to the railway tracks.\n\nThe museum appears as a playable level in the World War II video game \"Sniper Elite V2\".\n\n\n"}

There, he held the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship (WWWF Heavyweight Championship during his second reign) for more than 11 years (4,040 days) across two reigns, the first of which is the longest single reign in the promotion's history at 2,803 days.\n\nCalled \"The Italian Strongman\" and \"The Strongest Man in the World\" early in his career, Sammartino earned the title \"The Living Legend\" during his lifetime. Known for his powerful bearhug finishing move, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.\n\nBruno Leopoldo Francesco Sammartino was born in Pizzoferrato, Abruzzo, Italy, to Alfonso and Emilia Sammartino on October 6, 1935. He was the youngest of seven children, four of whom died during his early childhood. When he was four, his father immigrated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During World War II, his mother hid Bruno and his siblings from German soldiers in a mountain called Valla Rocca. During this time, his mother would sneak into their German-occupied town for food and supplies. In 1950\n\nWhen the Sammartinos arrived in the U.S. Bruno spoke no English and was sickly from the privations of the war years. This made him an easy target for bullies at Schenley High School. He turned to weightlifting and wrestling to build himself up. His devotion to weightlifting nearly resulted in a berth on the 1956 U.S. Olympic team, which went instead to eventual gold medalist Paul Anderson.\n\nIn 1959, Sammartino set a world record in the bench press with a lift of 565 pounds, done without elbow or wrist wraps. When he brought the bar down, he did not bounce it off his chest, but set it there for two seconds before attempting the press. He trained in wrestling with Rex Peery, the University of Pittsburgh team coach.\n\nHe also became known for performing strongman stunts in the Pittsburgh area, and sportscaster Bob Prince put him on his television show. It was there that he was spotted by local professional wrestling promoter Rudy Miller, who recruited the young man into the ring.\n\nSammartino made his professional debut in Pittsburgh on December 17, 1959, pinning Dmitri Grabowski in 19 seconds. Sammartino's first match in Madison Square Garden in New York City was on January 2, 1960, defeating Bull Curry in five minutes.\nFeeling like he was being held back in the New York territory in favor of National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) star Buddy Rogers, Sammartino gave his notice to Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) owner Vince McMahon Sr. and planned to go to San Francisco to work for Roy Shire. While on his way to California, he missed two bookings in Baltimore and Chicago, and as a result was suspended in those territories. California honored the other state's suspension, leaving Sammartino out of work. In his autobiography, Sammartino states that he believed McMahon set him up, by double-booking him and not informing him of his match in Baltimore, as a way of punishment. Sammartino was forced to return to Pittsburgh and found work as a laborer.\n\nOn the advice of wrestler Yukon Eric, Sammartino contacted Toronto promoter Frank Tunney hoping to take advantage of Toronto's large Italian population. Sammartino made his Toronto debut in March 1962 and very quickly, with the help of self-promotion in local newspapers and radio programs, became an attraction. His ability to speak Italian also ingratiated him with that immigrant population. With Whipper Billy Watson, Sammartino won his first professional wrestling championship in September 1962, the local version of the International Tag Team Championship. Soon, he was in demand by other promoters in different Canadian territories.\n\nSammartino also challenged NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz twice for the championship in Canada. One match ended in a draw and the other with Thesz scoring a fluke pin after a collision, despite Sammartino controlling the 20 minute match from the beginning. This match was booked by NWA kingpin Sam Muchnick as a preliminary to the forming of the WWWF, to ensure the dominance of the senior organization and its championship.\n\nEventually, promoters Toots Mondt and McMahon Sr. cleared up Sammartino's suspension by paying his $500 fine, allowing him to return to wrestling in the United States. After many weeks of phone calls from McMahon trying to lure him back, Sammartino agreed if he received a title match against \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, the-then WWWF World Heavyweight Champion. Sammartino won the title on May 17, 1963, defeating Rogers in 48 seconds. Sammartino and Rogers faced each other two months later at Madison Square Garden in a tag team match, with Rogers and Handsome Johnny Barend defeating Sammartino and Bobo Brazil by 2 falls to 1. Rogers pinned Sammartino for the third and deciding fall. Rogers retired prior to their scheduled title rematch on October 4, 1963, in Jersey City, New Jersey's Roosevelt Stadium. Sammartino instead that night had his first match against new number one contender, Gorilla Monsoon. Monsoon won the match but since it was by disqualification which under such a set of circumstances a title is not transferable, Sammartino retained his belt.\n\nOn December 8, 1969, he teamed with Tony Marino to win the WWWF International Tag Team Championship by defeating The Rising Suns (Tanaka and Mitsu Arakawa). Company policy meant that Sammartino could not hold two championships simultaneously, so he was replaced by Victor Rivera. Sammartino held the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship for seven years, eight months, and one day (2,803 days). On January 18, 1971, Sammartino lost the championship at Madison Square Garden to Ivan Koloff. Sammartino recalled the shocked silence that greeted the result, remarking he thought he had damaged his ears. Later that year, he won the International Tag Team Championship for the second time by teaming with Dominic DeNucci.\n\nLater in 1972, Sammartino was asked back by McMahon Sr. to regain the title. After refusing McMahon's initial offer, Sammartino was offered a percentage of all the gates when he wrestled and a decreased work schedule that only included major arenas. Soon after, Sammartino and then champion Pedro Morales teamed up for a series of tag team matches. In a televised match, Professor Tanaka blinded both men with salt and they were maneuvered into fighting each other. When their eyes cleared, they kept fighting each other. Two weeks later, all syndicated wrestling shows in the WWWF showed a clip of Sammartino and Morales signing a contract for a title match at Shea Stadium. When McMahon gestured for them to shake hands, both wordlessly turned and walked away. On September 30, 1972, Sammartino and Morales wrestled to a 65-minute draw at Shea Stadium in New York.\n\nEventually, on December 10, 1973, Sammartino regained the WWWF Heavyweight Championship by defeating Stan Stasiak. During this time, on April 26, 1976, Sammartino suffered a legitimate neck fracture in a match against Stan Hansen at Madison Square Garden, when Hansen improperly executed a move and dropped Sammartino on his head. After two months, Sammartino returned and faced Hansen in a rematch on June 25, 1976 at Shea Stadium, which was on the closed circuit TV undercard of the Ali vs. Antonio Inoki match for WWWF cities. The match was rated 1976 \"Match of the Year\" by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\".\n\nIn early 1977, Sammartino informed McMahon Sr. that he felt he could no longer continue as champion due to his injuries. On April 30, 1977, he was defeated by Superstar Billy Graham for the title. His second title run lasted three years, four months, and twenty days (1,237 days). Despite a very long series of rematches against Graham, Sammartino was unable to regain the title. His final attempt was in Philadelphia, just a few days before Graham was scheduled to lose the title to Bob Backlund.\n\nAfter his second reign ended, Sammartino leisurely toured the U.S. and the world. He wrestled then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race to a one-hour draw in St. Louis. He also wrestled and defeated Blackjack Mulligan, Lord Alfred Hayes, Dick Murdoch, Kenji Shibuya, and \"Crippler\" Ray Stevens. Also during this time, Sammartino began serving as color commentator for the WWF's syndicated programs, \"WWF Championship Wrestling\" and \"WWF All-Star Wrestling\".\n\nOn January 22, 1980, his former student Larry Zbyszko turned on him at the World Wrestling Federation's \"Championship Wrestling\" show. Sammartino, shocked and hurt by Zbyszko's betrayal, vowed to make Zbyszko pay dearly. Their feud culminated on August 9, 1980, in front of 36,295 fans at Shea Stadium. As the main event of 1980's Showdown at Shea, Sammartino defeated Zbyszko inside a steel cage. In his autobiography, Hulk Hogan claimed that his match with André the Giant was the real reason for the huge draw at Shea Stadium; however, the feud between Sammartino and Zbyszko sold out everywhere in the build-up to the show. In contrast, Hogan and André headlined exactly one card in White Plains, New York before they wrestled at Shea, and they drew a paltry 1,200 in a building that held 3,500.\n\nSammartino retired from North American wrestling full-time in 1981, in a match that opened the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Sammartino pinned George \"The Animal\" Steele in his match. Sammartino then finished up his full-time career by touring Japan.\n\nIt was during this time Sammartino found out through Angelo Savoldi, a recently fired office employee of Capitol Wrestling Corporation, that he had been cheated by Vince McMahon Sr. on the promised gate percentages for his entire second title run. Sammartino filed suit against McMahon and his Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The suit was eventually settled out of court by McMahon's son, Vince McMahon after his father had died, and included an agreement for Sammartino to return to the company as a commentator.\n\nAt the inaugural WrestleMania at a sold out Madison Square Garden in 1985, Sammartino was in his son David's corner for his match against Brutus Beefcake. The match ended in a double-disqualification after the Sammartinos began brawling with Beefcake and his manager Johnny Valiant. He returned to in-ring action soon after with his son, as they wrestled against Beefcake and Valiant at Madison Square Garden. The Sammartinos also teamed against \"Mr. Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan in various arenas.\n\nSammartino's highest-profile feud during this run was with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage. An irate Sammartino attacked Savage during a TV interview, after Savage bragged about injuring Ricky Steamboat, by driving the timekeeper's bell into Steamboat's throat during a televised match. Sammartino defeated Savage in a lumberjack match for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship via disqualification at the Boston Garden. This allowed Savage to keep the championship, as titles cannot change hands via countout or disqualification. He was often teamed with Tito Santana and his old enemy George \"The Animal\" Steele (who was a fan favorite at this point in his career) to wrestle Savage and \"Adorable\" Adrian Adonis. The climax of their feud came was a victory for Sammartino and Santana in a steel cage match in Madison Square Garden. Sammartino also engaged in a feud with \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper after Piper insulted his heritage on a segment of \"Piper's Pit\" at Madison Square Garden. Sammartino faced Piper in both singles and tag team matches. Sammartino teamed with Paul Orndorff in his matches against Piper, while Piper would tag with his \"bodyguard\", Ace \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton. Sammartino would eventually get the upper hand in the feud, by defeating Piper in a steel cage match at the Boston Garden. In 1986, Sammartino competed in a 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania 2 at the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago.\n\nSammartino's final match was at a WWF house show in Baltimore on August 29, 1987, where he teamed up with Hulk Hogan to defeat King Kong Bundy and One Man Gang in the main event. Sammartino continued doing commentary on \"Superstars of Wrestling\" until March 1988.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Sammartino became an outspoken critic of the path on which Vince McMahon has taken professional wrestling. He particularly criticized the use of steroids and \"vulgar\" storylines. He appeared in the media in opposition to the WWE on such shows as \"The Phil Donahue Show\", \"Geraldo\" and CNN.\n\nSammartino worked as a commentator for the Universal Wrestling Federation. On October 28, 1989, Sammartino made a special appearance at the NWA pay-per-view event Halloween Havoc, where he was the special guest referee in a \"Thunderdome\" cage match which featured Ric Flair and Sting taking on Terry Funk and The Great Muta. Sammartino worked several WCW events in a minor analysis role in the early 1990s, as well as a brief run doing color commentary with Jim Ross on \"Saturday Night\" in 1992. He also acted as special guest referee in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) for a series of matches between Flair and Randy Savage in June 1996.\n\nIn 2006, he signed an independent deal with Jakks Pacific to produce an action figure, which is part of the WWE Classic Superstars line, Series 10.\n\nOn March 25, 2010, Sammartino was honored at the 74th annual Dapper Dan Dinner, a popular awards and charity fundraising event in Pittsburgh, with a lifetime achievement award, for which fellow former \"Studio Wrestling\" personalities Bill Cardille, \"Jumping\" Johnny De Fazio, Dominic DeNucci, Frank Durso, and referee Andy \"Kid\" DePaul were all present.\nIn 2013, Sammartino accepted an invitation for induction into the WWE Hall of Fame, after having declined several times in prior years. He finally accepted the offer to join because he was satisfied with the way the company had addressed his concerns about rampant drug use as well as vulgarity. The ceremony took place at Madison Square Garden on April 6, 2013, and Sammartino was inducted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sammartino appeared on the October 7, 2013, episode of \"Raw\" and received a birthday greeting in his hometown of Pittsburgh. On March 28, 2015, Sammartino inducted Larry Zbyszko into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Sammartino was involved in a fight with former Pennsylvania Athletic Commissioner Joe Cimino. Cimino was new to his post and intervened in a match finish involving Sammartino, who took a shot at Cimino in the ring and the argument continued backstage. Sammartino ended up in a screaming match with Cimino on Pittsburgh's local \"Studio Wrestling\" program, and Cimino suspended him for a month. Sam Muchnick mentioned the incident in his book, \"Wrestling Babylon\".\n\nIn his autobiography, \"The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption\", Bill Watts told of witnessing a backstage incident between Sammartino and Gorilla Monsoon. Watts wrote that Monsoon \"soon found himself in deep water\" when messing with Sammartino, and he did not go into further detail on the incident out of respect for Monsoon.\n\nOn July 26, 2004, Sammartino and Ric Flair were involved in the \"Who snubbed who?\" non-confrontation at the Mellon Arena in Pittsburgh. Flair had denigrated Sammartino's wrestling ability in his book \"To Be the Man\". Flair said Sammartino refused to shake his hand at the event, while Sammartino said Flair saw him coming down the hall, turned, and rushed away.\n\n\nSammartino is included in two DVDs summarizing his career and life: \"Bruno Returns to Italy With Bruno Sammartino\" (2006) and \"Bruno Sammartino: Behind the Championship Belt\" (2006). Both were only released in Pittsburgh. Sammartino is honored on the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame.\n\nSammartino appeared in the \"WWE 2K14\" video game as a downloadable character.\n\nAt the age of 2, Peter Gene Hernandez was nicknamed 'Bruno' by his dad for his resemblance to the Italian wrestler, that kid is now international musical icon Bruno Mars.\n\nSammartino was married to his wife Carol from 1959 until his death in 2018. They had three sons together, David and fraternal twins Danny and Darryl. They were grandparents of four grandchildren. The Sammartinos lived in Ross Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh from 1965 on. In 1998, he said he had been estranged from David since retiring from wrestling against David's wishes for a tag team.\n\nOn April 6, 2013, Bruno received the Key to the City in Jersey City, New Jersey. May 17, 2013 was declared \"Bruno Sammartino Day\" in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. In 2013, Sammartino appeared as one of the Board of Governors in the nationally televised 69th Annual Columbus Day Parade.\n\nSammartino underwent heart surgery in 2011. He died on April 18, 2018, at the age of 82 from multiple organ failure due to heart problems following a two-month hospitalization. WWE honored his life with a ten-bell salute before a house show in Cape Town later that day, and again on the April 23 episode of \"Raw\" in St. Louis. Mayor Bill Peduto remembered him as \"one of the greatest ambassadors the city of Pittsburgh ever had.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "181211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181211", "title": "Charlotte Mary Yonge", "text": "Charlotte Mary Yonge\n\nCharlotte Mary Yonge (1823–1901) was an English novelist who wrote to the service of the church. Her books helped to spread the influence of the Oxford Movement. Her abundant work is mostly out of print.\n\nCharlotte Mary Yonge was born in Otterbourne, Hampshire, England, on 11 August 1823 to William Yonge and Fanny Yonge, \"née\" Bargus. She was educated at home by her father, studying Latin, Greek, French, Euclid, and algebra. Her father's lessons could be harsh:\nHe required a diligence and accuracy that were utterly alien to me. He thundered at me so that nobody could bear to hear it, and often reduced me to tears, but his approbation was so delightful that it was a delicious stimulus... I believe, in spite of all breezes over my innate slovenliness, it would have broken our hearts to leave off working together. And we went on till I was some years past twenty.\nYonge's devotion to her father was lifelong and her relationship with him seems to have been for her the standard for all other relationships, including marriage. His \"approbation was throughout life my bliss; his anger my misery for the time.\"\n\nShe was born into a religious family background, was devoted to the High Church, and much influenced by John Keble, Vicar of Hursley from 1835, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Yonge is herself sometimes referred to as \"the novelist of the Oxford Movement\", as her novels frequently reflect the values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She remained in Otterbourne all her life and for 71 years was a teacher in the village Sunday school. She lived in a house called \"Elderfield\" (which became a grade 2 listed building in 1984).\nIn 1868 a new parish was formed to the south of Yonge's home village of Otterbourne; the parish was to contain the villages of Eastley and Barton. Yonge donated £500 towards the parish church and was asked to choose which of the two villages the parish should be named after. She chose Eastley, but decided that it should be spelt \"Eastleigh\" as she perceived this as being more modern.\n\nYonge died in her home town of Otterbourne on 24 May 1901. Her obituary in \"The Times\" said:\nHer friends, and especially her poorer neighbours, knew both the strength and the winning charm of her character. Thus the late Archbishop Benson noted in his diary her 'odd majesty and kindliness, which are very strong'.\n\nBut it is of course as a writer that Miss Yonge will be remembered. She had an inventive mind and a ready pen, and a bare list of the books written or edited by her would probably occupy nearly a whole column of The Times. She wrote chiefly for young people, especially young girls, and her books are the result not only of a strong ethical purpose, but also of her firm devotion to the High Church view of Christian doctrine and practice.\nShe began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, \"The Heir of Redclyffe\" (1853), provided the funding to enable the schooner \"Southern Cross\" to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for forty years of \"The Monthly Packet\", a magazine (founded in 1851) with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls (in later years it was addressed to a somewhat wider readership).\nAmong the best known of her works are \"The Heir of Redclyffe\", \"Heartsease\", and \"The Daisy Chain\". \"A Book of Golden Deeds\" is a collection of true stories of courage and self-sacrifice. She also wrote \"Cameos from English History\", \"Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands\", and \"Hannah More\". Her \"History of Christian Names\" was described as \"the first serious attempt at tackling the subject\" and as the standard work on names in the preface to the first edition of Withycombe's \"The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names\" (1944).\n\nAround 1859 Yonge created a literary group made up of younger girl cousins in order that they could write essays and gain advice from Yonge on their writing. Together they created \"The Barnacle\" and this collaboration continued until about 1871. This was valuable as this may have been the last generation of girls to be educated at home. Her god-daughter, Alice Mary Coleridge contributed as the name of \"Gurgoyle\" from the first issue drawing the covers and contributing translations, articles and verses.\n\nHer personal example and influence on her god-daughter, Alice Mary Coleridge, played a formative role in Coleridge's zeal for women's education and thus, indirectly, led to the foundation of Abbots Bromley School for Girls.\n\nAfter her death, her friend, assistant and collaborator, Christabel Coleridge, published the biographical \"Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters\" (1903).\n\nYonge's work was widely read and respected in the nineteenth century. Among her admirers were Lewis Carroll, George Eliot, William Ewart Gladstone, Charles Kingsley, Christina Rossetti, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Anthony Trollope. William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones read \"The Heir of Redclyffe\" aloud to each other while undergraduates at Oxford University and \"took [the hero, Guy Morville's] medieval tastes and chivalric ideals as presiding elements in the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\" Yonge's work was compared favourably with that of Trollope, Jane Austen, Honoré de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, and Émile Zola.\n\nSir John Arthur Ransome Marriott wrote of her:\n\nCharlotte Yonge (1823–1902) was not only a prolific novelist, but a serious student of history, especially in its personal aspects. Having dealt in \"The Constable's Tower\" with Hubert de Burgh, with his famous defence of Dover Castle against Prince Louis of France (1213), and his still more famous victory at sea off Sandwich, and with Edward I as a crusader (\"The Prince and the Page\"), Miss Yonge drew on the \"Vie de Bertrand du Guesclin\" as well as on Froissart for her fascinating tale \"The Lances of Lynwood\". With characteristic modesty she expressed the hope that her sketch might \"serve as an inducement to some young readers to make acquaintance with the delectable old Canon (Froissart) for themselves\". The wise, of all ages, will fulfil her hope.\nSo popular were her works that\n\nA midshipman was able to supply from memory a missing page in his ship's copy of \"The Daisy Chain\". An officer in the Guards, asked in a game of \"Confessions\" what his prime object in life was, answered that it was to make himself like Guy Morville, hero of \"The Heir of Redclyffe\".\n\nC. S. Lewis thought very highly of Yonge, at one point bracketing her evocations of domestic life with those of Homer and Leo Tolstoy.\n\nAbraham Kuyper, who read \"The Heir of Redclyffe\" on the recommendation of his fiancé, Johanna Schaay, found it to be a very moving experience and wrote that the novel was \"next to the Bible in its meaning for my life.\"\n\nAccording to critic Catherine Sandbach-Dahlström, Yonge's work has been \"constantly be-deviled\" by a \"tendency to confuse the moral quality of [her] view of life with the quality of her literary expression\".\n\nYonge's work has been little studied, with the possible exception of \"The Heir of Redclyffe\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48344886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48344886", "title": "Dead Island announcement trailer", "text": "Dead Island announcement trailer\n\nDead Island: Official Announcement Trailer is an announcement trailer for the 2011 video game \"Dead Island\", which was developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver. The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who has turned into a zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by Giles Lamb.\n\nThe trailer was designed to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.\n\nThe story is presented in reverse chronological order and in slow motion. The trailer follows a family, consisting of a father, a mother and a daughter, visiting Banoi, an island paradise. After they have settled in a hotel, an unexpected zombie outbreak occurs. The daughter is running away from the horde of zombies in the hotel's corridor and dashing towards her room, where her father and mother are staying, when she is caught. A zombie bites the daughter's legs, causing her to become infected with the zombie virus.\n\nThe father opens the door and picks up a fire axe to fight against zombies. He rescues his daughter and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck. To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies. The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room in the beginning of the game.\n\n\"Dead Island\", originally announced in 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, it was a game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.\n\nThe trailer was produced and made by the Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for \"Killzone 2\" and \"Mass Effect 2\". According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director of the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.\n\nThe team hoped that despite the short duration of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would be easy for players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly. They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the \"discovery\" of the outbreak, its inevitability, and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story. The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies. The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling. Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in slow motion, as they believed that it could make the action feel \"balletic\" instead of purely violent.\n\nThe trailer is made up of computer imagery, and it does not show any actual gameplay footage of \"Dead Island\". The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of \"artwork\", stating influence from the \"Carousel\" trailer from Philips. The trailer was also designed to showcase \"great zombie moments\" in an effort to attract the genre's supporters. The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to help people who had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island.\n\nThe trailer's music was composed by Giles Lamb, who worked for a soundtrack development company called Savalas. The music was designed to be \"somber\", \"melancholy\", and \"elegant\", in contrast with the gore presented in the trailer. The music was designed to be tense when the trailer is depicting violent action, and beautiful during peaceful moments. The team hoped that the music would create a \"juxtaposition between beauty and horror\".\n\nPopular reaction to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust the game's tone, gameplay, and story, as well as the game's promotion strategy.\n\nA week after the release of the trailer, more than one million people had viewed it through YouTube, exceeding Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views. \"Dead Island\" also became one of the most searched items on Google, YouTube, and Twitter for several days. Axis was pleasantly surprised at the trailer's popularity. Following the trailer's release, \"Dead Island\" became a widely anticipated game.\n\nMany critics praised the trailer's use of reverse storytelling. Keith Stuart from \"The Guardian\" compared it favorably to Coldplay's \"The Scientist\", saying that it successfully delivered an affecting and emotive experience. Mike Fahey from \"Kotaku\" called the trailer's use of the dead girl \"heartbreaking\" and thought that it would be amazing if Techland was able to incorporate these emotional elements into the actual game. Its graphics and pacing also received commendation. The trailer's story was praised for presenting an unconventional take on a zombie apocalypse. Jason Schreier from \"Wired\" said that the trailer had successfully made a saturated genre feel fresh again.\n\nThe trailer generated controversy around the depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually \"shy away from\", yet it is presented as a main focus in the trailer. Ben Parfitt from \"Market for Home Computing and Video Games\" found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark. Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative. Robert Rath from \"The Escapist\" also liked the segment, calling it \"deliberate and necessary\", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.\n\nThe lack of gameplay information was also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected from the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer. Daemon Hatfield from IGN similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game would not be as entertaining and interesting as the trailer. Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.\n\nThe trailer was given a gold award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. It was named by gaming journalists as one of the best video game trailers ever made.\n\nA live-action remake and a recut version of the trailer which shows the story in a chronological order were released by fans. The announcement trailer also boosted the popularity of Techland and Deep Silver. The announcement trailer for \"\", released in 2012, featured a similar, depressing tone. A trailer for \"Goat Simulator\" in 2014 also mimicked the format of the \"Dead Island\" announcement trailer. A movie tie-in based on the trailer was once proposed by Lionsgate, though the project was ultimately cancelled. Deep Silver released a musical tribute to the trailer, coinciding with the launch of \"\" in May 2016.\n\n"}

One month later, Arcadia Books, the British publisher, withdrew the book and pulped all unsold copies in reaction to a legal threat initiated on behalf of Lily Safra under her interpretation that the book was a defamatory roman à clef. After some changes the book was republished in the United States in 2008 by Dynasty Press.\n\nBianca Barrett, the protagonist and daughter of a Welsh Surveyor and his Palestinian wife, becomes an \"ambitious and mercenary\" social climber and double murderess. Charming and well-educated, Bianca marries four times and advances in wealth and social influence. \n\nWith Bernardo, her first husband, Bianca has three children; they lose their son in a car crash. After a divorce, she marries the rich Fredie whose family owns the Piedraplata commercial empire. Before it comes to a divorce, the second husband is shot and killed by a hitman who makes it look like a suicide. The killing is arranged by her lover, Phillipe Mahfud, and Bianca becomes the financial beneficiary. \n\nAfter a brief marriage to husband number three – she had married him only to make Mahfud jealous-, she lastly marries Mahfud, a rich Iraqi businessman and banker. When their relationship sours, the banker dies with his nurse in a mysterious fire in his apartment in the tax haven of Andorra. Bianca's lawyers pay off the police and investigators, and the only justice that remains is in the court of public opinion.\n\nIn July 2005, Lily Safra claimed that her life had been \"stolen\" by the book and had her lawyer, Anthony Julius, demand that the publisher should recall the book and destroy unsold copies. Julius' letter indicated that Safra \"regarded the book as defamatory\". As English defamation law puts the burden of proof on the defendant, Arcadia Books complied indicating that they were too small a company to fight the looming legal battle. The author, however, denied that she had used Safra's life as a template and claimed that it was based on characters of her own family, including her cousin Blanche, a double murderess. A countersuit ensued with Lady Campbell demanding compensation for lost income. She did not prevail.\n\nA rewritten, American edition of the novel was published in 2008 after the 17 specific issues that had been seen as pointing to Safra were addressed. With changes described as minor, but legally important – for instance, Barret now grows up in Mexico (not South America), her mother is Palestinian (not Jewish), and her last husband Iraqi (not Lebanese) – this edition still preserved story, plot, incidents, and dialogue elements.\n"}

Executive agreements are considered \"politically binding\" to distinguish them from treaties which are \"legally binding\".\n\nIn the United States, executive agreements are made solely by the President of the United States. They are one of three mechanisms by which the United States enters into binding international obligations. Some authors consider executive agreements to be treaties under international law in that they bind both the United States and another sovereign state. However, under United States constitutional law, executive agreements are not considered treaties for the purpose of the Treaty Clause of the United States Constitution, which requires the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate to qualify as a treaty.\n\nSome other nations have similar provisions with regard to the ratification of treaties.\n\nExecutive agreements are often used in order to bypass the requirements of national constitutions for ratification of treaties. Many nations that are republics with written constitutions have constitutional rules about the ratification of treaties. The Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe is based on executive agreements.\n\nIn the United States, executive agreements are binding internationally if they are negotiated and entered into under the president's authority in foreign policy, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, or from a prior act of Congress. For instance, as commander-in-chief the President negotiates and enters into status of forces agreements (SOFAs), which govern the treatment and disposition of U.S. forces stationed in other nations. The president cannot, however, enter unilaterally into executive agreements on matters that are beyond his constitutional authority. In such instances, an agreement would need to be in the form of a congressional-executive agreement, or a treaty with Senate advice and consent.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, in \"United States v. Pink\" (1942), held that international executive agreements validly made have the same legal status as treaties and did not require Senate approval. Also, in \"Reid v. Covert\" (1957), while reaffirming the president’s ability to enter into executive agreements, the Court held that such agreements cannot contradict existing federal law or the Constitution.\n\nThe Case Act of 1972 requires the president to inform the Senate within 60 days of any executive agreement being made. No restriction was placed on presidential powers to make such agreements. The notification requirement enabled Congress to vote to cancel an executive agreement, or to refuse to fund its implementation.\n\n"}

These cookbooks may be written in notebooks, put in ring binders, or professionally published by one of several cookbook publishers that cater to families interested in preserving their food heritage.\n\nFamilies interested in genealogy sometimes also decide to preserve their recipes, since those recipes often represent a facet of their history. Some older recipes may give clues as to the ethnic origins of the people who cooked it, like lebkuchen with its German origins or sweet potato pie and its southern United States roots. Other genealogical clues may be found in recipe boxes, from the things the recipes are written on: old bills (may indicate where a family lived), letters (may contain stories about what was happening in their lives at the time), or newspaper clippings (may have dates).\n\nOther than the historical/genealogical aspect of a family cookbook, they also serve as a way to pass along family traditions to another generation. It is worth the time to measure the ingredients of a cook who makes her/his dishes from memory, as they prepare it. Some recipes may become lost when the person who always made that recipe (from memory) dies if it's not written down. In addition to the recipe itself, stories about the tradition are also good to include, perhaps special Christmas cookies were set out for Santa Claus for many generations, or a traditional Irish meal was made every St. Patrick's Day. \n\nFor large families who need to print 100 or more copies of their cookbook, there are several publishers who specialize in printing limited numbers of books. Smaller families have the option of going to their local printer (such as Kinko's), or doing it at home with desktop publishing.\n\n\n"}

The emphasis is on contemporary photograph and video presentations, with the focus on Man and society. \n\nThe museum consists of three different buildings, the Vleeshal (Flesher's hall) on the east side and the Verweyhal (named for Kees Verwey) on the west side are two large \"halls\" sandwiching the small entrance building. All three buildings are National Heritage sites today.\n\nThe Vleeshal was built in the years 1602 to 1605 and was originally a ‘meat hall’ where butchers sold their goods. The heads of bulls and rams on the façades are reminders of the original function of the building. It is an example of Dutch renaissance architecture, with renaissance ornaments being applied on a basic Gothic structure (floor plan and outer walls). The renaissance forms include pilasters, rustica, Tuscan (interior) pillars, scrollwork (above the cellar entrances) and obelisks. Sample prints by Hans Vredeman de Vries from Antwerp provided a source of inspiration for this. De Vleeshal was built by Lieven de Key, the town architect, commissioned by the city government, which judging by the finished building had a substantial treasury at the time. It remained a meat hall all the way into the 19th century.\n\nThe building later fulfilled a totally different function; from 1840 to 1885 it served as a storehouse for a garrison quartered in Haarlem. Later the building served as a Public Records Office, and after that as a depot for the municipal library. During the Second World War the building was occupied by the Distribution Service.\n\nAfter World War II, the Mayor and Aldermen decreed that the building should become an exhibition hall, and the first exhibitions were held in 1950. De Hallen Haarlem organises alternating exhibitions of contemporary art on two storeys, throughout summer combined with modern art. The Archeological Museum is in the cellar.\n\nThe little ‘fish house’ in between the two main halls was once the home of the servant of the fish market across the square and serves as the entrance for Frans Hals Museum - Hal today. \n\nThe Verweyhal is a former society meeting hall next to the main entrance on the corner of the Grote Markt and the Grote Houtstraat, where the former main entrance to it is located. The Verweyhal was built in the 19th century as a home for the Haarlem gentlemen’s society Trou moet Blycken.\n\nThe building is in the Eclectic style and also contains some art deco features in the interior though it has been renovated beyond recognition since 1880. It became a modern art exhibition hall in 1992 when the Kees Verwey Foundation renovated it and gave the artist's oeuvre to the Frans Hals Museum.\n"}

It has operations in the United Kingdom (known as Yell), the United States, and Spain (known as Paginas Amarillas). It has its origins in the yellow pages division of the privatised British telecommunications operator BT Group.\n\nIn 1966, Post Office Telecommunications – a division of the UK General Post Office, launched the first UK Yellow Pages classified directory in Brighton, Sussex. Yellow Pages were rolled out across the UK by 1973, and became the first information provider on Prestel.\n\nYellow Pages launched its iconic \"J. R. Hartley\" adverts in 1983, and became a separately identified business within the BT Group after BT was privatised in 1984. The red fronted \"Business Pages\" launched in 1985 in Bristol and South Wales, and the telephone directory enquiries information service \"Talking Pages\" was piloted in Brighton and Bristol from 1987, which then became known as 118 24 7 after 2003. The group launched Yell.com, its UK local search engine, in 1996 and acquired YellowBook USA in 1999 for $665 million.\n\nThe Group was renamed Yell in 2000 and BT restructured in 2001 and agreed to sell the Yell directory business to private equity firms Apax Partners and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst (today operating in Europe as Lion Capital LLP) for £2.14 billion/$3.5 billion, making it then the largest non-corporate LBO in European history.\n\nYell bought McLeodUSA, one of the largest independent directory publishers in the US for about $600 million in 2002, and floated on London's FTSE in 2003.\n\nIn May 2005, Yell announced the acquisition of U.S. directory publisher TransWestern Publishing (and its holding company TransWestern Holdings L.P. from a consortium of private equity firms (Thomas H. Lee Partners and CIVC Partners for $1.575 billion (£829 million). TransWestern operated in 25 states and had core positions in California and Texas. The deal went through later in the year, making Yell's U.S. subsidiary Yellowbook the fifth largest directory publisher in the United States at that time. TransWestern had been acquired by CIVC Partners in 1993 and was used as a vehicle for additional acquisitions of smaller directories publishers in the western US. In 1997, TransWestern completed a leveraged recapitalisation in which Thomas H. Lee Partners and Providence Equity Partners acquired a 60% interest in the company, with CIVC retaining a minority interest. In 2001, TransWestern acquired Texas-based WorldPages.com, Inc., a leading print and Internet yellow pages publisher listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $215 million. At the time, TransWestern was the second largest independent publisher of directories.\n\nIn April 2006, Yell agreed to purchase a 59.9% stake in Spanish phone directory firm Telefónica Publicidad e Informacion (TPI) from Telefónica, and launched a bid for the remaining shares which valued TPI at a total of 2.3 billion (€3.3 billion; US$4.1bn). Since then, Yell has bought further capital and in September 2007 reached agreement with the minority shareholders to acquire the remaining 1.28% of what was then named Yell Publicidad (now named Hibu Connect S.A.U., operating under the name Páginas Amarillas España). In July 2006, Yell threatened Yellowikis with legal action, claiming that people will confuse the two organisations. In 2008, Yell Group purchased the Pindar Set business and renamed it Yell Adworks.\n\nIn May 2009, Yell UK announced an alliance with Google to provide search marketing services to small businesses, followed by Yell Publicidad in January 2010. In June 2009, Yell Group announced the appointment of Bob Wigley as Chairman, following the announcement in May 2009, that existing chairman Bob Scott would step down. In September 2009, Yell's US arm, Yellowbook, acquired Texas and Louisiana assets of ypOne Publishing, the 10th largest independent yellow pages publisher in the US. Yell announced the completion of its refinancing in November 2009, as first announced in June 2009 and updated in September the same year.\n\nIn February 2010, Yell UK announced the first major redesign in forty years of the traditional Yellow Pages directories into a smaller compact size rather than the traditional A4 format.\n\nIn May 2010, Yell Group purchased TrustedPlaces, a user-contributed local review site, and its US arm Yellowbook, announced the launch of a new group buying website called Weforia.com in August 2010.\n\nSeveral management changes were made in 2011. Mike Pocock was appointed Yell Group CEO from 1 January 2011, replacing previous CEO John Condron. Richard Hanscott was named CEO for the UK part of the business in June, reporting to Mike Pocock. In October, Scott Moore was appointed Group Chief Digital Officer.\n\nIn July 2011, Yell announced the acquisition of Znode, the privately owned multi-store ecommerce company and strategic alliances on digital services for small businesses with both Microsoft and Bazaarvoice. On 14 July, Yell announced a four-year plan to move away from traditional print and online advertising and focus on providing a broader range of digital services for both small businesses and consumers.\n\nIn September 2011, Yell announced an alliance with mobile platform company Netbiscuits.\n\nIn 2011 the company reported spending £160 million on interest payments and incurring losses of £1.4 billion.\n\nIn May 2012, Yell announced that it was changing its name to Hibu, pronounced \"high-boo\" and styled \"hibü\", with rebranding undertaken by Landor. The company's shareholders approved the change of name at its annual general meeting held on 27 July 2012, and the new name became effective from 30 July 2012.\n\nThe company continued to acquire additional companies, with Moonfruit, a DIY website company, purchased in May 2012 for £18m.\n\nIn September 2012, it warned that it is working with a number of capital options that which may attribute little or no value to the group’s ordinary shares, it also warned profits would miss forecasts owing to the ongoing decline of its directory business.\n\nAs part of a strategic review of the business, in Spring 2014 Hibu decided to discontinue its US magazine business, having taken similar actions in the UK, Spain and Latin America.\n\nOn 3 March 2014, Hibu announced that the financial restructuring of the group is now effective following consent from lenders, clearance from the UK Pensions Regulator and court sanction. All of Hibu’s operations were transferred to a new group holding company, held privately by lenders.\n\nOn 18 August 2014, Hibu UK changed their customer facing brand back to Yell.

All of the museums offer free times or days and 11 of the museums are free all the time. Thursdays the Museum District gets particularly crowded because of museum free days. On Thursdays, The Houston Museum of Natural Science is free after 2 p.m., The Children's Museum of Houston is free after 5 p.m., The Health Museum is free from 2-7, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston is free all day (courtesy of Shell) .\n\nHouston's Museum District is walkable and bikeable. Sidewalks are wide and well-maintained, and attractions and restaurants are situated near each other.\n\nBordered roughly by Texas State Highway 288, Hermann Park, U.S. Route 59, and the Texas Medical Center, the Museum District specifically refers to the area located within a 1.5-mile radius of the Mecom Fountain in Hermann Park. The Museum District Civic Association compared the area to Georgetown in Washington, D.C. and to the French Quarter of New Orleans.\n\nThe Museum District is served by four stops on the METRORail, one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from I-69/US 59, State Highway 288 and Main Street, across from the main entrance to Rice University.\n\nThe beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-1980s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter. Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997.\n\nThe Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world. More information on the 20 institutions of Houston's Museum District may be found on their official website.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the area currently including the Houston Museum District had fallen into disrepair, badly needing attention from local, county and state governments to improve roads and beautify the area, then unsafe for pedestrian traffic and cyclists.\n\nThe Houston Museum District began as a grassroots community movement in 1977 led by Alexandra R. Marshall whose concept was to create a pedestrian-friendly district with the Museum of Fine Arts, at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Montrose Boulevard, as its core. In such a strongly vehicle-oriented city, and one which to this day retains the title of the largest city in the United States without zoning, this was fairly progressive.\n\nThe Museum District Development Association of Houston proposed a multi-phase plan to beautify and make more pedestrian-friendly the area located between Allen Parkway, Buffalo Bayou and Hermann Park. It took advantage of the opportunity to create in Houston an area of vital urban importance, similar to the French Quarter in New Orleans, St. Germain in Paris, and Georgetown in Washington, DC.\n\nSince its creation, the numerous efforts of the Houston Museum District organizations have included community improvement projects, tree planting, sidewalk planning, construction and expansion, esplanade design, development and beautification, establishment of public transportation to and from the area, police support and various cultural events\nThe Montrose Association, the Museum Area Municipal Association, the South Main Civic Association, the Cultural Arts Center of Houston and TALA (Texas Accountants and Lawyers for the Arts) all played a part in the development and subsequent success in the creation of the Houston Museum District.\n\n\n\nAccording to 1st board meeting notes (Oct 4, 1986):\n\nDirectors:\n\n\n\n\nParks and other institutions\n\nOriginally, funding was completely based on private sources—association member dues and members’ donations. Later, with growing awareness of the MDDAH and their work, funding came from numerous other sources.\n\nToday, total operating budgets for the member museums exceed $80 million, funded almost completely from revenues and private donations. Museum District funding includes approximately $1.5 million in Hotel Occupancy Tax funds from the City of Houston and the Houston Arts Alliance; contributions from all participating museums; foundation support from The Houston Endowment, Inc.; The John P. McGovern Foundation; The Wortham Foundation, Inc.; The Brown Foundation, Inc.; Susan Vaughan Foundation, Inc.; and corporate support from KHOU-TV Channel 11, KUHT-TV (PBS), the \"Houston Chronicle\", \"Texas Monthly\", Exxon, and Cadillac.\n\nThe District plays an ongoing role in forming responses to public concerns and opportunities that include transportation improvements, signage, visitor information, area beautification, flood control and urban planning considerations.\nThe HMDA also serves as an intermediary, which fosters an ongoing dialogue among the museums in the district to maintain continuing interest and visitation in the area.\n\nLaurette Canizares, Executive Director, Houston Museum District Association \nGina Miller, Programming and Public Relations Manager, Houston Museum District Association \n\nMuseum Park Neighborhood Association (MPNA) serves houses roughly bound by Texas State Highway 288, Hermann Park, Main Street, and Alabama Street. Several apartment and/or condo communities are already in the area and new ones are currently being built and developed. One benefit of living at The Circle at Hermann Park, The Mosaic, The Parklane, The Plaza, The Warwick, or new residential communities being built is that residents enjoy easy walking distance to the Houston Zoo, The Children's Museum of Houston, The Houston Museum of Natural Science, Miller Outdoor Theater, Hermann Park, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and more.\n\nParking in the Houston Museum District can be tricky if you visit on Thursdays, weekends, HISD Spring/Summer/Winter vacation days, or evenings when Miller Outdoor Theater is hosting a popular show. A parking lot adjacent to the McGovern Centennial Gardens on Hermann Drive was added in 2014. You may park there for free. Parking in the lot across from the Law Building at MFAH is also free. You may also park at the zoo or in the lot near the Rice University Light Rail Station for free (there is a 3-hour time limit). You may pay to park along Hermann Drive or on side streets, in the HMNS garage, or in various garages. You may also park along the MetroRail Line and take the light rail train to Rice University or The Museum District stops.\n\nThe Houston Independent School District (HISD) operates area public schools.\n\nElementary schools serving portions of the Museum District area:\n\nMiddle schools serving portions of the Museum District area:\nBeginning in 2018 Baylor College of Medicine Academy at Ryan also serves as a boundary option for students zoned to Blackshear, Lockhart, and MacGregor elementary schools.\n\nLamar High School serves houses in the Museum District area.\n\nPresbyterian School is located in the Museum District. The Post Oak High School, a private Montessori high school, opened in the northern hemisphere fall of 2012. It is the first high school in the Museum District.\n\nThe Houston Public Library Clayton Library, Center for Genealogical Research is located in the Museum District. The genealogical collection, originally housed in the Julia Ideson Building in Downtown Houston, moved to the William Clayton Home, a Georgian-style house built in 1917, in the Museum District in 1968. A site for a new building, adjacent to the Clayton Home, was purchased in 1986. The new building, which was built in 1988, was designed to complement the Clayton Home. The city implemented a $6.8 million renovation project for the Clayton Home and the guest house and carriage house on the property in the 2000s. The city planned to renovate the property so it would meet LEED standards. The city installed an elevator in the guest house so the building could be used as an administrative office. The carriage house received an addition so it could function as a 100-person conference room. The Clayton site can accommodate one plenary session and four breakout meetings, which would be required for a national genealogical conference. The \"Houston Business Journal\" awarded the renovation as the best historic renovation for its 2009 Landmark Awards. There is also a branch of the Houston Public Library in the Children's Museum of Houston.\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church is located in the Museum District.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36085263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36085263", "title": "Letter to the Romans (Ignatius of Antioch)", "text": "Letter to the Romans (Ignatius of Antioch)\n\nThe Letter to the Romans by Ignatius, an early-second-century Bishop of Antioch, was written during his transport from Antioch, Syria, to his execution in Rome. One of seven extant epistles written by Ignatius, \"Romans\" is Ignatius’ most detailed explanation of his views on martyrdom.\n\nThe exact year in which \"Romans\" was written is disputed; however, common consensus seems to be that Ignatius wrote concurrent with New Testament writings and likely under the rule of Roman Emperor Trajan. Scholars hypothesize that the text was written between “105 and 110 AD”, as well as “prior to 117 CE”, and “between the first year of Vespasian and the 10th year of Trajan” Although we do not know which specific year Ignatius wrote this letter, he does provide the month and day: August 23.\n\nFollowing his arrest in Syria, Ignatius traveled through many cities on his way to Rome for execution. \"Romans\" was written prior to his arrival in Rome, while he was in Smyrna. Our evidence for the Ignatius’ journey to Rome primarily comes from the fourth-century church historian Eusebius of Caesarea.\n\n\"Romans\" is part of a series of seven epistles that Ignatius wrote, each addressed to a different regional church. However, while the other letters addressed communities with whom Ignatius had already had contact (either in person or via representatives), \"Romans\" addresses Roman Christians prior to his arrival in Rome. It has been suggested that the letter (especially because it includes the specific day and month it was written) was intended to allow Roman Christians to prepare for Ignatius’ arrival.\n\n\"Romans\" follows an epistolary format, addressing the regional Roman church. The text is often considered to be modeled after the Pauline epistles, while incorporating certain Hellenistic mores.\n\n\"Romans\" follows this basic epistolary format:\nPrescript\n\nSections 1-8 are Ignatius’ request that Roman Christians not interfere with his martyrdom, as it is how he desires to be with God.\nSections 9-10 contain concluding remarks and greetings.\n\nJefford provides a nice acute summary (in clear, modern English) of \"Romans\" in the book \"Reading the Apostolic Fathers:\"\n\n\"Greetings to the Romans! Though I am unworthy, I long to see you. Pray for me. And when I arrive in chains, let me die a martyr’s death – eaten by wild beasts! I long for this proof that I am a true disciple of Christ. Let me follow in the footsteps of the Lord. I no longer take pleasure in life. Pray for the church in Syria.\"\n\nWhile \"Romans\" is primarily significant for Ignatius’ discussion of his impending martyrdom, it is also important for serving as a representation of early Christian writing, though it does differ from the other six letters Ignatius wrote.\n\nIgnatius implores the Roman Christians to allow him to be martyred, that they practice what they teach in regard to enduring suffering. The language Ignatius uses to discuss his death is frequently eucharistic, often referring to the consumption of his body as bread. Likewise, the language Ignatius uses is morbid, as the prospect of his death informs much of the letter. He claims that only through death can he attain true freedom, and that there is no longer any value in worldly things for him. Ignatius also likens his movement towards Rome to a victory march from battle. The various metaphors Ignatius uses glorify martyrdom. Overall, his rumination on martyrdom reflects the countercultural attitudes of Christianity during this post-apostolic era.\n\nAlso, it is important in how it differs from Ignatius’ other six epistles. This letter discusses martyrdom with a people Ignatius has not yet personally encountered (the Christian community in Rome), whereas the other letters primarily address issues such as church hierarchy, creeds and confessions, and maintaining Christianity. Thus, this letter places importance upon Rome as a vehicle towards martyrdom.\n\nFinally, this text is also important because it provides a sketch of the emerging church hierarchy. We can see how the three-tiered church hierarchy (consisting of bishops, elders, and deacons) was coming into being, and how regional churches were gaining unity through it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38296321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38296321", "title": "List of loanwords in Chinese", "text": "List of loanwords in Chinese\n\nLoanwords have entered written and spoken Chinese from many sources, including ancient peoples whose descendants now speak Chinese. In addition to phonetic differences, varieties of Chinese such as Cantonese and Shanghainese often have distinct words and phrases left from their original languages which they continue to use in daily life and sometimes even in Mandarin. Similarly, northern dialects include relatively greater numbers of loanwords from nearby languages such as Mongolian and Manchu.\n\nThroughout China, Buddhism has also introduced words from Sanskrit and Pali. More recently, foreign invasion and trade since the First and Second Opium Wars of the mid-nineteenth century has led to prolonged contact with English, French, and Japanese. Although politically-minded language reform under the Republic and People's Republic of China have generally preferred to use calques and neologisms in place of loanwords, a growing number particularly from American English have become current in modern Chinese. On the mainland, transcription into Chinese characters in official media and publications is directed by the Proper Names and Translation Service of the Xinhua News Agency and its reference work \"Names of the World's Peoples\".\n\nSince Hong Kong was under British control until 1997, Hong Kong Cantonese borrowed many words from English such as 巴士 (from the word \"bus\", Mandarin: \"bāshì\", Cantonese: \"baa1 si2\"), 的士 (from \"taxi\", Man.: \"dīshì\", Can.: \"dik1 si2\"), 芝士 (from \"cheese\", Man.: \"zhīshì\", Can.: \"zi1 si6\"), and 麥當簩/麦当劳 (from \"McDonald's\", Man.: \"Màidāngláo\", Can.: \"Mak6 dong1 lou4\"), and such loanwords have been adopted into Mandarin, despite them sounding much less similar to the English words the Cantonese versions.\n\nForeign businesses and products are usually free to choose their own transliterations and typically select ones with positive connotations and phonetic similarity to their products: for example,  (IKEA) is \"proper home\". Owing to antonomasia and genericization, these can then enter general Chinese usage: for example Coca-Cola's  (\"delicious fun\") has led to becoming the common Chinese noun for all colas.\n\nSince the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, relations between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China had been hostile, thus communication between Taiwan and mainland China became limited. For that reason, many loanwords and proper names became quite different from each other. For example, \"cheese\" in mainland China is 芝士 \"zhīshì\", while cheese in Taiwan is 起司 \"qĭsī\". \n\nChinese words of English origin have become more common in mainland China during its reform and opening and resultant increased contact with the West. Note that some of the words below originated in other languages but may have arrived in Chinese via English (for example \"pizza/披萨\" from Italian). English acronyms are sometimes borrowed into Chinese without any transcription into Chinese characters; for example \"IT\" (information technology), \"PPT\" (PowerPoint), \"GDP\" (Gross domestic product), \"APP\" (mobile app), \"KTV\" (karaoke), or \"DVD\". A rarer occurrence is the blending of the Latin alphabet with Chinese characters, as in \"卡拉OK\" (\"karaoke\"), “T恤” (\"T-shirt\"), \"IP卡\" (\"internet phone card\"). In some instances, the loanwords exists side by side with neologisms that translate the meaning of the concept into existing Chinese morphemes. For instance, while the loanword for 'penicillin' is 盘尼西林 (pánníxīlín), a neologism that 'translates' the word was later coined, 青霉素 （qīngméisù), which means 'blue/green mold extract/essence'. In contemporary Chinese, neologisms using native Chinese morphemes tend to be favored over loanwords that are transliterations. In the case of penicillin, the term 青霉素 is used almost exclusively, while 盘尼西林 is viewed as an early 20th century relic. Similarly, 'science' is now known as 科学 (kēxué) 'subject/specialty study' rather than 赛因斯 (sàiyīnsī), though it should be pointed out that the characters 科学 were actually coined in the late 19th century by the Japanese as a kanji compound. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "20611958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20611958", "title": "Malta Kiosk", "text": "Malta Kiosk\n\nThe Malta Kiosk () is a historic imperial Ottoman residence located within the garden of the Yıldız Palace in Istanbul, Turkey. The two-storey pavilion was commissioned by Sultan Abdülaziz (reigned 1861–1876) as a hunting lodge, designed by the architect Sarkis Balyan in the neo-baroque style and completed in 1870.\n\nThe pavilion, perched atop a steep hill, is one of the two lodges of its art within the Yıldız Park, the other one being the Çadır Pavilion (). It is located at the north side of the wall separating Yıldız Palace. There are also two watching and resting pavilions in the grove being the rear garden of Çırağan Palace from the Abdül Aziz I period. The origin of the name is not certain but it is thought that during the Ottoman era certain parts of palaces were called after the names of conquered places, so this name was probably given after the siege of Malta (even though the siege was a major Ottoman defeat and Malta remained unconquered).\n\nMalta Kiosk is an example of westernised architecture of the 19th century. The building was constructed by Sarkis Balyan and his brothers. During the Abdül Mecid I period, the architects have been influenced by the European architecture and motifs of nature, flowers, fruits and hunting animal figures have been widely used on the walls. Round marble columns, terraces, bedrooms, wooden and crystal halls have features like neo-classical, neo-Islamic and neo-Ottoman characteristics. The arches in S and C shapes originated from the Rococo style. Columns, palmets or sea shells have been added to the keystones of the arches. The baroque style of the 19th century has been reflected with oval windows, fluted cornices, flushed columns with small tower on ends. The vertical and horizontal elements have been balanced in the Empire style symbolising the Napoleonic period under the influence of Egyptian and Roman architecture.\n\nThe facades of the building on each side, painted in yellow and green, consists of three parts with a large center section flanked by two smaller. Main elements of the facades are triple, tall but narrow, round-arched windows. At the second floor on the side overlooking the Bosporus are also balconies. The building has four doors in total.\n\nThe waterside entrance opens onto a large hall. On both sides of the entrance hall, two staircases rise to upper floor. A large chandelier hangs from a dome-shaped ceiling, which is opulently decorated with curving branches and clusters of various flower motifs. The lower salon contains a big marble fountain and a marble pool in the center decorated with carved swan and fish figures. Between the hall and the salon, there are five-tier marble fountains again with carved swan figures. Two marble columns erects here to the ceiling.\n\nThe salon on the upper level is flanked with two large and one small-sized rooms. The large salons on both floors are equipped with a carved marble fireplace worked with colorful flowers. Oil paintings with landscape themes beautify the walls of the salons. Two rooms on the upper floor are decorated with flower motifs. There are balconies on the second floor facing the sea.\n\nWhen Sultan Abdülaziz was dethroned in 1876, his nephew Murad V (reigned May 30-August 31, 1876) was elevated to the throne. However, he was in turn deposed only after 93 days on the grounds that he was mentally ill, and was replaced by his brother, Abdul Hamid II (reigned 1876–1909). Abdul Hamid II detained Murad V in the Malta Pavilion.\n\nMidhat Pasha, grand vizier and statesman, was ordered by Sultan Abdul Hamid II to be arrested the second time in 1881. Although escaped in the first instance, Midhat Pasha returned a short time later claiming a fair hearing. The trial was held in the nearby Çadır Pavilion, and lasted three days in June that year, during which he was tortured in the basement. The trial of Midhat Pasha took place in a tent behind the pavilion.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, the Malta Pavilion, as many of Ottoman imperial buildings, stood unused and was neglected over a long period. In 1979, the Touring and Automobile Club of Turkey (TTOK) under its CEO Çelik Gülersoy signed an agreement with the City of Istanbul to restore and preserve specific imperial residences, and to run them as public premises. Malta Pavilion was the first restoration work accomplished.\n\nThe exterior walls were repainted green with white trim, and the interiors were restored to their former glory. Furnishings, chandeliers and paintings were collected to fit the style of the rich neo-baroque building.\n\nOpened to the public in 1982, the Malta Pavilion was run as a cafeteria and restaurant by the TTOK until the lease license expired, and the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul did not renew it. From 1997 until 2003, it was operated by the tourism company Beltur of the Metropolitan Municipality. Today, the premise is being run by a private company. In the restaurant and cafeteria on two floors, up to 150 guests can be served.\n\n\"Malta Köşkü\" is also the name of a cake in the Turkish cuisine prepared with the loquat fruit ().\n"}
{"id": "3358792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3358792", "title": "Microstock photography", "text": "Microstock photography\n\nMicrostock photography, also known as micropayment photography, is a part of the stock photography industry. What defines a company as a microstock photography company is that they (1) source their images almost exclusively via the Internet, (2) do so from a wider range of photographers than the traditional stock agencies (including a willingness to accept images from \"amateurs\" and hobbyists), and (3) sell their images at a very low rate (from US$0.20 to $10 in the US) for a royalty-free (RF) image.\n\nA number of microstock sites also sell vector art, and some sell audio (music) files, Flash animations and video as well as images.\n\nThe pioneer of microstock photography was Bruce Livingstone, who created iStockphoto, originally a free stock photo site that quickly became an industry phenomenon. Livingstone sold iStockphoto to Getty Images in February 2006 for 50 million. Many other sites sprang up in the years after iStockphoto's inception. Some of the larger ones are Alamy, Fotolia, Depositphotos, 123RF, Featurepics, Pond5, Can Stock Photo, Dreamstime and Shutterstock.\n\nAfter a few years of initial growth, the microstock industry began a period of mergers and acquisitions. The acquisition of iStockphoto by Getty Images in 2006 was followed by acquisition of StockXpert by Jupiterimages during 2006. Consequently, Jupiterimages, a wholly owned subsidiary of Jupitermedia, was bought by Getty Images in 2009 for $96 million in cash and resulted in the closure of StockXpert in 2010 because it was perceived to be non-strategic for Getty compared to iStockphoto. After the sale, Jupitermedia changed its name to WebMediaBrands. BigStockPhoto was purchased by Shutterstock in 2009.\n\nStarting from limited RF license, all agencies added various Extended Licenses; sites based on a \"pay-per-download\" principle introduced subscription and vice versa. Shutterstock, which was the only 100% subscription-based microstock agency, introduced a pay-per-download scheme and later acquired BigStockPhoto to extend their presence in pay-per-download niche. Newcomer Cutcaster.com extended the pricing model by introducing a model where contributors could set their start price or could choose to use a pricing algorithm and they allowed a buyer to pay the price shown or bid on the content and name their price. Microstock prices were significantly adjusted several times by the respective agencies in the last three years across multiple sites. Many microstock agencies started to sell video in addition to static pictures, and some started to sell sound clips.\n\n2011 marked the first signs of microstock photographers becoming a field of professionals. Photographers with large, market-relevant, or high-quality portfolios now often collaborate with each other and negotiate with less-established agencies for better commissions or search positioning, and the increasing popularity among photographers of photography portfolio management solutions to increase their throughput and improve metadata quality to better align with principles of SEO in image search algorithms.\n\nIn 2012, Shutterstock became the first microstock agency to complete an initial public offering. The agency now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SSTK.\n\nIn December 2014 Adobe acquired Fotolia for 800 million in cash.\n\nEach microstock agency uses a different pricing and payment scheme. In some instances the same photo can have several prices. Photographers can upload the same pictures on multiple sites or, with some agencies, become an exclusive supplier and receive an increased commission and additional benefits.\n\nThere is no fee to post photos on a microstock agency website. However, microstock agencies do not accept all submitters or all photographs. Each employs a team of reviewers who check every picture submitted for legal issues and technical quality, as well as artistic and commercial merit. Photographers add keywords that help potential buyers filter and find pictures of interest.\n\nSome professional photographers who do not participate believe that microstock devalues the practice of photography, and that the business model is unsustainable. They see the growth of microstock sites as reducing their own incomes. In 2015, hundreds of microstock contributors joined together to create the open-source Symbiostock project and associated Symzio agency in an effort to offset this devaluation through independently controlled pricing.\n\nA development that counters these critical opinions is the advance of on-demand photography (or crowd sourced photography, photography marketplaces, etc.). With the higher penetration of smartphones with ever-better cameras, most amateurs can create high quality photography wherever they are. Crowd photo services like CrowdFoto.net or imagebrief.com try to tap into this vast potential by giving clients the possibility to publish a request (or briefing) that can be picked up and worked on by literally everybody who finds the briefing on their platform. These services reinstate the traditional model of a client asking a photographer to create a photo, but make use of the broadened number of amateur photographers.\n\n"}
{"id": "2338892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2338892", "title": "Minority rights", "text": "Minority rights\n\nMinority rights are the normal individual rights as applied to members of racial, ethnic, class, religious, linguistic or gender and sexual minorities; and also the collective rights accorded to minority groups. Minority rights may also apply simply to individual rights of anyone who is not part of a majority decision.\n\nCivil rights movements often seek to ensure that individual rights are not denied on the basis of membership in a minority group, such as global women's rights and global LGBT rights movements, or the various racial minority rights movements around the world (such as the Civil Rights Movement in the United States).\n\nThe issue of minority rights was first raised in 1814, at the Congress of Vienna, which discussed the fate of German Jews and especially of the Poles who were once again partitioned up. The Congress expressed hope that Prussia, Russia, and Austria would grant tolerance and protection to their minorities, which ultimately they disregarded, engaging in organized discrimination.\n\nThe 1856 Congress of Paris paid special attention to the status of Jews and Christians in the Ottoman Empire. In Britain, William Gladstone made the massacres of Bulgarians by the Ottoman Empire a major campaign issue and demanded international attention. The Congress of Berlin in 1878 dealt with the status of Jews in Romania, especially, and also Serbia, and Bulgaria.\n\nOn the whole, the 19th century congresses failed to impose significant reforms. Russia was especially active in protecting Orthodox Christians and Slavic peoples under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Persecution or discrimination against specific minorities was increasingly the subject of media attention, and the Jews began to organize to protest the pogroms in Russia. However, there was little international outrage regarding treatment of other minorities, such as black people in the southern United States.\n\nThe first minority rights were proclaimed and enacted by the revolutionary Parliament of Hungary in July 1849. Minority rights were codified in Austrian law in 1867.\n\nAt the Versailles Peace Conference the Supreme Council established 'The Committee on New States and for The Protection of Minorities'. All the new successor states were compelled to sign minority rights treaties as a precondition of diplomatic recognition. It was agreed that although the new states had been recognized, they had not been 'created' before the signatures of the final peace treaties. The issue of German and Polish rights was a point of dispute as Polish rights in Germany remained unprotected, unlike the German minority in Poland. Like other principles adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations; like the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure, they remained the basis of international law. After World War II, the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.\n\nMinority rights, as applying to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities and indigenous peoples, are an integral part of international human rights law. Like children's rights, women's rights and refugee rights, minority rights are a legal framework designed to ensure that a specific group which is in a vulnerable, disadvantaged or marginalized position in society, is able to achieve equality and is protected from persecution. The first postwar international treaty to protect minorities, designed to protect them from the greatest threat to their existence, was the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n\nSubsequent human rights standards that codify minority rights include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 27), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, two Council of Europe treaties (the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages), and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Copenhagen Document of 1990.\n\nMinority rights cover protection of existence, protection from discrimination and persecution, protection and promotion of identity, and participation in political life. For the rights of LGBT people, the Yogyakarta Principles have been approved by the United Nations Human Rights Council. For the rights of persons with disabilities, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has been adopted by United Nations General Assembly.\n\nTo protect minority rights, many countries have specific laws and/or commissions or ombudsman institutions (for example the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for National and Ethnic Minorities Rights).\n\nWhile initially, the United Nations treated indigenous peoples as a sub-category of minorities, there is an expanding body of international law specifically devoted to them, in particular Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (adopted 14 September 2007).\n\nIn 2008, a declaration on LGBT rights was presented in the UN General Assembly, and in 2011, a LGBT rights resolution was passed in the United Nations Human Rights Council (\"See LGBT rights at the United Nations\").\n\nThere are many political bodies which also feature minority group rights, which might be seen in affirmative action quotas or in guaranteed minority representation in a consociational state.\n\nThe direct role of the European Union (and also the law of the EU/EC) in the area of protection of national minorities is still very limited (likewise the general protection of human rights). The EU has relied on general international law and a European regional system of international law (based on the Council of Europe, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, etc.) and in a case of necessity accepted their norms. But the “de-economisation of European integration”, which started in the 1990s, is changing this situation. The political relevance of national minorities' protection is very high.\n\nNow (2009), although protection of the national minorities has not become a generally accepted legally binding principle of the EU, in several legal acts issues of national minorities are mentioned. In external relations protection of national minorities became one of the main criteria for cooperation with the EU or accession.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name Ordbogen means \"the dictionary\" in Danish.\n\nOrdbogen A/S itself comprises several products: Two dictionary sites, Ordbogen.com and the forthcoming international site Lemma.com, and two online teaching resources Grammatip.com (grammar and spelling) and Educas.com, (all subjects of the Danish school system, 1st-10th grade). Ordbogen.com, Grammatip.com and Educas.com are all aimed at the Danish market, whereas Lemma.com targets the international market with dictionaries written in 45 languages. As of May 2016, the company has grown to more than 100 employees (with the goal of recruiting 30 more by 2017). Ordbogen has employees spanning 15 nationalities, who speak 20 different languages. The company was awarded six consecutive Børsen Gazelle Awards (2008-2013), which are awarded to the fastest growing companies in Denmark.\n\nIn 2001, Michael Walther, Bjarni Norddahl, Thomas Thomsen and Jacob Hatt founded the company Cool Systems ApS. Their associated website, coolsms.dk became one of the biggest websites in Denmark at that point in time, with 266,000 visits a day. The website allowed people to send text messages online at a lower price than the telephone companies’ usual price. Shortly after the release of coolsms.dk, Thomas Thomsen and Jacob Hatt left the company. In 2003, the remaining founders, Michael Walther and Bjarni Norddahl, went on to change Cool Systems ApS to Ordbogen ApS, and later, converted to a public limited liability company - Ordbogen A/S. 2003 was also the year when Ordbogen A/S released Ordbogen.com - the first subscription-based dictionary website in Denmark, offering easy access to a high-quality Danish-English/English-Danish dictionary, edited by Jørgen Rohde, translator and editor.\n\nBy 2005, the company replaced the previous dictionary with a new version tailored for web use, which was the company's first self-produced dictionary. That same year, Ordbogen also became strategic partners with the Centre for Lexicography at Aarhus University in order to publish their dictionary \"Den Danske Netordbog\" (Engl.: “the Danish Internet Dictionary”).\n\nA year later, in 2006, Ordbogen A/S released their second bilingual and self-produced dictionary, Danish-German/German-Danish.\n\nDuring this period, Ordbogen received the Børsen Gazelle award six years in a row. In 2010, Ordbogen acquired the online grammar teaching system Grammatip, and that same year they entered into another strategic partnership with the publishers JP/Politikens Hus, followed by the Danish Language Council, Dansk Sprognævn, in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, Grammatip was merged with Ordbogen A/S. This was also the year that the online school platform Educas was launched. Educas had developed from Vikartimen, a teachers’ resource previously bought by Ordbogen A/S, whose name and concept was changed and further digitised.\n\n2012 was also the year that Ordbogen became strategic partners with Oxford Dictionaries as well as German publishers Duden Schulbuch and Cornelsen Verlag, while 2013 was the year work started on Lemma.com.\n\nIn recent years, Ordbogen.com has undergone significant development, and in 2016 many new additions to the staff were made. Ordbogen is currently in the process of expanding to international markets through their development of an international version of Ordbogen.com, the site Lemma.com.\n\nOrdbogen's flagship product is Ordbogen.com which, due to its international collaboration, makes Ordbogen.com the largest dictionary website in Denmark. Ordbogen has more than 100 dictionaries including:\nAnd other dictionaries such as:\nAnd also dictionaries within such fields and subjects as:\n\nThe app Ordbogen Online offers the same services as the website.\n\nGrammatip is an online educational tool for teaching Danish, English, German and French grammar and spelling to Danish elementary and secondary school children as well as to adults and foreigners. It is a dynamic product as new assignments are added to it every week. Users have the opportunity to suggest changes and edits, which Grammatip then incorporates when creating new categories and exercises. Grammatip covers several exercises such as:\n\nEducas is a web-based educational portal with thousands of exercises for all mandatory subjects and interdisciplinary themes for the public Danish elementary and secondary level school system (the “folkeskole”). The site is updated daily with new exercises. Educas.com and Grammatip.com are both online resources, and assignments are both given and completed online. Educas allows teachers to apply the site as a digital ”blackboard”, and several times a year theme weeks are held that combine school topics with current events. The assignments are searchable through the Danish “Fælles Mål” (Engl. “common goals”), which are the official competence goals for the different school subjects at different grade levels of the “folkeskole”. Folkeskole courses include: \n\nLemma is the international version of Ordbogen.com and is currently under development. It will offer dictionaries from Ordbogen.com as well as from publishers such as Oxford Duden, Duden Verlag, K Dictionaries, and Cornelsen Verlag. Lemma will offer a lot of the same dictionaries as Ordbogen, but with such additions as: \n\nAccording to their website, Ordbogen values creativity, flexibility, ambition, and responsibility:\n\n”Here at Ordbogen we emphasise work/life balance and are fairly certain that our work culture defies the norm in every aspect. Need a brain break? Play fetch with the office dog. Challenge your coworkers to a game of MarioKart. Build some lego. Take 10 minutes for a yoga retreat in our yoga room. Blow off some steam at our ritual ‘Friday’s Bar’. Come skydiving with us. Travel the world with your team for a company conference. We know that our employees are the backbone of our business, of our success - and we make sure our workplace environment reflects that.”\n\nOrdbogen was awarded as a Gazelle company 6 years in a row (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) by the Danish business newspaper Børsen. The Gazelle award is given to Denmark's fastest growing companies. A gazelle is defined as a company which: \"[...] has achieved a continuous growth in revenue or gross profit for the last four financial years, and which has, in total, more than doubled the revenue or the gross profit in the period\".\n\nIn 2013, Ordbogen set a Guinness World Record for world's largest dictionary, with a book measuring 4.62 m (15 ft 1.89 in) and 89,471 pages. The book encompasses the 46 dictionaries which were available on www.ordbogen.com at the time.\n\nAccording to Ordbogen.com's own references, a great many Danish companies and media outlets have recommended them, including Amnesty International Danmark, GlaxoSmithKline Danmark, and the news department of the national broadcaster Danmarks Radio, which have applied Ordbogen.com for their translation and language needs since 2005.

Kennedy. The limousine is the car in which Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy were passengers when the President was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.\n\nFollowing Kennedy's assassination, the car received significant armor plating and a bullet-proof hardtop and its navy blue exterior was painted black. It resumed its role as a presidential limousine for President Lyndon B. Johnson until 1967 and later remained in service until 1978, when it was sent to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nSS-100-X was originally a standard 1961 Lincoln Continental four door convertible (model 74A) built by the Ford Motor Company and assembled at the Wixom, Michigan plant. It had a retail price of $7,347 (equivalent to $, as of ).\n\nThe car was moved to the Experimental Garage at the Ford Proving Grounds where an additional 41 inches was added between the front and rear doors and just beyond the rear doors. The car's frame was strengthened to accommodate the additional length and weight. It was painted a special navy blue color and taken to Hess & Eisenhardt of Cincinnati, Ohio, for reupholstering and further modifications to Secret Service specifications. During the refit the car had no bulletproof or bullet-resistant additions added. The windshield remained the standard two-ply safety glass which could be easily replaced at any dealership.\n\nIt was first delivered to the White House on June 15, 1961 and measured long, had a wheelbase of , was wide, and high. It weighed , up from factory weight, and was powered by a hand-built 350-horsepower Ford MEL engine.\n\nAn open car, the Lincoln was equipped with an assortment of tops, including a snap-together bubble top, a black cover for the bubble, a formal rear top and a stainless steel forward section (none of which were bulletproof). It also featured two-way radio telephones and retractable steps and grab-handles for Secret Service agents. No armor plate was added to the bodywork, but the undercarriage and all suspension components were strengthened. A hydraulically-lifted rear seat was fitted. At the time of the assassination, the Lincoln had been fitted with a 1962-model front clip (fenders, hood, grille and bumper assemblies).\n\nIt had a special short-turn radius, , compared to on the 1950 Eisenhower \"bubbletop\" which had been its predecessor. Total cost of modifications was approximately $200,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The limousine was registered to the Ford Motor Company and was leased to the Secret Service for a nominal fee of $500 per year (equivalent to $ in ).\n\nThe limousine carried the District of Columbia license plate GG 300. In November 2015, the license plates were sold at auction for $100,000.\n\nOn November 21, 1963 SS-100-X was loaded onto a Fairchild C-123 Provider piloted by Captain Thomason of the 76th Air Transport Squadron and flown to San Antonio and then onto Dallas Love Field where it was stored in an underground car park.\n\nFollowing the shooting of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at approximately 12:30 pm, SS-100-X was driven to Parkland Memorial Hospital. The Plexiglas bubble top and cloth cover were then attached. Later that afternoon at 3:30 pm CST, the limousine was taken to Love Field and loaded on a Lockheed C-130 Hercules and flown to Andrews Air Force Base, Washington DC, landing at 8 pm EST. After arrival at Andrews AFB, the limo was delivered to the White House garage. The Secret Service and later the FBI took photos of the limo's interior and searched it for evidence before it was thoroughly cleaned and valeted.\n\nIn late December 1963, the car was sent back to Hess & Eisenhardt to be modified further, and was rebuilt from the ground up. For protection, the Lincoln received titanium armor plating, bullet-resistant glass and a bulletproof permanent roof. Solid aluminium rims were also fitted inside the tires to make them flat-proof. It remained in service for an additional eight years, logging 50,000 miles on the ground and over one million miles being flown to and from its destinations. The vehicle was equipped with Presidential lap robes and mouton carpeting and a complete communications system including radio patch to the White House. It was replaced in 1967 and remained in service doing less important duties until 1978, when it was retired to the Henry Ford Museum. Finished originally in navy blue, the car was repainted black after the assassination, then repainted again after each assignment.\n\nFormer Secret Service agent Clint Hill, who leapt onto the limousine directly after Kennedy was shot, is the last surviving passenger of the presidential limousine during the assassination.\n\n"}

{"id": "5846630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5846630", "title": "Smithsonian Folkways", "text": "Smithsonian Folkways\n\nSmithsonian Folkways is the nonprofit record label of the Smithsonian Institution. It is a part of the Smithsonian's Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, located at Capital Gallery in downtown Washington, D.C. The label was founded in 1987 after the family of Moses Asch, founder of Folkways Records, donated the entire Folkways Records label to the Smithsonian. The donation was made on the condition that the Institution continue Asch's policy that each of the more than 2,000 albums of Folkways Records remain in print forever, regardless of sales. Since then, the label has expanded on Asch's vision of documenting the sounds of the world, adding six other record labels to the collection, as well as releasing over 300 new recordings. Some well-known artists have contributed to the Smithsonian Folkways collection, including Pete Seeger, Ella Jenkins, Woody Guthrie, and Lead Belly. Famous songs include \"This Land Is Your Land\", \"Goodnight, Irene\", and \"Midnight Special.\" Due to the unique nature of its recordings, which include an extensive collection of traditional American music, children's music, and international music, Smithsonian Folkways has become an important collection to the musical community, especially to ethnomusicologists, who utilize the recordings of \"people's music\" from all over the world.\n\nThe Smithsonian Folkways Recordings label arose when the Smithsonian acquired a vast collection of recordings from Folkways Records, maintained by Moses Asch. The original 2,168 titles produced by Folkways Records now make up the bulk of the label's collection.\n\nIn 1905, Moses \"Moe\" Asch was born in Poland. His father, Sholem Asch, a successful author, made enough money to move the family to Paris in 1912. In 1914, Sholem left Paris for work in New York City and, a year later, sent for his family. The experience at Ellis Island was traumatic for 10-year-old Moe, and, based on his own account, memory was seared into his mind. Sholem believed in educating his fellow man through his literature, and Moe showed that same passion through his chosen career of audio engineering.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Asch studied radio engineering in Germany, a center for the new science. When he returned to the United States, he worked for various electronic firms before opening his own radio repair business, Radio Labs, during the Great Depression. In this business, Moe built equipment for radio stations and installed recorders for air use. Asch wrote in a 1961 article, \"Forming one of the first independent record companies it was natural for me to want to record folk music and people's expression of their wants, needs and experiences.\"\n\nIn 1940, Sholem invited his son with him to New Jersey to meet physicist and humanitarian Albert Einstein, who encouraged Moe to record and document the sounds of the world, which Asch took to be his life calling. Soon after that meeting, in early 1940, Asch founded \"Asch Records\" with a small staff and studio located in downtown Manhattan, New York. He allowed any artist to come and record at no charge, in contrast to bigger studios that charged artists fees for using recording equipment. Because of his open-door policy, Asch attracted many young and/or unique \"would-be\" artists. Due to the American Federation of Musicians' 1942 strike against major record labels, small labels such as Asch's filled the void in sales for distributors. The label grew and became more successful through deals with other producers, including Norman Granz. This partnership proved successful, leading to the concept of recording live concerts. These recordings came close to Asch's vision of documenting \"real\" sound, and, because there were no studio fees, were less expensive to produce. Around this time, Asch began another record label, Disc Records, though this fell through in a short time. Asch received recordings from Granz of an up-and-coming pianist named Nat Cole, which he decided to issue on a record in fall 1946. He invested a large amount of money in publicity and advertising, for the first time attempting to break into the pop charts. Due to a snowstorm, shipping was delayed past the holiday rush, causing Asch Records to fall into bankruptcy. As one of the terms of his bankruptcy, Asch was barred from starting another label. To get around this, in July 1948, Marian Distler, Asch's longtime assistant, became the president of a new label, Folkways Records and Service Corporation. Asch was hired as her \"consultant,\" and Folkways Records was created. It was at this time that Asch created his plan for keeping all of the Folkways records in print, regardless of demand. In this way, he figured that demand, though small, would continue for decades. He famously remarked, \"Just because the letter \"J\" is less popular than the letter \"S\", you don't take it out of the dictionary.\"\n\nFolkways Records released over 2,000 recordings between the years 1949 and 1987, spanning many genres, including jazz, folk, classical, avant-garde, and world music. Over the years of Folkways Records, Asch recorded some of the biggest names in music, including Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Pete Seeger, Duke Ellington, James P. Johnson, Dizzy Gillespie, John Cage, and Charles Ives. Reissues of the early blues and folk recordings from Folkways, such as Harry Smith's well-known \"Anthology of American Folk Music\", fueled several generations of folk revivals, inspiring young musicians such as Dave van Ronk, Peter, Paul, and Mary, and Bob Dylan.\n\nIn 1984, looking for someone to continue the Folkways Records collection after him, Asch found Ralph Rinzler, who was then artistic director of the Smithsonian's annual Folklife Festival. Asch saw that the Smithsonian had the power to keep the collection alive and keep the sounds of the world in the people's hands. Asch stipulated one main condition: that every recording was to remain \"in print\" forever, regardless of its sales. It was the way that he began the label, and he felt that the people deserved to have the sounds of the world preserved. There was opposition to the transfer, with some members of the Smithsonian citing the Folkways collection's \"uneven quality\" and \"balance of repertory.\" Despite these criticisms, Rinzler persevered, and negotiations with Asch continued. Asch died in 1986 before the deal was completed, but his family finished the passing of the Folkways Records to the Smithsonian in 1987.\n\nThe collection became known as the Moses and Frances Asch Collection, part of the Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections housed in the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. The recordings on other labels, including Paredon Records, Cook, Collector, Dyer-Bennet, Fast Folk, Monitor, M.O.R.E. The Mickey Hart Collection, Arhoolie Records, and Bobby Susser Songs For Children have since been added to the collection.\n\nAfter the creation of the collection in the Smithsonian Archives, only two full-time positions were funded. Rinzler recruited Anthony Seeger, well known in the ethnomusicology community as director of the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University, as director, and a full-time archivist, Jeff Place. The Smithsonian also stipulated a condition regarding the transfer: if they accepted the label, it would have to support itself through its sales. Seeger and Place had no experience running a record label, but took on the project. Though they could not retain all of Asch's business practices, they managed to preserve the essence of Folkways Records while creating the new label, Smithsonian Folkways. The label now relies on a small team of full-time staff, part-time staff, interns, and volunteers to continue the mission of Smithsonian Folkways.\n\nSmithsonian Folkways is engaged in several projects dedicated to increasing the awareness and use of their recordings, as well as the preservation of them.\n\nAs part of their mission in spreading the sounds of the world, Smithsonian Folkways has made the recordings of their archives available digitally in various ways, in addition to retail distribution of CDs (some titles Manufactured on Demand) and LPs.\n\nIn February 2005, Smithsonian Folkways launched Smithsonian Global Sound, an online MP3 music store, similar to programs such as Apple's iTunes. The entire collection was made available online, at the cost of $0.99 per track. Smithsonian Folkways pays royalties to all the artists (and if the artists cannot be found, the money is put in escrow). The purpose of the brand name Smithsonian Global Sound has been altered to provide the entire collection online for streaming for subscribing institutions, such as universities, via the Smithsonian Global Sound for Libraries service, a co-production with Alexander Street Press.\n\nSmithsonian Folkways now offers the entire Folkways collection for digital download through its website, at $0.99 for most songs and $9.99 for most albums, available in both MP3 and FLAC format. In addition, Smithsonian Folkways distributes digitally via outlets such as iTunes and eMusic.\n\nIn 2011 Smithsonian Folkways released a new Jazz anthology to update their previous release, the 1973 Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz. The anthology includes 111 tracks on six discs, held within a 200-page compilation of historical essays, musical analyses, and contemporary photographs of the musicians.\n\nIn 2012 Smithsonian Folkways released \"\", a 150-page large-format book with 3 CDs containing 57 tracks, including Woody Guthrie's most important recordings such as the complete version of \"This Land Is Your Land,\" \"Pretty Boy Floyd,\" \"I Ain't Got No Home in This World Anymore,\" and \"Riding in My Car.\"\n\nfolkwaysAlive! was a partnership between Smithsonian Folkways and the University of Alberta established in 2002–2003 by professors Regula Qureshi and Michael Frishkopf with support from then VP Research Gary Kachanoski, aiming to create a \"national centre of musical and cultural excellence.\" Originally conceived as a part of the Canadian Centre for Ethnomusicology, folkwaysAlive! subsequently operated independently within the University of Alberta's Faculty of Arts. The mission was to create a research center for the music of the cultures of Alberta and western Canada, as well as cultures from around the world. The center invited local and visiting musicians and artists to present lectures and workshops. The partnership concluded December 31, 2016. As a consequence, folkwaysAlive! no longer exists at the University of Alberta, but has been superseded by a more broadly-conceived entity, the Sound Studies Initiative.\n\nIn 2003, Smithsonian Folkways, in conjunction with the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, began a project called \"Save Our Sounds\" that aims at preserving the sounds vital to our nation's history which are deteriorating, such as Thomas Edison's recordings made on wax cylinders and others done on acetate discs in the early 20th century. The \"Save America's Treasures\" program initiated by the White House Millennium Council awarded a matching grant of $750,000 for the project. The goal of the project is to expose the nation to the need for sound preservation, and to protect the most important and \"priceless\" records from the combined collections.\n\nSmithsonian Folkways and its collection of labels have earned a variety of awards and honors including 7 Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy award, 10 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Awards, and 19 Independent Music Awards.\n\n"}

It is located on a 25 by 100 foot plot at the corners of Center Street and Court Place. It was built in a modified Greek Revival style which is most apparent in the eyebrow windows located on the third level of the home. The main floor of the original structure included a side hall entry with two adjoining formal parlors. The second floor originally housed three large bedrooms. The third parlor was added onto the western side of the structure sometime after 1840. Two more bedrooms were the added above the third parlor. The basement of the structure houses both a functioning 1830's kitchen and what was once the home's dining room. The adjoining General Store was built as a series of additions between 1840 and 1870.\n\nStephen Dover Stephens, born in 1808, was the original owner. He owned the home and operated the store between 1837 and 1870. He was married to Elizabeth Johnson in 1829 at Saint Andrew's Church, which is also located in Richmondtown. Their five children Stephen Dover Jr., William James, Lucretia, Mary Elizabeth Jr, and Charlotte Ann were all baptized at that same church.\n\nIn 1870 both the home and the connected store were sold to Mary and Joseph Black. The Stephens family then moved up the road to the Stephens Prior House. Mr and Mrs. Stephens both resided there until their deaths in 1883. The Black family raised eleven children in the home and their family operated the store until 1926. In 1926 the remaining members of the Black family sold the store to Willet and Bertha Conner whom operated a post office in the store until the time of the Second World War. After which the house was separated into two apartments and rented until the mid-1960s when it became property of Historic Richmond Town.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53412768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53412768", "title": "Vault 7", "text": "Vault 7\n\nVault 7 is a series of documents that WikiLeaks began to publish on 7 March 2017, that detail activities and capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare. The files, dated from 2013–2016, include details on the agency's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera Software ASA), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nIn February 2017, WikiLeaks began teasing the release of \"Vault 7\" with a series of cryptic messages on Twitter, according to media reports. Later on in February, WikiLeaks released classified documents describing how the CIA monitored the 2012 French presidential election. The press release for the leak stated that it was published \"as context for its forthcoming CIA Vault 7 series.\"\n\nIn March 2017, US intelligence and law enforcement officials said to the international wire agency Reuters that they have been aware of the CIA security breach, which led to Vault 7, since late-2016. Two officials said they were focusing on \"contractors\" as the possible source of the leaks.\n\nIn 2017, federal law enforcement identified CIA software engineer Joshua Adam Schulte as a suspected source of Vault 7.\n\nThe first batch of documents named \"Year Zero\" was published by WikiLeaks on 7 March 2017, consisting of 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which already contains more pages than former NSA contractor and leaker, Edward Snowden's NSA release. WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had \"circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\" According to WikiLeaks, the source \"wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons\" since these tools raise questions that \"urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.\"\n\nWikiLeaks redacted names and other identifying information from the documents before their release, while attempting to allow for connections between people to be drawn via unique identifiers generated by WikiLeaks. It also said that it would postpone releasing the source code for the cyber weapons, which is reportedly several hundred million lines long, \"until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed this was only part of a larger series.\n\nThe CIA released a statement saying, \"The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists or other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.\"\n\nAssange held a press conference on 9 March to offer to share unpublished data from Vault 7 with technology companies to enable them to fix vulnerabilities detailed therein. He stated that only 1% of the total leak has been released and that much of the remainder of the leak included unpatched vulnerabilities but that he was working with Microsoft, Apple and Google to get these vulnerabilities patched as he would not release information which would put the public at risk, and as fixes were released by manufacturers he would release details of vulnerabilities. As such, none of the vulnerabilities currently released are zero-day exploits. In this press release Assange also read an official statement by Microsoft which stated Microsoft's desire for the \"next Geneva Convention\" which would protect people from government cyber weapons the same way the previous Geneva Conventions have protected noncombatants from warfare.\n\nIn a statement issued on 19 March 2017, Assange said the technology companies who had been contacted had not agreed, disagreed or questioned what he termed as WikiLeaks' standard industry disclosure plan. The standard disclosure time for a vulnerability is 90 days after the company responsible for patching the software is given full details of the flaw. According to WikiLeaks, only Mozilla had been provided with information on the vulnerabilities, while \"Google and some other companies\" only confirmed receiving the initial notification. WikiLeaks stated: \"Most of these lagging companies have conflicts of interest due to their classified work with US government agencies. In practice such associations limit industry staff with US security clearances from fixing holes based on leaked information from the CIA. Should such companies choose to not secure their users against CIA or NSA attacks users may prefer organizations such as Mozilla or European companies that prioritize their users over government contracts\".\n\nOn 23 March 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 2 \"Dark Matter\". That publication includes documentation for several CIA efforts to hack Apple's iPhones and Macs.\n\nOn 31 March 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 3 \"Marble\". It contained 676 source code files for the CIA's Marble Framework. It is used to obfuscate, or scramble, malware code in an attempt to make it so that anti-virus firms or investigators cannot understand the code or attribute its source. According to WikiLeaks, the code also included a de-obfuscator to reverse the obfuscation effects.\n\nOn 7 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 4 dubbed \"Grasshopper\". The publication contains 27 documents from the CIA's Grasshopper framework, which is used by the CIA to build customized and persistent malware payloads for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Grasshopper focused on Personal Security Product (PSP) avoidance. PSPs are antivirus software such as MS Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint or Kaspersky IS.\n\nOn 14 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 5, titled \"HIVE\". Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its \"Embedded Development Branch\" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing HTTPS interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks. Also called Listening Post (LP), and Command and Control (C2). All of the above while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public domains. This masking interface is known as \"Switchblade\".\n\nOn 21 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 6, code-named \"Weeping Angel\". Which is a hacking tool co-developed by the CIA and MI5. Used to exploit a series of smart TVs for the purpose of covert intelligence gathering. Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware and coordinated their work in Joint Development Workshops. As of this part 6 publication, \"Weeping Angel\" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, Dr. Who, alongside \"Sonic Screwdriver\" in \"Dark Matter\".\n\nOn 28 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 7 \"Scribbles\". The leak includes documentation and source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to whistleblowers and journalists by embedding web beacon tags into classified documents to trace who leaked them. The tool affects Microsoft Office documents, specifically \"Microsoft Office 2013 (on Windows 8.1 x64), documents from Office versions 97-2016 (Office 95 documents will not work!) [and d]ocuments that are not [locked], encrypted, or password-protected\". When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the agency's server is loaded, generating a HTTP request. The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. This is only overridden when a user enables editing.\n\nOn 5 May 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 8 \"Archimedes\". According to U.S. SANS Institute instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed \"Fulcrum\". According to cyber security expert and ENISA member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect local area network (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as man-in-the-middle (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.\n\nOn 12 May 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 9 \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\". AfterMidnight is a malware installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a DLL file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a Windows service process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to backdoor Trojan behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on Windows operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.\n\nOn 19 May 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 10 \"Athena\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released Windows 10 with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \"Athena\" malware and its secondary malware named \"Hera\" are similar in theory to Grasshopper and AfterMidnight malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a New Hampshire private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a Bloomberg 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' Remote Access services, while Hera hijacks Windows Dnscache service. Also both Athena and Hera affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent DLL files to create a backdoor to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive computer security software. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks has not provided any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.\n\nOn 1 June 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 11 \"Pandemic\". This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for Server Message Block traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \"Pandemic\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, \"Pandemic\" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged. The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become \"Pandemic\" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.\n\nOn 15 June 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 12 \"Cherry Blossom\". \n\nOn 22 June 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 13 \"Brutal Kangaroo\". \n\nOn 28 June 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 14 \"Elsa\". \n\nOn 29 June 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 15 \"OutlawCountry\". \n\nOn 6 July 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 16 \"BothanSpy\". \n\nOn 13 July 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 17 \"Highrise\". \n\nUCL / Raytheon - 19 July 2017 \n\nImperial - 27 July 2017 \n\nDumbo - 3 August 2017 \n\nCouchPotato - 10 August 2017 \n\nExpressLane - 24 August 2017 \n\nAngelfire - 31 August 2017 \n\nProtego - 7 September 2017\n\nWhen asked about their authenticity, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Michael Hayden replied that the organization does \"not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents.\" However, speaking on condition of anonymity, current and former intelligence officials said that the documents appear to be genuine. Edward Snowden tweeted shortly after the documents' release that they looked authentic. Robert M. Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas and Director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), likened the Vault 7 to NSA hacking tools disclosed in 2016 by a group calling itself The Shadow Brokers.\n\nOn 15 March 2017, President Donald Trump stated during an interview that \"the CIA was hacked, and a lot of things taken\". The following day in a statement, Adam Schiff, the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a news release, \"In his effort to once again blame Obama, the President appeared to have discussed something that, if true and accurate, would otherwise be considered classified information.\" Schiff also said that the president has the power to declassify whatever he wants.\n\nWikiLeaks said that the documents came from \"an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in Langley, Virginia.\" The documents allowed WikiLeaks to partially determine the structure and organization of the CCI. The CCI reportedly has an entire unit devoted to compromising Apple products.\n\nThe cybersecurity firm Symantec analyzed Vault 7 documents and found some of the described software closely matched cyberattacks by \"Longhorn,\" which it had monitored since 2014. Symantec had previously suspected that \"Longhorn\" was government-sponsored and had tracked its usage against 40 targets in 16 countries.\n\nThe first portion of the documents made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 \"Year Zero\", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of Frankfurt as the starting point for hacking attacks on Europe, China and the Middle East. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its Consulate General Office in Frankfurt as a hacker base for cyber operations. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.\n\nThe chief Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe Peter Frank announced on 8 March 2017 that the government was conducting a preliminary investigation to see if it will launch a major probe into the activities being conducted out of the consulate and also more broadly whether people in Germany were being attacked by the CIA. Germany's foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel from the Social Democratic Party responded to the documents of Vault 7 \"Year Zero\" that the CIA used Frankfurt as a base for its digital espionage operations, saying that Germany did not have any information about the cyber attacks.\n\nThe documents reportedly revealed that the agency had amassed a large collection of cyberattack techniques and malware produced by other hackers. This library was reportedly maintained by the CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group, with examples of using these techniques and source code contained in the \"Umbrage Component Library\" git repository. According to WikiLeaks, by recycling the techniques of third-parties through UMBRAGE, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attacks, but can also mislead forensic investigators by disguising these attacks as the work of other groups and nations. Among the techniques borrowed by UMBRAGE was the file wiping implementation used by Shamoon. According to \"PC World\", some of the techniques and code snippets have been used by CIA in its internal projects, whose end result cannot be inferred from the leaks. \"PC World\" noted that the practice of planting \"false flags\" to deter attribution was not a new development in cyberattacks: Russian, North Korean and Israeli hacker groups are among those suspected of using false flags.\n\nAccording to a study by Kim Zetter in \"The Intercept\", UMBRAGE was probably much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags. Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security told \"The Intercept\" that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is \"extremely public\", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: \"What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. [...] Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a false flag operation. They're not trying to say 'We're going to make this look like Russia'.\"\n\nOn the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as \"a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,\" and tweeted, \"CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating false flag attacks.\" A conspiracy theory soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Conservative commentators such as Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio show. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Vault 7 showed that \"the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them.\"\n\nCybersecurity writers, such as Ben Buchanan and Kevin Poulsen, were skeptical of those theories. Poulsen wrote, \"The leaked catalog isn't organized by country of origin, and the specific malware used by the Russian DNC hackers is nowhere on the list.\"\n\nThe documents describe the Marble framework, a string obfuscator used to hide text fragments in malware from visual inspection. As part of the program, foreign languages were used to cover up the source of CIA hacks. According to WikiLeaks, it reached 1.0 in 2015 and was used by the CIA throughout 2016.\n\nIn its release, WikiLeaks described the primary purpose of \"Marble\" as to insert foreign language text into the malware to mask viruses, trojans and hacking attacks, making it more difficult for them to be tracked to the CIA and to cause forensic investigators to falsely attribute code to the wrong nation. The source code revealed that Marble had examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Persian. These were the languages of the US's main cyber-adversaries – China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.\n\nAnalysts called WikiLeaks' description of Marble's main purpose inaccurate, telling \"The Hill\" its main purpose was probably to avoid detection by antivirus programs.\n\nMarble also contained a deobfuscator tool with which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation.\n\nSecurity researcher Nicholas Weaver from International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley told the Washington Post: \"This appears to be one of the most technically damaging leaks ever done by WikiLeaks, as it seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations.\"\n\nHammerDrill is a CD/DVD collection tool that collects directory walks and files to a configured directory and filename pattern as well as logging CD/DVD insertion and removal events. v2.0 adds a gap jumping capability that Trojans 32-bit executables as they are being burned to disc by Nero. Additionally, v2.0 adds a status, termination and an on-demand collection feature controlled by HammerDrillStatus.dll, HammerDrillKiller.dll and HammerDrillCollector.dll. The logging now also fingerprints discs by hashing the first two blocks of the ISO image, which enables unique identification of multi-sessions discs even as data is added and removed. The log also logs anytime a HammerDrill trojaned binary is seen on a disc.\n\nAfter WikiLeaks released the first installment of Vault 7, \"Year Zero\", Apple stated that \"many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS,\" and that the company \"will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\"\n\nOn 23 March 2017, WikiLeaks released \"Dark Matter\", the second batch of documents in its Vault 7 series, detailing the hacking techniques and tools all focusing Apple products developed by the Embedded Development Branch (EDB) of the CIA. The leak also revealed the CIA had been targeting the iPhone since 2008, a year after the device was released. These EDB projects attacked Apple's firmware meaning that the attack code would persist even if the system gets rebooted. The \"Dark Matter\" archive included documents from 2009 and 2013. Apple issued a second statement assuring, that based on an \"initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released.\" Additionally, a preliminary assessment showed \"the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013\".\n\nOn 24 March 2017 WikiLeaks described Apple as \"duplicitous\" for saying it had fixed security flaws: \"Apple's claim that it has \"fixed\" all \"vulnerabilities\" described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous. EFI is a systemic problem, not a zero-day\". Echoing the lack of trust in Apple was the German-Finnish Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who wrote: \"Apple statement is not credible.\"\n\nWikiLeaks said on 19 March 2017 on Twitter that the \"CIA was secretly exploiting\" a vulnerability in a huge range of Cisco router models discovered thanks to the Vault 7 documents. The CIA had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco's widely used internet switches, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Cisco quickly reassigned staff from other projects to turn their focus solely on analyzing the attack and to figure out how the CIA hacking worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using similar methods.\n\nOn 20 March, Cisco researchers confirmed that their study of the Vault 7 documents showed the CIA had developed malware which could exploit a flaw found in 318 of Cisco's switch models and alter or take control of the network.\n\nCisco issued a warning on security risks, patches were not available, but Cisco provided mitigation advice.\n\nThe electronic tools can reportedly compromise both Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. By adding malware to the Android operating system, the tools could gain access to secure communications made on a device.\n\nAccording to WikiLeaks, once an Android smartphone is penetrated the agency can collect \"audio and message traffic before encryption is applied\". Some of the agency's software is reportedly able to gain access to messages sent by instant messaging services. This method of accessing messages differs from obtaining access by decrypting an already encrypted message. While the encryption of messengers that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Signal, wasn't reported to be cracked, their encryption can be bypassed by capturing input before their encryption is applied, by methods such as keylogging and recording the touch input from the user. Commentators, among them Snowden and cryptographer and security pundit Bruce Schneier, observed that Wikileaks incorrectly implied that the messaging apps themselves, and their underlying encryption, had been compromised - an implication which was in turn reported for a period by the New York Times and other mainstream outlets.\n\nOne document reportedly showed that the CIA was researching ways to infect vehicle control systems. WikiLeaks stated, \"The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\" This statement brought renewed attention to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings.\n\nThe documents refer to a \"Windows FAX DLL injection\" exploit in Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. This would allow a user with malicious intents to hide its own malware under the DLL of another application. However, a computer must have already been compromised through another method for the injection to take place.\n\nOn 7 March 2017, Edward Snowden comments on the importance of the release, stating that it reveals the United States Government to be \"developing vulnerabilities in US products\" and \"then intentionally keeping the holes open\", which he considers highly reckless.\n\nOn 7 March 2017, Nathan White, Senior Legislative Manager at the Internet advocacy group Access Now, writes:\n\nOn 8 March 2017, Lee Mathews, a contributor to \"Forbes\", wrote that most of the hacking techniques described in Vault 7 were already known to many cybersecurity experts.\n\nOn 8 March 2017, Some note that the revealed techniques and tools are most likely to be used for more targeted surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden. In a press conference Assange states that while the leaks' content \"at least means that they have to engage in targeted attacks which is more expensive and might have more order trail\" he also states they have exposed the CIA's \"automated implant branch\" which not just develops and uses viruses \"but also automates how that is done\" which may approach the level of bulk intersection.\n\nOn 8 April 2017, Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney calls it \"critical to understand\" that \"these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and cyber criminals around the world.\" Justin Cappos, professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University asks \"if the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?\".\n\nOn 8 April 2017, Cindy Cohn, executive director of the international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \"If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed.\" \"And worse, they then lost track of the information they had kept from you so that now criminals and hostile foreign governments know about your broken lock.\" Furthermore, she stated that the CIA had \"failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans.\" \"The freedom to have a private conversation – free from the worry that a hostile government, a rogue government agent or a competitor or a criminal are listening – is central to a free society\". While not as strict as privacy laws in Europe, the Fourth amendment to the US constitution does guarantee the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nOn 12 May 2017 Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, wrote \"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks,\" In other words, Smith expressed concern about the fact that the CIA have stockpiled such computer vulnerabilities, which in turn were stolen from them, while they failed to inform Microsoft in a timely fashion about their security breach, as a result the privacy and security of their customers around the world were potentially negatively affected for an extended period and caused widespread damage.\n\n"}
{"id": "43645037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43645037", "title": "Vector tiles", "text": "Vector tiles\n\nVector tiles, tiled vectors or vectiles are packets of geographic data, packaged into pre-defined roughly-square shaped \"tiles\" for transfer over the web. This is an emerging method for delivering styled web maps, combining certain benefits of pre-rendered raster map tiles with vector map data. As with the widely used raster tiled web maps, map data is requested by a client as a set of \"tiles\" corresponding to square areas of land of a pre-defined size and location. Unlike raster tiled web maps, however, the server returns vector map data, which has been clipped to the boundaries of each tile, instead of a pre-rendered map image.\n\nThere are several major advantages of this hybrid approach. Compared to an un-tiled vector map, the data transfer is reduced, because only data within the current viewport, and at the current zoom level needs to be transferred. The GIS clipping operations can all be performed in advance, as the tile boundaries are pre-defined. This in turn means that tiled vector data can be packaged up and distributed, without needing any kind of GIS system available to serve data.\n\nCompared to a tiled raster map, data transfer is also greatly reduced, as vector data is typically much smaller than a rendered bitmap. Also, styling can be applied later in the process, or even in the browser itself, allowing much greater flexibility in how data is presented. It is also easy to provide interactivity with map features, as their vector representation already exists within the client. Yet another benefit is that less centralised server processing power is required, since rasterisation can be performed directly in the client. This has been described as making \"rendering ... a last-mile problem, with fast, high-quality GPU[s] in everyone’s pocket\".\n\nThere is a long history of the use of vector tile schemes in GIS. A very early GIS (circa 1966), the Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS), used a vector tile storage scheme that allowed limited resource computers to efficiently access and process vector map data. CGIS used the term \"frame\" instead of vector tiles.\n\nIn 1975, the US Wildlife Service initiated a national program to map and digitize all the wetlands in the US. In 1976 they awarded a contract to Autometric to develop a software application that allowed stereo imagery to be digitized using an analytical stereo plotter. Later support for 2d digitization from single photos (aka single photo resection) on a digitizing table was added. The software was called WAMS (Wetlands Analytical Mapping System). The WAMS data store used a tiled vector structure. Each tile was called a “geounit”. A geounit corresponded to one of the USGS quadrangle scales, typically 1:24000. As the data were digitized, they were immediately stored in the tiled data store and topologically structured. Lines crossing geounit boundaries were automatically split. The storage Coordinate Reference System (CRS) was WGS 72 lat/long. WAMS is described in detail in “The wetlands analytical mapping system: WAMS\" [Pywell and Niedzwiadek, 1980]\n\nBuilding on the operational experience gained in implementing and using WAMS as well as from the Map Overlay and Statistical System (MOSS), in 1986 Autometric released a UNIX based commercial GIS that implemented an enhanced vector tile storage and access structure: DeltaMap (later GenaMap). The vector tile structure and capability is described in \"DeltaMap: Not just another GIS\". Where WAMS implemented a fixed tile system based on latitude/longitude 1:24000 quadrangles, DeltaMap allowed the user to define any size tile in any coordinate reference system (CRS). In this way, sparse data required only a few tiles whereas dense data could use much smaller tiles. R-trees were used as the indexing scheme for the vector tiles. In the late 1980's, Genasys further enhanced GenaMap to allow \"Continuous, seamless\" processing of the tiled layers. Basically, from the end user perspective, the tiles became invisible. This capability was true regardless of whether the user were editing, visualizing, querying, or analyzing the data.\n\nAs of early 2015, there is no dominant standard for vector tiles. Approaches can differ in their URL format, data serialisation format, packaging of styling information, and support for projections other than Web Mercator.\n\nMapbox has defined an open standard for vector map tiles called \"vector-tile-spec\" which uses Google protocol buffers for space-efficient data serialisation. Web Mercator is the projection of reference, but vector tiles may be used to represent data with any projection and tile extent scheme. It is also tied to the Mapnik rendering engine, using a \"serialized version of the internal data that Mapnik uses\".\n\nIn March 2015, Esri, the dominant geospatial software maker, announced that they would be supporting Mapbox's vector tiles standard in both server and client platforms.\n\nThis was an early format developed for the Mapnik renderer.\n\nThe approach followed by TileStache is to allow multiple data serialisation formats; as of early 2015, it supports GeoJSON, ArcJSON, GeoBSON, Arc GeoServices BSON, GeoAMF and Arc GeoServices BSON. The requested format is given in the URL (e.g., codice_1)\n\nVector tiles have been used by the Google Maps Android client since December 2010 and on the desktop client since 2013.\nVector tiles for rendering OpenStreetMap data were first proposed in March 2013 and are supported by Mapnik, the most widely used renderer of OpenStreetMap data. Mapbox, a commercial provider of custom cartography tools and hosting, has focused its cartography tool, Mapbox Studio, around vector tiles.\n\nThe popular, and very powerful, Android client for OpenStreetMap data, osmAnd supports vector tiles, which it calls \"vector maps\".\n\nThe tile server pipeline TileStache supports several flavours of JSON natively. There is also a plugin vector tile provider called VecTiles which converts PostGIS data into vector tiles in Mapnik Vector Tile format (incompatible with the Mapbox specification) or TopoJSON.\n\nPGRestAPI (also known as Chubbs Spatial Server) is a standalone NodeJS server which can also generate vector tiles on the fly from a PostGIS data source, as well as serving pre-generated vector tiles from sources such as Mapbox Studio.\n\nESRI ArcGIS Server 10.4 and ArcGIS Pro 1.2 released in February 2016 added support for vector tiles.\n\nThe Leaflet JavaScript library does not directly support vector tiles, but there are third-party plugin for vector tiles, Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile for Leaflet 0.7.x and Leaflet.VectorGrid for Leaflet 1.0.x.\n\nMapbox's own JavaScript library, Mapbox.js, can be used.\n\nOpenLayers supports vector tiles through the ol.source.VectorTile object, as of version 3.\n\n"}

It was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1911, who wrote; \"17. View of Amsterdam. The Amstel fills the right-hand side of the picture. In the centre is a canal bordered by a meadow. A ray of light illumines the town. In the sky are masses of storm-cloud. Canvas. Sale. Comte de Morny, Paris, May 24, 1852, No. 24 (3100 francs).\"\n\nAccording to Vereniging Rembrandt, the steeples in this painting are from left to right: Leidsepoort, Utrechtsepoort, Westerkerk, Stadhuis (Dam), Oude Kerk, Zuiderkerk, Portugees-Joodse Synagoge, 's Lands zeemagazijn, Weesperpoort, Oosterkerk. All of these buildings had been recently designed and built under the supervision of the city architect Daniël Stalpaert.\n\nThis scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period of Amsterdam and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.\n"}

He was brought up in Somerset, England, where his mother taught him to cook. He was educated at Wellington, a local public school, although he left at the age of sixteen. He joined the \"Bristol Evening Post\" as a cub reporter—where he worked alongside the future playwright Tom Stoppard. He was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment in 1963 as a second lieutenant, but his career there only lasted until 1966; he left military service and moved to London and then France, where he worked in several restaurants in various roles.\n\nIn 1971 he set up his first restaurant in Bristol—Floyd's Bistro—which proved popular enough for him to open three further outlets in the city. His burgeoning empire soon collapsed and he sailed around the Mediterranean for two years, from where he exported wine to the UK. He also opened a restaurant in the south of France, but this was also unsuccessful and it closed in 1979, when Floyd returned to the UK. He opened another Bristol-based restaurant and wrote a book—\"Floyd's Food\"—which was locally published in 1981; this led to a short recipe slot on the local Radio West station. In 1983 one of his customers—David Pritchard, a television producer—suggested to Floyd that he front a television series, which resulted in \"Floyd on Fish\", broadcast on BBC Two in late 1985. Several series followed on the BBC before the Floyd-Pritchard partnership broke up in 1993; a corresponding book appeared with each series. There were no scripts for the programmes, and Floyd ad-libbed throughout; when he ran out of words, he would sip from an ever-present glass of wine to give him time to create the next line. Pritchard's directing style and Floyd's presentation technique produced what the food writer Tom Jaine considers as \"cheerful mayhem\", although viewers were educated in basic techniques. He went on to say that \"Floyd's performances, on or near the stove, were a refreshing departure from the prissy, controlled style then in favour at the BBC, or the alternative mode of half an hour with a French chef whose incomprehensible English made the recipes a mystery.\"\n\nPaul Levy, Floyd's obituarist, considered the broadcaster had \"no outstanding talent, either as a cook or as a TV presenter, no great knowledge of his subject, or any apparent passion for anything but drink. This is not to say that his first TV programmes were bad – they were, indeed, highly diverting entertainment\". The programmes were also highly popular both with the public and other cooks. Following his death of heart disease in September 2009 several fellow chefs voiced their opinions of him. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall considers that Floyd \"cooked his ingredients with the love and passion of a gifted amateur\", while Heston Blumenthal opines that \"His enthusiasm, even when he was being a bit crotchety, jumped out of the screen. No-one made TV food programmes quite like him. He had a wealth of knowledge but there was a no-nonsense approach to it all\".\n\nFloyd had a one-man show, \"Floyd Uncorked: The Life of a Bon Viveur\". The show, which was unscripted, toured the British provinces in 2006 and 2007.\n\n"}
