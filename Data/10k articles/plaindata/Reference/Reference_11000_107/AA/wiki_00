Alongside Miyamoto Musashi's \"The Book of Five Rings\", it is one of the preeminent treatises on warfare in classical Japanese literature. Similar to Musashi's contemporary work, Munenori's has garnered appeal for its applicability beyond the warrior paradigm.\n\nThe book is divided into three chapters.“The Killing Sword” addresses force as a remedy to disorder and violence. The following “Life-Giving Sword” considers the role of prevention in conflict. Finally, in “No Sword”, the merits of using the environment's resources to one's fullest advantage are explored.\n\nThis chapter discusses strategies like how higher ground can give an advantage over your foes and how to use inclement weather to your advantage. There are several mentions of how uneven terrain can make all the difference in battle and how a simple thing like a loose stone can turn the table on your enemy.\n"}

Commissioner, 400 F.2d 981 (7th Cir. 1968) is a decision by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, in which the court, distinguishing from the holding in \"Schlude v. Commissioner\", held that accrual method taxpayers are not required to include prepayments in gross income when there is certainty as to when performance would occur.\n\nThe petitioner, an accrual method taxpayer, operated the Chicago White Sox professional baseball franchise using a fiscal year for federal income tax purposes. During the 1962 taxable year, the club sold single and season tickets to games to be played during the 1963 taxable year. The petitioner failed to report income from the sales on its 1962 return and instead reported the receipts as income in 1963.\n\nThe petitioner's decision to include income from its ticket sales in 1963, rather than 1962, was part of their practice of reporting income from ticket sales as the corresponding games were played.\n\nThe Commissioner argued that, in light of \"Schlude v. Commissioner\", the income should have been reported in the year in which the payment was received, the 1962 taxable year.\n\nMust the taxpayer include in gross income for 1962 the sale of proceeds received from tickets allocable to games to be played in 1963?\n\nNo. Despite the general rule that requires accrual method taxpayers to include advance payments in the year of receipt, the court carved out a narrow exception for taxpayers such as the petitioners, who are able to prove that services will be performed on fixed dates in one or more subsequent taxable years.\n\nGenerally, accrual method taxpayers include income in taxable year it is earned, rather than when it is received. However, the Supreme Court trilogy ending with \"Schlude\" required inclusion of prepayments in gross income because of the uncertainties as to when, or if, performance would occur. The court distinguished the facts of Artnell from this holding and found that the uncertainties present in previous cases that required the inclusion of advance payments in the year of receipt were not present. The Court found that the deferred income was attributable to games that were intended to be played on a fixed schedule and that notwithstanding rain delays there was certainty about when services would be performed. The court reasoned that there are some situations where deferral will so clearly reflect income, that the IRS abuses its discretion when it refuses to permit deferral.\n\nSamuel A.

They are also available for self-guided tours of outdoor locations, or as a part of an organised tour. It provides background, context, and information on the things being viewed. Audio guides are often in multilingual versions and can be made available in different ways. Some of the more elaborate tours may include original music and interviews. Traditionally rented on the spot, more recently downloaded from the Internet or available via the mobile phone network. Some audio guides are free or included in the entrance fee, others have to be purchased separately.\n\nWillem Sandberg, director of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam from 1945 to 1962, pioneered the world's first museum audio tours. When invented in 1952, the developers were drawn by its unique potential to mediate an experience individually controllable by each visitor, which was content rich, was personal to them, was available at any time, and suited learning styles not served by catalog, text panel, or label. \n\nSandberg's ambulatory lectures were delivered through a closed-circuit shortwave radio broadcasting system in which the amplified audio output of an analog playback tape recorder served as a broadcast station, and transmission was via a loop aerial fixed around the gallery or galleries. Identical lectures in Dutch, French, English, and German were recorded onto magnetic tapes, broadcast in turn through the aerial, and picked up by visitors through a portable radio receiver with headphones, when inside the loop. \n\nThe system was such that all visitors with a receiver could only hear a specific piece of commentary at any time; hence, groups of visitors would move through the galleries and look at exhibits as if guided by an invisible force, in complete synchronicity. \n\nA multimedia electronic guide is a device specially designed to provide audio, visual or textual content to museum visitors with or without user interaction. It may also provide alternative content corresponding to different personal preferences. It may include accessories such as headphones, a digital pen and displays with LEDs or LCD screens.\n\nThese smart guides may be operated to supply content in different languages and accents, with different voice alternatives, with text, and with age group specific content. They can be operated in several ways:\n\n\nThese electronic guides can provide the museum management with useful statistics and reports, which may include tour statistics, visitor statistics, opinions, and other surveys.\n\nA cell phone tour is an audio tour where pre-recorded or stream audio interpretation for a heritage site or a cultural exhibit is provided via a cell phone. Cell phone audio tours have the advantage that most visitors already have the equipment needed to take the audio tour, being their cell phones.\n\nEach venue is assigned a phone number with appropriate stop numbers, displayed next the exhibit. Once a visitor has dialed in, they will be prompted and can enter the corresponding stop number of the exhibit they’re viewing, to hear the recorded content. These tours also enable the visitors to: fast forward, rewind, pause, as well as leave a feedback message for each exhibit or the whole tour; simply by pressing a number. In addition to audio content, some providers are also able to stream video, and text message recent visitors with updates . This is the old-style approach, not used widely.\n\nSmart phones have significant advantages over cell phones, as they have story-triggering technologies (GPS, bluetooth, NFC, QR-code scanner) and can use the power of mobile apps to deliver the right story in the right language in the right place and in the right context (e.g. the evening tour, or a winter tour). Stories could be adjusted to the pace and mood of the user. Of course, such guided tours will use other types of content, above audio: photo, texts, video, quests. Such apps can work online and offline. \n\nSmart phone tours could guide the user outdoor (streets, highways, zoos, parks, archaeological sites) and indoor (museums), using different guiding techniques. \n\nThere are hundreds apps available on the market, for cities and museums. \n\nLike it happens with any other type of content (e.g. Youtube in video), development of smart phone guiding apps inevitably led to the launch of so-called \"platforms\", which aggregate thousands of tours and stories, available for the apps to retell. Examples of such platforms are: izi.TRAVEL, PocketGuide, Guidigo, VoiceMap etc. Some of them, like izi.TRAVEL, are fully free and open. \n\nThe storytelling platforms introduced huge change to several markets:\n\nThe museum market changes:\n\n\nThe tourism market changes:\n\n\nThe educational market changes:\n\n\nThe public grant market changes:\n\n\nThe modern technology implications:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1530481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1530481", "title": "Banburismus", "text": "Banburismus\n\nBanburismus was a cryptanalytic process developed by Alan Turing at Bletchley Park in Britain during the Second World War. It was used by Bletchley Park's Hut 8 to help break German \"Kriegsmarine\" (naval) messages enciphered on Enigma machines. The process used sequential conditional probability to infer information about the likely settings of the Enigma machine. It gave rise to Turing's invention of the \"ban\" as a measure of the weight of evidence in favour of a hypothesis. This concept was later applied in Turingery and all the other methods used for breaking the Lorenz cipher.\n\nThe aim of Banburismus was to reduce the time required of the electromechanical Bombe machines by identifying the most likely right-hand and middle wheels of the Enigma. Hut 8 performed the procedure continuously for two years, stopping only in 1943 when sufficient bombe time became readily available. Banburismus was a development of the \"clock method\" invented by the Polish cryptanalyst Jerzy Różycki.\n\nHugh Alexander was regarded as the best of the Banburists. He and I. J. Good considered the process more an intellectual game than a job. It was \"not easy enough to be trivial, but not difficult enough to cause a nervous breakdown\".\n\nIn the first few months after arriving at Bletchley Park in September 1939, Alan Turing correctly deduced that the message-settings of Kriegsmarine Enigma signals were enciphered on a common \"Grundstellung\" (starting position of the rotors), and were then super-enciphered with a bigram and a trigram lookup table. These trigram tables were in a book called the \"Kenngruppenbuch (K book)\". However, without the bigram tables, Hut 8 were unable to start attacking the traffic. A breakthrough was achieved after the \"Narvik pinch\" in which the disguised armed trawler \"Polares\", which was on its way to Narvik in Norway, was seized by in the North Sea on 26 April 1940. The Germans did not have time to destroy all their cryptographic documents, and the captured material revealed the precise form of the indicating system, supplied the plugboard connections and \"Grundstellung\" for 23 and 24 April and the operators' log, which gave a long stretch of paired plaintext and enciphered message for the 25th and 26th.\n\nThe bigram tables themselves were not part of the capture, but Hut 8 were able to use the settings-lists to read retrospectively, all the Kriegsmarine traffic that had been intercepted from 22 to 27 April. This allowed them do a partial reconstruction of the bigram tables and start the first attempt to use Banburismus to attack Kriegsmarine traffic, from 30 April onwards. Eligible days were those where at least 200 messages were received and for which the partial bigram-tables deciphered the indicators. The first day to be broken was 8 May 1940, thereafter celebrated as \"Foss's Day\" in honour of Hugh Foss, the cryptanalyst who achieved the feat.\n\nThis task took until November that year, by which time the intelligence was very out of date, but it did show that Banburismus could work. It also allowed much more of the bigram tables to be reconstructed, which in turn allowed 14 April and 26 June to be broken. However, the Kriegsmarine had changed the bigram tables on 1 July. By the end of 1940, much of the theory of the Banburismus scoring system had been worked out.\n\nThe \"First Lofoten pinch\" from the trawler \"Krebs\" on 3 March 1941 provided the complete keys for February – but no bigram tables or \"K book\". The consequent decrypts allowed the statistical scoring system to be refined so that Banburismus could become the standard procedure against Kriegsmarine Enigma until mid-1943.\n\nBanburismus utilised a weakness in the indicator procedure (the encrypted message settings) of Kriegsmarine Enigma traffic. Unlike the German Army and Airforce Enigma procedures, the Kriegsmarine used a \"Grundstellung\" provided by key lists, and so it was the same for all messages on a particular day (or pair of days). This meant that the three-letter indicators were all enciphered with the same rotor settings so that they were all \"in depth\" with each other. Normally, the indicators for two messages were never the same, but it could happen that, part-way through a message, the rotor positions became the same as the starting position of the rotors for another message, the parts of the two messages that overlapped in this way were in depth.\nThe principle behind Banburismus is relatively simple (and seems to be rather similar to the Index of Coincidence). If two sentences in English or German are written down one above the other, and a count is made of how often a letter in one message is the same as the corresponding letter in the other message; there will be more matches than would occur if the sentences were random strings of letters. For a random sequence, the repeat rate for single letters is expected to be 1 in 26 (around 3.8%), and for the German Navy messages it was shown to be 1 in 17 (5.9%). If the two messages were in depth, then the matches occur just as they did in the plaintexts. However, if the messages were not in depth, then the two ciphertexts will compare as if they were random, giving a repeat rate of about 1 in 26. This allows an attacker to take two messages whose indicators differ only in the third character, and slide them against each other looking for the giveaway repeat pattern that shows where they align in depth.\n\nThe comparison of two messages to look for repeats was made easier by punching the messages onto thin cards about 250 mm high (10\") by several metres wide (they had different cards for different lengths of message). A hole at the top of a column on the card represented an 'A' at that position, a hole at the bottom represented a 'Z'. The two message-cards were laid on top of each other on a light-box and where the light shone through, there was a repeat. This made it much simpler to detect and count the repeats. The cards were printed in Banbury in Oxfordshire. They became known as 'banburies' at Bletchley Park, and hence the procedure using them: Banburismus.\n\nThe application of the scritchmus procedure (see below) gives a clue as to the possible right-hand rotor.\n\nMessage with indicator \"VFG\": XCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF\n\nMessage with indicator \"VFX\":\nYNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ\n\nHut 8 would punch these onto banburies and count the repeats for all valid offsets −25 letters to +25 letters. There are two promising positions:\n\nThis offset of eight letters shows nine repeats, including two bigrams, in an overlap of 56 letters (16%).\n\nThe other promising position looks like this:\n\nThis offset of seven shows just a single trigram in an overlap of 57 letters.\n\nTuring's method of accumulating a score of a number of decibans allows the calculation of which of these situations is most likely to represent messages in depth. As might be expected, the former is the winner with odds of 5:1 on, the latter is only 2:1 on.\n\nTuring calculated the scores for the number of single repeats in overlaps of so many letters, and the number of bigrams and trigrams. Tetragrams often represented German word in the plaintext and their scores were calculated according to the type of message (from traffic analysis), and even their position within the message. These were tabulated and the relevant values summed by Banburists in assessing pairs of messages to see which were likely to be in depth.\n\nBletchley Park used the convention that the indicator plaintext of \"VFX\", being eight characters ahead of \"VFG\", or (in terms of just the third, differing, letter) that \"X = G+8\".\n\nScritchmus was the part of the Banburismus procedure that could lead to the identification of the right-hand (fast) wheel. The Banburist might have evidence from various message-pairs (with only the third indicator letter differing) showing that \"X = Q−2\", \"H = X−4\" and \"B = G+3\". He would search the deciban sheets for all distances with odds of better than 1:1 (i.e. with scores ≥ +34). An attempt was then made to construct the 'end wheel alphabet' by forming 'chains' of end-wheel letters out of these repeats.\nThey could then construct a \"chain\" as follows:\n\nIf this is then compared at progressive offsets with the known letter-sequence of an Enigma rotor, quite a few possibilities are discounted due to violating either the \"reciprocal\" property or the \"no-self-ciphering\" property of the Enigma machine:\nThe so-called \"end-wheel alphabet\" is already limited to just nine possibilities, merely by establishing a letter-chain of five letters derived from a mere four message-pairs. Hut 8 would now try fitting other letter-chains — ones with no letters in common with the first chain — into these nine candidate end-wheel alphabets.\n\nEventually they will hope to be left with just one candidate, maybe looking like this:\nNot only this, but such an end-wheel alphabet forces the conclusion that the end wheel is in fact \"Rotor I\". This is because \"Rotor II\" would have caused a mid-wheel turnover as it stepped from \"E\" to \"F\", yet that's in the middle of the span of the letter-chain \"F----A--D---O\". Likewise, all the other possible mid-wheel turnovers are precluded. Rotor I does its turnover between \"Q\" and \"R\", and that's the only part of the alphabet not spanned by a chain.\n\nThat the different Enigma wheels had different turnover points was, presumably, a measure by the designers of the machine to improve its security. However, this very complication allowed Bletchley Park to deduce the identity of the end wheel.\n\nOnce the end wheel is identified, these same principles can be extended to handle the middle rotor, though with the added complexity that the search is for overlaps in message-pairs sharing just the first indicator letter, and that the overlaps could therefore occur at up to 650 characters apart.\n\nThe workload of doing this is beyond manual labour, so BP punched the messages onto 80-column cards and used Hollerith machines to scan for tetragram repeats or better. That told them which banburies to set up on the light boxes (and with what overlap) to evaluate the whole repeat pattern.\n\nArmed with a set of probable mid-wheel overlaps, Hut 8 could compose letter-chains for the middle wheel much in the same way as was illustrated above for the end wheel. That in turn (after Scritchmus) would give at least a partial middle wheel alphabet, and hopefully at least some of the possible choices of rotor for the middle wheel could be eliminated from turnover knowledge (as was done in identifying the end wheel).\n\nTaken together, the probable right hand and middle wheels would give a set of bombe runs for the day, that would be significantly reduced from the 336 possible.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49391233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49391233", "title": "Cangjiepian", "text": "Cangjiepian\n\nThe Cangjiepian, also known as the Three Chapters (, \"Sancang\"), was a BCE Chinese primer and a prototype for Chinese dictionaries. Li Si, Chancellor of the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE), compiled it for the purpose of reforming written Chinese into the new orthographic standard Small Seal Script. Beginning in the Han dynasty (206 BCE-221 CE), many scholars and lexicographers expanded and annotated the \"Cangjiepian\". By the end of the Tang dynasty (618-907), it had become a lost work, but in 1977, archeologists discovered a cache of (c. 165 BCE) texts written on bamboo strips, including fragments of the \"Cangjiepian\".\n\nThe eponymous \"Cangjiepian\" title derives from the culture hero Cangjie, the legendary Yellow Emperor's historian and inventor of Chinese writing. According to Chinese mythology, Cangjie, who had four eyes and remarkable cognizance, created Chinese characters after observing natural phenomena such as the footprints of birds and animals (Yang et al. 2008: 84-86). In Modern Standard Chinese usage, the Cangjie method of inputting characters into a computer is more common than with the ancient \"Cangjiepian\" proto-dictionary.\n\nIn the name Cāngjié or Cāng Jié, \"cāng\" 倉/仓 means \"storehouse; warehouse\" and is sometimes written 蒼/苍 \"dark green; blue; gray; ashy\", which is a common Chinese surname. The character 頡/颉 is only pronounced \"jié\" in this name, and is usually pronounced \"xié\" \"stretch the neck; fly up (of birds)\".\n\nThe \"piān\" 篇 in \"Cangjiepian\" originally meant \"bamboo strips used for writing (before the invention of paper)\", which was semantically extended to \"sheet (of paper/etc.); piece of writing; article; chapter; section; book\". The sinologists Li Feng and David Branner (2011: 217) describe \"pian\" as \"separate textual unit\". The original \"Cangjiepian\", like most Qin and Han era books, was written on bamboo and wood strips.\n\nIn the traditional history of Chinese lexicography, the first proto-dictionary primers were the Eastern Zhou dynasty \"Shizhoupian\" \"Historian Zhou's Chapters\", the Qin dynasty \"Cangjiepian\", and the Han dynasty \"Jijiupian\". The Chinese lexicographers Heming Yong and Jing Peng (2008: 34) say these texts that arranged characters into categories \"acted as the catalyst for the birth of ancient Chinese dictionaries\".\n\nDuring the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), there was a wide and confusing variety of unstandardized Large Seal Script characters, with the same word being written in several different ways. After Emperor Qin Shi Huang had conquered all other Warring States and unified China in 221 BCE, he adopted a language-reform proposal made by the Legalist Li Si and promulgated a decree of \"Shutongwen\" 書同文 \"Writing the Same Character\". It mandated using a consistent writing system based on the Small Seal Script, which was comparatively simpler and easier to write than Large Seal Script (Yong and Peng 2008: 18). In a logographic language like Chinese, correct character writing is fundamental for efficiency of information transfer.\n\nThe emperor ordered his chancellor and two other ministers to compile a standard Small Seal character wordbook in three parts. The 7-chapter \"Cangjiepian\" compilation was overseen by Li Si, the 6-chapter \"Yuanlipian\" 爰歷篇 \"Explanation of Difficult Words\" by Zhao Gao, and the 7-chapter \"Boxuepian\" 博學篇 \"Extensive Knowledge of Words\" by Humu Jing 胡毋敬 (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 197). They simplified, standardized, and disseminated a national standard script for the first time in China (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 199). These three textbooks were officially issued and circulated during the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) (Hayhoe 1992: 28, Greatrex 1994:101).\n\nScholars in the early Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) combined these three Qin texts into one book, and transcribed the original Small Seal script into the standard Han Clerical script. Ban Gu's \"Book of Han\" records, \nthe teachers and learned people in the towns and villages combined \"The Cangjie Primer\", \"The Yuanli Primer\", and \"The Scholarly Primer\" [i.e., \"Boxuepian\"] under one cover and segmented the book into fifty-five chapters, each chapter containing sixty characters. This new textbook retained the original title \"The Cangjie Primer\". (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 52) \nThis 3,300-character \"Cangjiepian\", commonly called the \"Sancang\" 三倉 \"Three Cangs\", became popular and was widely recognized as the standard textbook for character learning (Yong and Peng 2008: 34-35). Scribes at the beginning of the Han were expected to be able to recite 5,000 characters, which is more than the original \"Cangjiepian\" (Feng and Branner 2011: 351).\n\nThe \"Book of the Han\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 28) further says that about 60 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han (r. 74-49 BCE), the \"Cangjiepian\" was \"filled with obsolete characters that are difficult for ordinary teachers to read\". The emperor called for scholars who could pronounce them correctly, and Zhang Chang was chosen. After he died in 48 BCE, his grandson-in-law Du Lin 杜林 completed the \"Collections of Cangjie Exegesis\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 101), which was lost by the Sui dynasty (518-618) (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 199).\n\nThe \"Cangjiepian\" had a serious pedagogical shortcoming: some Chinese characters could only be understood with the help of specialized annotations, and many came forth (Yong and Peng 2008: 35). The Han philosopher and philologist Yang Xiong (53 BCE–18 CE) first revised the \"Cangjiepian\" and wrote the \"Cangjiexunzuan\" 倉頡訓纂 \"Collections of Cangjie Exegesis\" supplement, which had 5,340 characters (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 47, 81). In the reign of Emperor He of Han (88-105 CE), Jia Fang 賈魴 compiled another supplement named the \"Pangxipian\" 滂喜篇. \n\nDuring the Jin dynasty (265-420) period, the \"Cangjiepian\", \"Xunzuanpian\", and \"Pangxipian\" were combined into one 3-chapter book with the title \"Cangjiepian\", also called the \"Sancang\". According to the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\" (biography of Jiang Shi, tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 215), in the early Cao Wei dynasty, Zhang Yi (fl. 227-232) wrote the \"Picang\" 埤倉 \"The Augmented Cangjie Glossary\", \"Guangya\" \"The Broad Ready Guide\" , and \"Gujin zigu\" 古今字詁 \"The Exegesis of Ancient and Contemporary Characters\". Guo Pu (276 – 324) wrote a commentary to the \"Sancang\", which is lost (Yong and Peng 2008: 34).\n\nFan Ye's \"Book of the Later Han\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 101) says that when Xu Shen started compiling the \"Shuowen jiezi\", he used ten dictionaries and primers, including the \"Cangjiepian\" (inclusive \"Sancang\" version) \"The Cangjie Primer\", \"Cangjiezhuan\" 倉頡傳 \"The Biography of Cangjie\", both Yang Xiong's and Du Lin's \"Cangjiexunzuan\" 倉頡訓纂 \"Collections of Cangjie Exegesis\", and the \"Cangjiegu\" 倉頡故 \"The Exegesis of the Cangjie Primer\".\n\nThe \"Cangjiepian\" was continuously used until the end of the Tang Dynasty, when the last remaining copies were destroyed during the Huang Chao Rebellion (874–884). Various Qing dynasty (1644-1912) scholars partially reconstructed the text by collecting fragments quotations of the \"Cangjiepian\" in works such as the \"Wenxuan\" and \"Taiping Imperial Reader\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 27).\n\nArcheologists have discovered \"Cangjiepian\" fragments in several locations, including the Dunhuang manuscripts from the Mogao Caves in Gansu province, at Juyan Lake Basin in westernmost Inner Mongolia, and most notably at the Shuanggudui archeological site, located near Fuyang in Anhui province (Wilkinson 2000: 49). In 1977, archeologists excavated a (165 BCE) Han dynasty tomb at Shuanggudui and discovered a cache of texts written on bamboo strips, including the \"Yijing\" and \"Chuci\". The \"Cangjiepian\" version has 541 characters, nearly 20 percent of the complete work, and is longer and more legible than the other fragments; Theobald (2011) provides pictures of these strips. The presence of the \"Cangjiepian\" in several early Han tombs shows that it was, \"if not a common manual for elementary instruction, at least not a rare work\" (Greatrex 1994:104).\n\nWhile some academics conclude that the \"Cangjiepian\" \"demonstrated the prototype of a modern Chinese dictionary\", Yong and Peng (2008: 28) believe this character-learning textbook's format was \"not particularly standardized and consistent to the eye of a modern lexicographer\". Nevertheless, they admit it is undeniable that the \"Cangjiepian\" \"laid a solid foundation and initiated an enlightening start in character standardization, corpus construction, and source material accumulation\".\n\nThe excavated Han dynasty bamboo-slip \"Cangjiepian\" edition has two outstanding features in layout: rhymed 4-character phrases that are easy to recite and remember, and character collation that is semantically grouped and graphic radical-oriented (Yong and Peng 2008: 52)\n\nFirst, the \"Cangjiepian\" format has rhymed (in Qin period Old Chinese), 4-character phrases/sentences that are easy for children to recite and memorize. Take the Preface for example,\nCangjie creates characters [*\"s-ta\" 書] for educating the young [*\"sə.lə-s\" 嗣]. The youth are summoned [*\"taw-s\" 詔] and they should learn to be serious, cautious, respectful, and self-disciplined [*\"kˤrək-s\" 戒]. They should make up their mind and study hard [*\"sə-loŋ-s\" 誦] and show perseverance in reading and reciting day and night [*\"trək-s\" 置]. If selected to serve as officials in the government [*\"s-rəʔ\" 史], they should be qualified in calculating, accounting, discriminating good from evil, and ruling [*\"C.lrə\" 治]. They should be trained to be the elites [*\"[ɡ]ur\" 群] and the exceptional but not the deviants [*\"ɢək-s\" 異].) (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 53, OC reconstructions from Baxter-Sagart 2014) \nThe \"Cangjiepian\" adapted the prevalent style of writing Chinese poetry in 4-character lines, which dates back to the (11th-7th centuries BCE) \"Classic of Poetry\". Later poetry was composed in 5- and 7-character lines\n\nSome \"Cangjiepian\" passages seem incongruous for a children's primer, for instance (quoted by Yan Zhitui, tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 53), \"The Han Dynasty annexes the whole world and all the kingdoms observe its decrees. Its ruling will be like slaughtering the pigs and pulling down the fences. For those kingdoms that disobey, they will be denounced, suppressed, and destroyed\".\n\nSecond, the \"Cangjiepian\" collated characters on the basis of semantic fields (already used in the 3rd-century BCE \"Erya\" dictionary) and graphic radicals (later used in the 121 CE \"Shuowen Jiezi\"). \n\nSome sections give characters for words that are synonyms, antonyms, or otherwise semantically related. An example of words meaning \"length\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 55) is: \"cùn\" 寸 \"inch\", \"báo\" 薄 \"thin\", \"hòu\" 厚 \"thick\", \"guǎng\" 廣 \"wide\", \"xiá\" 狹 \"narrow\", \"hǎo\" 好 \"good\", \"chǒu\" 醜 \"ugly\", \"cháng\" 長 \"long\", and \"duǎn\" 短 \"short\".\n\nOther sections give characters that share a common radical, and furthermore, the sequence of radicals generally resembles the sequence of the 540 radicals in the \"Shuowenjiezi\". For one example (Yong and Peng 2008: 28), the \"door radical\" 門 (which is generally used to write words semantically related to \"doors\") is seen in the sequence \"kāi\" 開 \"open\", \"bì\" 閉 \"close\", \"mén\" 門 \"door\", and \"lǘ\" 閭 \"town\" all fall under the heading of, for their meanings are all related to the concept of \"door\". For another, \"sickness radical\" 疒 (seen in many characters denoting \"illness; sickness\") is seen in all but one of the series \"bìng\" 病 \"illness\", \"kuáng\" 狂 (with the \"dog radical\" 犭) \"madness\", \"cī\" 疵 \"blemish\", \"gāng\" 疕 \"head sores\", \"chèn\" 疢 \"fever\", and \"yáng\" 瘍 \"sore\". In addition, some \"Cangjiepian\" passages explain semantic extensions and polysemy, such as \"\"措 means 置 \"to handle\", also 安 \"arrange\", and also 施 \"implement\"\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 149).\n\nThe original \"Cangjiepian\" did not have explanatory notes for difficult characters and words, but some received editions have interpretations and glosses added to characters, which are obviously accretions from scholars of later periods (Yong and Peng 2008: 28). The Tang Dynasty dictionary by Xuan Ying (玄應), the \"Yiqie jing yinyi\" \"Pronunciation and Meaning in the \"Tripitaka\" quotes the \"Cangjiepian\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 54) to say, 痏創也 音如鮪魚之鮪, \"Wěi\" 痏 [also pronounced \"yáng\" or \"yòu\"] means \"chuàng\" 創 \"wound\", and is pronounced like the fish \"wěi\" 鮪 \"sturgeon\".\"\n\n"}

The mufti, or Islamic judge, Hasanayn al-Makhluf was the individual who ruled on this matter. The reason that this was investigated under Islamic law was because of rumors and conspiracies spreading among the public about these brands. One of these conspiracies was that the Coca-Cola logo, when reflected in a mirror, spelled out \"No Mohammed no Mecca\" in Arabic.\n\nMufti Hasanayn al-Makhluf explained in this fatwa that all foods and drinks are assumed to be permissible under Islamic law unless found otherwise. According to the fatwa, if a person does not know the condition or ingredients of a food or beverage, its consumption is permitted until its nature is determined. Thus, the results of this fatwa would serve to remove the uncertainty regarding the consumption of cola beverages such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. In order to get an accurate answer on whether or not Pepsi and Coca-Cola were prohibited by Islamic law, the Department of Fatwas collaborated with the Ministry of Public Health in order to ascertain the composition of the two sodas. On August 25, 1951, the Ministry of Public Health wrote to the Department of Fatwas to share their findings. They found that neither Pepsi-Cola nor Coca-Cola had any narcotics, alcohol, or pepsin present in them. The use of narcotics and the consumption of alcohol are both prohibited under Islamic law. Pepsin is created from the membrane of pig stomachs, and any product coming from a pig is not permitted under Muslim Sharia law. The Ministry of Public Health goes on to explain that the drinks also have no harmful microbes in them. Based on the information provided by the Ministry of Public Health that assured the Department of Fatwas of the lack of narcotics, alcohol, pepsin, and microbes in both Pepsi Cola and Coca-Cola, Hasanayn al-Makhluf declared the drinks to be permissible under Islamic law.\n\n"}

{"id": "400649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400649", "title": "Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom", "text": "Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom\n\nThe Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, originally the Crown Jewels of England, are 140 royal ceremonial objects kept in the Tower of London, which include the regalia and vestments worn by British kings and queens at their coronations.\n\nSymbols of 800 years of monarchy, the coronation regalia are the only working set in Europe – other present-day monarchies have abandoned coronations in favour of secular ceremonies – and the collection is the most historically complete of any regalia in the world. Objects used to invest and crown the monarch variously denote his or her roles as head of state, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, and head of the British armed forces. They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as Head of the Commonwealth.\n\nUse of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to medieval times. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to Edward the Confessor, was established after he was made a saint in the 12th century. By the Tudor period it was usual for a monarch to inherit state regalia from his or her predecessor. Most of the present collection as a whole dates from around 350 years ago when Charles II ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been either sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649, during the English Civil War. Only four original items pre-date the Restoration: a late 12th-century anointing spoon, which is the oldest object in the collection, and three early 17th-century swords. Upon the Acts of Union 1707, the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the Honours of Scotland.\n\nThe regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them Cullinan I, the largest clear cut diamond in the world at , set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan Diamond, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to Edward VII. On the Imperial State Crown are Cullinan II (second-largest of the Cullinan diamonds), the Stuart Sapphire, St Edward's Sapphire, and the Black Prince's Ruby – a large spinel given to Edward the Black Prince by a Spanish king in 1367. The Koh-i-Noor diamond, originally from India, has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals.\n\nAt a coronation the monarch is anointed using holy oil poured from an ampulla into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with St Edward's Crown. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia, and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each queen consort. Also regarded as Crown Jewels are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. When not in use the Jewels are on public display, mainly in the Jewel House, where they are seen by approximately 2.5 million visitors every year.\n\nThe earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in Deal, Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150 BC. A sword, brooch, ceremonial shield, and decorated bronze crown with a single arch, which sat directly on the head of its wearer, were found inside the tomb of the Mill Hill Warrior. At this point, crowns were symbols of authority worn by religious and military leaders. Priests continued to use crowns following the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD. A dig in a field at Hockwold cum Wilton, Norfolk, in 1957 revealed a bronze crown with two arches and depictions of male faces, dating from the period of Roman occupation. \n\nBy the early 5th century, the Romans had withdrawn from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One of the methods used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories was the use of ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king – evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia – at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an iron ring surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.\n\nIn 597, a Benedictine monk had been sent by Pope Gregory I to start converting Pagan England to Christianity. The monk, Augustine, became the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made that was usually buried with him or her upon death. In 9th-century Europe, gold crowns in the Byzantine tradition were replacing bronze, and gold soon became the standard material for English royal crowns.\n\nÆthelstan ascended the throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the Kingdom of England. In the earliest known depiction of an English king wearing a crown, he is shown presenting a copy of Bede's \"Life of St Cuthbert\" to the saint himself. Until his reign, kings had been portrayed on coins wearing helmets and circlets, or wreath-like diadems in the style of Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Whether or not they wore such an item is questionable. Edgar the Peaceful was the first English king to be crowned with an actual crown, and a sceptre was also introduced for his coronation in 973. After crowns, sceptres were the most potent symbols of royal authority in medieval England.\n\nEdward the Confessor is depicted on a throne and wearing a crown and holding a sceptre in the first scene of the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1066, Edward died without an heir, and William the Conqueror emerged as the first Norman king of England following his victory over the English at the Battle of Hastings. Wearing a crown became an important part of William I's efforts to cement his authority over his new territory and subjects. At his death in 1087, the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" reported: \"[William] kept great state … He wore his crown three times a year as often as he was in England … He was so stern and relentless … we must not forget the good order he kept in the land\". Those crown-wearings were held on the religious festivals of Easter, Whitsun and Christmas.\nIn 1161, Edward the Confessor was made a saint, and objects connected with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity and they were to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, dalmatic, pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the Holy Communion a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold – all of which were considered precious relics. Although the Abbey's claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe. Westminster Abbey is owned by a monarch, and the regalia had always been royal property – the abbots were mere custodians. In the following centuries, some of these objects would fall out of use and the regalia would expand to include many others used or worn by monarchs and queens consort at coronations.\n\nA crown referred to as St Edward's Crown is first recorded as having been used for the coronation of Henry III in 1220, and it appears to be the same crown worn by Edward. Being crowned and invested with regalia owned by a previous monarch who was also a saint reinforced the king's authority. It was also wrongly thought to have been originally owned by Alfred the Great because an inscription on the lid of its box, translated from Latin, read: \"This is the chief crown of the two, with which were crowned Kings Alfred, Edward and others\". The crown would be used in many subsequent coronations until its eventual destruction 400 years later. Few descriptions survive, although one 17th-century historian noted that it was \"ancient Work with Flowers, adorn'd with Stones of somewhat a plain setting\", and an inventory described it as \"gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells\", weighing . It had arches and may have been decorated with filigree and cloisonné enamels. Also in the Royal Collection in this period was an item called a state crown. Together with other crowns, rings, and swords, it comprised the monarch's state regalia that were kept separate from the coronation regalia, mostly at the royal palaces.\n\nThe transferring of crowns symbolised the transfer of power between rulers. Following the defeat in 1282 of the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd by Edward I, the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary King Arthur, were surrendered to England. According to the \"Chronicle of Aberconwy Abbey\", \"and so the glory of Wales and the Welsh was handed over to the kings of England\". After the invasion of Scotland in 1296, the Stone of Scone was sent to the Tower of London \"in recognition\", as the chronicler Walter of Guisborough put it, \"of a kingdom surrendered and conquered\". It was fitted into a wooden chair, which came to be used for the investiture of kings of England, earning its reputation as the Coronation Chair. The Scottish regalia were also taken to London and offered at the shrine of Edward the Confessor; Scotland eventually regained its independence. In Edward II's treasury in 1324 there were 10 crowns. When Richard II was forced to abdicate in 1399, he symbolically handed St Edward's Crown to Henry IV, saying \"I present and give to you this crown … and all the rights dependent on it\".\n\nMonarchs often pledged various items of state regalia as collateral for loans throughout the Middle Ages. Edward II pawned his Great Crown in Flanders. Three crowns and other jewels were held by the Bishop of London and Earl of Arundel as security for £10,000 in the 1370s. One crown was handed over to the Corporation of London in exchange for a £4,000 loan in 1386. Sometimes objects were temporarily released from pawn by mayors, knights, peers, bankers, and other wealthy subjects in both England and continental Europe for the king to use at state occasions, then returned following the ceremony. Kings also distributed plate and jewels to their troops in lieu of money.\n\nAt some point in the 14th century, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London owing to a series of successful and attempted thefts in Westminster Abbey. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. After a long absence, two arches topped with a monde and cross were added to new images of St Edward's Crown by the time of Henry IV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor Henry V, though arches did not feature on the Great Seal until 1471. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches and cross symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe traditions established in the medieval period continued later. By the middle of the 15th century, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, Epiphany, Easter, Whitsun, All Saints' Day, and one or both feasts of St Edward. A crown was displayed and worn at the annual State Opening of Parliament, and three were placed on the heads of monarchs at a coronation: St Edward's Crown, the state crown, and a \"rich crown\" made specially for the king or queen.\nAround this time, three swords – symbols of kingship since ancient times – were being used in the coronation ceremony to represent the king's powers in the administration of justice: the Sword of Spiritual Justice, the Sword of Temporal Justice, and the blunt Sword of Mercy. An emerging item of regalia was the orb, described in Tudor inventories as a round ball with a cross of gold, which underlined the monarch's sovereignty. Orbs had been pictorial emblems of royal authority in England since the early Middle Ages but a real orb was probably not used at any English coronation until that of Henry VIII in 1509. After the English Reformation, the Church of England denounced the veneration of medieval relics, and starting with the coronation of Edward VI in 1547, the significance of St Edward's regalia was downplayed in the ceremony. \n\nState regalia increasingly passed from one king to the next. The best known example of this was Henry VIII's Crown. Its date of manufacture is unknown, but it was probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty, maybe in the reign of Henry VII. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in English law when James I decreed in 1605: \"Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme\". After James died in 1625, Charles I succeeded to the throne. Desperate for money, one of his first acts as king was to load 41 masterpieces from the Jewel House onto a ship bound for Amsterdam – the hub of Europe's jewel trade. This hoard of unique bejewelled pieces, like the Mirror of Great Britain, a gold salt cellar known as the Morris Dance, and much fine Elizabethan plate, was expected to swell the king's coffers by £300,000, but they fetched £70,000.\n\nCharles's many conflicts with Parliament, stemming from his belief in the divine right of kings and the many religious conflicts that pervaded his reign, triggered the English Civil War in 1642. Parliament deemed the regalia as \"Jewels of the Crown\", vested in the monarch because of his public role as king, and not owned by him personally. To avoid putting his own subjects at risk, Charles and his wife once again raised money by exporting royal jewels at a heavy discount. On learning of the king's scheme, both Houses of Parliament declared traffickers of the Crown Jewels to be enemies of the state. Just two years later, Parliament seized of rare silver-gilt pieces from the Jewel House, which included a royal christening font, and used them to bankroll its own side of the war.\n\nAfter six years of war, Charles was defeated and executed in 1649. Less than a week after the king's execution, the Rump Parliament voted to abolish the monarchy. The newly created English Republic found itself short of money. To raise funds, the Act for the Sale of the Goods and Personal Estate of the Late King, Queen and Prince was brought into law, and trustees were appointed to value the Jewels – then regarded by Oliver Cromwell as \"symbolic of the detestable rule of kings\" and \"monuments of superstition and idolatry\"  – and sell them to the highest bidder. The most valuable object was Henry VIII's Crown, valued at £1,100. Their gemstones and pearls removed, most of the coronation and state regalia were melted down, and the gold was struck into hundreds of coins by the Mint.\n\nTwo nuptial crowns, the Crown of Margaret of York and the Crown of Princess Blanche, survived as they had been taken out of England centuries before the Civil War by Margaret and Blanche when they married kings in continental Europe. Both crowns and the 9th-century Alfred Jewel give a sense of the character of royal jewellery in England in the Middle Ages. Another rare survivor is Henry V's 600-year-old Crystal Sceptre, a gift to the Lord Mayor of London, who still bears it at coronations. Many pieces of English plate had been presented to visiting dignitaries and can be seen in museums throughout Europe. The Scottish regalia of Charles II, who was crowned King of Scotland in 1651, also survive even though Cromwell made an attempt to seize and destroy them. In England, Cromwell declined invitations by Parliament to be made king and became Lord Protector. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall in 1657, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested with many traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown perhaps made of gilded base metal, as was typical of funerary crowns in those days, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.\n\nThe monarchy was restored after Cromwell's death, and for the English coronation of Charles II, who had been living in exile abroad, new Jewels were made based on records of the lost items. They were supplied by the banker and Royal Goldsmith, Sir Robert Vyner, at a cost of £12,184 7s 2d – as much as three warships. It was decided to fashion the replicas as much as possible like the medieval regalia and to use the original names. These 22-karat gold objects, made in 1660 and 1661, form the nucleus of the Crown Jewels today: St Edward's Crown, two sceptres, an orb, an ampulla for the holy anointing oil, a pair of spurs, a pair of armills or bracelets, and a walking stick. A medieval silver-gilt anointing spoon and three swords survived and were returned to the Crown, and the Dutch ambassador arranged the return of extant jewels pawned in Holland. The king spent additional money on of altar and banqueting plate, and he was presented with conciliatory gifts.\nIn 1669, the Jewels went on public display for the first time in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. The Deputy Keeper of the Jewel House took the regalia out of a cupboard and showed it to visitors for a small fee. This informal arrangement was ended two years later when Thomas Blood, an Irish-born army officer loyal to Parliament, attacked the 77-year-old and stole a crown, a sceptre, and an orb. Blood and his three accomplices were apprehended at the castle perimeter, but the crown had been flattened with a mallet in an attempt to conceal it, and there was a dent in the orb. He was pardoned by the king, who also gave him land and a pension; it has been suggested that Blood was treated leniently because he was a government spy. Ever since, the Jewels have been protected by armed guards.\n\nSince the Restoration, there have been many additions and alterations to the regalia. A new set was commissioned in 1685 for Mary of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, Charles II having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when Mary II was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband William III. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest, and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Gemstones were hired for coronations – the fee typically being 4% of their value – and replaced with paste and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice that continued until the early 20th century.\n\nDuring World War II, the Crown Jewels were stored in the basement of Windsor Castle. The most valuable gems, such as the Koh-i-Noor and Cullinan diamonds, were sealed in a biscuit tin and hidden beneath a sally port, allowing them to be recovered swiftly. After the war, the Jewels were kept in a vault at the Bank of England for two years while the Jewel House was repaired as the Tower had been struck by a bomb. In 1953, St Edward's Crown was placed on the head of Queen Elizabeth II in what is now the only ceremony of its kind in Europe. Today, 140 objects make up the Crown Jewels, which are permanently set with 23,578 precious and semi-precious stones, and they are seen by around 2.5 million visitors every year.\n\nCrowns are the main symbols of royal authority. All crowns in the Tower are decorated with alternating crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis, a pattern which first appears on the great seal of Richard III, and their arches are surmounted with a monde and cross pattée. Most of them also have a red or purple velvet cap and an ermine border.\n\nThe centrepiece of the coronation regalia is named after Edward the Confessor and is placed on the monarch's head at the moment of crowning by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Made of gold and completed in 1661, St Edward's Crown has two depressed arches on top. It is embellished with 444 stones, including amethysts, garnets, peridots, rubies, sapphires, topazes, tourmalines and zircons. The crown was fashioned to closely resemble the medieval one, with a heavy gold base and clusters of semi-precious stones, but the arches are decidedly Baroque. In the late 20th century, it was assumed to be original, as their weight is almost identical, and an invoice was produced in 1661 for the addition of gold to an existing crown. In 2008, new research found that a coronation crown had been made in 1660, and it was enhanced when Parliament increased the budget for Charles II's delayed coronation. The crown is tall, and at a weight of it has been noted to be extremely heavy. After 1689, monarchs chose to be crowned with a lighter, bespoke coronation crown (e.g., that of George IV) or their state crown, while St Edward's Crown usually rested on the high altar. The tradition of using St Edward's Crown was revived in 1911 for the coronation of George V. In 1953, Elizabeth II opted for a stylised image of this crown to be used on coats of arms, badges, logos and various other insignia in the Commonwealth realms to symbolise her royal authority. It replaced the image of a Tudor-style crown adopted in 1901 by Edward VII.\n\nA much lighter crown is worn by the monarch when leaving Westminster Abbey, and at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The current Imperial State Crown was made in 1937 for George VI and is a copy of the one made in 1838 for Queen Victoria, which had fallen into a poor state of repair, and had been made using gems from its own predecessor, the State Crown of George I. In 1953, the crown was resized to fit Elizabeth II, and the arches were lowered by to give it a more feminine appearance. The gold, silver and platinum crown is decorated with 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds and 5 rubies. Among the largest stones are the Cullinan II diamond, also known as the Second Star of Africa, added to the crown in 1909. The Black Prince's Ruby, set in the front cross, is a large spinel given to Edward the Black Prince by a Spanish king in 1367 and worn by Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. At the back of the crown is the Stuart Sapphire, and in the top cross is St Edward's Sapphire, reputedly taken from the ring of Edward the Confessor when his body was re-interred at the Abbey in 1163. Below the monde hang four pearls, three of which are often said to have belonged to Queen Elizabeth I, but the association is almost certainly erroneous.\n\nAfter the Restoration, wives of kings – queens consort – traditionally wore the Crown of Mary of Modena, wife of James II, who first wore it at their coronation in 1685. Originally set with 561 hired diamonds and 129 pearls, it is now set with crystals and cultured pearls for display in the Jewel House along with a matching diadem that consorts wore in procession to the Abbey. The diadem once held 177 diamonds, 1 ruby, 1 sapphire, and 1 emerald. By the 19th century, the crown was judged to be too theatrical and in a poor state of repair, so the Crown of Queen Adelaide was made for the wife of William IV to wear in 1831 using gemstones from her own collection of jewellery. \nThus began a tradition of each queen consort having a crown made specially for her. In 1902, the Crown of Queen Alexandra, a European-style crown – flatter and with eight half-arches instead of the traditional four – was made for Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII, to wear at their coronation. Set with over 3,000 diamonds, it was the first consort crown to include the Koh-i-Noor diamond presented to Queen Victoria in 1850 following the British conquest of the Punjab. Originally and set in an armlet, it was cut down to an oval brilliant weighing , which Victoria mounted in a brooch and circlet. The second was Queen Mary's Crown; also unusual for a British crown in having eight half-arches, it was made in 1911 for the coronation of Queen Mary and George V. It contains 2,200 diamonds and has contained Cullinans III and IV. In 1914, both stones and the Koh-i-Noor were replaced with crystal replicas and the arches were made detachable so it could be worn as an open crown. Mary paid for the Art Deco-inspired crown and originally hoped that it would be used by future queens consort.\n\nAfter George V died, Mary continued wearing the crown (without its arches) as a queen mother, and so the Crown of Queen Elizabeth was made for Queen Elizabeth, wife of George VI and later known as the Queen Mother, to wear at their coronation in 1937. It is the only British crown to be made entirely of platinum, and was modelled on Queen Mary's Crown, but has the usual four half-arches instead of eight. The crown is decorated with about 2,800 diamonds, most notably the Koh-i-Noor in the middle of the front cross. It also contains a replica of the Lahore Diamond given to Queen Victoria by the East India Company in 1851, and a diamond given to her by Abdülmecid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, in 1856. Elizabeth last wore it as an open crown at the coronation of her daughter Elizabeth II in 1953. The crown was laid on top of Elizabeth's coffin during her lying in state and funeral in 2002.\n\nA relatively modest coronet was made in 1728 for Frederick, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of George II. It takes the form laid down in a royal warrant issued by Charles II which states that the heir apparent of the Crown shall use and bear a coronet of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch surmounted by a ball and cross. The single arch denotes inferiority to the monarch and shows that the prince outranks other royal children, whose coronets have no arches. Frederick never wore his gold coronet; instead, it was placed on a cushion in front of him when he took his seat in the House of Lords. It was used by his son, George III, then his son, George IV, and last used by Edward VII when he was Prince of Wales. Due to its age, a new silver-gilt coronet was made for his son, the future George V, to wear at Edward's coronation in 1902. In contrast to the earlier coronet, which has a depressed arch, the arch on this one is raised. At George's own coronation in 1911, the coronet was worn by his son, Edward, the next Prince of Wales. After he became king in 1936, Edward VIII abdicated later the same year and, as the Duke of Windsor, went into exile in France, taking the 1902 coronet with him; it remained abroad until his death in 1972. In its absence, another coronet had to be made for the investiture of Prince Charles in 1969. Unlike the defunct coronets, this one is not a part of the Crown Jewels but the Honours of the Principality of Wales.\n\nIn the Jewel House there are two crowns that were not intended to be used at a coronation. Queen Victoria's Small Diamond Crown is just tall, and was made in 1870 using 1,187 diamonds for Victoria to wear on top of her widow's cap. She often wore it at State Openings of Parliament in place of the much heavier Imperial State Crown. After the queen's death in 1901, Queen Alexandra wore the crown, and it was also worn by Queen Mary. The Imperial Crown of India was created in 1911 when George V visited the Delhi Durbar with Queen Mary to be proclaimed (but not crowned) as Emperor of India. Since the British constitution prohibits the removal of Crown Jewels from the United Kingdom, a new crown had to be made for the event, with emeralds, rubies, sapphires and 6,100 diamonds. It has not been used since and is now a part of the Crown Jewels.\n\nA coronation begins with the procession into Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe swords of state reflect a monarch's role as Commander-in-Chief of the British Armed Forces and Defender of the Faith. Three are carried before the monarch into the Abbey: the blunt Sword of Mercy (also known as Curtana), the Sword of Spiritual Justice, and the Sword of Temporal Justice. All are believed to have been supplied at the time of James I between 1610 and 1620, probably by a member of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, using blades created in the 1580s by Italian bladesmiths Giandonato and Andrea Ferrara. They were deposited with St Edward's regalia at the Abbey by Charles II; before then, new swords had been made for each coronation since the 15th century. Sold in the civil war, they were returned at the Restoration, and their first recorded use was at the coronation of James II in 1685.\n\nTwo other swords are used. The two-handed Sword of State, made in 1678 – a 1660 sword was last used in the 18th century – symbolises the monarch's royal authority. It is also carried before the monarch at State Openings of Parliament. Its wooden sheath, made in 1689, is bound in crimson velvet decorated with silver-gilt emblems of England, Scotland and Ireland, fleurs-de-lis and portcullises. The lion of England and unicorn of Scotland form the cross-piece to the sword's handle. Before the investiture, it is exchanged for the principal Sword of Offering, of which the Sword of State is a metaphor. Commissioned by George IV for his 1821 coronation, its gilded leather sheath is encrusted with 1,251 diamonds, 16 rubies, 2 sapphires and 2 turquoises. The sword has a Damascus steel blade and is set with 2,141 diamonds, 12 emeralds and 4 rubies. The precious stones are arranged to form roses, thistles, shamrocks, oak leaves and acorns. Two diamond lion heads, one at each end of the cross-piece, have ruby eyes. George paid more than £5,000 for the sword out of his own pocket in a radical change from the austere £2 swords used by his 18th-century predecessors. It remained in personal ownership of the Royal family until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels and has been used at every coronation since 1911. A monarch is girded and blessed using the sword, which is returned to the Keeper of the Jewel House by the Abbey for a token sum of £5, and it is borne unsheathed for the rest of the ceremony.\n\nThe defunct Irish Sword of State, made in 1660, was held by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (a viceroy) prior to Ireland's independence from the United Kingdom in 1922, and also resides at the Tower of London. Its handle takes the form of a lion and unicorn and is decorated with a celtic harp. Each new viceroy was invested with the sword at Dublin Castle, where it usually sat across the arms of a throne, representing the king or queen. It was borne in procession in front of monarchs upon their official visits to Dublin. In June 1921, the sword was present at the official opening by George V of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in Belfast. It was displayed at Dublin Castle from September 2017 until April 2018 as part of the 'Making Majesty' exhibition – the first time it had been to Ireland in 95 years.\n\nSt Edward's Staff is a gold walking stick made for Charles II in 1661. It has a plain monde and cross at the top and a steel pike at the bottom. This object is almost certainly a copy of the long rod of silver-gilt mentioned in the list of royal plate and jewels destroyed in 1649. The staff's intended role in the coronation has been forgotten since medieval times, and so it is carried into the Abbey by a peer as a holy relic and laid on the altar, where it remains throughout the ceremony.\n\nThe Crown Jewels include 16 silver trumpets dating from between 1780 and 1848. Nine of these are draped with red silk damask banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in the 19th century. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions.\n\nBeginning as lethal weapons of medieval knights, maces evolved into ceremonial objects carried by sergeants-at-arms and now represent a monarch's authority. The House of Commons can only operate lawfully when the royal mace – dating from the reign of Charles II – is present at the table. Two other maces dating from the reigns of Charles II and William III are used by the House of Lords: One is placed on the Woolsack before the house meets and is absent when a monarch is there in person. In the late 17th century, there were 16 maces, but only 13 survive, 10 of which are on display at the Tower of London. Two of these are carried in the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament and coronations. Each mace is about long and weighs an average of . They are silver-gilt and were made between 1660 and 1695.\n\nWhen a monarch is anointed, the Dean of Westminster pours holy anointing oil from an ampulla into a spoon.\n\nThe Ampulla, tall and weighing , is a hollow gold vessel made in 1661 and shaped like an eagle with outspread wings. Its head unscrews, enabling the vessel to be filled, and the oil exits via a hole in the beak. The original ampulla was a phial made of stone, sometimes worn as a pendant by kings, and otherwise kept inside a gold eagle. Fourteenth-century legend has it that the Virgin Mary appeared in front of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until 1170, and presented to him a gold eagle and phial of oil for anointing English kings. This ampulla was first recorded as being used at the coronation of Henry IV in 1399 and was deposited for safekeeping with St Edward's regalia at the Abbey by Richard III in 1483. The same batch of oil was used to anoint all kings and queens (except Mary I) until it ran out in 1625. No one is quite sure why the vessel itself came to be reinterpreted as an eagle standing on a domed base after the Restoration. In terms of religious importance, the anointing objects are second only to St Edward's Crown, and the ampulla was placed beside the crown on the altar of Westminster Abbey in 2013 at a service marking the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth II's coronation.\n\nThe Coronation Spoon, which dates from the late 12th century, is silver-gilt and set with four pearls added in the 17th century. A ridge divides the bowl in half, creating grooves into which the Archbishop of Canterbury dips two fingers and anoints the monarch, confirming him or her as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Originally, the spoon may have been used for mixing water and wine in a chalice, and it was first used to anoint a monarch at the English coronation of James I in 1603. It is the oldest surviving piece of regalia, first recorded in the Royal Collection in 1349 as \"a spoon of ancient form\", and was probably made for Henry II or Richard I. In 1649, the spoon was sold to Clement Kynnersley, Yeoman of the Removing Wardrobe, who returned it to Charles II upon the restoration of the monarchy.\nThe anointing is followed by investment with coronation robes and ornaments.\n\nAll the robes have priestly connotations and their form has changed little since the Middle Ages. A tradition of wearing St Edward's robes came to an end in 1547 after the English Reformation but was revived in 1603 by James I to emphasise his belief in the divine nature of kingship. As well as robes, a monarch also wore either cloth-of-gold buskins or sandals, depending on the size of his or her feet. The holy relics were destroyed along with royal crowns and ornaments in the Civil War, and new robes were made for each monarch starting with Charles II, a practice that ended in 1911, when George V wore the Supertunica (a dalmatic) and the Imperial Mantle (a cope), both made for George IV in 1821. The robes are of gold thread and together weigh approximately . They were also worn by his successors George VI and Elizabeth II. A new stole was made in 1953 for Elizabeth II by the Worshipful Company of Girdlers. It is adorned with floral emblems of Australia, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, and the four countries of the United Kingdom – members of the Commonwealth, which is headed by the Queen.\n\nPrick spurs remade for Charles II are presented to the monarch. They are made of solid gold, richly embossed with floral patterns and scrolls, and have straps of crimson velvet embroidered in gold. Both necks terminate in a Tudor rose with a spike at its centre. Also known as St George's Spurs, they are one of the emblems of knighthood and chivalry, and denote the sovereign's role as head of the Armed Forces. Gold spurs are first known to have been used in 1189 at the coronation of Richard I, though it is likely they were introduced for Henry the Young King in 1170, and this element of the service was probably inspired by the initiation ceremony of knights. A pair of mid 14th-century spurs were added to St Edward's regalia at the Abbey in 1399 and used at all coronations until they were destroyed in 1649. Historically, spurs were fastened to a monarch's feet, but since the Restoration they are simply brushed against the heels of kings or shown to queens.\n\nThe Armills are gold bracelets of sincerity and wisdom. Like spurs, they were first used at English coronations in the 12th century. By the 17th century, armills were no longer delivered to the monarch, but simply carried at the coronation. A new pair had to be made in 1661; they are wide, in diameter, and champlevé enamelled on the surface with roses, thistles and harps – the national symbols of England, Scotland and Ireland – as well as fleurs-de-lis. For Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, the medieval tradition was revived, and a new set of plain 22-karat gold armills lined with crimson velvet was presented to the Queen on behalf of various Commonwealth governments. Each bracelet is fitted with an invisible hinge and a clasp in the form of a Tudor rose. The hallmark includes a tiny portrait of the Queen, who continued to wear the armills on leaving the Abbey and could be seen wearing them later, with the Imperial State Crown and Sovereign's Ring, at her appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nAn orb, a type of globus cruciger, was first used at an English coronation by Henry VIII in 1509 and then by all subsequent monarchs, apart from early Stuart kings James I and Charles I, who opted for the medieval coronation order. The Tudor orb was deposited with St Edward's regalia at Westminster Abbey in 1625. The Sovereign's Orb used today is a hollow gold sphere about in diameter and weighing (more than twice as heavy as the original) made for Charles II in 1661. A band of gems and pearls runs along the equator and there is a half-band on the top hemisphere. Atop the orb is an amethyst surmounted by a jewelled cross, symbolising the Christian world, with a sapphire on one side and an emerald on the other. Altogether, the orb is decorated with 375 pearls, 365 diamonds, 18 rubies, 9 emeralds, 9 sapphires, 1 amethyst and 1 piece of glass. It is handed to the sovereign during the investiture rite of the coronation and is borne later in the left hand when leaving Westminster Abbey. A small version, originally set with hired gems, was made in 1689 for Mary II to hold at her joint coronation with William III; it was never used again at a coronation and is set with imitation gems and cultured pearls. The orb is in diameter and weighs . Both orbs were laid on Queen Victoria's coffin at her state funeral in 1901. Officially, no reason was given for using Mary II's orb, but it may have been intended to reflect Victoria's position as Empress of India.\n\nBefore 1831, each monarch generally received a new ring to symbolise his or her \"marriage\" to the nation. An exception was the Stuart Coronation Ring, probably used at the English coronations of Charles I and Charles II, and certainly that of James II, who took the ring to France after the Glorious Revolution. It returned to the United Kingdom 100 years later and is now part of the Royal Collection of Gems and Jewels. The gold ring has a large ruby etched with a St George's Cross and bordered by 26 diamonds applied in the 19th century. Rubies symbolise all the kingly virtues and have featured on coronation rings since the early Middle Ages. Since 1830, the ring has been on permanent loan from Windsor Castle to Edinburgh Castle, where it is displayed with the Honours of Scotland.\n\nThe Sovereign's Ring has been used by all monarchs from William IV in 1831 to Elizabeth II in 1953, with the exception of Queen Victoria, whose fingers were too small to retain it. In the centre of the gold ring is an octagonal sapphire overlaid with a square ruby and four long, narrow rubies forming a cross. Around the sapphire are 14 brilliant diamonds. The general design is intended to represent the red Cross of St George on the blue background of St Andrew's Cross. A small copy of the ring was made for Victoria, who wrote in a letter: \"The Archbishop had (most awkwardly) put the ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the greatest difficulty to take it off again, which I at last did with great pain\". In fact, the ring had been sized to fit the queen's little finger instead of her ring finger due to a misunderstanding by the jewellers. In 1919, it was deposited at the Tower of London along with the Sovereign's Ring and Queen Consort's Ring, which has been worn by all wives of kings from Queen Adelaide onwards.\n\nThe sceptre, a symbolic ornamental rod held by the monarch at a coronation, is derived from the shepherd's staff via the crozier of a bishop. Two gold sceptres made in 1661 are part of the coronation regalia. The Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross is a token of his or her temporal power as head of state. The whole object is long, weighs around , and is decorated with 333 diamonds, 31 rubies, 15 emeralds, 7 sapphires, 6 spinels and 1 composite amethyst. In 1910, it was redesigned to incorporate Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, which, at over , is still the largest clear cut diamond in the world. It was part of a rough diamond weighing found in South Africa in 1905 and was named after the chairman of the mining company, Thomas Cullinan. The gold clasps holding it can be opened and the stone removed to be worn as a pendant hanging from Cullinan II, which is set in the Imperial State Crown, to form a brooch – Queen Mary, wife of George V, often wore it like this. Above the pear-shaped diamond is the amethyst surmounted by a cross pattée encrusted with an emerald and small diamonds.\n\nThe Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, which also has been known as the Rod of Equity and Mercy, is emblematic of his or her spiritual role. It is a bit longer at but weighs about the same as the Sceptre with Cross. The sceptre is decorated with 285 gemstones, including 94 diamonds, 53 rubies, 10 emeralds, 4 sapphires and 3 spinels. Circling the rod are bands of precious stones. At the top is a gold monde set with diamonds and topped by a plain cross, upon which sits a white enamelled dove with its wings outspread, representing the Holy Ghost. A sceptre like this first appeared in the 11th century, and it was probably based on the German sceptre, which was topped by an Imperial Eagle. The Sceptre with Dove is the penultimate piece of regalia to be delivered. As the monarch holds both sceptres, he or she is crowned with St Edward's Crown.\n\nThe Crown Jewels include two sceptres made for Mary of Modena, the wife of James II, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made of ivory. Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband George VI in 1937. For the coronation of Mary II, the wife and joint sovereign of William III, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went missing for several decades, only to be found in 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London.\n\nIn the Jewel House there is a collection of chalices, patens, flagons, candlesticks and dishes – all silver-gilt except five gold communion vessels – that are displayed on the high altar or in front of the royal box at Westminster Abbey during a coronation. Some are also used at other times. Although not held or worn by a monarch, such items are Crown Jewels by virtue of their long association with the Jewel House. One of the most striking pieces is a large dish across and weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the Last Supper. Around the edge are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles. Made in 1664 for James, Duke of York, and later acquired by Charles II, it stands on the high altar during a coronation ceremony. At each end of the altar stands a tall candlestick made in the 17th century, which is engraved all over with scrolls, leaves and flowers, and they were also used at the lying in state of Edward VII at Buckingham Palace in 1910.\n\nAn altar dish and flagon were made in 1691 for the royal Church of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London. The dish measures across; it also has a depiction of the Last Supper, below which is the coat of arms of co-regents William III and Mary II. The flagon stands tall. Both pieces are still used in the chapel on Easter, Whitsun and Christmas, and they were first displayed at a coronation in 1821. Another dish still in regular use is the Maundy Dish – one of six used by the Queen at Royal Maundy for handing out alms to elderly people in recognition of their service to the church and local community. The ceremony, which takes place in a different cathedral every year, entirely replaced the ancient custom of washing the feet of the poor in 1730, and the dish, though it bears the royal cypher of William and Mary, dates from the reign of Charles II. Two purses containing specially minted coins are taken from the dish and presented to each recipient.\n\nThe last coronation banquet held at Westminster Hall took place in 1821 for George IV. Silverware used at those banquets include the Plymouth Fountain, a wine fountain made around 1640 by a German goldsmith and presented to Charles II by the city of Plymouth. Gilded for George II in 1726, it is tall and decorated with flowers, fruit, dolphins, mermaids and sea monsters. The nautical theme is continued in the silver-gilt Wine Cistern, also known as the Grand Punch Bowl, which is cast as a giant oyster shell. It weighs , is tall, long and wide, and can hold 144 bottles of wine on ice. It was commissioned in 1829 by George IV but completed after his death. Weighing over a quarter of a ton, it is the heaviest surviving piece of English banqueting plate. In 1841, the cistern was re-purposed as a punch bowl, with the addition of an ivory-stemmed ladle, which is long and has a silver-gilt bowl in the form of a nautilus shell.\nThe Exeter Salt, a tall salt cellar in the form of a castle on a rocky outcrop, was presented to Charles II after the Restoration by the city of Exeter. Each of its four main compartments, in the turrets, held about of salt, and smaller compartments in the walls held pepper and spices. It was made in 1630 by a German goldsmith in Hamburg and is set with 73 gems. Eleven smaller salts named after St George were originally made for a St George's Day banquet of the Knights of the Garter and Charles II in the 17th century. Another, the Queen Elizabeth Salt, was made in 1572 during the reign of Elizabeth I for a member of the aristocracy; it was acquired by Charles II. Twelve spoons made for George IV in 1820 complement the salts.\n\nThree silver-gilt objects which have been used at royal christenings are displayed in the Jewel House. Charles II's marriage to Catherine of Braganza produced no heir, but a font and basin made in 1661 may have been used to baptise some of his 13 illegitimate children. The font stands tall, and the whole objects weighs . Its domed lid is surmounted by a figure of Philip the Evangelist baptising the Ethiopian eunuch. It was last used to baptise Princess Charlotte of Wales (child of the future George IV) in 1796, and the basin found a new role as an altar dish in the 19th century, while the font was used as a plinth for the Lily Font.\n\nA christening ewer and basin made in 1735 were used at the christening of the future George III in 1738. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, had been banished from the royal court by George II and was forbidden to use the Charles II Font. An inscription at the front of the ewer records its use at the christening of George III's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the triumph of virtue over vice; it stands tall.\n\nThe Lily Font was made in 1840 for the christening of Victoria, Princess Royal, the first child of Queen Victoria, who declined to use the Charles II Font because of its unseemly history. The font is decorated with water lilies, symbolising purity and new life, and cherubs plucking lyres. It has been used for the christenings of all of Elizabeth II's children and grandchildren except Princess Eugenie, with holy water from the River Jordan. The font stands tall and weighs approximately .\n\nThe Crown Jewels, part of the Royal Collection, do not officially belong to the nation, but are effectively public assets. Ownership is regarded as inalienable and passes from one monarch to the next by virtue of his or her position as king or queen. However, a 17th-century ruling by Sir Edward Coke, which states \"the ancient jewels of the crown are heirloomes and shall descend to the next successor and are not devisable by testament\", contains an exception allowing the monarch to dispose of objects via letters patent. In practice it is unlikely the Crown Jewels will ever be sold, nor are they insured against loss, and are officially priceless. Their maintenance falls to the Crown Jeweller, a member of the Royal Household who cleans them at the Tower of London each January after visiting hours. The jeweller also accompanies the regalia and plate whenever they leave the Tower, for example at State Openings of Parliament and royal christenings. Older items such as the Coronation Spoon are cleaned by experts from the British Museum. The Royal Collection Trust keeps an inventory of the regalia, and Historic Royal Palaces is responsible for their display.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8481634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8481634", "title": "Digital versus film photography", "text": "Digital versus film photography\n\nThe merits of digital versus film photography were considered by photographers and filmmakers in the early 21st century after consumer digital cameras became widely available. Digital photography and digital cinematography have both advantages and disadvantages relative to still film and motion picture film photography. In the 21st century photography came to be predominantly digital, but traditional photochemical methods continue to serve many users and applications.\n\nThe visual quality of a digital photograph can be evaluated in several ways. The pixel count of an image is related to its spatial resolution and is often used as a figure of merit. The quantity of picture elements (pixels) in the image sensor is usually counted in millions and called \"megapixels\". Sensor pixel density sets a limit on the final output resolution of images captured with that sensor. Other factors, such as the effect of a Bayer pattern or other filter on the digital sensor and the image processing algorithm used to interpolate raw sensor data to image pixels. Most digital sensors are arranged in a rectangular grid pattern, making certain images (for example of parallel lines) susceptible to moire pattern artifacts. Film is not affected by moire because of the random orientation of the silver salts in its emulsion, however the pattern of these silver salts may become visible upon enlargement, creating the patterns called \"grain\" in the final output.\n\nThe resolution of film images depends upon the area of film used to record the image (35 mm, medium format or large format) and the film speed. Estimates of a photograph's resolution taken with a 35mm film camera vary. More information may be recorded if a fine-grain film is used, while the use of poor-quality optics or coarse-grained film may yield lower image resolution. A 36mm × 24mm frame of ISO 100-speed film was initially estimated to contain the equivalent of 20 million pixels, or approximately 23,000 pixels per square mm.\n\nMany professional-quality film cameras use medium-format or large-format films. Because of the relatively large size of the imaging area these media provide, they can record higher resolution images than most consumer digital cameras. Based upon the above pixel density, a medium-format film image can record an equivalent resolution of approximately 83 million pixels in the case of a 60 x 60 mm frame, to 125 million pixels in the case of a 60 x 90 mm frame. In the case of large format, 4 x 5 inch films can record approximately 298.7 million pixels, and 1,200 million pixels in the case of 8 x 10 inch film. However, as with a digital system, poor optical quality of lenses will decrease the resolving potential of a film emulsion.\n\nShot noise, produced by spontaneous fluctuations in detected photocurrents, degrades darker areas of electronic images with random variations of pixel color and brightness. Film grain becomes obvious in areas of even and delicate tone. Grain and film sensitivity are linked, with more sensitive films having more obvious grain. Likewise, with digital cameras, images taken at higher sensitivity settings show more image noise than those taken at lower sensitivities.\n\nHowever, even if both techniques have inherent noise, it is widely appreciated that for color, digital photography has much less noise/grain than film at equivalent sensitivity, leading to an edge in image quality. For black-and-white photography, grain takes a more positive role in image quality, and such comparisons are less valid.\n\nNoise in digital cameras can produce color distortion or confetti-like patterns, in indoor lighting typically occurring most severely on the blue component and least severely on the red component. Nearly all digital cameras apply noise reduction to long-exposure photographs to counteract noise due to pixel leakage. For very long exposures, the image sensor must be operated at low temperatures to prevent noise affecting the final image. Film grain is not affected by exposure time, although the marginal sensitivity of the film changes with lengthy exposures, a phenomenon known as reciprocity failure. \n\nTraditional exposure metering and autofocus systems employ secondary sensors, whose readings are typically low-fidelity (e.g. a very small number of averaged readings from various image areas vs. fully resolved image information) and may not correspond to the actually recorded image, for example due to parallax issues, differing sensitivity towards polarization, differing spectral response, differing amplitude response, optical aberrations of optical elements in the sensing system, differing sensitivity towards stray light, or misalignment of the focal plane of the sensor.\nMost digital cameras allow users to capture and analyze image information from the same sensor as used for image recording in real-time. Using this information for exposure and focus determination inherently eliminates most alignment and calibration issues, while simultaneously eliminating the cost of secondary metering sensors.\n\nFilm typically assumes using separate films to account for white balance of scene (typically in two variants: for sunlight or tungsten lamps), or usage of filters. Many film cameras had a dial to help user keep track of type of film that was loaded in the camera. \n\nDynamic range is a significant factor in the quality of both the digital and emulsion images. Both film and digital sensors exhibit non-linear responses to the amount of light, and at the edges of the dynamic range, close to underexposure and overexposure the media will exhibit particularly non-linear responses. The non-linear dynamic response or saturation qualities of emulsion film are often considered a desirable effect by photographers, and the distortion of colour, contrast and brightness varies considerably between film stocks. There is no limit to the number of possible levels of colour on emulsion film, whereas a digital sensor stores integer numbers, producing a limited and specific possible number of colours. Banding may be visible in the unusual case that it is not obscured by noise, and detail may be lost, particularly in shadow and highlight areas.\n\nDigital sensors might also suffer from blooming issue, though degree of it varies significantly between sensors.\n\nDigital camera manufacturers have made consistent improvements in the dynamic range captured by their products. Some cameras have an automatic exposure bracketing mode, to be used in conjunction with high-dynamic-range imaging software. Output media also have characteristic limitations to the dynamic range they are able to reproduce and the linearity of display.\n\nFlexibility and convenience are among the reasons for the widespread adoption of digital cameras. With film cameras, a roll is usually completely exposed before being processed. When the film is returned, it is possible to see the photograph, but most digital cameras incorporate a liquid crystal display that allows the image to be viewed immediately after capture. The photographer may delete undesired or unnecessary photographs, or reshoot the image if required. A user who wants prints can quickly and easily print just the required photographs.\n\nPhotographic film is made with specific characteristics of colour temperature and sensitivity (ISO). Lighting conditions often require characteristics different from those of the film specifications, requiring the use of filters or corrections in processing. Digital photography allows colour temperature and sensitivity to be adjusted at each shot, either manually or automatically.\n\nDigital images may be conveniently stored on a personal computer or in off-line storage such as small memory cards. Professional-grade digital cameras can store pictures in a raw image format, which stores the output from the sensor, rather than processing it immediately to form an image. When edited in suitable software, such as Adobe Photoshop or the GNU program GIMP (which uses dcraw to read raw files), the user may manipulate certain parameters, such as contrast, sharpness, or colour balance before producing an image. JPEG images can be similarly manipulated, though usually less precisely; software for this purpose may be provided with consumer-grade cameras. Digital photography allows the quick collection of a large quantity of archival documents, bringing convenience, lower cost, and increased flexibility in using the documents.\n\nThere are some areas where film may have some advantages. Modern film cameras are not as power-thirsty as modern digital cameras and can last longer on smaller batteries. Some film cameras, especially older ones, can operate without batteries: some will function completely without batteries, while others may lose some functionality such as metering and some shutter speeds. Batteries that only have to power light meters are often very small and can last a long time. This can be a boon for those who may be spending a long time with little or no access to electricity or a source of batteries.\n\nCompared to film, digital cameras are capable of much higher speed (sensitivity to light) and can perform better in low light or very short exposures. The effective speed of a digital camera can be adjusted at any time, while the film must be changed in a film to change the speed.\n\nDust on the image plane is a constant issue for photographers, and especially so in digital photography. DSLR cameras are especially prone to dust problems because the sensor remains in place, whereas a film advances through the camera for each exposure. Debris in the camera, such as dust or sand, may scratch the film; a single grain of sand can damage a whole roll of film. As film cameras age, they can develop burs in their rollers. With a digital SLR, dust is difficult to avoid but is easy to rectify using a computer with image-editing software. Some digital SLRs have systems that remove dust from the sensor by vibrating or knocking it, sometimes in conjunction with software that remembers where dust is located and removes dust-affected pixels from images.\n\nCompact digital cameras are fitted with fixed lenses, which makes it harder for dust to get into the image area. Similar film cameras are often only light-tight and not environmentally sealed. Some modern DSLRs, like the Olympus E-3, incorporate extensive dust and weather seals to avoid this problem.\n\nFilm and digital imaging systems have different cost emphases. Digital cameras are significantly more expensive to purchase than film equivalents. Prices are however dropping rapidly due to intense competition. Film cameras, on the other hand, are quite inexpensive to purchase, especially used equipment, but require ongoing film and development costs. However, in the digital realm, it could be argued that the constant state of technological change will cause a digital user to keep upgrading and buying other equipment once their digital camera becomes quickly obsolete. Other costs of digital photography include specialized batteries, memory cards and long-term data storage. The cost of digital editing software can be considerable, especially if newer features are required. The emergence of very high quality phone cameras since the early 2010s are making lower end, small sensor digital cameras redundant, almost as quickly as they grew in the last decade. Consequently, manufacturers are focusing attention to premium models such as compact system cameras and large sensor compacts. Mobile phones such as the iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Nokia Lumia 1020 are capable of images that can rival or beat cheaper dedicated cameras. Inkjet printers can make low-quality prints cheaply and easily from digital files, but high-quality inkjet printing has costs comparable to wet photo process printing, regardless of initial image source.\n\nThere are film industry specific arguments in the film vs. digital debate.\n\nMost digital cinema is displayed in 2K resolution, which is only a small amount more resolution than the consumer-oriented 1080p HD format.\n\nHigh profile film directors such as Christopher Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin Tarantino have all publicly criticized digital cinema and digital cinematography, and advocated the use of film and film prints. Most famously, Tarantino suggested in 2012 that he wanted to retire because (although he can still shoot on film) he cannot project on 35mm prints in most American cinemas, because of the rapid conversion to digital. Paul Thomas Anderson recently was able to create the most 70mm film prints in years for his film \"The Master\". There also are many film directors such as Peter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro, George Lucas, and James Cameron who are adamant supporters of digital cinema and the potential for higher frame rates that it brings.\n\n\n"}

These programs were established to document historic places in the United States. Records consist of measured drawings, archival photographs, and written reports, and are archived in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress.\n\nIn 1933, NPS established the Historic American Buildings Survey following a proposal by Charles E. Peterson, a young landscape architect in the agency. It was founded as a constructive make-work program for architects, draftsmen and photographers left jobless by the Great Depression. Guided by field instructions from Washington, D.C., the first HABS recorders were tasked with documenting a representative sampling of America's architectural heritage. By creating an archive of historic architecture, HABS provided a database of primary source material and documentation for the then-fledgling historic preservation movement. Earlier private projects included the White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs, many contributors to which later joined the HABS program.\n\nNotable HABS photographers include Jack Boucher, who worked for the project for over 40 years.\n\nThe Historic American Engineering Record program was founded on January 10, 1969, by NPS and the American Society of Civil Engineers. HAER documents historic mechanical and engineering artifacts. Since the advent of HAER, the combined program is typically called \"HABS/HAER\". Today much of the work of HABS/HAER is done by student teams during the summer, or as part of college-credit classwork. Eric DeLony headed HAER from 1971 to 2003.\n\nIn October 2000, NPS and the American Society of Landscape Architects established a sister program, the Historic American Landscapes Survey, to systematically document historic American landscapes. A predecessor, the Historic American Landscape and Garden Project, recorded historic Massachusetts gardens between 1935 and 1940. That project was funded by the Works Progress Administration, but was administered by HABS, which supervised the collection of records.\n\nThe permanent collection of HABS/HAER/HALS are housed at the Library of Congress, which was established in 1790 (and reestablished after the disastrous fire of 1814 in Washington, D.C. by purchasing former third President Thomas Jefferson's personal library at Monticello in 1815) as the replacement reference library of the United States Congress. It has since been expanded to serve as the National Library of the United States; U.S. publishers are required to deposit a copy of every copyrighted and published work, book monograph and magazine. As a branch of the United States Government, its created works are in the public domain in the US. Many images, drawings, and documents are available through the Prints and Photographs Online Catalog, including proposed, demolished, and existing structures; locales, projects, and designs.\n\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

This incomplete history in six books was written after 787 and at any rate no later than 796, maybe at Montecassino.\n\nThe history covers the story of the Lombards from their mythical origins to the death of King Liutprand in 743, and contains much information about the Eastern Roman empire, the Franks, and others. The story is told from the point of view of a Lombard patriot and is especially valuable for its treatment of the relations between the Franks and the Lombards. As his primary sources, Paul used the document called the \"Origo gentis Langobardorum\", the \"Liber pontificalis\", the lost history of Secundus of Trent, and the lost annals of Benevento; he also made free use of works by Bede, Gregory of Tours, and Isidore of Seville.\n\nAccording to a study made by Laura Pani in 2000, there are 115 surviving codices of Paul's history. A popular work in the Middle Ages, as indicated by the number of copies and their dissemination throughout Western Europe, more than twenty of these manuscripts predate the 11th century while another eighty or more were copied later.\n\nThe relations between these manuscripts were studied by Georg Waitz, who in 1876 identified 11 different families of the \"Historia Langobardorum\". The oldest manuscript is the Palimpsest of Assisi, written in the uncial script towards the end of the 8th century, almost immediately after Paul's work was completed. This palimpsest is, however, far from complete, as it contains only parts of books II and V of Paul's history. The earliest complete manuscript is the \"Codex Sangallensis 635\" written sometime between the 8th and the 10th centuries and designated by Waitz as F1. According to Waitz, F1's age makes it the most reliable of the \"Historia\"'s codices, a view which has been challenged by Antonio Zanella and Dante Bianchi, both of whom hold that the F1 does not correctly reflect Paul's original. \nPaul's account was largely accepted by subsequent writers, was often continued, and was first printed in Paris in 1514. Among the printed editions of the Latin text, the most authoritative is that edited by Ludwig Konrad Bethmann and Georg Waitz and published in the \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica. Scriptores rerum langobardicarum et Italicarum\" (Hanover, 1878).\n\nIt has been translated into English, German, French, Polish, Spanish, Swedish, Italian, Aragonese, and Croatian, the English translation being by W.D.

In this function, he participated in several Swiss Diets and also served as scribe on campaign during the Old Zürich War (1440–46). His chronicle on the Zürich War is essentially a contemporary eyewitness account. Fründ appears to have contracted a serious illness in 1447 which prevented him from completing the chronicle, so the text does not cover the peace negotiations and final treaty of 1450.\n\nFründ remained in Schwyz until 1457. In that year, he was again employed by Lucerne in the office of court secretary (\"Gerichtsschreiber\") after an unsuccessful application for the position of state secretary (\"Stadtschreiber\").\n\nFründ was married three times, to Elli Bumbel, Adelheid von Tengen and Margaretha Giessmann. He died probably in 1468, and certainly before 10 March 1469. He appears to have had acquired some wealth, as there are records of a dispute over his inheritance between his third wife and his daughter from his second marriage.\n\nFründ's chronicle is one of the main sources (alongside Conrad Justingers \"Bernese Chronicle\" of c. 1430) used in the Tschachtlanchronik of 1470. Similarly, Diebold Schilling the Elder used substantial portions of Fründ's text in his 1483 chronicle. Although Fründ's text was widely received by way of the works of these later writers, his own authorship was mostly forgotten, and his own works misattributed. Fründ's chronicle was considered lost, and Heinrich Bullinger misattributed his text to one Ulrich Wagner. He was only remembered as a chronicler by Aegidius Tschudi (c. 1550), who is otherwise not known as a very reliable witness. Fründ's identity and authorship was eventually recovered in Swiss historiography in the 1870s, first by Hungerbühler (1871), who however misattributed an early text on the Swiss Swedish origin legend to Fründ, the text of his chronicle being edited by Kind (1875).\n\n"}

For prescription medications, the insert is technical, and provides information for medical professionals about how to prescribe the drug. Package inserts for prescription drugs often include a separate document called a \"patient package insert\" with information written in plain language intended for the end-user -- the person who will take the drug or give the drug to another person, for example a minor. Inserts for over-the-counter medications are also written plainly.\n\nIn the US the document is called \"prescribing information\" or the \"package insert\" (PI) and layperson's document is called the \"patient package insert\" (PPI). In Europe the technical document is called the \"summary of product characteristics\" and the document for end-users is called the \"package leaflet\".\n\nEach country or region has their own regulatory body. \n\nIn the European Union, the European Medicines Agency has jurisdiction and the relevant documents are called the \"summary of product characteristics\" (SPC or SmPC) and the document for end-users is called the \"package leaflet\". The SPC is not intended to give general advice about treatment of a condition but does state how the product is to be used for a specific treatment. It forms the basis of information for health professionals to know how to use the specific product safely and effectively. The package leaflet supplied with the product is aimed at end-users.\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determines the requirements for patient package inserts. In the United States, the FDA will occasionally issue revisions to previously approved package inserts, in much the same way as an auto manufacturer will issue recalls upon discovering a problem with a certain car. The list of 1997 drug labelling changes can be found on the FDA's website, here. The first patient package insert required by the FDA was in 1968, mandating that isoproterenol inhalation medication must contain a short warning that excessive use could cause breathing difficulties. The second patient package insert required by the FDA was in 1970, mandating that combined oral contraceptive pills must contain information for the patient about specific risks and benefits. The patient package insert issue was revisited in 1980 and in 1995 without conclusive action being taken. Finally, in January 2006, the FDA released a major revision to the patient package insert guidelines, the first in 25 years. The new requirements include a section called Highlights which summarizes the most important information about benefits and risks; a Table of Contents for easy reference; the date of initial product approval; and a toll-free number and Internet address to encourage more widespread reporting of information regarding suspected adverse events.\n\nOther national or international organizations that regulate medical information include the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW). Other country-specific agencies, especially in the case of EU (European Union) countries and candidates, plus countries of South America and many in Asia and the Far East, rely heavily on the work of these three primary regulators.\n\nPackage inserts follow a standard format for every medication and include the same types of information.

This fastening mechanism is anchored to the back side of a button-shaped metal disk, either flat or concave, which leaves an area on the front of the button to carry an image or printed message. The word is commonly associated with a campaign button used in the United States and abroad during a political campaign. The first design for a pin-back button in the United States was patented in 1896, and contemporary buttons have many of the same design features.\n\nPolitical buttons have been used in the United States since the first presidential inauguration in 1789, when George Washington's supporters wore buttons imprinted with a slogan. These early buttons were sewn to the lapel of a coat or worn as a pendant on a string. The first campaign buttons with photographs of were produced to promote the political platform of Abraham Lincoln in 1860.\n\nBenjamin S. Whitehead patented the first innovation to the design in 1893 by inserting a sheet of transparent film made of celluloid over a photograph mounted on a badge to protect the image from scratches and abrasion. Whitehead had patents for various designs of ornamental badges and medallions previously, patented as early as 1892. Another patent was issued to Whitehead & Hoag on for a \"Badge Pin or Button\" which used a metal pin anchored to the back of the button to fasten the badge.\nMy present invention has reference to improvements in badges for use as lapel pins or buttons, or other like uses, and has for its primary object to provide ... a novel means for connecting the ornamental shell or button to the bar or pin for securing the badge to the lapel of the coat.\n\nOther improvements and modifications to the basic design were patented in the following years by other inventors.\n\nEarly pin-back buttons from 1898 were printed with a popular cartoon character, The Yellow Kid, and offered as prizes with chewing gum or tobacco products to increase sales.\n\nThese buttons were produced with a concave opening on the back side (which provided space to insert advertising), or with a closed back, filled with metal insert and fastener. These are called \"open back\" and \"closed back\" buttons.\n\nIn 1945, the Kellogg Company, the pioneer in cereal box prizes, inserted prizes in the form of pin-back buttons into each box of Pep Cereal. Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics. There were 5 series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection.\n\n"}

{"id": "26313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26313", "title": "Roget's Thesaurus", "text": "Roget's Thesaurus\n\nRoget's Thesaurus is a widely used English-language thesaurus, created in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget (1779–1869), British physician, natural theologian and lexicographer. It was released to the public on 29 April 1852. The original edition had 15,000 words, and each new edition has been larger. Roget was inspired by the Utilitarian teachings of Jeremy Bentham and wished to help \"those who are painfully groping their way and struggling with the difficulties of composition [...] this work processes to hold out a helping hand\" The Karpeles Library Museum houses the original manuscript in its collection.\n\nThe name \"Roget\" is trademarked in parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom. By itself, it is not protected in the United States, where use of the name \"Roget\" in the title of a thesaurus does not necessarily indicate any relationship to Roget directly; it has come to be seen as a generic thesaurus name. With it's hegemonic status, it became \"a mark of civility\". J.M. Barrie stated \"[Captain Hook] is not wholly evil [h]e has a Thesaurus in his cabin\" . Indeed, Sylvia Plath considered it her desert islandbook over the Bible. \n\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\n\"Roget's Thesaurus\" is composed of six primary classes. Each class is composed of multiple divisions and then sections. This may be conceptualized as a tree containing over a thousand branches for individual \"meaning clusters\" or semantically linked words. Although these words are not strictly synonyms, they can be viewed as colours or connotations of a meaning or as a spectrum of a concept. One of the most general words is chosen to typify the spectrum as its headword, which labels the whole group.\n\nRoget's schema of classes and their subdivisions is based on the philosophical work of Leibniz (see Leibniz—Symbolic thought), itself following a long tradition of epistemological work starting with Aristotle. Some of Aristotle's Categories are included in Roget's first class \"abstract relations\". \n\nThe book is updated regularly and each edition is heralded as a gauge to contemporary terms; but each edition keeps true to the original classifications established by Roget. \n\nNaturally, it has critics calling it a book for the 'lexically lazy'. Simon Winchester believes it has allowed a \"state of linguistic and intellectual mediocrity\". Whilst Robert McNeil used the Thesaurus to rewrite, satirically for The Scotsman, Shakespeare, the 'nunnery scene': \"To vegetate or not to exist, that is the knotty point. Whether 'tis haughtier in the cerebellum to grin and bear the pea-shooters and harpoons of unmentionable serendipity ...\" thus highlighting the book's lost art form. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31119", "title": "Tate Modern", "text": "Tate Modern\n\nTate Modern is a modern art gallery located in London. It is Britain's national gallery of international modern art and forms part of the Tate group (together with Tate Britain, Tate Liverpool, Tate St Ives and Tate Online). It is based in the former Bankside Power Station, in the Bankside area of the London Borough of Southwark. Tate holds the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present day and international modern and contemporary art. Tate Modern is one of the largest museums of modern and contemporary art in the world. As with the UK's other national galleries and museums, there is no admission charge for access to the collection displays, which take up the majority of the gallery space, while tickets must be purchased for the major temporary exhibitions.\n\nTate Modern is housed in the former Bankside Power Station, which was originally designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Battersea Power Station, and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. It is directly across the river from St Paul's Cathedral. The power station closed in 1981.\n\nPrior to redevelopment, the power station was a long, steel framed, brick clad building with a substantial central chimney standing . The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east-west – the huge main Turbine Hall in the centre, with the boiler house to the north and the switch house to the south.\n\nFor many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers. Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to list the building was refused. In April 1994 the Tate Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of Herzog & de Meuron were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The £134 million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000.\n\nThe most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An electrical substation, taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company EDF Energy while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.\nThe history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary \"Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building & Tate Modern\". This challenging conversion work was carried by Carillion.\n\nTate Modern was opened by the Queen on 11 May 2000.\n\nTate Modern received 5.25 million visitors in its first year. The previous year the three existing Tate galleries had received 2.5 million visitors combined.\n\nTate Modern had attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it had been in preparation since 2004. These plans focused on the south west of the building with the intention of providing 5,000m of new display space, almost doubling the amount of display space.\n\nThe southern third of the building was retained by the French power company EDF Energy as an electrical substation. In 2006, the company released the western half of this holding and plans were made to replace the structure with a tower extension to the museum, initially planned to be completed in 2015. The tower was to be built over the old oil storage tanks, which would be converted to a performance art space. Structural, geotechnical, civil, and façade engineering and environmental consultancy was undertaken by Ramboll between 2008 and 2016.\n\nThis project was initially costed at £215 million. Of the money raised, £50 million came from the UK government; £7 million from the London Development Agency; £6 million from philanthropist John Studzinski; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and Elisabeth Murdoch.\n\nIn June 2013, international shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer pledged £10m to the extension project, making it to 85% of the required funds. Eyal Ofer, chairman of London-based Zodiac Maritime Agencies, said the donation made through his family foundation would enable \"an iconic institution to enhance the experience and accessibility of contemporary art\". The Tate director, Nicholas Serota, praised the donation saying it would help to make Tate Modern a \"truly twenty-first-century museum\".\n\nThe first phase of the expansion involved the conversion of three large, circular, underground oil tanks originally used by the power station into accessible display spaces and facilities areas. These opened on 18 July 2012 and closed on 28 October 2012 as work on the tower building continued directly above. They reopened following the completion of the Switch House extension on 17 June 2016.\n\nTwo of the Tanks are used to show live performance art and installations while the third provides utility space. Tate describes them as \"the world's first museum galleries permanently dedicated to live art\".\n\nA ten-storey tower, 65 metres high from ground level, was built above the oil tanks.\n\nThe original western half of the Switch House was demolished to make room for the tower and then rebuilt around it with large gallery spaces and access routes between the main building and the new tower on level 1 (ground level) and level 4. The new galleries on level 4 have natural top lighting. A bridge built across the turbine hall on level 4 to provides an upper access route.\n\nThe new building opened to the public on 17 June 2016.\n\nThe design, again by Herzog & de Meuron, has been controversial. It was originally designed with a glass stepped pyramid, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping façade in brick latticework (to match the original power-station building) despite planning consent to the original design having been previously granted by the supervising authority.\n\nThe extension provides 22,492 square metres of additional gross internal area for display and exhibition spaces, performance spaces, education facilities, offices, catering and retail facilities as well as a car parking and a new external public space.\n\nIn May 2017 the Switch House was formally renamed the Blavatnik Building, after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, who contributed a \"substantial\" amount of the £260m cost of the extension. Sir Nicholas Serota commented \"Len Blavatnik's enthusiastic support ensured the successful realisation of the project and I am delighted that the new building now bears his name\".\n\nThe collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and contemporary art dating from 1900 until today.\n\nLevels 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Each of those floors is split into a large east and west wing with at least 11 rooms in each. Space between these wings is also used for smaller galleries on levels 2 and 4. The Boiler House shows art from 1900 to the present day.\n\nThe Switch House has eleven floors, numbered 0 to 10. Levels 0, 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Level 0 consists of the Tanks, spaces converted from the power station's original fuel oil tanks, while all other levels are housed in the tower extension building constructed above them. The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.\n\nThe Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six stories tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0. The eastern end provides a very large space that can be used to show exceptionally large artworks due its unusual height.\n\nThe main collection displays consist of 8 areas with a named theme or subject. Within each area there are some rooms that change periodically showing different works in keeping with the overall theme or subject. The themes are changed less frequently. There is no admission charge for these areas.\n\nAs of June 2016 the themed areas were:\n\nThere is also an area dedicated to displaying works from the Artist Rooms collection.\n\nSince the Tate Modern first opened in 2000, the collections have not been displayed in chronological order but have been arranged thematically into broad groups. Prior to the opening of the Switch House there were four of these groupings at a time, each allocated a wing on levels 3 and 5 (now levels 2 and 4).\n\nThe initial hanging from 2000 to 2006:\n\nThe first rehang at Tate Modern opened in May 2006. It eschewed the thematic groupings in favour of focusing on pivotal moments of twentieth-century art. It also introduced spaces for shorter exhibitions in between the wings. The layout was:\n\n\nIn 2012 there was a partial third rehang. The arrangement was:\n\n\nThe Turbine hall, which once housed the electricity generators of the old power station, is five storeys tall with 3,400 square metres of floorspace. It is used to display large specially-commissioned works by contemporary artists, between October and March each year. \n\nFrom 2000 until 2012, the series was named after its corporate sponsor, Unilever. In this time the company provided £4.4m sponsorship in total including a renewal deal of £2.2m for a period of five years agreed in 2008.\nThis series was planned to last the gallery's first five years, but the popularity of the series led to its extension until 2012.\n\nThe artists who have exhibited commissioned work in the Turbine Hall as part of the Unilever series are:\nIn 2013, Tate Modern signed a sponsorship deal worth around £5 million with Hyundai to cover a ten-year program of commissions, then considered the largest amount of money ever provided to an individual gallery or museum in the United Kingdom. The first commission for the Hyundai series is Mexican artist, Abraham Cruzvillegas.\n\nThe artists who have exhibited commissioned work in the Turbine Hall as part of the Hyundai series thus far are:\nWhen there is no series running, the Turbine Hall is used for occasional events and exhibitions. In 2011 it was used to display Damien Hirst's \"For The Love of God\" while a sell out show by Kraftwerk in February 2013 crashed the ticket hotline and website, causing a backlash from the band's fans.\n\nTwo wings of the Boiler House are used to stage the major temporary exhibitions for which an entry fee is charged. These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the Gilbert and George retrospective due to the size and number of the works. Currently the two wings used are on level 3. It is not known if this arrangement is permanent. Each major exhibition has a dedicated mini-shop selling books and merchandise relevant to the exhibition.\n\nA 2014 show of Henri Matisse provided Tate Modern with London's best-attended charging exhibition, and with a record 562,622 visitors overall, helped by a nearly five-month-long run. In 2018, Joan Jonas had a retrospective exhibition.\n\nThe Tanks, located on level 0, are three large underground oil tanks, connecting spaces and side rooms originally used by the power station and refurbished for use by the gallery. One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection.\n\nThe Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) was a smaller gallery located on the north side of the Boiler House on level 1 which housed exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically ran for 2–3 months and then travelled to the collaborating institution for display there. The space was only accessible by leaving the building and re-entering using a dedicated entrance. It is no longer used as gallery space.\n\nWorks are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members' rooms. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the Boiler House building.\n\nIn addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:\n\nThe closest station is Blackfriars via its new south entrance. Other nearby stations include Southwark, as well as St Paul's and Mansion House north of the river which can be reached via the Millennium Bridge. The lampposts between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange to show pedestrian visitors the route.\n\nThere is also a riverboat pier just outside the gallery called Bankside Pier, with connections to the Docklands and Greenwich via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain.\n\nTo the west of Tate Modern lie the sleek stone and glass Ludgate House, the former headquarters of Express Newspapers and Sampson House, a massive late Brutalist office building.\n\n\nFrances Morris' appointment as director was announced in January 2016.\n\n\nSince 2010 there have been 14 protest art performances by the art collective \"Liberate Tate\" demanding the Tate to \"disengage from BP as a sponsor, and stop allowing Tate to be used to deflect attention away from the devastating impacts that BP has around the world.\" BP is criticised for operations in relation with Petroleum exploration in the Arctic, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Oil sands and climate change. The artists involved in the protests are referring to a deal between BP and the Tate: BP pays £224,000 a year to the Tate. The Tate presents the brand BP in return. In June 2015 a group of artists occupied Tate Modern for 25 hours.\n\n\n\n"}

The result may not make sense, but it will last long enough for you to be comfortably seated before the feature begins.\" This statement refers to the original theatrical exhibition of the cartoon, in which it ran ahead of a feature film.\n\nAt first, Jerry eats the watermelon and spits the seeds out, hitting and waking Tom, who initially grabs the hammer to attempt to hit Jerry but instead flicks him in the back of his head. Jerry swallows the seeds by accident, causing him to turn green for a moment and then make sounds like a shaker when he moves, and goes into a lively dance until Tom traps him in a metal can. Tom uses Jerry as a maraca for his own dance; when the effect suddenly stops, Tom peeks inside only to get a mouthful of seeds spat into his face. He gets very mad and devours the rest of the watermelon and turns his head into a cannon to fire blasts of seeds at Jerry, who takes cover in the kit box just before Tom hits it, blowing up the stick of dynamite and destroying the box.\n\nJerry winds up lying beneath a book named \"Judo for Mice\", studies it, and emerges with enough fighting skill to easily overpower Tom. Even a stint of training at a boxing gym and use of the knife do not give Tom any advantage against Jerry. Finally Tom goes to a judo school in order to face him again. The two have a breaking contest, in which each tries to outdo the other: Jerry with a wooden board, Tom with a brick, then Jerry again with a cement block. The contest ends abruptly when Tom tries to break a huge block of heavy marble, which crashes through the floor and takes him with it.\n\nAn unconscious Tom ends up in the battered box. Jerry replaces the lid as the narrator pipes up, \"Our next film will be for the kiddies, and will demonstrate a new poison gas. Thank you and good night.\" The words on the lid say \"The End, an MGM cartoon\" like an ending typical of a Deitch Tom and Jerry short. The music winds to stop as if it was being played on a slowing phonograph record, and Jerry bows to the audience in typical Japanese fashion, as the gong is sounded, making the screen fade to black.\n\n\n\n"}

They have been variously identified by theologians as two individuals, as two groups of people, or as two concepts. Dispensationalist Christians believe that the events described in the Book of Revelation will occur before and during the Second Coming of Christ, and they attempt to associate references in the Book of Revelation with historical or current happenings and people.\n\nJohn is told that the court of God's temple would be trampled on by the nations for 42 months. During that period for 1,260 days (or 42 months, or 3½ years), two witnesses would be granted authority to prophesy. They are described as \"two olive trees\" and \"two lampstands\" who stand before the Lord of the earth. Both are able to devour their enemies with fire that flows out of their mouths. Also, they have power over the sky and waters and are able to strike the earth with plague.\n\nAfter their testimony, \"the Beast\" overcomes the two witnesses and kills them. For three and a half days, the people of the earth celebrate the two witnesses' death (who have tormented them for three and a half years) and will not permit the witnesses a proper burial. After this time, God resurrects the two witnesses; their resurrection strikes fear on everyone witnessing their revival, and the two witnesses then ascend to heaven. In the next hour, a great earthquake occurs and kills 7000 men, destroying a tenth of the city.\n\nAccording to the text, the \"two witnesses\" are symbolised as the \"two olive trees and the two lampstands\" that have the power to destroy their enemies, control the weather and cause plagues. Their description as \"two olive trees and two lampstands\" may be symbolism, allegory, or literal.\n\nIn attempting to interpret Revelation 11, commentators who hold to a premillennial eschatology generally interpret the two witnesses in one of three ways: (1) as individuals either manifested in some form of reincarnation; or \"in the spirit\" of biblical prophets who once appeared in Bible history; or simply as two individuals newly arrived on the earth; (2) as corporate in nature (human) standing for the Church only or for Israel only; or both Israel and the Church; or for both Jewish and Gentiles believers in Jesus; or (3) as symbolism or an expression of biblical concepts (i.e., the Old and New Testaments; the Law and the Prophets; Mercy and Grace).\n\nThe literalist typically has a dispensationalist or futurist interpretation that the \"two witnesses\" will be actual people who will appear in the Last days. However, there are varying views as to the identity of the \"two witnesses\".\n\nEarly Christian writers such as Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Hippolytus of Rome, have concluded that the two witnesses would be Enoch and Elijah, prophets who did not die because God \"took\" them according to other Biblical passages.\n\nOthers have proposed Moses as one of the witnesses, for his ability to turn water into blood and the power to plague the earth.\n\nModern theologians, such as John Walvoord, have furthered the point of individualism by comparing the \"two lampstands\" and the \"two olive trees\" of \"Revelation\" 11 to the \"two golden pipes\" and \"two olive trees/branches\" of \"Zechariah\" 4. By the identification of the \"two olive branches\" as \"two anointed ones\" or \"two sons of the oil\", in Zechariah, this reinforces the literalist interpretation that the two witnesses are two people. The personification of the \"two witnesses\" in \"Revelation\" is so prevalent that according to theologian William Barclay, the passage seems to refer to definite persons. Walvoord further pointed out that because the \"Revelation\" passage does not specifically identify who the \"two witnesses\" are, it would be safer to conclude that they are not related to any previous historical character.\n\nThe \"two witnesses\" have been interpreted as representing the Church or a similar concept. The \"1599 Geneva Study Bible\" has asserted that the two witnesses are the exclusive purview of the church. Matthew Henry's \"Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible\" gives one church interpretation as consisting of believing Jews and that of the Gentiles. John Wesley in his commentary on Revelation 11 suggests a more spiritual, almost ambiguous, application. John Gill's \"Exposition of the Bible\" interprets the two witnesses as the true Church in counterdistinction to the antichrist system of Roman Catholicism. Ross Taylor's \"Verse by Verse Commentary on Revelation\" clearly defines the Church as the \"two olive trees and the two lampstands.\"\n\nSimilarly, the two witnesses have been identified as Israel and the Christian Church. The number \"two\" has been associated with the witness of Israel to the Gentile nations during the 70th Week of Daniel's prophecy. The olive tree in the Scripture signifies Israel. The \"witness of the Church\" is signified by the two lampstands, whose identity was disclosed by the seven golden lampstands (i.e., candlesticks) revealed in Revelation 2-3 as the \"churches.\" Revelation 2:1 refers to the churches as golden lampstands.\n\nIt has also been proposed that the \"two witnesses\" are the witnessing church, because Jesus sent out his disciples \"two by two\".\n\nIn the Seventh-day Adventist interpretation, Uriah Smith and Ellen G. White considered the \"two witnesses\" to be the Old and New Testaments. They believed that the French Revolution was the time when the \"two witnesses\" were killed. Other Historicists consider the Two Witnesses also in this way.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the two witnesses would be two prophets on a mission to the Jews in the modern nation of Israel, possibly two members of their Quorum of the Twelve or their First Presidency, who are considered to be prophets by the church. Some members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claim that Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith, Assistant President from 1841-1844, are the two witnesses in Revelation 11.\n\nThe Testimony of the Two Witnesses website declares that Peter the Roman will be one of the two witnesses of the Book of Revelation.\n\nThe two witnesses play a central role in the supernatural drama television series \"Sleepy Hollow\".  The first witness is Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison), a Revolutionary War soldier who, after battling with the Horseman of Death (whom he causes to be headless), awakens in Sleepy Hollow in 2013.  The second witness is Lieutenant Abbie Mills (Nicole Beharie), a contemporary woman in law enforcement who helps Crane adjust to the 21st century and aids him in battling dæmonic forces.  The two witnesses must face 'Seven Tribulations' (although other characters note that the Witnesses are only required to \"witness\" the events rather than take action themselves), the first being Moloch, the master of the Horsemen.  The second Tribulation is Pandora and her master, an ancient Sumerian god known as the Hidden One.  Although Lieutenant Mills (now Agent Mills of the F. B. I.) loses her soul, there must always be two witnesses, and the mantle passes on to Molly Thomas (Oona Yaffe) on her eleventh birthday.  Not long thereafter, Molly's older self, going by the name Lara (Seychelle Gabriel), comes from the future to aid Crane in his battles, thereby assuming the mantle of the witness from her younger self.\n\nIn the \"Left Behind\" franchise, the two witnesses prophesy at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. They are later revealed to be Elijah and Moses, and are killed by the Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33291", "title": "WYSIWYG", "text": "WYSIWYG\n\nWYSIWYG ( ) is an acronym for \"what you see is what you get\". In computing, a WYSIWYG editor is a system in which content (text and graphics) can be edited in a form closely resembling its appearance when printed or displayed as a finished product, such as a printed document, web page, or slide presentation.\n\nWYSIWYG implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the end result while the document is being created. In general, WYSIWYG implies the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without having to type or remember names of layout commands. The actual meaning depends on the user's perspective, e.g.\n\nModern software does a good job of optimizing the screen display for a particular type of output. For example, a word processor is optimized for output to a typical printer. The software often emulates the resolution of the printer in order to get as close as possible to WYSIWYG. However, that is not the main attraction of WYSIWYG, which is the ability of the user to be able to visualize what they are producing.\n\nIn many situations, the subtle differences between what the user sees and what the user gets are unimportant. In fact, applications may offer multiple WYSIWYG modes with different levels of \"realism\", including\n\nBefore the adoption of WYSIWYG techniques, text appeared in editors using the system standard typeface and style with little indication of layout (margins, spacing, etc.). Users were required to enter special non-printing \"control codes\" (now referred to as markup \"code tags\") to indicate that some text should be in boldface, italics, or a different typeface or size. In this environment there was very little distinction between text editors and word processors.\n\nThese applications typically used an arbitrary markup language to define the codes/tags. Each program had its own special way to format a document, and it was a difficult and time-consuming process to change from one word processor to another.\n\nThe use of markup tags and codes remains popular today in some applications due to their ability to store complex formatting information. When the tags are made visible in the editor, however, they occupy space in the unformatted text and so disrupt the desired layout and flow.\n\nBravo, a document preparation program for the Alto produced at Xerox PARC by Butler Lampson, Charles Simonyi and colleagues in 1974, is generally considered the first program to incorporate WYSIWYG technology, displaying text with formatting (e.g. with justification, fonts, and proportional spacing of characters). The Alto monitor (72 PPI, based on the typographic unit) was designed so that one full page of text could be seen and then printed on the first laser printers. When the text was laid out on the screen, 72 PPI font metric files were used, but when printed 300 PPI files were used—thus one would occasionally find characters and words slightly off, a problem that continues to this day.\n\nBravo was released commercially and the software eventually included in the Xerox Star can be seen as a direct descendant of it.\n\nIn parallel with but independent of the work at Xerox PARC, Hewlett Packard developed and released in late 1978 the first commercial WYSIWYG software application for producing overhead slides or what today are called presentation graphics. The first release, named BRUNO (after an HP sales training puppet), ran on the HP 1000 minicomputer taking advantage of HP's first bitmapped computer terminal the HP 2640. BRUNO was then ported to the HP-3000 and re-released as \"HP Draw\".\n\nBy 1981 MicroPro advertised that its WordStar word processor had WYSIWYG, but its display was limited to displaying styled text in WYSIWYG fashion; bold and \"italic\" text would be represented on screen instead of surrounded by tags or special control characters. In 1983 the \"Weekly Reader\" advertised its Stickybear educational software with the slogan \"what you see is what you get\", with photographs of its Apple II graphics, but home computers of the 1970s and early 1980s lacked the sophisticated graphics capabilities necessary to display WYSIWYG documents, meaning that such applications were usually confined to limited-purpose, high-end workstations (such as the IBM Displaywriter System) that were too expensive for the general public to afford. Towards the mid-1980s, however, things began to change. Improving technology allowed the production of cheaper bitmapped displays, and WYSIWYG software started to appear for more popular computers, including LisaWrite for the Apple Lisa, released in 1983, and MacWrite for the Apple Macintosh, released in 1984.\n\nThe Apple Macintosh system was originally designed so that the screen resolution and the resolution of the ImageWriter dot-matrix printers sold by Apple were easily scaled: 72 PPI for the screen and 144 DPI for the printers. Thus, the scale and dimensions of the on-screen display in programs such as MacWrite and MacPaint were easily translated to the printed output—if the paper were held up to the screen, the printed image would be the same size as the on screen image, but at twice the resolution. As the ImageWriter was the only model of printer physically compatible with the Macintosh printer port, this created an effective closed system. Later, when Macs using external displays became available, the resolution was fixed to the size of the screen to achieve 72 DPI. These resolutions often differed from the VGA-standard resolutions common in the PC world at the time. Thus, while a Macintosh monitor had the same 640 × 480 resolution as a PC, a screen would be fixed at 832 × 624 rather than the 800 × 600 resolution used by PCs. With the introduction of third-party dot-matrix printers as well as laser printers and multisync monitors, resolutions deviated from even multiples of the screen resolution, making true WYSIWYG harder to achieve.\n\nIn 2012, Wikipedia offered a WYSIWYG editor called VisualEditor, which allowed edits of Wikipedia to be performed without seeing the page source.\n\nThe phrase \"what you see is what you get\", from which the acronym derives, was a catchphrase popularized by Flip Wilson's drag persona Geraldine, first appearing in September 1969, then regularly in the early 1970s on \"The Flip Wilson Show\". The phrase was a statement demanding acceptance of Geraldine's entire personality and appearance.\n\nFurthermore, multiple hit songs and albums debuted in 1971 that could have also contributed to popularizing this phrase, including What You See Is What You Get by Stoney & Meatloaf, Stand by Me (Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get) by Bernard Purdie and Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get by The Dramatics.\n\nAs it relates to computing, there are multiple claims to first use of the phrase:\n\nBecause designers of WYSIWYG applications typically have to account for a variety of different output devices, each of which has different capabilities, there are a number of problems that must be solved in each implementation. These can be seen as tradeoffs between multiple design goals, and hence applications that use different solutions may be suitable for different purposes.\n\nTypically, the design goals of a WYSIWYG application may include the following:\nIt is not usually possible to achieve all of these goals at once.\n\nThe major problem to be overcome is that of varying output resolution. As of 2016, monitors typically have a resolution of between 102 and 125 pixels per inch. Printers generally have resolutions between 240 and 1440 pixels per inch; in some printers the horizontal resolution is different from the vertical. This becomes a problem when trying to lay out text; because older output technologies require the spacing between characters to be a whole number of pixels, rounding errors will cause the same text to require different amounts of space in different resolutions.\n\nSolutions to this include the following:\n\nOther problems that have been faced in the past include differences in the fonts used by the printer and the on-screen display (largely solved by the use of downloadable font technologies like TrueType) and differences in color profiles between devices (mostly solved by printer drivers with good color model conversion software).\n\nApart from these issues, the practice of WYSIWYG itself has been condemned as distracting from the writing process.\n\nMany variations are used only to illustrate a point or make a joke, and have very limited real use. Some that have been proposed include the following:\n\n"}

Zeal combined the work of Looksmart's paid editors with that of volunteers who profiled websites and placed them in a hierarchy of subcategories. The resulting categories and profiles were downloaded at intervals by LookSmart and its partners, other search companies such as MSN, Lycos, and Altavista, for use in their own systems with or without modification.\n\nPaid editors attended to commercial sites and oversaw the voluntary work on non-commercial sites.\n\nVolunteers worked under a defined set of Guidelines and were required to pass an introductory level test on those Guidelines before submitting site profiles or edits. As points and experience were acquired, volunteers could elect to take a further exam which allowed them to \"adopt\" and create topic categories of special interest. They could then move up the organizational structure from Community Member to Zealot to Expert Zealot, acquiring additional tools and oversight responsibility at each level. Expert Zealots, who could move or delete some whole categories, monitored the day-to-day operations of the non-commercial portion of the directory and acted as mentors to new members.\n\nActive volunteers were found in many English-speaking countries (particularly North America, United Kingdom, India, Australia, and New Zealand) and some other countries such as Spain, Switzerland, and Japan.\n\nBy March 2003, Zeal had passed the 250,000 listings mark; eventually it passed the 400,000 mark due, in part, to the Zeal Charity Drive contest of October 2003, which saw over $25,000 distributed around prominent charities such as WWF. \n\nAfter Looksmart's acquisition of Zeal, its internet traffic as measured by Alexa fluctuated considerably; after MSN withdrew from the related partnership, Zeal traffic declined from \"usually better than 2000th\" (mid-2003) to \"about 5000th\" (mid-2004).\n\nBranch offices in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom were closed in about 2004, and the corresponding directories were said to have been sold but/and were gradually merged with the main directory.\n\nZeal closed on 28 March 2006.\n\n"}
