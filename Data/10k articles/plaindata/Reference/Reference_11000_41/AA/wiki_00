Most words have an explanation of their usage, origins and area of usage with examples. The Dictionary contains words collected from all written forms, since the first Lithuanian published book in 1547 until 2001.\n\nThe idea of the Dictionary belongs to Lithuanian philologist Kazimieras Būga. He started collecting material for the dictionary in 1902 and had over 617,000 cards with words, part of them from Antanas Juška dictionary. The first part of the dictionary was printed in 1924, the complete first volume in 1941 (letters A-B) under supervision of Juozas Balčikonis. The second volume appeared in 1947, and together with the first it was banned and hidden by the Soviet authorities because of ideological reasons. These volumes are now bibliographical rarities. The first and second volumes had to be republished later. Work continued as the third volume was published in 1956, although it was difficult under the Soviet regime; some words (especially religious) were forced to be omitted. The loss was restored after Lithuania regained independence and ideological barriers were removed.\n\nThe work on the dictionary took more than six decades by many generations of linguists. It was finished in 2005, and an online version has appeared.\n\nThe dictionary is available printed, on CD-ROM and online.\n\n\n"}

Roy (1914-1984) was among the handful of photojournalists in India who documented the eventful years immediately before and after independence. He was a close friend of the Arya family and left his surviving photographic negatives and prints to Aditya Arya. These prints and negatives remained forgotten in boxes for nearly 23 years after his death, until their inheritor Aditya Arya, began restoring and cataloguing them. The archive included many unpublished pictures of national leaders and events of the Indian pre and post-independence era and were brought to the public domain after the establishment of the Aditya Arya Archive.\nOne of the outcomes of the unearthing and restoration process of the archive was that many images from the last years of British rule and the early decades after India’s independence, which were reprinted over the decades and credited to random journalists, turned out to be Roy’s work and have now been duly acknowledged. One of many such images is the iconic 1939 photograph of Mohandas K. Gandhi and Ali Jinnah in a heated argument, which has now been credited to Roy by Getty Images.\nMany historians believe that the archive may shed light on the key moments in India’s independence movement.\n\nAditya Arya Archive contains some rare and iconic images from the period of India’s independence struggle and thereafter. These include rare photographs of Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi and Sardar Patel huddled in an animated discussion, Mahatma Gandhi in debate with Mohd. Ali Jinnah, with whom he was seldom seen with, Jacqueline Kennedy sharing a laugh with Pt. Nehru, Pt. Nehru wearing khaki shorts heading to attend a Congress Seva Dal Volunteers rally in Kanpur, Pt. Nehru in cricket gear, the Indian National Army Trials, Pt. Nehru bidding farewell to his grandson Rajiv Gandhi as he leaves for a tour, Congress Party meetings, Muslim League meetings, Mahatma Gandhi’s visit to the North West Frontier Province, signing of the Indian Constitution, Mahatma Gandhi addressing the Indian National Army soldiers, the Cripps' Mission, a series documenting the development of the Bhakra Dam and photographs from the front of the Sino-Indian War, etc.\n\nTaking a leap with the Kulwant Roy collection, the Aditya Arya Archive released a book, History in the making – The visual archives of Kulwant Roy, in April 2010. The book has been published in hardback by HarperCollins Publishers India Ltd.\n\nAditya Arya and Indivar Kametkar worked together on the book for nearly three years, putting together text and images to form a compelling visual narrative. It is a visual documentary on the history of India from the 1930s to 1950s and some of Kulwant Roy’s original captions and the imprint of his own rubber stamp on several pages. The forward has been written by India’s Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh. \n\n\nOne of the outcomes of the process of restoration of the historical photographic collections is the India Photo Archive Foundation, which was established in the year 2009 The India Photo Archive Foundation is a Public Charitable Trust engaged in digitising, annotating, and preserving photographic archives.\n"}

The case involved the testimony of a dying man who identified his attackers and the testimony of other African American victims of an attack with an axe. Kentucky state law prohibited the testimony of a \"Negro\" against a white man and barred African Americans from serving on juries. After the attackers were convicted in Federal court, the State of Kentucky appealed the case to the Supreme Court citing States Rights in defense of its laws prohibitting African Americans from testifying against Whites. The case was a test of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Supreme Court ruled that victims were not entitled to protection from the state law because word \"affected\" in the law did not apply to victims of crimes who are not defendants in a case.

The civil rights legislation was subsequently modified and comments in the dissent are noted for putting forth a group right to the adequate protection of the law.

It houses a collection of circus posters, Gustav A. Dentzel Carousel animals, and elaborately carved miniature circuses, including those by Roy Arnold and Edgar Kirk.\n\nIn the 1950s the Museum conceived of the design for the Circus Building, completed in 1965, to meet the requirements of exhibiting the five-hundred-foot-long Roy Arnold miniature circus. Traversing the grand hallway of the large horseshoe-shaped, spruce and cedar structure gives the impression of walking through the entire concourse of a circus parade. Outside, the large boulders that form the building’s foundation accentuate the structure’s dramatic shape and serve as the backdrop for the Daylily Garden, planted in 2008.\n\nAlthough the carousel was invented in Europe it reached its fullest development in the United States between 1870 and 1930. during this time, elaborate carousels became fixtures of the new city parks built for a public with increasing amounts of leisure time and disposable income. Hundreds of park carousels were built by highly skilled woodcarvers and painters while an even greater number of smaller, portable carousels were made for use at country fairs and carnivals.\n\nShelburne Museum owns examples of both types of carousels: a small, portable machine operates outside the Circus Building, while the animals, chariots and painted panels from a part carousel manufactured by the Gustav Dentzel Company of Philadelphia are exhibited inside the Circus Building. Figures by a number of other manufacturers, both European and American, also are exhibited in the Circus building. \n\nThe German-born Dentzel opened America’s first carousel business in 1867. Detnzel’s shop produced the most realistic and graceful of all carousel animals; his carvers paid enormous attention to anatomical detail and his painters rendered every nuance of the animals’ coloration. Shelburne Museum’s Dentzels are from a forty-animal carousel completed about 1902. The three-row machine carried twenty-nine horses and four chariots; menagerie figures include three giraffes, three goats, three deer, a lion and a tiger. The figures were finish-carved by Daniel Muller, the most skilled of Dentzel’s craftspeople. All the animals are in their original factory paint; this is almost unheard of for carousel figures because most carousels were repainted frequently as part of routine maintenance. Several of the figures have recently been conserved; layers of discolored, non-original linseed oil were removed to reveal the richly colored and complex paint patterns applied by Dentzel’s masterful painters. All forty animals will eventually receive the same professional treatment. \n\nThe small, portable carousel outside the circus building was made about 1920 by the Allan Herschell Company of North Tonawanda, New York. In 1883 herschell began producing carousels designed to endure hard wear and frequent travel. The horses were smaller and more compact than those made for permanent park carousels by such companies as Dentzel and the Philadelphia Toboggan Company heads and legs were tucked close to the bodies to minimize breakage and the machines could be easily taken apart, moved, and reassembled.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, the circus was an annual event awaited with great anticipation. Weeks before the circus was due to arrive, colorful posters appeared on barns and fences, announcing the dates and new performers. When the circus arrived, excitement grew as wagons, elephants, and clowns paraded through town.\n\nTraveling circuses are represented at the Shelburne Museum by the vintage advertising posters that line the inside wall of the Circus Building. The Museum’s collection of over five hundred circus posters is among the finest and most comprehensive in the country. It includes many extremely rare, early posters as well as examples from all the major circuses of the Golden Age of the American traveling circus (ca. 1870-1940), including Barnum and Bailey, Ringling Brothers, Adam Forepaugh, John B. Doris, and the Sells Brothers. The posters are typically brightly colored and attention-grabbing. Most feature dramatic new acts or exotic animals; many make outrageous (and sometimes utterly false) claims – the largest, the smallest, the most dangerous, the rarest, the one and only, etc.\n\nThe Museum owns three elaborate carved miniature circuses. The Circus Parade, which runs over five hundred feet through the circus building, was begun in 1925 by Roy Arnold (1892-1976) of Hardwick, Vermont. Built on a one-inch to one-foot scale, the parade required thirty years to complete. Four other skilled woodcarvers, Harry T. Prior, Charles W. Dech, Milo Smith and Charles Lockier, worked with Arnold on the parade, which features accurate reproductions of wagons used by circuses of the Golden Age. The miniature parade is complemented by exhibits of pony-sized wagons and several life-sized figures originally carved by Samuel Anderson Robb for Barnum and Bailey tableau wagons in the 1890s. Robb is best known for his trade figures, several of which are exhibited in Stagecoach Inn.\n\nThe Kirk Bros. Miniature Circus is a complete three-ringed folk art circus created by Edgar Decker Kirk (1891-1956) of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, over a period of forty-six years. Kirk, who worked as a brakeman on the Pennsylvania railroad, began the circus in 1910 when his children were small and continued to work on it long after they were grown, until 1956. Working at night after twelve-hour days with the railroad, Kirk cut the figures for his circus from scrap lumber on a treadle-operated jigsaw and completed the carving with an ordinary penknife. Only the nails and paint were specially purchased. The Kirk circus, complete with animals acts, clowns, trapeze artists, bands, side shows and bleachers full of spectators and vendors, is a monument to Kirk’s creativity, ingenuity and lifelong passion for the circus. \n\nAlso in the collection are scale models of a canal boat circus. From 1882 to 1887 residents of ports along the Erie and Oswego canals of central New York State were visited each summer by Sig Sautelle’s big shows, one of the only circuses ever to travel by boat. Sautelle, born George Satterlee (1848–1928), was a colorful showman and one of the most successful promoters of his time. The wooden models of Sautelle’s two circus canal boats, built by Milo Smith of Herkimer, New York, provide a vivid picture of this unique regional circus.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation from 1981 to 1988, where he held the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on two occasions and was crowned the inaugural King of the Ring in 1985. Muraco was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004 and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nMuraco was born at Sunset Beach, Oahu, Hawaii in 1949 of Native Hawaiian heritage. A Hawaii state amateur wrestling champion in 1967, Muraco chose professional wrestling over football. He spent the first year of his career learning the ropes in Vancouver, Portland, Florida and Los Angeles before getting his first big break, for Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association (AWA). Wrestling as a face, he often tag teamed with Jimmy Snuka, against wrestlers such as Larry Hennig, Ivan Koloff and Dusty Rhodes. In 1973, tired of life in Minneapolis, he left the AWA for Roy Shire's San Francisco NWA territory.\n\nIn 1974, Muraco moved to Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF). He was frequently compared to the NWA World Champion Jack Brisco, whom he physically resembled. In a match between the two on May 28, 1974, Muraco reversed Brisco's finishing move, the figure four leglock. Though Muraco lost the match by disqualification, this feat made him a star.\n\nAfter brief stints in Texas and Georgia, Muraco returned to California in 1975 and won his first singles title, the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship. He then won the San Francisco version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Masked Invader #1. In San Francisco, Muraco learned to work as a heel.\n\nFrom 1977 through 1981, Muraco shuttled several more times between Florida, San Francisco and his native Hawaii. In Florida, he was involved in two high-profile angles. In 1979, a masked villain called \"The Magnificent M\" appeared in the territory. Though it came as little surprise when he was eventually unmasked as Muraco, his bald head shocked the audience. Then, in 1980, he feuded with Barry Windham, in which the bigger and more experienced Muraco piledrove the rookie on the concrete floor. Windham eventually got his revenge, in the process becoming a credible wrestler in the eyes of the fans.\n\nIn 1981, Muraco debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he would have his greatest success. Managed by The Grand Wizard, he captured the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on June 20, 1981, from Pedro Morales. He lost it to Morales on November 23 in a Texas Death match, capping a bloody feud. That year, Muraco wrestled then WWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund several times, including a 60-minute draw on October 24. He split 1982 between Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (where he partnered with Roddy Piper for a time), Georgia Championship Wrestling (where he also wrestled under a mask as Dr. X) and New Japan Pro Wrestling (where he wrestled in the annual MSG League tournament), before returning to the WWF that fall.\n\nNow managed by Captain Lou Albano, Muraco regained the Intercontinental title from Morales on January 22, 1983. That year, Muraco feuded with Albano's former protégé, Jimmy Snuka. The feud culminated on October 17, in a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden. Snuka lost the match, but afterward dragged Muraco back into the ring and hit his finisher, the Superfly Splash, from the top of the 15-foot cage. In the crowd at the Garden for this match was future WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley.\n\nDuring his two Intercontinental title reigns, Muraco had bloody feuds with Bob Backlund, Tony Atlas and Rocky Johnson. He portrayed an arrogant villain who angrily demanded respect, while engaging in disrespectful behaviour himself; in one match, he brought a submarine sandwich to the ring and ate it while dominating his outmatched opponent. Later, he would preface his matches by dedicating his impending finishing move, the piledriver, to either the heel commentator or whomever he was feuding with at the time. Audiences regularly mocked Muraco and his Hawaiian origins with derisive chants of \"beach bum\".\n\nOn February 11, 1984, Muraco lost the Intercontinental title to Tito Santana. After a series of unsuccessful rematches, Muraco took a hiatus from wrestling in August 1984.\n\nMuraco returned to the WWF in 1985, managed by Mr. Fuji. After not wrestling on the card of the first WrestleMania, Muraco headlined three consecutive Madison Square Garden cards against WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, climaxing in a bloody steel cage match on June 21, which Hogan won. On July 8, Muraco won the first King of the Ring tournament when he pinned The Iron Sheik in the Final. Before defeating the Sheik, Muraco had defeated the Junkyard Dog, Les Thornton and Pedro Morales to reach the Final.\n\nIn addition to feuding with Ricky Steamboat for much of the remainder of the year which included hanging Steamboat from the top rope with Steamboat's own karate belt on an episode of \"WWF Championship Wrestling\", Fuji and Muraco debuted \"Fuji Vice\", a series of skits parodying Miami Vice, on \"Tuesday Night Titans\" (\"Fuji General\", a parody of the ABC soap \"General Hospital\", followed soon after).\nIn 1986, Muraco allied with Adrian Adonis and Bob Orton, Jr. in their feud with Roddy Piper. This led to Orton and Muraco becoming a regular tag team. In March 1987 they lost to the Can-Am Connection (Tom Zenk and Rick Martel) in the opening match of Wrestlemania III in front of a reported 93,173 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome. July 1987, a falling out between Muraco and Orton led to a feud between them and a face turn for Muraco. Muraco won almost every match in the feud, on TV and at house shows, until Orton left the WWF that year.\n\nIn a TV taping aired in November 1987, Muraco solidified his face status by saving Superstar Billy Graham from a three-on-one beating by Butch Reed, One Man Gang and Slick, and taking Graham as his new manager. Muraco adopted Graham's tie-dye attire and changed his nickname from \"Magnificent Muraco\" to \"The Rock\" (although announcer Gorilla Monsoon continued to refer to Muraco by his previous nickname). Muraco replaced Graham on the team led by his former rival Hulk Hogan at the first Survivor Series and reached the quarterfinals of the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at WrestleMania IV. In his final months with the WWF, he feuded with Greg Valentine and lost to Dino Bravo at the inaugural SummerSlam. Muraco left the WWF in late 1988.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Muraco split his time between Stampede Wrestling (where he defeated Makhan Singh to win the North American Heavyweight title), the AWA (where he wrestled AWA World Heavyweight Champion Larry Zbyszko to a double disqualification) and Herb Abrams' UWF (where he feuded with Cactus Jack).\n\nMuraco won the ECW Championship twice, before the promotion was renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling. During his time there, he rekindled old feuds with Jimmy Snuka and Tito Santana.\n\nMuraco, as Aka Oni, debuted for Wrestle Association R (WAR) on August 25, 1994, defeating Takashi Ishikawa. He had twelve more matches with the promotion, culminating in a tag loss (with Ai Oni) to Animal Hamaguchi and Ryuma Go on December 4, at WAR Mega Power in Sumo Hall.\n\nAfter retiring from the ring in 1995, Muraco returned to Hawaii. In 2003, he co-founded Hawai'i Championship Wrestling with local TV producer Linda Bade, which ran from 2003 to 2008. He was the storyline commissioner of Hawai'i Championship Wrestling until 2006. He also worked as a longshoreman.\n\nIn 2004, Muraco was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004 by Mick Foley, who, like Tommy Dreamer, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley, credits the 1983 steel cage match between Muraco and Snuka at Madison Square Garden (which he attended) as his inspiration for becoming a wrestler.\n\nHe managed his son, Joe, in WXW. On August 27, 2005, he teamed with Joe to defeat another father and son team, Bob and Brad Armstrong, at WrestleReunion 2.\n\nIn 2007, Muraco inducted his former manager, Mr. Fuji, into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2007.\n\nMuraco currently resides in Hawaii with his wife Sharon. He has three children.\n\n\n"}

Powell III\n\nEarl Alexander Powell III (born October 24, 1943), nicknamed Rusty Powell, is an American art historian and museum director. From 1980 to 1992, he was Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was appointed Director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in September 1992. He was appointed to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in 2003 and elected chairman in 2005. He was appointed to a second four-year term on August 30, 2012, and continues to serve as chairman.\n\nEarl Powell was born in October 1943 in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to Earl Alexander Powell II and Elizabeth Duckworth Powell. His grandfather operated a photoengraving business, which Powell credits as influential in sparking his later love of art. The Powells moved to Rhode Island. \"Rusty\", as Powell was known, graduated from Providence Country Day School in 1962. He was a standout football player in high school.\n\nPowell graduated from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts with a bachelor's degree in art history and European history (with honors) in 1966. He was a pre-med major, but barely passed his introductory chemistry class. Powell switched to art history, and studied under the legendary art history professors S. Lane Faison, Jr., Whitney Stoddard, and William Pierson, Jr.\n\nPowell enlisted in the United States Navy in 1966, winning a spot in the Navy Officer Candidate School. His active duty service, which lasted until 1969, included a tour of duty in Vietnam as a navigator during the Vietnam War. He left active duty service and entered the United States Navy Reserve, serving until 1980.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy, Powell considered becoming an architect. His old professor, S. Lane Faison, strongly discouraged him. As Powell later, recalled, Faison said, \"That's stupid. You should go into art history. It's the only thing you were ever good at.\" Powell enrolled at Harvard University, where he obtained a Master of Arts from the Fogg Museum in 1970. He entered the doctoral program in art history at Harvard in 1970. While working on his degree, he served as a teaching fellow. Powell's dissertation was on the work of the early American painter Thomas Cole, and he received his doctorate in 19th-century American and European art history in 1974.\n\nThe same year he received his Ph.D., Powell took a position as assistant professor of art history at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nIn 1976, Powell left the University of Texas to take a position as a curator at the National Gallery of Art (NGA). The NGA's director at the time, J. Carter Brown, recruited Powell away from teaching. \"I first spotted (Powell) in Austin, Texas. It occurred to me that he had rare potential, someone who had a passion for art, but yet had his feet on the ground. He was a people person, yet he could also handle the administrative details...,\" Brown later said. Powell stayed at the NGA for four years, rising to the position of executive curator in 1979. Brown later said, \"Rusty was my right hand for years\". During his time as curator, Powell organized some of the NGA's biggest exhibitions, including \"The Splendor of Dresden: Five Centuries of Art Collecting\" in 1978 and \"American Light: The Luminist Movement\" in 1980.\n\nIn January 1980, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) hired Powell to be its director.\n\nPowell's tenure at LACMA was an outstanding one. In his first six years, he doubled the exhibition space by opening the Robert O. Anderson Building and the Pavilion for Japanese Art to house a rare collection of Japanese art. He also oversaw the opening of the museum's new outdoor sculpture garden in 1988.\n\nPowell was also a successful fund-raiser for the museum. In his first eight years, he reached his fund-raising goal of $80 million. In 1991, publisher Walter Annenberg donated $10 million to the museum, the largest cash donation in its history. During Powell's tenure, the LACMA endowment also rose to $21 million from $3 million.\n\nJ. Carter Brown later described Powell's tenure as director of LACMA as one \"bound for glory\".\n\nOn January 24, 1992, J. Carter Brown announced that he was retiring as director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. After a nationwide search, Earl A. Powell III was named director of the National Gallery of Art. He was only the fourth director in the museum's history. He assumed the directorship on September 1, 1992. When he was appointed, Powell said that he believed the era of \"blockbuster\" exhibitions was ending, and that his focus would be to utilize the NGA's permanent collection. \"I don't see the future for these massive international loan exhibitions,\" he said. \"I would prefer to use the gallery's permanent collections in new and innovative ways.\"\nDuring the beginning of Powell's tenure at the NGA, he faced several challenges. In May 1994, the NGA learned that its painting, \"The Holy Family on the Steps\", was a forgery and not the work of 17th-century French painter Nicolas Poussin. Powell was criticized for not ordering the relabeling of the painting in a timely manner, and for mishandling the NGA's response to its critics. In December 1994, D.C. television station WJLA ran a three-part exposé titled \"Gallery of Shame\", in which the station revealed the content of a confidential report that criticized the NGA for severe lapses in maintenance, environmental control, and art storage. The report said that these conditions \"threaten[ed] the security of the collection\" and placed works of art \"at risk\" of \"serious damage.\" The report documented a leaky roof, dripping skylights, flooded storerooms, and burst radiators that poured clouds of steam into galleries. In one case, a poorly maintained humidifier turned the varnish on John Singleton Copley's \"Watson and the Shark\" an opaque white. (The painting was restored with no damage.) The report also criticized the management structure at the museum, documented low employee morale, and uncovered poor minority hiring practices. Powell attacked WJLA's report as \"hyperbole and exaggeration\", and said that not a single work of art had been damaged. He also said that the NGA had been aware of the problems for several years, and that he already had a plan in place to implement the consultants' recommendations within 12 months.\n\nPowell has also had numerous and notable successes as NGA director. In 1995, the museum mounted the first comprehensive retrospective of the work of American painter Winslow Homer in 25 years. It also hosted an exhibit of nearly all the works of 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. The Vermeer exhibit was shuttered three times in November and December 1995 when the federal government shut down after President Bill Clinton and the United States Congress were unable to reach agreement on a federal budget. Powell ordered that $30,000 from the NGA's Fund for International Exchange be used to reopen the Vermeer exhibit (but no other parts of the National Gallery of Art) for one week. In 1997, Powell presided over the ground-breaking for the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden.\n\nIn June 2002, President George W. Bush nominated and the United States Senate approved Powell for a position as a member of the National Council on the Arts, an advisory panel for the National Endowment for the Arts. Powell filled an unexpired six-year term which would end on September 3, 2006. But Powell resigned the position in late 2003.\n\nIn May 2005, architect David Childs resigned as chairman of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA). President Bush immediately appointed Powell to the commission. His fellow commissioners elected Powell chairman of the CFA. During his tenure as chairman of the CFA, Powell and the CFA provided input and advice for the \"Monumental Core Framework Plan\", a 2006 study by the National Capital Planning Commission which made recommendations regarding land use, transportation, and urban design in areas around the National Mall. President Bush reappointed Powell to the CFA in May 2008. Again he was elected chairman. During his second term, Powell led the CFA in participating in the study and review of the \"Final National Mall Plan / Environmental Impact Statement\"—a 2010 plan by the National Park Service to craft a vision and planning document to guide the National Mall in Washington, D.C., for the next 50 years.\n\nPresident Barack Obama appointed Powell to a second full four-year term on the CFA in August 2012. Once more, Powell continued as chairman.\n\nPowell has published a number of scholarly and popular works. As curator and director at two major art museums, he has written numerous exhibit reviews and introductions to exhibit catalogs. Among the more notable of these is his 1980 essay on early American Luminist painter Fitz Hugh Lane.\n\nAs a scholar of the works of Thomas Cole, Powell has written extensively on the painter's art. His more prominent works include \"Thomas Cole's 'Dream of Arcadia'\" (published in \"Arts Magazine\" in November 1977), and \"Thomas Cole and the American Landscape Tradition: The Naturalist Controversy\" (published in \"Arts Magazine\" in February 1978). Powell also authored a monograph on Thomas Cole in 1990. A revised second edition was published in 2000.\n\nPowell has been honored with several positions. He was elected to a three-year term on the Pitzer College Board of Trustees in 1986, and was a director of the Georgia O'Keeffe Foundation in 2005.\n\nPowell has also been awarded honorary doctorates from the Otis College of Art and Design (1987) and Williams College (1993).\n\nAmong the many awards Powell has received are the St. Olav's Medal from Norway (1978), the Order of Prince Henry from Portugal (1995), the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic from Italy (1998), Knight of the Legion of Honour from France (2000), Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France (2004), Order of the Aztec Eagle from Mexico (2007), and the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (2009).\n\nEarl Powell married Nancy Landry of New Orleans in 1971. They have three children.\n\nThe Powells owned a summer home in Newport, Rhode Island, where (as of 1992) Powell's mother and mother-in-law both lived.\n"}

It contains 14 recipes each written in the style of a famous author from history. As of 2007 it had been translated into 18 languages and published in 27 countries. Excerpts from the book have appeared in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" and the \"New York Times\". Theatrical performances of the recipes have taken place in France and Canada.\n\nRecipes include: tiramisu as made by Proust, cheese on toast by Harold Pinter, clafoutis grandmere by Virginia Woolf, chocolate cake prepared by Irvine Welsh, lamb with dill sauce by Raymond Chandler, onion tart by Chaucer, fenkata (rabbit stew) by Homer, boned stuffed poussins by the Marquis de Sade, mushroom risotto by John Steinbeck, tarragon eggs by Jane Austen, Vietnamese chicken by Graham Greene and Kafka's Miso soup. Also included are recipes in the style of Jorge Luis Borges and Gabriel García Márquez.\n\nAmong the recipes that did not make the original edition of the book was \"plum pudding à la Charles Dickens\" which was written but rejected by Mark Crick for being \"too long-winded\". It was, however, included in a subsequent paperback edition of the book along with two recipes, Rösti à la Thomas Mann and moules marinieres à la Italo Calvino, originally created for the German and Italian translations respectively.\n\n\"Kafka's Soup\" is illustrated with paintings by the author in the style of a number of famous artists including Picasso, Matisse, Hogarth, De Chirico, Henry Moore, Egon Schiele and Warhol.\n\n\"Kafka's Soup\" is Mark Crick's first book. He has subsequently written two other books with similar themes; \"Sartre's Sink\" and \"Machiavelli's Lawn\" which are literary pastiches in the form of a DIY handbook and a gardening book respectively.\n\nThe idea for \"Kafka's Soup\" arose during a conversation between Crick and a publisher. Crick noted his dislike for cookbooks saying that he enjoyed looking at the pictures but found the accompanying text dull. When asked what would it take for him to read beyond the ingredients list he replied \"if [the text] was written by the world's greatest authors.\" The publisher liked the idea and, in Crick's words, \"she said that if I wrote it she'd publish it.\"\n\nMost of the recipes in the book are Crick's own, although some, such as the chocolate cake, came from his friends. Crick notes the implausibility of some of his authors cooking their stated dishes (for example he states that John Steinbeck \"would never have eaten [mushroom risotto]\" and \"I certainly accept any challenge that Kafka would not have eaten miso soup\"). He says that he selected the recipes based on the ability of each dish to allow him to use the language he wished to use. Chocolate cake was selected for Irvine Welsh because \"people become terribly selfish when there's chocolate cake around, just as they do with drugs. It's the closest many get to taking heroin.\"\n\nCrick says that he found Virginia Woolf the most difficult of the authors to write while Raymond Chandler was the easiest.\n\n\"Kafka's Soup\" has become a cult hit. Andy Miller of the \"Telegraph\" called the recipes \"note-perfect parodies of literary greats\". Emily Stokes of the \"Observer\" called it an \"illustrated masterpiece of pastiche\" citing the lamb with dill sauce as \"particularly good\". C J Schüler wrote that Virginia Woolf's clafoutis grandmere is the \"pièce de resistance\" and called the collection \"irresistibly moreish\". He later called the book \"a little gem of literary impersonation\". Schüler believes that \"part of the book's appeal lies in the fact that the recipes...actually work.\" The French writer and satirist Patrick Rambaud has named \"Kafka's soup\" as one of his favourite parodies, noting the inclusion of parodies of continental European authors such as Proust and the Marquis de Sade in addition to English-speaking authors.Some have noticed the similarity with the story written by Frederic Grimani Fiegenwald Coy, one year earlier: https://storywrite.com/story/7598601-what-would-franz-kafka-say-if-you-knock-on-his-toilet-door--by-sexy\n\nAs of 2007 \"Kafka's Soup\" had been translated into 18 languages and published in 27 countries. The Croatian translation proved more popular than \"The Da Vinci Code\", forcing it in to second place on the country's best seller list. Each recipe in the French version was translated by a separate translator specialising in the translation of the works of the parodied author.\n\nIn England, the recipes have reportedly been used as audition pieces by a small West Country theatre company. The Théâtre de l'Atelier in Paris hosted a performance of the French translation of the book in 2007. The production included performances by Irène Jacob, Isabelle Carré and Denis Podalydès, including a sung version of the recipe for onion tart. A live reading of the French translation of \"Kafka's Soup\" took place at the Montreal Festival International de la Littérature in 2007 with the author in attendance. The production received an additional performance run in the Terrebonne suburb of Montreal in 2009. \n"}

It was founded to house the private library of J. P. Morgan in 1906, which included manuscripts and printed books, some of them in rare bindings, as well as his collection of prints and drawings. The library was designed by Charles McKim of the firm of McKim, Mead and White and cost $1.2 million. It was made a public institution in 1924 by J. P. Morgan's son John Pierpont Morgan, Jr., in accordance with his father's will.\n\nThe building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966 and was declared a National Historic Landmark later that same year.\n\nToday the library is a complex of buildings which serve as a museum and scholarly research center. The scope of the collection was shaped in its early years as a private collection by Belle da Costa Greene, J.P. Morgan's personal librarian, who became the library's first director and served from the time that it became public until her retirement in 1948. Her successor Frederick Baldwin Adams, Jr. managed the Library until 1969 and was also world-renowned for his own personal collections. The most internationally significant part of the collection is its relatively small but very select collection of illuminated manuscripts, and medieval artworks such as the Stavelot Triptych and the metalwork covers of the Lindau Gospels. Among the more famous manuscripts are the Morgan Bible, Morgan Beatus, Hours of Catherine of Cleves, Farnese Hours, Morgan Black Hours, and Codex Glazier. The manuscript collection also includes authors' original manuscripts, including some by Sir Walter Scott and Honoré de Balzac, as well as the scraps of paper on which Bob Dylan jotted down \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"It Ain't Me Babe\".\n\nIt also contains a large collection of incunabula, prints, and drawings of European artists—Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, Rembrandt, Rubens, Gainsborough, Dürer, and Picasso; early printed Bibles, among them three Gutenberg Bibles; and many examples of fine bookbinding. Other holdings include material from ancient Egypt and medieval liturgical objects (including Coptic literature examples), Émile Zola, William Blake's original drawings for his edition of the \"Book of Job\"; concept drawings for \"The Little Prince\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry; a Percy Bysshe Shelley notebook; originals of poems by Robert Burns; a unique Charles Dickens manuscript of \"A Christmas Carol\" with handwritten edits and markup from the author; a journal by Henry David Thoreau; an extraordinary collection of autographed and annotated libretti and scores from Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Mahler and Verdi, and Mozart's Haffner Symphony in D Major; and manuscripts of George Sand, William Makepeace Thackeray, Lord Byron, Charlotte Brontë and nine of Sir Walter Scott's novels, including \"Ivanhoe\". The collection still includes a few Old Master paintings collected by Morgan between 1907 and 1911 (works by Hans Memling, Perugino, and Cima da Conegliano), but this has never been the collection's focus, and Ghirlandaio's masterpiece \"Portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni\" was sold to Thyssen when the Great Depression worsened the Morgan family's finances.\n\nOther notable artists of the Morgan Library and Museum are Jean de Brunhoff, Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, John Leech, Gaston Phoebus, Rembrandt van Rijn, and John Ruskin.\n\nThe Morgan has one of the world's greatest collections of ancient Near Eastern cylinder seals, small stone cylinders finely engraved with images for transfer to clay by rolling. It also contains many music manuscripts and a considerable collection of Victoriana, including one of the most important collections of Gilbert and Sullivan manuscripts and related artifacts.\n\nOf interest to Australians is a copy of the letter written by Andrea Corsali from India in 1516. This letter, one of five in existence, contains the first description of the Southern Cross which is also illustrated by Corsali in this letter and which was also named \"croce\" by him. One other copy of the letter is in the British Library and two are in Australia. The fifth is in the Library of Princeton University. The letter is also readily available in Ramusio's \"Viaggi\", a compendium of letters of exploration, published in Venice in three volumes from 1555.\n\nThe first building constructed to house Morgan's library – the \"McKim Building\" – was designed in the Classical Revival style by Charles Follen McKim of the noted firm of McKim, Mead & White in 1903. Morgan also commissioned a house to be built for his daughter a block away at the same time. It is located at 33 East 36th Street, which was at the time just to the east of Morgan's residence, a brownstone house at 219 Madison Avenue built in 1880. McKim took his inspiration from the Villa Giulia and its Nymphaeum. The building was constructed from 1902-1907 and has a facade of Tennessee marble and a Palladian arch entrance which features two lionesses sculpted by Edward Clark Potter, who would later create the two lions that guard the New York Public Library's main building. Also in the entrance are roundels and panels by Andrew O'Connor and Adolph Weinman.\n\nThe interior of the building is richly decorated, with a polychrome rotunda which leads to three public rooms, which were originally Morgan's private study, the librarian's office, and the library itself. The rotunda itself has a domed ceiling with murals and plasterwork inspired by Raphael, created by H. Siddons Mowbray. Morgan's study, now the West Library, has been called \"one of the greatest achievements of American interior decoration,\" while the East Library features triple-tiers of bookcases.\n\nMorgan's residence was torn down in 1928, after his death, to be replaced by an annex building which featured an exhibition hall and a reading room, designed by Benjamin Wistar Morris to harmonize with McKim's original.\nThe remaining Italianate brownstone house in the library complex is 231 Madison Avenue, on the corner of East 37th Street. This house was built by Isaac Newton Phelps who bequeathed it to his daughter, Helen Stokes, wife of Anson Phelps Stokes. She extended the building, doubling the size and adding an additional attic floor (architect R. H. Robertson). Their son, architect Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, was born in the house on April 11, 1867. The house was purchased by J. P. Morgan in 1904. It served as the home of his heir J. P. Morgan Jr. from 1905 to 1943.\n\nThe most recent addition to the library is a modernist entrance building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano – his New York City debut – and Beyer Blinder Belle, which was completed in 2006. Although externally \"bland\", the building helps to organize the interior spaces of the complex.\n\nThe Library was closed during the construction and expansion. In the interim it sponsored numerous traveling exhibitions around the country. When the work was completed, it reopened on April 29, 2006 as the Morgan Library & Museum. With the expansion above and below street level, the Morgan's exhibition space had been doubled; Piano set its new reading room under a translucent roof structure, to allow scholars to examine manuscripts in natural light. Piano's four-story steel-and-glass atrium links McKim's library building and the Morgan house in a new ensemble. Added storage facilities were obtained by drilling into Manhattan's bedrock schist.\n\nBetween 1987 and 2008, Charles E. Pierce Jr. served as director of what was then known as the Pierpont Morgan Library. During his tenure at the Morgan Library and Museum between 2008 and 2015, director William M. Griswold spearheaded the growth of its collections, exhibition programs and curatorial departments, adding a photography curator in 2013, a first for the institution. In an effort to reach a younger audience, he also presented many contemporary-art exhibitions and installed temporary sculpture in its atrium. In 2015, the Morgan named Colin Bailey as its new director.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Mozart rented rooms here from 1784, at which time it was also known as the Camesina House, after the family which had owned it since 1720. Since the original entrance of the house facing the Schulerstraße (the one Mozart used) was walled up to make room for a shop, the house has to be entered today from its rear in the Domgasse.\n\nIn 1941, the 150th anniversary of Mozart's death, his former rooms were opened to the public as part of \"Imperial German Mozart Week\", a National Socialist event intended to honour him as a \"typically German\" composer (in contrast to his polyglot lifestyle). In 1945 the running of the exhibition was taken over by the Vienna Museum. Despite its apparently attractive location near St. Stephen's Cathedral, visitor numbers at the so-called \"Figaro House\" were relatively modest, at around 80,000 per year.\n\nIn 2004, the city of Vienna's \"Wien Holding\" company undertook the total renovation of the Mozarthaus and redesigned it for visitors, and this was completed in time for Mozart Year 2006, the 250th anniversary of his birth. Following a complete refurbishment, the entire building (including the expanded basement) became a centre dedicated to the composer's life and work, incorporating the rooms occupied by Mozart himself. This process was overseen by the Vienna Museum. \n\nToday the Mozarthaus presents information about the composer in combination with historical exhibits and audio-visual installations, while the basement contains an events hall co-financed by the EU. 340,000 people visited the museum in its first three years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "467343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=467343", "title": "Player's Handbook", "text": "Player's Handbook\n\nThe Player's Handbook (spelled Players Handbook in first edition \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"AD&D\")) is a book of rules for the fantasy role-playing game \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"D&D\"). It does not contain the complete set of rules for the game, and only includes rules for use by players of the game. Additional rules, for use by Dungeon Masters (DMs), who referee the game, can be found in the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\". Many optional rules, such as those governing extremely high-level players, and some of the more obscure spells, are found in other sources.\n\nSince the first edition, the \"Player's Handbook\" has contained tables and rules for creating characters, lists of the abilities of the different character classes, the properties and costs of equipment, descriptions of spells that magic-using character classes (such as wizards or clerics) can cast, and numerous other rules governing gameplay. Both the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" and the \"Player's Handbook\" give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play. The \"Player's Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\" make up the core \"D&D\" rulebooks.\n\nThe first true \"Players Handbook\" was released in June, 1978 as a 128-page hardcover. It was written by Gary Gygax and edited by Mike Carr, who also wrote the foreword. The original cover art was by D.A. Trampier, who also provided interior illustrations along with David C. Sutherland III. In this edition, the game rules were divided between the \"Players Handbook\" and the \"Dungeon Masters Guide\", which was printed later. Later editions of the game moved the bulk of the game rules to the \"Player's Handbook\", leaving information needed chiefly by the DM in the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\". The new rules were so open-ended that game campaigns required a referee or Dungeon Master.\n\nThe \"Players Handbook\" contained the information needed to play the standard character classes: clerics (including druids), fighters (including rangers and paladins), magic-users (including illusionists), thieves (including assassins), and monks. The book also included information on non-human races, such as dwarves, elves, and halflings, character abilities, armor and weapons, spell descriptions, and optional rules for psionics.\n\nThe original \"Players Handbook\" was reviewed by Don Turnbull in issue No. 10 of \"White Dwarf\", who gave the book a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull noted, \"I don't think I have ever seen a product sell so quickly as did the \"Handbook\" when it first appeared on the Games Workshop stand at Dragonmeet\", a British role-playing game convention; after the convention, he studied the book and concluded that \"whereas the original rules are ambiguous and muddled, the \"Handbook\" is a detailed and coherent game-system, and very sophisticated.\" Turnbull felt a bit of apprehension at the amount of time it would require to digest all the new material, but concluded by saying \"I said of the \"Monster Manual\" that it was TSR's most impressive publication to date; that is no longer true—this accolade must belong to the \"Handbook\" which is nothing short of a triumph.\"\n\nIn 1983, TSR changed the cover art of the \"Players Handbook\", although the interior contents remained the same. This printing featured cover art by Jeff Easley. Printings with this cover also bear an orange spine that fits in with other \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" books.\n\nNumerous foreign editions of the \"Players Handbook\" were published, including versions for the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Germany. Games Workshop (U.K.) published a softcover version also in 1978.\n\nDealers continued to place orders for the 1st edition \"Players Handbook\" even after 2nd edition was released, causing the final printing to be in July 1990, a year after the release of 2nd edition.\n\nIn 2012, Wizards of the Coast released a new printing of the original book, billed as the \"1st Edition Premium Player's Handbook\", as part of a set of limited-edition reprints of the original 1st Edition core rulebooks: the \"Monster Manual\", \"Player's Handbook\", and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\". These premium versions of the original \"AD&D\" rulebooks were reprinted with the original art and content, but feature a new cover design. Purchase of the reprinted \"Player's Handbook\" will help support the Gygax Memorial Fund—established to immortalize Gary Gygax with a memorial statue in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\n\nThe \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition Player's Handbook\" was a 256-page hardcover book written by David \"Zeb\" Cook and released in 1989. The original cover art is by Jeff Easley, and the book featured eight full-page color illustrations, as well as other interior illustrations by Douglas Chaffee, Larry Elmore, Craig Farley, John and Laura Lakey, Erik Olson, Jack Pennington, Jeff Butler, Jeff Easley, Jean E. Martin, and Dave Sutherland.\n\nThe \"Player's Handbook\" for 2nd edition was compatible with 1st edition rules, but was streamlined and clarified. The book included information on how to play the standard character classes: warriors (including fighters, paladins, and rangers), wizards (including mages and specialist wizards such as illusionists), priests (clerics and guidelines for variance by mythos, including the druid as an example), and rogues (including thieves and bards); while most character classes remained about the same as in the 1st edition rules, the bard was regularized, and the assassin and monk were dropped. TSR, Inc. also removed some races from the game, such as half-orcs, although some of these were added back into the game in supplements, such as \"The Complete Book of Humanoids\". Optional rules for skills, known as \"proficiencies\", were added, and sections describing role-playing, combat, magic, time and movement, equipment, and spell descriptions were all expanded. The book included major changes regarding character classes, races, and magic, and incorporated many new rules that had been published in supplements such as \"Unearthed Arcana\" and \"Dragonlance Adventures\".\n\nThe 2nd edition \"Player's Handbook\" was an Origins and Gamer's Choice award winner. Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book \"Heroic Worlds\", called the book \"a vast improvement\" over the 1st edition book; he noted that the monk character class had been \"banished to \"Oriental Adventures\" where it belongs\", but commented that the spell descriptions \"have positively bloated to over 100 pages\".\n\nIn 1995, a new version of the 2nd edition \"Player's Handbook\" was released as part of TSR's 25th anniversary. The book was revised, becoming sixty-four pages larger, mainly due to layout changes and new artwork. A new foreword in this edition specifically stated that the book was not \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" 3rd edition.\n\nThe 2nd edition \"Player's Handbook\" was reproduced as a premium reprint on May 21, 2013.\n\nThe third edition, published August 10, 2000, (with the \"Player's Handbook\" debuting at that year's Gen Con) represented a major overhaul of the game, including the adoption of the d20 system. The third edition also dropped the word \"Advanced\" from the title, as the publisher decided to publish only one version of the game instead of both basic and advanced versions.\n\nMonte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition \"Players Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\", and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Tweet is credited with the book's design. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Lars Grant-West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Arnie Swekel, and Sam Wood. The 3rd edition \"Player's Handbook\" also saw the return of half-orcs and monks to the core rules set, along with some all-new classes.\n\nThe reviewer from \"Pyramid\" commented on the release of third edition, stating: \"There's a lot to like about \"Dungeons and Dragons\" 3rd Edition as seen in the \"Player's Handbook\". The new artwork is gorgeous and evocative, and in the 286 pages of the main rulebook there's a lot of well-written and tightly packed rules.\" Another reviewer wrote a response to the first review. A third reviewer felt that the design team \"smoothed out the rough edges from \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragon\" 2nd Edition and added tons of new goodies to make \"D&D\" 3rd Edition the best combat-oriented RPG you can buy\".\n\nIn July 2003, the rules were revised again to version 3.5 based on two years of player feedback. Revisions to the \"Player's Handbook\" included the classes becoming more balanced against each other. When asked about the changes from the prior \"Player's Handbook\" release, Skip Williams said \"I think they range from the almost invisible (unless it affects your character directly) to the pretty radical,\" while Andy Collins replied \"Well, I don't think I'd call any of the changes \"radical.\" Even though some characters will undergo some significant changes, the aim is for the character to still feel like the same character, only with more interesting and balanced options.\" Andy Collins is credited for the \"Player's Handbook\" 3.5 revision. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Lars Grant-West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Jeremy Jarvis, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Wayne Reynolds, Arnie Swekel, and Sam Wood.\n\nMay 2006 saw the release of the \"Player's Handbook II\", designed to follow up the standard \"Player's Handbook\". This book was designed by David Noonan. It contains four new classes, along with new spells, feats, and new role-playing options. Its cover pays homage to the 1st edition \"Player's Handbook\".\n\nThe 3.5 edition \"Player's Handbook\" was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012.\n\nOn June 6, 2008, the Fourth Edition \"Player's Handbook\", subtitled \"Arcane, Divine and Martial Heroes\", was released. It was originally announced that the 4th edition's three core rulebooks would be released over a three-month period, but the date changed after customer feedback revealed a majority preference among D&D customers to have all three core rulebooks released in the same month. The Fourth Edition \"Player's Handbook\" was designed by Rob Heinsoo, Andy Collins, and James Wyatt. The front cover illustration was by Wayne Reynolds and the back cover illustration was by Dan Scott, with interior illustrations by Zoltan Boros & Gabor Szikszai, Matt Cavotta, Eric Deschamps, Wayne England, David Griffith, Ralph Horsley, Howard Lyon, Raven Mimura, Lee Moyer, William O'Connor, Steve Prescott, Dan Scott, Anne Stokes, Franz Vohwinkel, and Eva Widermann.\n\nThe first \"Player's Handbook\" includes eight classes: cleric, fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, warlock, warlord, and wizard, and eight races: dragonborn, dwarf, eladrin, elf, human, half-elf, halfling, and tiefling. The warlock and warlord classes, and the dragonborn and tiefling races, represented new additions to the core rules, while the book left out previous core elements such as the monk and bard classes and the gnome and half-orc races. Wizards of the Coast emphasized that those elements would be coming in subsequent \"Player's Handbooks\" and would be considered to be as central to the game as those in the first book.\n\nThe 4th edition \"Player's Handbook 2\", subtitled \"Arcane, Divine and Primal Heroes\", was released on March 17, 2009. The \"Player's Handbook 2\" includes eight classes: the avenger, barbarian, bard, druid, invoker, shaman, sorcerer, and warden, and five races: the deva, gnome, goliath, half-orc, and shifter. The book reached No. 28 on \"USA Today\"s bestseller list the week of March 26, 2009 and No. 14 on the \"Wall Street Journal\"s non-fiction bestseller list a week later.\n\nA third book in the series, \"Player's Handbook 3\", subtitled \"Psionic, Divine and Primal Heroes\", was released on March 16, 2010. Retrieved on 2011-02-20. The book was designed by Mike Mearls, Bruce R. Cordell, and Robert J. Schwalb, and featured cover art by Michael Komarck and interior art by Ralph Beisner, Eric Belisle, Kerem Beyit, Wayne England, Jason A. Engle, Carl Frank, Randy Gallegos, Adam Gillespie, Ralph Horsley, Roberto Marchesi, Jake Masbruch, Jim Nelson, William O'Connor, Hector Ortiz, Shane Nitzche, Wayne Reynolds, Chris Seaman, John Stanko, Matias Tapia, Beth Trott, Francis Tsai, Eva Widermann, Sam Wood, Ben Wootten, and Kieran Yanner. It includes six classes: ardent, battlemind, monk, psion, runepriest, and seeker, along with four races: wilden, the minotaur, githzerai, and shardminds. The PHB3 also includes new multi-classing rules for hybrid characters.\n\nThe fifth edition \"Player's Handbook\" was released on August 19, 2014.\n\nThe \"Player's Handbook\" contains the basic rules of the 5e system, the base classes and races, and character customization options.\n\nChuck Francisco of mania.com commented: \"While it was an easily accessible system, 4e left a lukewarm feeling with my gaming group. There was something too generic and uninteresting about player characters which pervaded the system, especially in the wake of 3.5e (which some felt provided too many options so as to be confusing). In the process, 4e characters lost an indescribable crunchy feeling, but I'm pleased to say that it's been brought back for the newest installment of this venerated table top series.\"\n\nAndrew Zimmerman Jones of \"Black Gate\" comments on the 5th edition \"Player's Handbook\": \"Their rules light approach make it a natural system for old fans to bring new players into the hobby, but even with this initial offering there are enough customization options to keep old school gamers happy playing with it.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13388088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13388088", "title": "Record sealing", "text": "Record sealing\n\nRecord sealing is the practice of sealing or, in some cases, destroying court records that would otherwise be publicly accessible as public records. The term is derived from the tradition of placing a seal on specified files or documents that prevents anyone from reviewing the files without receiving a court order. The modern process and requirements to seal a record and the protections it provides vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and even between civil and criminal cases.\n\nGenerally, record sealing can be defined as the process of removing from general review the records pertaining to a court case. However, the records may not completely disappear and may still be reviewed under limited circumstances; in most instances, it requires a court order to unseal records once they are sealed. In the United States, some states order records to be destroyed after they are sealed. Once a record is sealed, in some states, the contents are legally considered never to have occurred and are not acknowledged by the state.\n\nThe public policy of record sealing balances the desire to free named citizens from the burdens caused by the information contained in state records while maintaining the state's interest in the preservation of records that may be beneficial to the state or other citizens.\n\nIn many cases, a person with a sealed record gains the legal right to deny or not acknowledge anything to do with the arrest and the legal proceedings from the case itself.\n\nRecords are commonly sealed in a number of situations:\n\nNormally, records should not be filed under seal without a court permission. However, FRCP 5.2 requires that sensitive text – like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts, and children’s names – should be redacted off the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits. A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court’s permission to file some exhibits completely under seal.\n\nWhen the document is filed \"under seal\", it should have a clear indication for the court clerk to file it separately – most often by stamping words \"Filed Under Seal\" on the bottom of each page. Person making filing should also provide instructions to the court clerk that the document needs to be filed \"under seal\". Courts often have specific requirements to these filings in their Local Rules.\n\nA Delaware background check corporation by the name of IntegraScan has filed for Declaratory Relief in both the states of Texas and New Jersey. The position of IntegraScan is that state mandated record sealing and expungements do not apply to private corporations, only state and Federal run agencies. The contention of the suits are that record sealing and expungement orders applied to corporations and private citizens violate First Amendment rights.\n\nExpungement, which is a physical destruction, namely a complete erasure of one's criminal records, and therefore usually carries a higher standards, differs from record sealing, which is only to restrict the public's access to records, so that only certain law enforcement agencies or courts, under special circumstances, will have access to them. A record seal will greatly improve the chance of employment, as employers will not have access to damning records. There are occasions, like expungement, where one can truthfully state under oath that they have never been convicted before.\n\nMost of the time, a record seal has more relaxed requirements than an expungement. If an expungement is not allowed with a case, then sealing a record may be the best bet. Different states have different terms for what constitutes sealing of a record.\n\n"}
{"id": "3526475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3526475", "title": "Restaurant rating", "text": "Restaurant rating\n\nRestaurant ratings identify restaurants according to their quality, using notations such as stars or other symbols, or numbers. Stars are a familiar and popular symbol, with scales of one to three or five stars commonly used. Ratings appear in guide books as well as in the media, typically in newspapers, lifestyle magazines and webzines. Websites featuring consumer-written reviews and ratings are increasingly popular, but are far less reliable.\n\nIn addition, there are ratings given by public health agencies rating the level of sanitation practiced by an establishment. \n\nOne of the best known guides is the Michelin series which award one to three stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high culinary merit. One star indicates a \"very good restaurant\"; two stars indicate a place \"worth a detour\"; three stars means \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey\".\n\nSeveral bigger newspapers employ restaurant critics and publish online dining guides for the cities they serve, such as the Irish Independent for Irish restaurants. \n\nInternet restaurant review sites have empowered regular people to generate non-expert reviews. This has sparked criticism from restaurant establishments about the non-editorial, non-professional critiques. Those reviews can be falsified or faked.\n\nThe different guides have their own criteria. Not every guide looks behind the scenes or decorum. Others look particularly sharply to value for money. This is why a restaurant can be missing in one guide, while mentioned in another. Because the guides work independently, it is possible to have simultaneous multiple recognitions.\n\nA top restaurant rating can mean success or failure for a restaurant, particularly when bestowed by an influential sources such as Michelin. Still, a good rating is not enough for economic success and many Michelin starred and/or highly rated restaurants have met the same fate as the Dutch restaurant De Swaen.\n\nIn 2004, Michelin came under fire after bipolar chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide after he was rumoured to be in danger of losing one of his three Michelin stars. However, the Michelin guide had stated he would not be downgraded. Most news reports attributed his suicide to the downgrade carried out by the rival Gault Millau guide.\n\nMany countries have a system of checks and inspections in place for sanitation. Only a few countries, amongst others the United States and Canada, create and publish restaurant ratings based on this. However, the whole of the United Kingdom is covered - as is Denmark.\n\nIn the United States, several states have imposed uniform statewide restaurant grading systems, under which safety and hygiene inspection reports are used to compute numerical scores or letter grades, and those must be prominently posted by restaurants. The first state to enact such a statewide system was South Carolina in 1995. Tennessee and North Carolina later enacted legislation imposing similar statewide systems.\n\nIn many other states, the mandatory posting of restaurant grades is neither required nor prohibited statewide, which means it is purely a matter for local governments like cities and counties. \n\nIn November 1997, a KCBS-TV sweeps news story called \"Behind The Kitchen Door\" focused attention on problems in Los Angeles's top restaurants. The station used hidden cameras to catch restaurant employees practicing unsafe food handling practices such as picking up food from the floor and re-serving it, vermin crawling near food to be served, and mixing uncooked meat and vegetables. The KCBS report also reviewed inspection reports, which have always been public records, but were available only on request (and at the time required an in-person visit to the health department), and found that many problems had already been expressly identified in the inspection reports but had not been adequately publicized.\n\nAs a result of this report, in December 1997 the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County introduced a letter grading system already in use for some years in two other nearby counties, San Diego County and Riverside County. Instead of merely listing violations in a report, the restaurant inspection system was changed to a point system, with each restaurant starting each inspection with a perfect score of 100 points. Environmental health specialists were required to use a standard form called the Food Official Inspection Report to identify violations as they inspected establishments; the form required them to subtract a certain number of points for each violation found. Based on the number of points remaining, letter grades were then assigned and required to be prominently posted at all establishments selling food, and all establishments were also required to provide a copy of the underlying inspection report to any customer on request. Grades are available at the County Public Health Department's web site.\n\nTwo Stanford University economics researchers found that higher lettered restaurants scored a rise in revenue, while lower lettered restaurants have seen their revenues decline. The quality of restaurants in the entire county became more acceptable, with the average score going up from about 75% to nearly 90% in the year after restaurant grading was implemented. The researchers concluded that the results were not explained solely by consumers switching to higher quality restaurants, and that some of the effect had to do with restaurants making changes due to grade cards. Another study estimated a 13.1% reduction in hospitalization for food borne illnesses in the year following implementation of the program, suggesting that implementing a restaurant grading program could improve public safety.\n\nAlthough Los Angeles County was not the first local jurisdiction to require restaurants to post grades, its success in implementing such a program inspired many other local governments during the 2000s to enact similar programs based on the Los Angeles model, such as Toronto, Las Vegas, Dallas, and New York City.\n\n"}

Initially called the \"nouveau salon près de la chapelle\" (new salon near the chapel) when the room was started in 1710 by Robert de Cotte for Louis XIV. However, with the death of Louis XIV in 1715 the project was postponed (Verlet, 321).\n\nBeginning in 1724, work on the \"salon d’Hercule\" recommenced. Louis XV commissioned architect Jacques Gabriel, \"marbrier\" Claude-Félix Tarlé, and sculptors Jacques Verberckt and François-Antoine Vassé to complete the room (Verlet, 321).\n\nThe room was completed in 1736 with the ceiling painting \"Apothéose d’Hercule\" (\"Apotheosis of Hercules\") by François Le Moyne, which gave the room its present name (Verlet, 322).\n\nThere are only two other paintings decorating this room, both of which are by Veronese. Above the fireplace is the artist’s \"Rebecca at the Well\"; on the opposite wall forming a pendant is the famed \"Feast in the House of Simon\" (Verlet, 322). Louis XIV received the latter painting as a diplomatic gift from the Republic of Venice in 1664. Owing to the size of the work – 4.5 meters high by 9.7 meters long – the painting was displayed in the \"galerie d’Apollon\" of the Louvre. It was installed in \"salon d’Hercule\" in 1730 where it remained until 1832 at which time it was transferred to the Louvre. In 1961 the \"Feast in the House of Simon\" was returned to the \"salon d’Hercule.\" In 1994, under the aegis of the Société des amis de Versailles and BNP the painting was restored.\n\nDuring the reign of Louis XV the room served as a ball room as the king felt the salon de Mars was too small and the \"galerie des glaces\" was too large. The inaugural ball held in the \"salon d’Hercule\" was on 26 January 1739 to celebrate the marriage of Louis XV’s eldest daughter Marie Louise-Élisabeth with Infante Filipe of Spain (Luynes, 335-345); and the wedding dinner \"au grand courvert\" of the duc de Chartres on 5 January 1769 (Verlet, 323). After the destruction of the \"escalier des ambassadeurs\" in 1752, Louis XV planned for the \"salon d’Hercule\" to be the landing for a new staircase for the château (Verlet, 323).\n\nDuring the reign of Louis XVI the \"salon d’Hercule\" served for diplomatic functions such as the embassy sent by the bey of Tunis (January 1777); the receptions of the representatives of the Three Estates of the Estates-General (May 1789); and, the reception of the embassy of the sultan Mysore (September 1778) (Verlet, 555).\n"}

It covers all of the \"Fallout\" video games, as well as all \"Fallout\" related content. The Vault runs on MediaWiki and is currently part of the Curse network. The site is also available in several other languages, including Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\nThe Vault was founded by Paweł Dembowski and launched on February 7, 2005, initially hosted by \"Fallout\" fansite Duck and Cover, as a general source of information about the \"Fallout\" universe, initially focusing mostly on information about the \"Fallout\" world, as depicted in \"Fallout\" and \"Fallout 2\". Its purpose was to continue the work started by \"Fallout 2\" developer Chris Avellone in his \"Fallout Bible\", which was meant to be a reference guide to the \"Fallout\" fictional universe, but was abandoned after Avellone left Black Isle Studios. Since the launch, the wiki has expanded to include the entire \"Fallout\" series, both in terms of the fictional universe and in terms of gameplay information and help.\n\nIn 2007, because the original host could no longer take the wiki constantly being targeted for various exploits by spammers as well as other attackers, the Vault moved to Wikia, and became one of Wikia's most popular wikis after the release of \"Fallout 3\" by Bethesda Softworks in October 2008. It has broken previous popularity records for gaming wikis on the weekend after the release of \"\" in October 2010, with daily page views topping at 8.8 million (the previous record, 5 million, belonged to WoWWiki). Within the first week of the game's release, the site had 2.5 million unique visitors.\n\nIn October 2011, The Vault was split by its founder and many of the administrators moved to FalloutWiki.com, and later fallout.gamepedia.com, both hosted by Curse. The wikia version remains, now under the name \"Nukapedia\".\n\nIn an interview with Eurogamer, the wiki's founder has stated that it has even been used as a source by developers of recent \"Fallout\" games, citing one example of lore in \"Fallout 3\" being influenced by The Vault.\n\nThe Vault has also released some previously unknown information on canceled \"Fallout\" projects like the \"Fallout Extreme\" 2000 console game and the 1998 cancelled \"Fallout\" film project, as well as using its YouTube channel and other social media to make available audio and video \"Fallout\" Media.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5438682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5438682", "title": "Tobacco fatwa", "text": "Tobacco fatwa\n\nA tobacco fatwa is a fatwa (Islamic legal pronouncement) that prohibits the usage of tobacco by Muslims. All contemporary rulings condemn smoking as potentially harmful or prohibit (haram) smoking outright as a result of the severe health damage that it causes. Arab Muslims tend to prohibit smoking (despite Saudi Arabia ranking 23rd in the world for the percentage of its population that smokes) and, in South Asia, smoking tends to be considered lawful but discouraged:\n\nFor many Muslims, the legal status of smoking has changed during recent years, and numerous fatawas, including from notable authorities such as Al-Azhar University in Cairo, now consider smoking \"haram\" (prohibited). The reasons cited in support of the reclassification of smoking as prohibited include Islamic law's general prohibition of all actions that result in harm. For example, the Quran says, \"And spend of your substance in the cause of God, and make not your own hands contribute to your own destruction.\" Additionally, jurists rely on the exhortations in the Quran not to waste money. Greater appreciation of the risks associated with secondhand smoke has also led recent jurists to cite the obligation to avoid causing willful annoyance, distress, or harm to other people.\n\nFatwas condemning smoking have been issued in Egypt, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, among others. \n\nThe earliest fatwa regarding smoking was issued in Morocco in 1602. Following the introduction of tobacco to the kingdom in 1598, King Ahmad al-Mansur sought guidance from religious scholars in Fez. The kingdom's Grand Mufti and the Wali of Sila both ruled that smoking was forbidden in Islam. This ruling failed to have much effect on tobacco use in the kingdom, leading the Mufti to issue a second ruling forbidding its use, as the use of all \"intoxicants and harmful substances\" is forbidden in Islam. This categorical prohibition was unsuccessful, and the Mufti and the other scholars who joined him in his ruling were either killed by a mob angry at this ruling or fled the country.\n\nIn recent years, tobacco fatwas (Islamic legal pronouncements) have been issued due to health concerns.\n\nThe holy book of Islam, the Qur'ān, does not specifically prohibit or denounce smoking, but gives behavioral guidance:\n\n\nIn practice, at least one recent survey (Abbottabad, Pakistan) found that observant Muslims tend to avoid smoking. A study of young Muslim Arab-Americans found that Islamic influences were correlated with some diminished smoking. Conversely, an Egyptian study found that knowledge of an anti-smoking fatwa did not reduce smoking. Overall, the prevalence of smoking is increasing in Islamic countries.\n\nThe prominent scholar Yusuf al Qaradawi argues that smoking is no longer an issue of dispute among Islamic scholars due to the knowledge of health risks.\n\nThe reported juristic disagreement among Muslim scholars on the ruling concerning smoking, since its appearance and spread, is not usually based on differences between legal proofs, but on the difference in the verification of the cause on which the ruling is based. They all agree that whatever is proved to be harmful to the body and mind is prohibited, yet they differ whether this ruling applies to smoking. Some of them claimed that smoking has some benefits, others assured that it had few disadvantages compared to its benefits, whereas a third group maintained that it had neither benefits nor bad effects. This means that if scholars had been certain about the harmfulness of smoking, then they would undoubtedly have considered it prohibited.[…]\n\nSecond: Our inclination to consider smoking prohibited does not mean that it is as grave as major sins like adultery, drinking alcohol or theft. In fact, prohibited matters in Islam are relative; some of them are minor prohibitions whereas others are major, and each has its own ruling. The major sins, for example, have no expiation other than sincere repentance. However, the minor sins can be expiated by the Five Prayers, the Friday Prayer, the Fasting of Ramadan, the Night Vigil Prayer in Ramadan, and other acts of worship. They can also be expiated by avoiding the major sins.\n\nFatwas ruling that smoking is impermissible have been issued by sheikhs of all four Sunni schools of fiqh—Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali—as well as by those of the Ibadi sect.\n\nIn 2000, the Grand Mufti of Egypt, Dr. Nasr Farid Wasil, ruled that smoking was \"haram\" (forbidden) in Islam because of its detrimental health effects. The fatwa, which ruled that smoking is a major sin on par with alcohol use and acceptable grounds for divorce, triggered substantial controversy in Egypt. Grand Imam Gadul Haq Ali Gadul Haq, the Sheikh of al-Azhar mosque, the center of Islamic learning in the Sunni world, issued a similar ruling in 2000, citing the following verse from the Quran as justification: \"and cast not yourselves to ruin with your own hands\". \n\nIn 2009, Majelis Ulama Indonesia, the organization of Indonesian religious scholars, declared smoking in public or near pregnant women \"haram\" (forbidden), while declaring smoking in general to be \"makruh\" (discouraged or reprehensible). Indonesian Muslim organization Muhammadiyah declared smoking \"haram\" in 2010; the organization had previously listed smoking as merely \"Makruh\" (to be avoided). Tobacco companies sponsored 1,350 youth-oriented events from January to October in 2007, and often gave free cigarettes to youths. A 2015 study found that the fatwa had had a small effect on smoking and was primarily effective at keeping non-smokers from smoking.\n\nIran’s Grand Ayatollah Mirza Shirazi in 1891 issued a fatwa against tobacco.\n\nMalaysia's National Fatwa Council first issued a fatwa against smoking in 1996, when it declared smoking haram because of its detrimental health effects. In 2013, a study of Muslims and Buddhists in Malaysia found that this fatwa and other religious norms against smoking have had an independent and significant increase in quit attempts. Among Muslims, religious pressure against smoking was more effective at inspiring people to quit than social pressure. In 2015, the National Fatwa Council followed-up by issuing a fatwa declaring electronic cigarettes haram because of their harmful health effects and bad smell. \n\nIn 1996, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Hamad Al Khalili, the Grand Mufti of Oman, issued a fatwa prohibiting smoking and the sale of tobacco, comparing smoking to \"sipping poison\" Sheikh Al Khalili cited a verse from the Quran, \"do not kill yourselves for God Almighty is most merciful to you,\" to justify his ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Council of Darul Ifta of the Philippines, headed by Grand Mufti Sheikh Omar Pasigan, stated in June 2010 that smoking cigarettes is \"haram\".\n\nThe Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Aal Al-Sheikh, has ruled that \"smoking is impermissible on the basis of authentic quotations, sound judgments, and the opinions of reputable physicians.\" The Mufti cites a sahih hadith (verifiable saying of the Prophet) saying \"do not harm yourself or others.\" He further referenced a Quranic verse saying that the Prophet \"forbids that which is unwholesome.\" \n\nIn addition to issuing a fatwa against smoking, the United Arab Emirates instructed imams in all mosques to read a sermon against smoking on June 11, 1999 following Friday prayers.\n\nFrom the 1970s to the late 1990s, tobacco companies including British American Tobacco and Phillip Morris were involved in campaigns to undermine fatwas against smoking in Muslim majority countries by branding Muslims who opposed smoking as a fundamentalist'? who wishes to return to sharia law\", and be \"a threat to existing government\". The tobacco industry was also concerned that the World Health Organization's encouraging of anti-smoking stance of Muslim scholars. A 1985 report from tobacco firm Philip Morris squarely blamed the WHO: \"This ideological development has become a threat to our business because of the interference of the WHO ... The WHO has not only joined forces with Muslim fundamentalists who view smoking as evil, but has gone yet further by encouraging religious leaders previously not active anti-smokers to take up the cause.\"\n\n\n\n"}

American General Corp., 651 A.2d 1361 (Del. 1995) is the leading case on a board of directors' ability to use defensive measures, such as poison pills or buybacks, to prevent a hostile takeover. The case demonstrates an approach to corporate governance that favors the primacy of the board of directors over the will of the shareholders.\n\nAmerican General Corp. tendered an offer for a controlling block of shares of Unitrin. The Board of Directors of Unitrin, who held 23% of the shares, did not think the price offered was adequate and so initiated a poison pill and offered a buyback to increase their holdings to 28% of the total shares.\n\nThe trial court found that the offer represented a threat of \"substantive coercion\", and based on the \"Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum\" test, the poison pill was reasonable but the repurchase was not. The issue before the Supreme Court of Delaware was whether the repurchasing was a reasonable reaction to American General's threat.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court found that the lower court erred in applying the Unocal standard. The court must first determine whether the defensive measure is draconian in that it has the effect of precluding or coercing shareholders choice. Only after that determination should the inquiry shift to whether the measure is within the range of reasonableness in response to the perceived threat.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "994892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=994892", "title": "Voter registration", "text": "Voter registration\n\nVoter registration (or enrollment) is the requirement that a person otherwise eligible to vote register (or enroll) on an electoral roll before they will be entitled or permitted to vote. Such enrollment may be automatic or may require application being made by the eligible voter. The rules governing registration vary between jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions have \"election day registration\" and others do not require registration, or may require production of evidence of entitlement to vote at time of voting. In some jurisdictions registration by those of voting age is compulsory, while in most it is optional. In jurisdictions where registration is voluntary, an effort may be made to encourage persons otherwise eligible to vote to register, in what is called as a voter registration drive.\n\nRegistered persons may need to re-register or update their registration if they change residence or other relevant information. In some jurisdictions, when a person registers a change of residence with a government agency, say, for a driver's license, the government agency may forward the information to the electoral agency to automatically update the voter registration information.\n\nEven in countries where registration is the individual's responsibility, many reformers, seeking to maximize voter turnout, argue for a wider availability of the required forms, or more ease of process by having more places where they can register. The United States, for example, the \"National Voter Registration Act of 1993\" (\"Motor Voter Law\") and similar laws require states to offer voter registration at motor vehicle departments (driver's license offices) as well as disability centers, public schools, and public libraries, in order to offer more access to the system. State authorities are also required to accept mail-in voter registrations. Many jurisdictions also offer online registrations.\n\nIn the United States, states generally require voter registration. Some U.S. states do not require advance registration, instead allowing voters to register when they arrive at the polls, in what is called \"same day registration\" or \"election day registration\". North Dakota is the only state which has no registration requirement.\n\nSame-day registration (SDR) has been linked to higher voter turn-out, with SDR states reporting average turn-out of 71% in the 2012 United States Presidential election, well above the average voter turn-out rate of 59% for non-SDR states.\n\nRegistration laws making it harder for voters to register correlate strongly with lower percentages of people turning out to vote where voting is voluntary.\n\nHistorically in the United States, the southern states of the former Confederacy passed new constitutions and laws at the turn of the century that created barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, and complicated record keeping requirements. In practice, in their system of Jim Crow, these elements were used to disenfranchise most African Americans and many poor whites from voting, excluding thousands of people in each state from the political system. The minority of white Democrats in these states controlled the political process and elections, gaining outsize power locally and in Congress as the Solid South. The states maintained such exclusion of most African Americans for more than 60 years. Other minority groups have also been discriminated against by other states at various times in voter registration practices, such as Native Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and other language minorities.\n\nBecause of this history, voter registration laws and practices in the United States have been closely scrutinized by interest groups and the federal government, especially following passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It authorized federal oversight of jurisdictions with a history of under-representation of certain portions of their populations in voting. Such laws are often controversial. Some advocate for their abolition, while others argue that the laws should be reformed, for instance: to allow voters to register on the day of the election. Several US states - Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming - have adopted this approach, called Election Day Registration. For the 2012 election year, California joined this list.\n\nSystems of voter registration vary widely from country to country, and sometimes among lower jurisdictions, such as states or provinces. In some nations, voters are automatically added to the rolls when they reach legal voting age. In others, potential voters are required to apply to be added to the rolls.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission maintains Australia's federal electoral roll. Each state also has its own electoral commission or office, but voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission. Voter registration is mandatory for all citizens 18 years of age or above. The AEC monitors house and apartment sales and sends a reminder (and the forms) to new residents if they have moved to another electorate, making compliance with the law easier.\n\nIn Canada, the task of enumeration was handled until 1992 by the relevant elections bureau, such as Elections Canada for the federal level. The task was delegated to temporary employees from the public, who were charged with going to each residence in assigned areas to determine the eligible voters to be recorded for a publicly displayed list for each election. The Parliament discontinued this system for fiscal reasons in the 1990s in favour of an opt-in process, by which voters mark their consent to be added the national voters list, or register, on their annual income tax returns. Although this allows the list to be updated annually, complaints are registered that there are excessive numbers of omissions of residents, which needlessly complicates voting for the public and is contributing to a serious decline in the percentage of the population who vote.\n\nThe Register is also updated using the following sources:\n\n\nSame-day registration is also permitted.\n\nSince 2012, voter registration in Chile is automatic. It is based on a database by the Civil Registry Office of Chileans and resident foreigners in possession of an identity card number, which is unique for each individual when issues and is never re-used after a person's death. All Chileans and eligible foreigners are added automatically to the electoral roll at age 17 and placed on an electoral constituency based on their last reported address with the Office. That address, known as \"electoral domicile,\" can be different from a person's living address, if so desired. The electoral roll may contain a substantial number of persons residing abroad. Residents abroad are not allowed to vote in Chilean elections.\n\nAll citizens and residents are included in the national register. Each person is assigned a personal identification number that includes the person's date of birth and is divisible by 11.\n\nAll citizens and residents of Denmark are included in the national register, \"Det Centrale Personregister.\" Each person is assigned a personal number of ten digits, which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system, official record of residence, and other purposes. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place; it may only be presented at the designated local polling station. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while long-time residents may vote in local and regional elections. Permanent address within Denmark is required in order to vote. Voting is voluntary.\n\nVoter registration in Finland is automatic and based on the national population register. Each citizen is assigned a identification number at birth. Permanent residents are recorded in this register even if they are not citizens, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. People in the register are legally obliged to notify the register keeper of changes of address. Changing the address in the register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the process of moving residence very simple. Close to election time, the government mails a notification to registered persons informing them of the election and where and when to cast their votes. Only citizens may vote in national elections, but all residents may vote in local elections. \n\nAll permanent residents of Germany are required to register their place of residence (or the fact that they are homeless) with local government. Citizens who will be 18 or older on the day of voting will automatically receive a notification card in the mail some weeks before any election in which they are eligible to vote: for local elections, resident citizens of other EU countries will also receive these cards and may vote. For European elections, citizens of other EU countries have to register separately. Polling places have lists of all eligible voters resident in the neighborhood served by the particular station; the voter's notification card (or photo ID such as an identity card, passport or driving license, if the notification card is not at hand) is checked against these lists before individuals receive a ballot. Voting is not compulsory.\n\nIn Hong Kong all permanent residents who are above 18 years of age and do not suffer from a mental illness can register as voters. Imprisoned people can also register and vote since the laws prohibiting them from voting was ruled unconstitutional in 2009 and are able to vote since mid-2010 as the electoral roll is updated annually. The registration process is voluntary. In 2002 around 1.6 million permanent residents did not register.\n\nAll citizens of Iceland are registered in a central database at birth, which is maintained by Registers Iceland. They do not need to register separately to vote.\n\nThe Government of India conducts a revision of the voters list every 5 years. An additional summary revision is conducted every year. Apart from this, citizens can request their inclusion in the voters list by applying through Form 6. If the application is valid, the applicant's name will get included in the list. At 18 years old, completed person should be eligible for voter list (for Indian citizens only).\n\nIn Israel, all citizens who are 18 years of age or older on election day are automatically registered to vote.\n\nIn Italy, all municipalities have a registry of residents and a registry of eligible voters.This is revised every six months and whenever there is an election. The registry of eligible voters can be viewed by anyone to ensure maximum transparency in the electoral process. All citizens aged 18 or more on the election day are automatically registered to vote.\n\nMexico has a general electoral census. Any citizen of age 18 or greater must go to an electoral office in order be registered into the electoral census. Citizens receive a voting card (\"credencial de elector con fotografía\"), issued by the National Electoral Institute (INE) (from 1990 until 4/2014 it was called Federal Electoral Institute) that must be shown to vote in any election. The voting card also serves as a national identity document.\n\nAll citizens and residents of Norway are included in the national register, \"Folkeregisteret\", where each person is assigned a personal number of eleven digits which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system and other purposes, and it is maintained by the tax authorities. All eligible voters receive a card in the mail before each election which shows the date, time and local polling place. Only citizens may vote in national elections, while longtime residents may vote in local and regional elections. Voting is not compulsory.\n\nAll citizens of Peru between 18 and 70 years are registered to vote through the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status, except all members of the police and the armed forces, who are not allowed to participate in elections. For all citizens in the country and abroad voting is mandatory, unless legally exempted. Failing to vote in the election of 7 Oct 2018 was fined with S/ 83, with 50% or 75% discount for areas with poverty or extreme poverty, and this must be paid to get access to many public services.\n\nThere is no formal process for voter registration for South Korean citizens. All citizens will be automatically listed in the voters' list upon each election date. A domestic in-absentee vote was ceased and citizens can visit any residents' center (주민센터) and vote in advance during the weekend before the actual election date.\n\nHowever, citizens either temporary visiting or permanently residing abroad must register for an overseas in-absentee ballot in order to vote. Voting can be done in Korean overseas missions.\n\nVoter registration in Sweden is automatic and based on the national population register, Folkbokföringsregistret, administered by the Swedish Tax Agency, where all citizens and residents of Sweden are included. Each person is assigned a ten digit national identification number, which include the person's date of birth. The register is used for tax lists, voter lists, membership in the universal health care system, public insurance, official record of residence, and other purposes. Permanent residents shall be recorded in this register even if they are not citizens but enjoy right of residence, and their citizenship status is indicated in the register. Changing the address in the central register automatically notifies all other public bodies (for example the tax district for local taxation, the social security authorities, the conscription authorities) and certain trusted private ones (e.g. banks and insurance companies), making the administration of a move of residence very simple. \n\nAll eligible voters receive a letter in the mail to their registered address of 30 days prior to election day, in Sweden or abroad, which shows the date, time and local polling place, always on a Sunday, normally in September each 4 years. Polling may also be done anywhere in the country at various early voting stations determined by the local Election Committee or at a Swedish Diplomatic mission, all to facilitate for the voters. To vote in person a recognized photo identity document is required, or a confirmation by someone with proper identification. The voting card letter is not compulsory to bring as it is possible to print a copy of it, but it reduces waiting time. For people with difficulties to move, like elderly, hospitalized or imprisoned, there are ambulant voting stations and the possibility to vote as an absentee through a proxy, that can be a family member, caretaker, prison guard or other person in a normal relationship with the voter. Those living on the country-side can vote with their postman and those staying abroad are allowed to vote through mail with the material provided by a diplomatic mission. Elections through Internet are not yet implemented, although most other registry related services are available, like leaving a tax return. The Local Election Committee, that manages the electoral roll and oversees safe vote counting and reporting, is appointed by each County Administrative Board and all work is transparent, as Swedish authorities by default must follow the principle of transparency, but the actual vote of each individual is kept secret. All absentee and early voting ballots are sent physically to the registered local polling station for counting and double checking the voter's identity with the electoral roll eliminating any risk of double voting.\n\nOnly Swedish citizens being 18 years old on the election day and living in Sweden may vote in all public elections. Registered residents may vote in local and regional elections. Swedish citizens that are resident abroad have the right to vote in Riksdag and EU elections only. To maintain a record in the electoral roll as an expatriate, one needs to refresh the registration within 10 years; a vote counts as a valid refresh. In the elections for political members of the Church Board (Parochial church council), similar elections are held, but only members of the Church of Sweden above 16 years of age have suffrage. Universal egalitarian voting rights are protected by the constitution; all voting is voluntary and free of charge, but often seen as a duty, with voter turnout between 80 and 90% in the last decades. It is possible to change an early vote, on the election day, thus scrapping a previously sent vote. By Swedish law, the elections are direct and proportional, which means that the actual votes are reflected in each party's share of the 349 of representatives in the Riksdag, but each individual enter according to amount of personal votes. Any mismatch between districts that could skew the proportion is managed through the Leveling seats, rendering no votes powerless if placed on a party that can enter the parliament. The eligibility to the governing bodies follow the same limitations as for the voting. Through the use of blank (1,09% in 2010 Parliament elections) and unlocked ballots to allow total democracy and voting for unregistered parties, people that were not even running for office have been elected to municipal boards when their name has been handwritten on ballots raising controversy, thus the rules are being changed to disqualify ballots for a person that does not approve or is disapproved by the party.\n\nAll citizens and residents of Switzerland are required to register with the municipal authorities at their place of residence. Voter registration is automatic for citizens; the government sends out ballots by mail a few weeks before an election or referendum.\n\nIn the UK voter registration is compulsory, but the requirement to register is rarely enforced.\nThe current system of registration in the United Kingdom (UK), introduced by the Labour government, is known as rolling registration. Electors can register with a local authority at any time of the year. This replaced the twice-yearly census of electors, which often disenfranchised those who had moved during the interval between censuses.\n\nAcross the country, the registration of electors is still technically the responsibility of the head of household, a concept which some consider to be anachronistic in modern society. This current system is controversial, as it is possible for one person to delete persons who live with them from the electoral roll. As of January 2012, mandatory individual registration, pursuant to the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009, was anticipated.\n\nA feasibility study for electronic individual voter registration (IVR), based on the experience of other nations, was undertaken by EURIM (Information Society Alliance) in 2010. The final report was released in 2011. According to the House of Commons Hansard from 16 January 2012, the IVR initiative is yet to be implemented in the UK. There was discussion of data from Northern Ireland, where individual voter registration levels significantly decreased following the introduction of an IVR policy.\n\nIn an experiment in Northern Ireland using personal identifiers, such as National Insurance numbers and signatures, the number of registered electors fell by some ten thousand. It was also understood that the new process may have resulted in fictitious voters being dropped from rolls.\n\nRegistration is mandatory pursuant to section 23 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 (No. 341) and violators are liable on summary conviction and face a maximum fine of £1,000. Voters must be on the electoral roll in order to vote in national, local or European elections. A fixed address is required in order for an individual to vote in an election. To provide for persons who are transient, if an individual lacking a fixed address wants to vote, they may register by filling in a 'Declaration of local connection' form. This establishes a connection to the area based on the last fixed address someone had, or the place where they spend a substantial amount of their time (e.g. a homeless shelter).\n\nA voting card is sent to each registrant shortly before any elections. The individual does not need to take the card to the polling station, instead it serves to remind individuals of the details they had provided to the electoral register.\n\nVoter registration in the United States takes place at the county level, and is a prerequisite to voting at federal, state and local elections. The only exception is North Dakota, although North Dakota law allows cities to register voters for city elections.\n\nA 2012 study by The Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that 24% of the voting-eligible population in the United States are not registered to vote, a percentage that represents \"at least 51 million eligible U.S. citizens.\" Numerous states had a history of creating barriers to voter registration through a variety of fees, literacy or comprehension tests, and record-keeping requirements that in practice discriminated against racial or ethnic minorities, language minorities, and other groups. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 forbade such abuses and authorized federal oversight in jurisdictions of historic under-representation of certain groups. States continue to develop new practices that may discriminate against certain populations. By August 2016, federal rulings in five cases have overturned all or parts of voter registration or voter ID laws in Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and North Dakota that were found to place undue burden on minorities and other groups among voters. The states are required to offer alternatives for the November 2016 elections; many of these cases are expected to reach the US Supreme Court for additional hearings.\n\nWhile voters traditionally had to register at government offices by a certain period before an election, in the mid-1990s, the federal government made efforts to simplify registration procedures to improve access and increase turnout. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the \"Motor Voter\" law) required state governments to \"either\" provide uniform opt-in registration services through drivers' license registration centers, disability centers, schools, libraries, and mail-in registration, \"or\" to allow voter registration on Election Day, where voters can register at polling places immediately prior to voting. From January 1, 2016, Oregon was the first state to adopt a fully automatic (opt-out) voter registration system as part of the process of issuing driver licenses and ID cards. By April 2016 three more states - California, West Virginia, and Vermont - followed suit, and in May 2016 Connecticut implemented it administratively rather than by legislation, bringing the number of states with automatic voter registration to five. Alaskan voters approved Measure 1 during the November 8, 2016 general election, allowing residents the ability to register to vote when applying annually for the state's Permanent Dividend Fund. Voter approval of Measure 1 made Alaska the first state to implement automatic (opt-in) voter registration via ballot initiative and the sixth state to implement automatic registration by any means including passing legislation. Several more states have drafted legislation proposing automatic registration.\n\nPolitical parties and other organizations sometimes hold voter registration drives, organized efforts to register groups of new voters.\n\n\n\n"}
