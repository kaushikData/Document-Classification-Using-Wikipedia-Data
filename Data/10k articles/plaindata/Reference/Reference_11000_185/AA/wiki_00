{"id": "18935732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18935732", "title": "Associated Press", "text": "Associated Press\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) is a U.S.-based not-for-profit news agency headquartered in New York City. Founded in 1846, it operates as a cooperative, unincorporated association. The AP is owned by its contributing newspapers and radio and television stations in the United States, all of which contribute stories to the AP and use material written by its staff journalists. Its Statement of News Values and Principles spells out its standards and practices.\n\nThe AP has earned 52 Pulitzer Prizes, including 31 for photography, since the award was established in 1917.\n\nThe AP has counted the vote in U.S. elections since 1848, including national, state and local races down to the legislative level in all 50 states, along with key ballot measures. AP collects and verifies returns in every county, parish, city and town across the U.S., and declares winners in over 5,000 contests.\n\nThe AP news report, distributed to its members and customers, is produced in English, Spanish and Arabic. AP content is also available on the agency's app, AP News. A 2017 study by NewsWhip revealed that AP content was more engaged with on Facebook than content from any individual English-language publisher.\n\n, news collected by the AP was published and republished by more than 1,300 newspapers and broadcasters. The AP operates 263 news bureaus in 106 countries. It also operates the AP Radio Network, which provides newscasts twice hourly for broadcast and satellite radio and television stations. Many newspapers and broadcasters outside the United States are AP subscribers, paying a fee to use AP material without being contributing members of the cooperative. As part of their cooperative agreement with the AP, most member news organizations grant automatic permission for the AP to distribute their local news reports. The AP employs the \"inverted pyramid\" formula for writing which enables the news outlets to edit a story to fit its available publication area without losing the story's essentials.\n\nCutbacks at rival United Press International in 1993 left the AP as the United States' primary news service, although UPI still produces and distributes stories and photos daily. Other English-language news services, such as the BBC, Reuters and the English-language service of Agence France-Presse, are based outside the United States.\n\nThe Associated Press was formed in May 1846 by five daily newspapers in New York City to share the cost of transmitting news of the Mexican–American War. The venture was organized by Moses Yale Beach (1800–68), second publisher of \"The Sun\", joined by the \"New York Herald\", the \"New York Courier and Enquirer\", \"The Journal of Commerce\", and the \"New York Evening Express\". Some historians believe that the \"Tribune\" joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849. \"The New York Times\" became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and price setting practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by Victor Lawson, editor and publisher of the \"Chicago Daily News\", revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led to the demise of the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 Illinois Supreme Court decision (\"Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press\")—that the AP was a public utility and operating in restraint of trade—resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.\n\nWhen the AP was founded, news became a salable commodity. The invention of the rotary press allowed the \"New York Tribune\" in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the Civil War and Spanish–American War, there was a new incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. Melville Stone, who had founded the \"Chicago Daily News\" in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925–48), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after World War II), the Middle East. He introduced the \"telegraph typewriter\" or teletypewriter into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.\n\nIn 1945, the Supreme Court of the United States held in \"Associated Press v. United States\" that the AP had been violating the Sherman Antitrust Act by prohibiting member newspapers from selling or providing news to nonmember organizations as well as making it very difficult for nonmember newspapers to join the AP. The decision facilitated the growth of its main rival United Press International, headed by Hugh Baillie from 1935 to 1955.\n\nAP entered the broadcast field in 1941 when it began distributing news to radio stations; it created its own radio network in 1974. In 1994, it established APTV, a global video newsgathering agency. APTV merged with WorldWide Television News in 1998 to form APTN, which provides video to international broadcasters and websites. In 2004, AP moved its world headquarters from its longtime home at 50 Rockefeller Plaza to a huge building at 450 West 33rd Street in Manhattan—which also houses the \"New York Daily News\" and the studios of New York's public television station, WNET. In 2009, AP had more than 240 bureaus globally. Its mission—\"to gather with economy and efficiency an accurate and impartial report of the news\"—has not changed since its founding, but digital technology has made the distribution of the AP news report an interactive endeavor between AP and its 1,400 U.S. newspaper members as well as broadcasters, international subscribers, and online customers.\n\nThe AP began diversifying its news gathering capabilities and by 2007 AP was generating only about 30% of its revenue from United States newspapers. 37% came from the global broadcast customers, 15% from online ventures and 18% came from international newspapers and from photography.\n\nThe AP's multi-topic structure has resulted in web portals such as Yahoo! and MSN posting its articles, often relying on the AP as their first source for news coverage of breaking news items. This and the constant updating evolving stories require has had a major impact on the AP's public image and role, giving new credence to the AP's ongoing mission of having staff for covering every area of news fully and promptly. The AP was also the news service used on the Wii's News Channel. In 2007, Google announced that it was paying to receive Associated Press content, to be displayed in Google News, though this was interrupted from late 2009 to mid-2010, due to a licensing dispute.\n\n\nThe AP conducts polls for numerous college sports in the United States. The AP college football rankings were created in 1936, and began including the top 25 teams in 1989. Since 1969, the final poll of each season has been released after all bowl games have been played. The AP released its all-time Top 25 in 2016. , 22 different programs had finished in the number one spot of the poll since its inception.\n\nThe AP college basketball poll has been used as a guide for which teams deserve national attention. The poll first began its poll of college basketball teams in 1949, and has since conducted over 1,100 polls. The college basketball poll started with 20 teams and was reduced to 10 during the 1960-61 college basketball season. It returned to 20 teams in 1968-69 and expanded to 25 beginning in 1989-90. The final poll for each season is released prior to the conclusion of the NCAA tournament, so all data includes regular season games only. In 2017, The AP released a list of the Top 100 teams of all time. The poll counted poll appearances (one point) and No. 1 rankings (two points) to rank each team.\n\nThe AP began its Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award in 1959, for a manager in each league. From 1984 to 2000, the award was given to one manager in all of MLB. The winners were chosen by a national panel of AP baseball writers and radio men. The award was discontinued in 2001.\n\nEvery year, the AP releases the names of the winners of its AP College Basketball Player of the Year and AP College Basketball Coach of the Year awards. It also honors a group of All-American players.\n\n\nIn 1994, London-based Associated Press Television (APTV) was founded to provide agency news material to television broadcasters. In 1998, AP purchased Worldwide Television News (WTN) from the ABC News division of The Walt Disney Company, Nine Network Australia and ITN London. AP publishes 70,000 videos and 6,000 hours of live video per year, . The agency also provides four simultaneous live video channels. AP was the first news agency to launch a live video news service in 2003.\n\nWashington, D.C. bureau reporter Christopher Newton, an AP reporter since 1994, was fired by AP in September 2002 after he was accused of fabricating sources since 2000, including at least 40 people and organizations. Prior to his firing, Newton had been focused on writing about federal law-enforcement while based at the Justice Department. Some of the nonexistent agencies quoted in his stories included \"Education Alliance\", the \"Institute for Crime and Punishment in Chicago\", \"Voice for the Disabled\", and \"People for Civil Rights\".\n\nIn June 2008, the AP sent numerous DMCA take down demands and threatened legal action against several blogs. The AP contended that the internet blogs were violating AP's copyright by linking to AP material and using headlines and short summaries in those links. Many bloggers and experts noted that the use of the AP news fell squarely under commonly accepted internet practices and within fair-use standards. Others noted and demonstrated that AP routinely takes similar excerpts from other sources, often without attribution or licenses. AP responded that it was defining standards regarding citations of AP news.\n\nIn August 2005, Ken Knight, a Louisiana photographer, sued the AP claiming that it had willfully and negligently violated Knight's copyright by distributing a photograph of celebrity Britney Spears to various media outlets including, but not limited to: truTV (formerly CourtTV), America Online and Fox News. The case was settled in November 2006.\n\nIn a case filed February 2005, \"McClatchey v. The Associated Press\", a Pennsylvania photographer sued the AP for cropping a picture to remove the plaintiff's embedded title and copyright notice and later distributed it to news organizations without the plaintiff's permission or credit. The parties settled.\n\nIn March 2009, the Associated Press counter-sued artist Shepard Fairey over his famous image of Barack Obama, saying the uncredited, uncompensated use of an AP photo violated copyright laws and signaled a threat to journalism. Fairey had sued the AP the previous month over his artwork, titled \"Obama Hope\" and \"Obama Progress\", arguing that he did not violate copyright law because he dramatically changed the image. The artwork, based on an April 2006 picture taken for the AP by Mannie Garcia, was a popular image during the 2008 presidential election and now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. According to the AP lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, Fairey knowingly \"misappropriated The AP's rights in that image\". The suit asked the court to award AP profits made off the image and damages. Fairey said he looked forward to \"upholding the free expression rights at stake here\" and disproving the AP's accusations. In January 2011 this suit was settled with neither side declaring their position to be wrong but agreeing to share reproduction rights and profits from Fairey's work.\n\nIn January 2008, Associated Press sued competitor All Headline News (AHN) claiming that AHN allegedly infringed on its copyrights and a contentious \"quasi-property\" right to facts. The AP complaint asserted that AHN reporters had copied facts from AP news reports without permission and without paying a syndication fee. After AHN moved to dismiss all but the copyright claims set forth by AP, a majority of the lawsuit was dismissed. The case has been dismissed and both parties settled.\n\nIn June 2010, Associated Press was accused of having unfair and hypocritical policies after it was demonstrated that AP reporters had copied original reporting from the \"Search Engine Land\" website without permission, attribution, or credit.\n\nIn April 2013, AP stated that it had dropped the term \"illegal immigrant\" from its stylebook. AP follows ABC, NBC, and CNN in not using the term. Jose Antonio Vargas commended The Associated Press for its decision.\n\nSyndicated writer Ruben Navarrette criticized the decision, stating the reasoning behind the decision was political correctness and called the blog \"incomprehensible\". Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said of the decision, that she doesn't get involved in \"vocabulary wars\" and then stated \"They are immigrants who are here illegally, that's an illegal immigrant\".\n\nOn April 23, 2013, the AP's Twitter account was hacked to release a hoax tweet about fictional attacks in the White House that left President Obama injured. This erroneous tweet resulted in a brief plunge of 130 points from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, removal of $136 billion from S&P 500 index, and the temporary suspension of their Twitter account. Although all executed trades were considered final, the Dow Jones later restored its session gains.\n\nOn May 13, 2013, The Associated Press announced telephone records for 20 of their reporters during a two-month period in 2012, had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Justice Department and described these acts as a \"massive and unprecedented intrusion\" into news-gathering operations. The AP reported that the Justice Department would not say why it sought the records, but sources stated that the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia's office was conducting a criminal investigation into a May 7, 2012 AP story about a CIA operation that prevented a terrorist plot to detonate an explosive device on a commercial flight. The DOJ did not direct subpoenas to the AP, instead going to their phone providers, including Verizon Wireless. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder testified under oath in front of the House Judiciary Committee that he recused himself from the leak investigations to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Holder said his Deputy Attorney General, James M. Cole, was in charge of the AP investigation and would have ordered the subpoenas.\n\nIn his book \"Broken Spring: An American-Israeli Reporter's Close-up View of How Egyptians Lost Their Struggle for Freedom\", former AP correspondent Mark Lavie claims that the AP upheld a narrative line in which Arabs and Palestinians were entirely without blame in a conflict where all guilt lay with Israel. Israeli journalist Matti Friedman accused AP of killing a story he wrote about the \"war of words\", \"between Israel and its critics in human rights organizations\", in the aftermath of the Israel/Gaza conflict of 2008–09.\n\nThe Associated Press is governed by an elected board of directors. Since April 2017, the chairman is Steven Swartz, president and CEO of Hearst Communications.\n\n\n"}

Attorneys may form professional firms and practice in partnerships, ranging in size to the \"Big Five\" law firms. The profession is regulated by the \"Attorneys Act, 1979 (Act No. 53 of 1979)\". See: Advocates in South Africa. There are currently around 21400 attorneys and 5000 candidate attorneys in South Africa, each of which are represented by the LSSA (Law Society of South Africa)\n\nFor admission as an attorney, the academic qualification required is an LLB from a South African university; see Bachelor of Laws: South Africa; Legal education in South Africa. (Historically, the B.Proc. degree was also offered.) One then serves \"articles\" as a candidate attorney with a practicing attorney for a period specified according to the qualification of the candidate (generally two years if an appropriate legal degree has been obtained); the length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing community service. The candidate must also write a \"board exam\" set by the relevant provincial Law Society. The examination comprises the following:\n\nAttorneys may additionally qualify as Notaries and Conveyancers, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys - see Patent attorney: South Africa.\n\nAlthough not formally required for practice, further training, e.g. in tax, is usually via specialised postgraduate diplomas or LL.M. programmes. See Master of Laws: South Africa.\n\nThe LSSA (Law Society of South Africa) consists of the regulatory and disciplinary bodies for practicing attorneys in South Africa. Attorneys are required to register at the relative provincial law society where they practice in terms of the Attorneys Act, 1979.\n\nAttorneys are engaged directly by clients, acting as the “manager” of litigious cases. Although both attorneys and advocates may appear in the High Court of South Africa, they will 'brief' an advocate when specialist litigation, is required.\n\nThe split between \"attorney\" and \"advocate\" in South Africa mirrors the split between solicitor and barrister in other Commonwealth countries, with attorneys having broadly equivalent roles to solicitors and advocates having broadly equivalent roles to barristers.\n"}

She is the only square rigged ship left in the San Francisco Bay area and is representative of several different commercial ventures, including lumber, salmon, and grain. She is a U.S. National Historic Landmark and is currently preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park in San Francisco, California. She was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 7 November 1976.\n\n\"Balclutha\" was built in 1886 by Charles Connell and Company of Scotstoun in Glasgow, Scotland, for Robert McMillan, of Dumbarton, Scotland. Her namesake is said to be the eponymous town of Balclutha, New Zealand, but her name also refers to her first homeport, Glasgow, Scotland, which is a \"City on the Clyde\" - the meaning of her name derived from the Gaelic \"Baile Chluaidh\". Designed as a general trader, \"Balclutha\" rounded Cape Horn 17 times in thirteen years.\n\nDuring this period she carried cargoes such as wine, case oil, and coal from Europe and the East Coast of the United States to various ports in the Pacific. These included Chile for nitrate, Australia and New Zealand for wool, Burma for rice, San Francisco for grain, and the Pacific Northwest for timber.\n\nIn 1899 \"Balclutha\" transferred to the registry of Hawaii, and traded timber from the Pacific Northwest to Australia, returning to San Francisco with Australian coal.\nIn 1902 \"Balclutha\" was chartered to the Alaska Packers' Association (APA). After having struck a reef off of Sitkinak Island near Kodiak Island on 16 May 1904, she was renamed the \"Star of Alaska\" when bought by APA for merely $500. After extended repairs she joined the salmon fishing trade, sailing north from the San Francisco area to the Chignik Bay, Alaska, in April with supplies, fishermen, and cannery workers, and returned in September with a cargo of canned salmon.\n\nFor this trade she carried over 200 crew and passengers, as compared to the 26-man crew she carried as the \"Balclutha\". In 1911 the poop deck was extended to the main mast to accommodate Italian and Scandinavian workers. This expansion is called the shelter deck. In the 'tween deck, bunks for Chinese workers were built. Her last voyage in this trade was in 1930, when she then was laid up after her return home.\n\nIn 1933, \"Star of Alaska\" was renamed \"Pacific Queen\" by her new owner Frank Kissinger. In this guise she appeared in the film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" starring Clark Gable and Charles Laughton. She then eked out an existence as an exhibition ship, gradually deteriorating, and was for a while exhibited as a \"pirate ship\".\n\nIn 1954, \"Pacific Queen\" was acquired by the San Francisco Maritime Museum, which restored her and renamed her \"Balclutha\" and moored her at Pier 41 East. In 1985 she was designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nIn 1988, she was moved to her present mooring at Hyde Street Pier of the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. She is host to a monthly Chantey Sing in the shelter deck 8pm to midnight on the first Saturday of every month.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11415924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11415924", "title": "Big boy letter", "text": "Big boy letter\n\nA big boy letter is a pre-sale agreement in connection with a private sale of securities (such as in a PIPE transaction) not to sue over non-disclosure of material inside information that is not disclosed, entered into between two sophisticated parties. Big boy provisions may also be contained within securities purchase agreements, rather than being the subject of a separate letter agreement. Generally, a seller's request that a buyer agree to a big boy letter is a signal to the sophisticated buyer that there is likely to be material non-public information that exists concerning a security, which could give rise to a lawsuit brought by the buyer if it was not disclosed, in the absence of the letter.\n\nThe legality of big boy letters themselves in the United States Securities markets is a matter of dispute. This is because the primary lawsuit parties seek to avoid with such letters is one under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which contains a provision, Section 29(a), that waivers of liability for securities fraud are void. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which includes the financial District of New York, has enforced agreements similar to big boy letters strictly against the buyer. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which includes Delaware, which is the state of incorporation for many publicly held companies, has given greater weight to the anti-waiver provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, although it has not completely ignored these agreements in considering all facts and circumstances of a transaction. As of 2008, Commissioners and staff from the Securities and Exchange Commission have expressed concern about the legal enforceability of big boy letters. Two commissioners have stated that even if the letters provide a defense in private securities litigation, that they are not a defense in an SEC enforcement action.\n\nEven more controversial than the letters themselves is the practice of buying securities subject to a big boy letter and then reselling the securities to a third party without disclosing the existence of the \"big boy letter.\" This practice is the subject of ongoing litigation and debate among persons familiar with securities markets. Some argue that there is no duty to disclose the existence of the letter, because the buyer doesn't have any specific information. Others argue that there is a duty to disclose the existence of a \"big boy letter\" because it strongly suggests that some material non-public information exists, even if the exact nature of that information is unknown, and that this practice, in effect, constitutes insider trading.\n\n"}

The untouchable (\"avarna\") women were expected to pay the government a tax on their breasts, as soon as they started developing breasts. The outcaste men had to pay a similar tax, called \"tala-karam\", on their heads. Those belonging to a varna (\"savarna\"), from Brahmins to the Shudras, were exempted from the taxes.\n\nThe outcaste women were not allowed to wear clothes covering their upper body in the public. The law resulted from Travancore's tradition, in which the breast was bared as a symbol of respect to higher-status people. For example, the Nairs bared their breasts to the upper-caste Nambudiri Brahmins, while the Brahmins bared their breasts only to the images of the deities. The people of the even lower castes, such as Nadars (or Shanars), were not allowed cover their breasts at all. With the spread of Christianity in the 19th century, the Christian converts among the Nadar women started covering their upper body, and gradually, even the Hindu Nadar women adopted this practice. After a series of protests (see Channar revolt), the Nadar women were granted the right to cover their breasts in 1859.\n\n"}

Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for \"The Washington Post\", and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of U.S. President Richard Nixon's administration in what came to be known as the Watergate scandal. In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former Federal Bureau of Investigation Associate Director Mark Felt was Deep Throat. Felt was suffering from dementia at the time and had previously denied being Deep Throat, but Woodward and Bernstein confirmed the attorney's claim.\n\nDeep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book \"All the President's Men\" by \"Washington Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, which was adapted as a film two years later. According to the authors, Deep Throat was a key source of information behind a series of articles which introduced the misdeeds of the Nixon administration to the general public. The scandal eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon, as well as to prison terms for White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, G. Gordon Liddy, Egil Krogh, White House Counsel Charles Colson, former United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, John Dean, and presidential adviser John Ehrlichman.\n\nHoward Simons was the managing editor of the \"Post\" during Watergate. He dubbed the secret informant \"Deep Throat\", alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film \"Deep Throat\". For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation. Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it. J. Anthony Lukas speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book \"Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years\" (1976), based on three \"New York Times Sunday Magazine\" articles, but he was widely criticized. According to an article in \"Slate\" on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the \"intelligence community\" in a 1989 \"Playboy\" interview with Lukas.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, \"Vanity Fair\" revealed that Felt was Deep Throat in an article on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf. Felt reportedly said, \"I'm the guy they used to call Deep Throat.\" After the \"Vanity Fair\" story broke, Woodward, Bernstein, and Benjamin C. Bradlee, the \"Post\"s executive editor during Watergate, confirmed Felt's identity as Deep Throat. L. Patrick Gray, former acting Director of the FBI and Felt's boss, disputed Felt's claim in his book \"In Nixon's Web\", co-written with his son Ed Gray. Gray and others have argued that Deep Throat was a compilation of sources characterized as one person in order to improve sales of the book and movie. Woodward and Bernstein, however, defended Felt's claims and detailed their relationship with him in Woodward's book \"The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate's Deep Throat\".\n\nOn June 17, 1972, police arrested five men inside the offices of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Complex in Washington, D.C.. In their possession were $2,300, burglary tools, a walkie-talkie, a radio scanner capable of listening to police frequencies, cameras, 40 rolls of film, tear gas guns, electronic devices which they apparently intended to plant in the Democratic Committee offices, and notebooks containing the telephone number of White House official E. Howard Hunt. One of the men was James W. McCord Jr., a former Central Intelligence Agency employee and a security man for Nixon's Committee to Re-elect the President (popularly known as \"CREEP\").\n\n\"Washington Post\" reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward pursued the story for two years. The scandal eventually implicated many members of the Nixon White House, and Nixon became the only US president to resign. Woodward and Bernstein wrote in \"All the President's Men\" that key information in their investigation had come from an anonymous informant whom they dubbed \"Deep Throat\".\n\nWoodward, in \"All the President's Men\", first mentions Deep Throat on page 71; earlier in the book he reports calling \"an old friend and sometimes source who worked for the federal government and did not like to be called at his office\". Later, he describes him as \"a source in the Executive Branch who had access to information at CRP as well as at the White House\". The book also calls him \"an incurable gossip\", \"in a unique position to observe the Executive Branch\", and a man \"whose fight had been worn out in too many battles\".\n\nWoodward claimed that he would signal to \"Deep Throat\" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When Deep Throat wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of \"The New York Times\"; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met \"on the bottom level of an underground garage just over the Key Bridge in Rosslyn\", at 2:00 a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has an historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal. , the garage had not been demolished.\n\nMany were skeptical of these cloak and dagger methods. Adrian Havill investigated these claims for his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, and found them to be factually impossible. He noted that Woodward's apartment 617 at 1718 P Street, Northwest, in Washington faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street. Havill said anyone regularly checking the balcony, as \"Deep Throat\" was said to have done daily, would have been spotted. Havill also said that copies of \"The New York Times\" were not delivered to individual apartments but delivered in an unaddressed stack at the building's reception desk. There would have been no way to know which copy was intended for Woodward. Woodward, however, has stated that in the early 1970s the interior courtyard was an alleyway and had not yet been bricked off, and that his balcony was visible from street level to passing pedestrians. It was also visible, Woodward conjectured, to anyone from the FBI in surveillance of nearby embassies. Also revealed was the fact that Woodward's copy of \"The New York Times\" had his apartment number indicated on it. Former neighbor Herman Knippenberg stated that Woodward would sometimes come to his door looking for his marked copy of the \"Times\", claiming, \"I like to have it in mint condition and I like to have my own copy.\"\n\nFurther, while Woodward stressed these precautions in his book, he also admits to having called \"Deep Throat\" on the telephone at his home.\n\nIn public statements following the disclosure of his identity, Felt's family called him an \"American hero\", stating that he leaked information about the Watergate scandal to \"The Washington Post\" for moral and patriotic reasons. Other commentators, however, have speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward.\n\nIn his book \"The Secret Man\", Woodward describes Felt as a loyalist and admirer of J. Edgar Hoover. After Hoover's death, Felt became angry and disgusted when L. Patrick Gray, a career naval officer and lawyer from the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, with no prior law enforcement experience, was appointed Director of the FBI over Felt, a 30-year veteran of the Bureau. Felt was particularly unhappy with Gray's management style at the FBI, which was markedly different from Hoover's. Felt selected Woodward because he knew Woodward and Bernstein were assigned to investigate the burglary. Instead of seeking out prosecutors at the Justice Department, or the House Judiciary Committee charged with investigating presidential wrongdoing, he methodically leaked information to Woodward to guide their investigation while keeping his own identity and involvement safely concealed.\n\nSome conservatives who worked for Nixon, such as Pat Buchanan and G. Gordon Liddy, castigated Felt and asserted their belief that Nixon was unfairly hounded from office.\n\nAlthough confirmation of Deep Throat's identity remained elusive for over 30 years, there were suspicions that Felt was indeed the reporters' mysterious source long before the public acknowledgment in 2005.\n\nIn February 2005, Nixon's former White House Counsel, news columnist John Dean, reported that Woodward had recently informed Bradlee that \"Deep Throat\" was ailing and that Bradlee had written Deep Throat's obituary. Both Woodward and the then-current editor of \"The Washington Post\", Leonard Downie, denied these claims. Felt was something of a suspect, especially after the mysterious meeting that occurred between Woodward and Felt in the summer of 1999. But others had received more attention over the years, such as Pat Buchanan, Henry Kissinger, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist, General Alexander Haig, and before it was revealed that \"Deep Throat\" was definitely not female, Diane Sawyer.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, \"Vanity Fair\" reported that Felt, then aged 91, claimed to be the man once known as \"Deep Throat\". Later that day, Woodward, Bernstein, and Bradlee released a statement through \"The Washington Post\" confirming that the story was true.\n\nOn June 2, 2005, \"The Washington Post\" ran a lengthy front-page column by Woodward in which he detailed his friendship with Felt in the years before Watergate. Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by chance in 1970, when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant in his mid-20s who was dispatched to deliver a package to the White House's West Wing. Felt arrived soon after, for a separate appointment and sat next to Woodward in the waiting room. Woodward struck up a conversation, eventually learning of Felt's position in the upper echelon of the FBI. Woodward, who was about to get out of the Navy at the time and was unsure about his future direction in life, became determined to use Felt as a mentor and career advisor, and so he got Felt's phone number and kept in touch with him.\n\nAfter deciding to try a career as a reporter, Woodward eventually joined \"The Washington Post\" in August 1971. Felt, who Woodward writes had long had a dim view of the Nixon administration, began passing pieces of information to Woodward, although he insisted that Woodward keep the FBI and Justice Department out of anything he wrote based on the information. The first time Woodward used information from Felt in a \"Washington Post\" story was in mid-May 1972, a month before the Watergate burglary, when Woodward was reporting on Arthur Bremer, who had attempted to assassinate presidential candidate George C. Wallace; Nixon had put Felt in charge of investigating the would-be assassin. A month later, just days after the Watergate break-in, Woodward would call Felt at his office, marking the first time Woodward spoke with Felt about Watergate.\n\nCommenting on Felt's motivations for serving as his Deep Throat source, Woodward wrote, \"Felt believed he was protecting the bureau by finding a way, clandestine as it was, to push some of the information from the FBI interviews and files out to the public, to help build public and political pressure to make Nixon and his people answerable. He had nothing but contempt for the Nixon White House and their efforts to manipulate the Bureau for political reasons.\"\n\nIn 1980, Felt himself was convicted of ordering illegal break-ins at the homes of Weathermen suspects and their families. Richard Nixon testified on his behalf. President Ronald Reagan pardoned Felt and the conviction was subsequently expunged from the record.\n\nPrior to Felt's revelation and Woodward's confirmation, part of the reason historians and other scholars had so much difficulty in identifying the real Deep Throat is because no single person seemed to truly fit the character described in \"All the President's Men\". This had caused some scholars and commentators to come to the conclusion that Deep Throat could not possibly be a single person, and must be a composite of several sources. Woodward and Bernstein consistently denied the theory.\n\nFrom a literary business perspective, this theory was further supported by David Obst, the agent who originally marketed the draft for \"All the President's Men\", who stated that the initial typescript of the book contained absolutely no reference to Deep Throat. Obst believed that Deep Throat was invented by Woodward and Bernstein for dramatic purposes. It also led to speculation that the authors played at condensing history in the same way Hollywood scriptwriters do.\n\nEd Gray, the son of L. Patrick Gray III, stated in \"In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate\" that his examination of Woodward's interview notes pertaining to Deep Throat at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin provided \"convincing evidence that 'Deep Throat' was indeed a fabrication\". According to Gray, the file contained notes regarding four interviews that were attributed to either Felt, \"X\", or \"my friend\", and a fifth interview dated March 24, 1973, that was unattributed. He said he discovered that he had already seen the paper in 2006 after Woodward released interview files with people who were not Deep Throat. Gray wrote that he contacted Stephen Mielke, the archivist who oversees the Woodward-Bernstein collection at the University of Texas, who said that a carbon copy of the paper contained a note in Woodward's handwriting attributing the interview to Donald Santarelli, an official with the Department of Justice during the Watergate era. Gray wrote that he contacted Santarelli who confirmed that the March 24 meeting was with him. Other interview notes attributed to \"X\" were interpreted by Gray as containing content that could not have been known by Felt.\n\nRegarding Gray's allegations, Woodward wrote that the March 24 notes were obviously not from an interview with Felt because Felt is referred to by name twice in quotes from the source, and that he never stated or wrote that he met with Deep Throat on that date. According to Woodward, Mielke said the page was likely misfiled under Felt due to a lack of source.\n\nAnother leading candidate was White House Associate Counsel Fred F. Fielding. In April 2003 Fielding was presented as a potential candidate as a result of a detailed review of source material by William Gaines and his journalism students, as part of a class at the University of Illinois journalism school. Fielding was the assistant to John Dean and as such had access to the files relating to the affair. Gaines felt that statements by Woodward ruled out Deep Throat's being in the FBI and that Deep Throat often had information before the FBI did. H. R. Haldeman himself suspected Fielding as being Deep Throat.\n\nDean had been one of the most dedicated hunters of Deep Throat. Both he and Leonard Garment dismissed Fielding as a possibility, reporting that he had been cleared by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Reagan administration. However this assertion, which comes from Fielding, has not been corroborated.\n\nOne reason that many experts believed that Deep Throat was Fielding and not Felt was due to Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that \"Deep Throat\" worked in the intelligence community:\n\nAny candidate who died before the Felt admission ceased to fit Woodward's criteria at that time, since Woodward had stated that he was free to reveal his identity when \"Deep Throat\" died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8709", "title": "Dhrystone", "text": "Dhrystone\n\nDhrystone is a synthetic computing benchmark program developed in 1984 by Reinhold P. Weicker intended to be representative of system (integer) programming. The Dhrystone grew to become representative of general processor (CPU) performance. The name \"Dhrystone\" is a pun on a different benchmark algorithm called Whetstone.\n\nWith Dhrystone, Weicker gathered meta-data from a broad range of software, including programs written in FORTRAN, PL/1, SAL, ALGOL 68, and Pascal. He then characterized these programs in terms of various common constructs: procedure calls, pointer indirections, assignments, etc. From this he wrote the Dhrystone benchmark to correspond to a representative mix. Dhrystone was published in Ada, with the C version for Unix developed by Rick Richardson (\"version 1.1\") greatly contributing to its popularity.\n\nThe Dhrystone benchmark contains no floating point operations, thus the name is a pun on the then-popular Whetstone benchmark for floating point operations. The output from the benchmark is the number of Dhrystones per second (the number of iterations of the main code loop per second).\n\nBoth Whetstone and Dhrystone are \"synthetic\" benchmarks, meaning that they are simple programs that are carefully designed to statistically mimic the processor usage of some common set of programs. Whetstone, developed in 1972, originally strove to mimic typical Algol 60 programs based on measurements from 1970, but eventually became most popular in its Fortran version, reflecting the highly numerical orientation of computing in the 1960s.\n\nDhrystone's eventual importance as an indicator of general-purpose (\"integer\") performance of new computers made it a target for commercial compiler writers. Various modern compiler static code analysis techniques (such as elimination of dead code: for example, code which uses the processor but produces internal results which are not used or output) make the use and design of synthetic benchmarks more difficult. Version 2.0 of the benchmark, released by Weicker and Richardson in March 1988, had a number of changes intended to foil a range of compiler techniques. Yet it was carefully crafted so as not to change the underlying benchmark. This effort to foil compilers was only partly successful. Dhrystone 2.1, released in May of the same year, had some minor changes and remains the current definition of Dhrystone.\n\nOther than issues related to compiler optimization, various other issues have been cited with the Dhrystone. Most of these, including the small code size and small data set size, were understood at the time of its publication in 1984. More subtle is the slight over-representation of string operations, which is largely language-related: both Ada and Pascal have strings as normal variables in the language, whereas C does not, so what was simple variable assignment in reference benchmarks became buffer copy operations in the C library. Another issue is that the score reported does not include information which is critical when comparing systems such as which compiler was used, and what optimizations.\n\nDhrystone remains remarkably resilient as a simple benchmark, but its continuing value in establishing true performance is questionable. It is easy to use, well documented, fully self-contained, well understood, and can be made to work on almost any system. In particular, it has remained in broad use in the embedded computing world, though the recently developed EEMBC benchmark suite, HINT, Stream, and even Bytemark are widely quoted and used, as well as more specific benchmarks for the memory subsystem (Cachebench), TCP/IP (TTCP), and many others.\n\nDhrystone remains in use 30 years after it was designed by Weicker, a longer life than most software.\n\nCoreMark is a small benchmark released by the non-profit Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium (EEMBC) in 2009, that targets the CPU core, similar to Dhrystone. Both benchmarks are available free of charge and are small enough to execute on any processor, including small micro-controllers. CoreMark avoids issues such as the compiler computing the work during compile time, and uses real algorithms rather than being completely synthetic. CoreMark also has established rules for running the benchmark and for reporting the results.\n\nDhrystone may represent a result more meaningfully than MIPS (million instructions per second) because instruction count comparisons between different instruction sets (e.g. RISC vs. CISC) can confound simple comparisons. For example, the same high-level task may require many more instructions on a RISC machine, but might execute faster than a single CISC instruction. Thus, the Dhrystone score counts only the number of program iteration completions per second, allowing individual machines to perform this calculation in a machine-specific way. Another common representation of the Dhrystone benchmark is the DMIPS (Dhrystone MIPS) obtained when the Dhrystone score is divided by 1757 (the number of Dhrystones per second obtained on the VAX 11/780, nominally a 1 MIPS machine).\n\nAnother way to represent results is in DMIPS/MHz, where DMIPS result is further divided by CPU frequency, to allow for easier comparison of CPUs running at different clock rates.\n\nUsing Dhrystone as a benchmark has pitfalls: \n\n\n"}

She and her husband, Nathaniel Lord Britton played a significant role in the fundraising and creation of the New York Botanical Garden. She was a co-founder of the predecessor to the American Bryological and Lichenological Society. She was an activist for protection of wildflowers, inspiring local chapter activities and the passage of legislation. Elizabeth Britton made major contributions to the literature of mosses, publishing 170 papers in that field.\n\nElizabeth Gertrude Knight was born on January 9, 1858 in New York City, one of five daughters, to James and Sophie Anne (née Compton) Knight. Her family operated a furniture factory and sugar plantation in the vicinity of Matanzas, Cuba, and she spent much of her childhood there. In later childhood, she attended a private school in New York; she then attended Normal College (later, Hunter College) and was graduated from there in 1875, at the early age of seventeen. On August 27, 1885 she married Nathaniel Lord Britton, an Assistant in Geology at Columbia College who shared her growing interest in botany. The couple had no children.\n\nAfter graduation in 1875, Elizabeth Knight joined the staff of Normal College as a critic teacher. She joined the Torrey Botanical Club in 1879, and in 1881 she published her first scientific paper in that organization's \"Bulletin\", reporting observations of unexpected white flowers in two species of plants. She also observed the presence of a curlygrass fern, Schizaea pusilla, in Nova Scotia. In 1883, she was named a Tutor in Natural Science. At that time, she began to specialize in bryology and her first paper concerning mosses appeared. Elizabeth collected fertile specimens of Eustichium norvegicum in Wisconsin and wrote the first description of its fruits; known since 1827, the plant had hitherto been known only in a sterile condition.\n\nAfter her marriage in 1885, Elizabeth Britton resigned her teaching position at Normal College, and took charge of the moss collections at Columbia in an unofficial, unpaid capacity. She served as editor of the \"Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club\" from 1886 to 1888; in 1889, she published the first of an eleven-part series of papers titled \"Contributions to American Bryology\" in that journal. Her catalogue of the mosses of West Virginia appeared in 1892, and the first of eight articles titled \"How to Study the Mosses\" for a popular magazine was published in 1894. These papers \"sufficed to place Mrs. Britton in command of the bryological field in America.\" Showing skills away from the lab as well, she worked with her husband to acquire for Columbia the moss herbarium of August Jaeger (1842–1877) of Switzerland; Elizabeth persuaded wealthy friends to contribute the necessary $6000.\n\nElizabeth Britton, along with her husband, was one of the Torrey Botanical Club members who spurred the establishment of the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG). As the story goes, the couple had traveled to England in 1888. Nathaniel was performing research at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in order to classify the Bolivian botanical collections of Henry Hurd Rusby, a gift to Columbia; meanwhile, Elizabeth worked on mosses at the Linnaean Society of London. Inspired by the quality and quantity of Kew's herbarium, library, and gardens, the couple set about organizing an institution of comparable stature for New York. A Club meeting was held in October, 1888; rich and prominent citizens were recruited as incorporators; and the Botanical Garden was established by act of the state legislature in 1891. Elizabeth was a prime mover in the efforts to raise funds for the organization in the 1890s. Nathaniel became the first Director-in-Chief of the Botanical Garden in 1896; Elizabeth joined him in a volunteer capacity. It was largely through her interest that the collection of liverworts and mosses of William Mitten was acquired for the NYBG in 1906. In recognition of her service, Britton was named Honorary Curator of the Mosses in 1912, a post which she held until her death.\n\nElizabeth enumerated the ferns in the Rusby collection in 1888. After extensive research, comparison with the specimens at Kew and elsewhere, and consultations with other bryologists, she published her enumeration of the Rusby mosses in 1896.\nBritton traveled to various locations in the continental United States to collect botanical specimens, including the Great Dismal Swamp, the Adirondack Mountains, and the mountains of North Carolina. She accompanied Nathaniel on 23 of the 25 trips he made to the islands of the Caribbean and West Indies. Under her own name, she published her findings in the \"Bulletin\" in 1913–1915. Elizabeth wrote the chapters concerning mosses for Nathaniel's \"Flora of Bermuda\" and \"The Bahama Flora\".\n\nElizabeth worked with organizations to promote the study of mosses, especially by women scientists. She chaired the division of bryophyta for the (Women's) National Science Club (NWSC) in 1897.\n\nAs part of her unofficial position at Columbia, Britton acted as advisor to doctoral students, including James Franklin Collins and Abel Joel Grout. Together, in 1898 Grout and Britton founded the Sullivant Moss Chapter of the Agassiz Association; by 1908, it was known as the Sullivant Moss Society (and after 1949, as the American Bryological and Lichenological Society). Although relations between the two researchers later became chilly, Britton continued to participate in the Society, contributing articles to \"The Bryologist\", its journal, and serving as its president from 1916 to 1919.\n\nElizabeth Britton continued to study plants other than mosses. She published \"A Revision of the North American Species of \"Ophioglossum\",\" the adder's-tongue ferns, in 1897. With Delia West Marble, she collected the type specimen of \"Dryopteris brittonae\", a species of maiden fern, in 1906. Britton collected the type specimen for the orchid named Britton's shadow witch (\"Ponthieva brittonae\" Ames).\n\nIn the first decade of the century, Britton began to devote energy to the conservation of wildflowers. A gift of $3000 by Olivia Stokes and Caroline Phelps Stokes to the NYBG spurred the creation of the Wild Flower Preservation Society of America. The first meeting was held on April 23, 1902; Frederick Vernon Coville was elected president, Charles Louis Pollard was elected secretary, and Britton was elected to the Board of Managers. Other members of the board included Charles Edwin Bessey, Liberty Hyde Bailey, William Trelease, Charles Frederick Millspaugh, and Alice Eastwood. Britton went on to serve as secretary and treasurer of the organization. The Society established numerous local chapters. It was incorporated in the state of New York in 1915, then reorganized as the Wild Flower Preservation Society in 1925, with Percy L. Ricker as its head. Britton vigorously promoted the cause for nearly 35 years, by publishing, lecturing, and conducting correspondence; her efforts led to adoption of legislation in various states, as well as local conservation activities in garden clubs and public schools. She published fourteen articles in the NYBG's \"Journal\" under the series title of \"Wild Plants Needing Protection\".\n\nIn 1925, as chair of the conservation committee of the Federated Garden Clubs of New York State, Britton successfully led a boycott campaign against the common practice of harvesting wild American holly for use as a Christmas decoration; as a substitute, she promoted the propagation of the plant by cuttings for commercial use.\n\nAll told, during the period 1881 to 1930, Elizabeth Britton published 346 papers, of which 170 dealt with mosses. She wrote descriptions of six families of mosses for the New York Botanical Garden's \"Flora of America\". Marshall Avery Howe described Britton as \"a woman of extraordinary physical and mental energy—the possessor of a remarkably quick and brilliant intellect. She has left an enduring record in the literature of science, and her well-directed activities have had an outstanding influence in the conservation of the native flora of the United States.\"\n\nIn In 1893, Britton was the only woman among the 25 scientists nominated for charter membership in the Botanical Society of America. In 1905, she was one of three bryologists appointed to the nomenclature committee that would report to the 1910 meeting of the International Botanical Congress in Brussels. In 1906, Britton was one of only nineteen women listed in the first edition of \"American Men of Science\". Her entry was marked with an asterisk: this \"starred\" listing was limited to the top 1,000 scientists in the book, as determined by the editors. Britton was starred in the five editions of the book that appeared through 1933.\n\nThe moss genus \"Bryobrittonia\" is named for Elizabeth Britton, as well as fifteen species of plants and one of animals.\n\nMount Britton, a double peak in El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico, honors Elizabeth and her husband Nathaniel.\n\nIn 1940, a memorial plaque in honor of Elizabeth Britton was installed in the new Wild Flower Garden of the New York Botanical Garden. A gift of the New York Bird and Tree Club, it is mounted on a ten-ton boulder of Bronx schist, and its text reads, \"Let those who find pleasure in this garden remember Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton, lover of wildflowers and ardent advocate of their protection\". The garden is now known as the Native Plant Garden, and the boulder as Britton Rock.\n\nToday, the Elizabeth Gertrude Knight Britton archive is held by the NYBG Mertz Library. It includes personal papers, manuscripts and published research, artwork and photographs, and printing plates. The archive documents Britton's teaching career at the Normal School, as well as her participation in the Torrey Botanical Club and the NYBG. Her field notebooks can be found in the New York Botanical Garden Collectors' Field Notebook collection.\n\nThe character of Alma Whittaker in the 2013 novel \"The Signature of All Things\", by Elizabeth Gilbert, is modeled in part on Elizabeth Britton.\n\nElizabeth Britton died at her home at 2965 Decatur Avenue in The Bronx on February 25, 1934, following an apoplectic stroke; her husband Nathaniel survived her by four months. Although she was nominally a member of the Episcopalian faith, she was buried in the Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island, where Nathaniel's ancestors had been early settlers and he held property.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A standout athlete in high school, Ladd attended Grambling State University on a basketball scholarship before being drafted to the American Football League's San Diego Chargers in 1961. Ladd found success in the AFL as one of the largest players in professional football history at 6' 9\" and 315 pounds.\n\nHe helped the Chargers to four AFL championship games in five years, winning the championship with the team in 1963. He also had stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Oilers. Ladd took up professional wrestling during the AFL offseason, and after a knee injury ended his football career turned to it full-time in 1969.\n\nAs a wrestler, Ladd became one of the top heels in the business. For much of his career he played a villainous character who would arrogantly taunt both opponents and crowds. Ladd feuded with many popular wrestlers of the time, including Wahoo McDaniel, André the Giant, Bobo Brazil, Dusty Rhodes, and Mr. Wrestling. He retired from the ring in 1986.\n\nLadd was inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame in 1981, the Grambling State University Hall of Fame in 1989, and the WWF Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nLadd was diagnosed with colon cancer in the winter of 2003–2004. He died on March 10, 2007 at the age of 68.\n\nLadd was born in Rayville, Louisiana and raised in Orange, Texas, where he was a high school football and basketball star. His football coach was William Ray Smith, Sr., father of NFL star Bubba Smith. Ladd subsequently attended Grambling State University on a basketball scholarship. He was the nephew of Grambling and Houston Oilers teammate Garland Boyette.\n\nLadd was drafted in the fourth round of the 1961 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears. He was also taken by the American Football League's San Diego Chargers with their 15th pick (119th overall) in the 1961 AFL draft. He chose to sign with the Chargers.\n\nAt 6'9\" and 315 pounds, Ladd was said to be the biggest and strongest man in professional football during his era. His physical measurements included a 52-inch chest, 39-inch waist, 20-inch biceps, 19-inch neck, and size 18D shoes.\n\nLadd played in four AFL championship games, helping the Chargers win the American Football League title in 1963 with teammate Earl Faison, both members of the original Fearsome Foursome. Ladd, an American Football League All-Star from 1962 through 1965, was one of the AFL players that organized a walkout on the 1965 AFL All-Star Game due to the racism they experienced in New Orleans.\n\nAlthough Ladd found success with the Chargers, he had a contentious relationship with the Chargers front office. He started the 1965 season being indefinitely suspended from the team by Coach/General Manager Sid Gillman.\n\nLadd stated that he and teammate Earl Faison would play out their contract options, opting to take a 10 percent cut in salary in exchange for becoming free agents at the end of the season. A planned trade with the Oilers in early 1966 would have sent Faison and Ladd to Houston. However, both were declared free agents by AFL commissioner Joe Foss, who ruled that Oilers owner Bud Adams had tampered in trade dealings with the Chargers. Ladd refused to re-sign with the Chargers and suggested he might instead turn to professional wrestling full-time.\n\nEventually, Ladd signed with the Oilers and spent the 1966 season playing for them before moving in 1967 to the Kansas City Chiefs. There, with similarly king sized Grambling teammate and future NFL Hall of Famer Buck Buchanan (6'7\", 286 lbs), he filled out what was probably the biggest defensive tackle tandem in history. Both Ladd and Buchanan were inducted into the Grambling State University Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nBoston Patriots center Jon Morris said Ladd was so big \"It was dark. I couldn’t see the linebackers. I couldn’t see the goalposts. It was like being locked in a closet.\" In 1981, he was inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame.\n\nLadd started wrestling in 1961. As a publicity stunt, some wrestlers in the San Diego area challenged Ladd to a private wrestling workout. Before long, Ladd was a part-time competitor in Los Angeles, during football's off-season. Ladd became a huge draw in short order. When knee problems cut his football career short, Ladd turned to the more financially lucrative business of wrestling full-time in 1969. After a run as a fan favorite, Ladd became one of wrestling's most hated heels during the 1970s, as well as one of the first black wrestlers to portray a heel character. He riled crowds with his arrogant and colorful demeanor during interviews, especially with his less than politically correct nicknames for opponents such as Wahoo McDaniel (whom he referred to as \"the Drunken Indian\"), and Mr. Wrestling (whom he called \"the Masked Varmint\" and insisted that he was an escaped criminal). Ladd also controversially employed a taped thumb, claiming the support was needed due to an old football injury. Often when Ladd appeared to be in serious trouble during a match he'd walk out of the arena and accept a countout loss, known since as \"pulling an Ernie Ladd\".\n\nLadd wrestled for a number of different professional associations, including the World Wide Wrestling Federation where he was managed by The Grand Wizard of Wrestling. Additionally, he had several successful runs in the NWA territories, The Mid - South Promotion, NWF, and WWC Promotion.\n\nKnown for his immense size and power, it was natural for Ladd to engage in feuds with other giants, including famously with André the Giant (whom Ladd antagonizingly referred to as \"Andre the Dummy\" or \"The Big Fat French Fry\" during interviews).\n\nIn certain areas, Ladd's wrestling nickname was \"The King\", and he would wear an ornate crown.\n\nIn other wrestling associations, he was \"The Big Cat\", and entered wearing a big cowboy hat.\n\nAfter handily pinning Earl \"Mr. Universe\" Maynard the month prior, Ladd challenged Bruno Sammartino at Madison Square Garden for the WWWF title on March 1, 1976. He also later challenged Pedro Morales for the same title. In 1978, he wrestled WWWF champion Bob Backlund. When the International Wrestling Association had its brief run in the New York area, Ladd lost a 2 out of 3 fall match at Roosevelt Stadium, in Jersey City, New Jersey, to champion Mil Mascaras, 2 falls to 1 (he pinned Mascaras the first fall, was disqualified in the second, and was pinned by Mascaras in the third).\n\nAfter leaving the WWWF, Ladd ventured to the Mid-South territory promoted by Bill Watts. While there Ladd feuded with Paul Orndorff, Ray Candy, and Junkyard Dog. He also served as a manager to Afa & Sika, The Wild Samoans. Ladd also had a decent run as part of a tag team with \"Bad\" Leroy Brown in the early 1980s. Ladd would also assist Watts as a booker behind the scenes, and had a large part in the development of Sylvester Ritter as the area's top draw.\n\nLadd retired from wrestling in 1986 due to recurring knee problems. He then returned to the WWF as a Color Commentator, calling the 20 Man Battle Royal at Wrestlemania 2 (which featured NFL players) and then earning a trial run doing commentary for various shows, including the April, 1986 show at Madison Square Garden. He would also be used as a fill-in for random matches on syndicated programming such as \"WWF Championship Wrestling\". Ladd also teamed with Gorilla Monsoon and Johnny Valiant in the broadcast booth during The Big Event at C.N.E. Stadium in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ladd, Monsoon, and Valiant were the original three man team for the first few weeks of \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\", before Ladd was replaced by Bobby Heenan and Valiant's role was reduced significantly to only calling matches when Heenan had to be at ringside for one of the wrestlers he managed. Following this Ladd quietly left the WWF.\n\nHe was inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame in 1994 and the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1995, becoming the first (and for several years only) inductee in both halls.\n\nLadd was a longtime friend of the Bush family and supported the 2000 campaign of George W. Bush.\n\nLadd also owned and operated Big Cat Ernie Ladd's \"Throwdown\" BBQ Restaurant in New Orleans, Louisiana, until it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005. In the disaster's aftermath, he ministered to Katrina evacuees at the Astrodome. He was a friend of WWE Hall of Fame commentator Jim Ross.\n\nLadd also appeared in an episode of \"That '70s Show\" entitled \"That Wrestling Show.\" He was in the locker room with The Rock, who was playing his own father \"Soul Man\" Rocky Johnson.\n\nLadd was also a basketball coach for young kids in Franklin, Louisiana.\n\nLadd was diagnosed with colon cancer in the winter of 2003–2004, being advised he had three to six months to live. Three years passed before he died on March 10, 2007 at the age of 68. He was survived by his wife of 45 years and their four children.\n\nHollywood Wrestling / Worldwide Wrestling Associates \n\n\n"}

It was the first of three similar documents, followed by the Treaty of Kruschwitz (Kruschwitz) in 1230, and the papal Golden Bull of Rieti in 1234.\n\nThe Piast duke Konrad I of Masovia had waged several Prussian Crusades and particularly in 1222/23 had tried to conquer Chełmno Land (Culmer Land) east of the Vistula River from the pagan Old Prussians. Backed by his Polish cousins Leszek I the White and Henry I the Bearded, he initially was successful, but had to face a Prussian counterstrike and now feared for his Duchy of Masovia, which suffered under continuous Prussian attacks. In 1224 the duke began negotiations with the Teutonic Knights to strengthen his forces and to stabilize the situation.\n\nBetween 1211 and 1225, the Teutonic Order, led by Grand Master Herman of Salza, was present in the Burzenland region of Transylvania. Similar to Konrad of Masovia's request, the Knights had been called in by King Andrew II of Hungary to settle, stabilize and protect the eastern Hungarian frontier against the Cuman people. Yet, they were expelled after trying to establish an autonomous state on Hungarian territory, subordinate only to the authority of Pope Honorius III. This time von Salza would wait to set out for Prussia, until the Order's claimed possessions were confirmed directly by the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe Knights were to be equipped by Duke Konrad I of Masovia in exchange for their support to stabilize his Masovian land:\n\n<poem>...our trusty Brother Herman, the worthy Master of the Sacred House of the Hospital of St. Mary of the Germans in Jerusalem [i.e., the Teutonic Order] has explained ... that our devoted Konrad (\"Chünradus\"), Duke of Masovia and of Kujawy (\"Cuiaviae\"), has promised and undertaken to provide for him and to his brethren from that land, which is called the Chelmło Land (\"terra quae vocatur Culmen\"), and in that other land, that is to say, between his borderland (\"marchiam\") and the territories of the Prussians (\"confinia Prutenorum\"), that they may thus indeed take up the task and readily embark upon the invasion and obtaining of the land of Prussia (\"terram Prusciae\") for the honor and glory of the true God.\n\nWe [that is, Frederick himself] therefore... especially because the land itself is held under the sole rule of the Empire (\"sub monarchia imperii\"), trusting also in the judgment (\"prudentia\") of the same Master, because he is a man mighty both in deed and word and through his own and his brethren's perseverance is mightily undertaking and manfully carrying out the conquest of that land... even though many, vainly besought with numerous exertions in this business, gave up (\"defecerunt\") just when they seemed about to set forth, grant the land of Prussia to the same Master along with the forces of his order and with all those who think to invade [it]...</poem>\n\nThis Imperial authorisation was signed by a large number of princes, such as the Archbishops of Magdeburg, Ravenna, Tyre, Palermo and Reggio, the Bishops of Bologna, Rimini, Cesena, Mantua and Tortosa, the Dukes of Saxony and Spoleto, and the Margrave of Montferrat.\n\nDuke Konrad actually had no intention of ceding Chełmno Land and therefore established his own military Order of Dobrzyń (\"Fratres Militiae Christi\") in 1228, whom he vested with Dobrzyń Land. The few brethren. however, were not able to secure the borders of Masovia against the Prussian raids and Konrad faced the threat of losing his whole duchy.\n\nOn 16 June 1230, the Treaty of Kruszwica was supposedly signed, according to which Duke Konrad ceded the lands of Chełmno, as well as all other conquests made in Prussia, to the Teutonic Knights under Grand Master Hermann von Salza and the Order of Dobrzyń. The text is only known by later references, as the original document is not preserved. According to the historian Max Perlbach (1848-1921), the Knights forged it to create a legal basis for their secular possessions.\n\nIn 1234, Pope Gregory IX issued the Golden Bull of Rieti, \"Pietati proximum\", confirming the prior deals, stating that the Prussian lands of the Order were subject only to the Pope, not a fief of any other secular or ecclesiastical power. The Roman Curia had already made a promise confirming this; nevertheless, von Salza had insisted on its being put in writing.\n\nThe bull was again confirmed by Pope Alexander IV in 1257.\n\n\n"}

He chose the Hayden adventure and would map the western portion of the Hayden's division until 1879.\n\nOn July 26, 1872, while climbing the then unnamed highest mountain in the Gallatin Mountains, he and his party experienced electric shocks following a lightning event near the summit.

In 1870, he enrolled at the \"\". While there, he became interested in zoology and began a correspondence with Alfred Brehm. He also started an entomological collection that would later be donated to the University of Moscow and wrote a short book called \"Angling for Fish\" (1877).\n\nHe did not take his first art lessons until 1880, when he developed the desire to become a painter after seeing an exhibition of landscape paintings staged by the Peredvizhniki. Concerned that he was too old to begin attending art school, he sought someone to give him private lessons. An old acquaintance introduced him to Alexander Kiselyov, who at that time was working at a private girls' school and tutoring.\n\nThe following year, he felt confident enough to study with Ilya Repin. That Christmas, he worked together with Victor Vasnetsov, designing and creating decorations for a performance at the home of Savva Mamontov. After that, he became a regular visitor to Abramtsevo, sketching the landscapes and architecture.\n\nMeanwhile, he applied at the Imperial Academy of Arts, but was only allowed to audit classes. In the evenings he studied drawing at the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts and took more lessons from Repin. Through 1884, he also spent some time in the workshop of Pavel Chistyakov. In 1886, he was able to study with Vladimir Makovsky at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. That same year, he presented two paintings at the fourteenth exhibition of the Peredvizhniki and would exhibit with them regularly after that; becoming a member in 1891. \n\nHe would also develop a close friendship with Pavel Tretyakov, who bought several of his early paintings. After Tretyakov's death in 1898, the Moscow City Duma chose Ostroukhov as one of the trustees for the Tretyakov Gallery. From 1899 to 1903, he served as de facto head of the board, then was removed for spending too much on acquisitions. \n\nApparently upset by the affair, he retired to a spa in the Vosges to recuperate. In 1905, after some contention, the Duma elected him Chairman of the Board. Everything went well until 1913, when a knife-wielding attacker slashed \"Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan\", Repin's painting of Ivan the Terrible. This gave Ostroukhov's opponents a chance to attack him. He resigned and, by mutual agreement with the Duma, was replaced by Igor Grabar. \n\nDuring this period (which also included a stint as organizer of the Russian exhibition at the Exposition Universelle (1900) and election to the Imperial Academy in 1906) he had virtually given up painting. It was not until 1916, when he spent some time with friends in Crimea, that he began to sketch again. Two years later, he held his last full-scale exhibition with the Peredvizhniki.\n\nIn addition to his work with the Tretyakov Gallery, he was a notable collector in his own right; beginning in the 1890s after he married into the wealthy family of tea merchants and acquired a large house as a dowry. He accumulated over 300 paintings (including Medieval icons) and 500 drawings; mostly by Russian artists, but Degas, Manet, Renoir and Matisse were also represented. One of its highlights was \"The Allegory of Faith\" by Vermeer. He had a library of over 12,000 volumes as well; including a copy of the \"Divine Comedy\" from 1515 and a \"Decameron\" from 1757. In 1918, his collection was nationalized as a public museum and he was appointed curator for life.\n\nBy March 1929 when, as a former landlord, he found himself deprived of his voting rights, he was in very poor health and nearly blind. He died four months later. Shortly after, the museum was closed and his widow was limited to the use of two rooms in their home. She died in 1935. His collection was transferred to the Tretyakov Gallery. Later, the house was reopened as a branch of the \"\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26570339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26570339", "title": "Intromittent organ", "text": "Intromittent organ\n\nAn intromittent organ is a general term for an external organ of a male organism that is specialized to deliver sperm during copulation. Intromittent organs are found most often in terrestrial species, as most non-mammalian aquatic species fertilize their eggs externally, although there are exceptions. For many species in the animal kingdom, the male intromittent organ is a hallmark characteristic of internal fertilization. \n\nMale cephalopods have a specialized arm, the hectocotylus, which is inserted into the female's mantle cavity to deliver a spermatophore during copulation. In some species, the hectocotylus breaks off inside the female's mantle cavity; in others, it can be used repeatedly to copulate with different females.\n\nIn spiders the intromittent organs are the male pedipalps, even though these are not primarily sexual organs, but serve as indirect mating organs; in the male the pedipalps have hollow, clubbed tips, often of complex internal anatomy. The sexually mature male typically deposits his semen onto a specially woven silken mat, then sucks the emission into his pedipalps. In mating, he inserts the openings of the pedipalps in turn into the epigyne, the female external genital structure.\n\nIn Solifugae sperm transfer is also indirect; the male deposits a spermatophore on the ground, picks it up in his chelicerae, then inserts it into the female's genital opening.\n\nIn Opiliones (harvestmen), males have a structure called a penis, which is not present in other arachnids.\n\nIn most millipedes, sperm-transfer is performed by one or two pair of modified legs called gonopods, which are often on the seventh body segment. During mating, a male bends his body to collect a spermatophore from the genital pore of his third segment, and inserts it into the females body. Gonopods vary greatly among millipedes, and are often used to identify species.\n\nMale insects possess an aedeagus, whose function is directly analogous to that of the vertebrate penis. Some insects also have claspers. Male moths have an additional organ called the juxta, which supports the aedeagus. These however are generalisations, and insect genitalia vary enormously in anatomy and in application. For example, some insects, most notoriously the Cimicidae and some Strepsiptera practise traumatic insemination, in which the intermittent organ pierces the abdominal wall and the semen is deposited into the hemocoel.\n\nIn male members of Chondrichthyes (sharks and rays), as well as now-extinct placoderms, the pelvic fins bear specialized claspers. During copulation, one clasper is inserted into the female's cloaca, and sperm is flushed by the male's body through a groove into the female.\n\nMembers of Poeciliidae are small fishes that give birth to live young. In males, the anal fin is shaped into a grooved, rod-shaped organ called a gonopodium used to deliver sperm to females.\n\nIn lizards and snakes, males possess paired hemipenes, each of which is usually grooved to allow sperm transport and spiny or rough at the tip to allow firm attachment to the female. To become erect, a hemipenis is evaginated (turned inside out) through muscle action and engorgement with blood. Only one is inserted into the female's cloaca at a time.\n\nIn some turtles, crocodiles, some birds, and in all mammals, males possess a penis centered along the midline of the body. During copulation it becomes erect due to engorgement with blood or lymph, though in many animals it also contains a stiff or even bony support structure. When not in use, its soft penile tissue is usually flaccid, and depending on the species, may be retracted into the body. The anatomy of the penis varies widely according to species. However, the penis evolved only once in the evolutionary history of amniotes.\n\nAll male mammals have a penis. Insectivores, bats, rodents, carnivorans, and most primates (but not humans) have a bone called the baculum or \"os penis\" that permanently stiffens the penis. During copulation, blood engorges the already-stiff penis resulting in a full erection.\n\nMonotreme penes are variously unusual; the platypus has a penis with a two-lobed (bifid) tip though the whole shaft is inserted in mating, possibly to engage both of the uterine branches, but the echidna's penis actually has four heads, only two of which function at a time. Both monotremes and marsupial moles are the only mammals with internal penises, located on the cloacal wall instead of outside of it as in other mammals.\n\nMost marsupial penises are variously forked or split into two in such ways that they resemble hemipenes; in different marsupial species their forms are characteristic enough to be taxonomically important.\n\nAlthough birds reproduce through internal fertilization, 97% of males completely lack a functional intromittent organ. For the 3% of birds with an intromittent organ, copulation occurs through brief insertion of the male organ into the vagina before ejaculation. Alternatively, for the vast majority of birds—a group comprising nearly 10,000 species —sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in a maneuver known as the “cloacal kiss”. Birds are one of the only groups which reproduce through internal fertilization but have repeatedly lost the intromittent organ.\n\nMale ostriches have a conical shaped penis that is wider at the base.\n\nA functional intromittent organ is known to be present in most species of Paleognathae and Anseriformes. The Anseriformes (waterfowl) are a particularly interesting group to study given the high variability in intromittent organ morphology. Waterfowl intromittent organs range greatly in length, are often characterized by surface elaborations (both spines and grooves), and at times spiral counter-clockwise. Male ducks have a penis that is coiled along the ventral wall of the cloaca when flaccid and which may have an elaborate spiral shape when erect. Waterfowl intromittent organ variation is most likely due to an intersexual arms race resulting from a mating system in which forced extra-pair copulations are frequent.\n"}

He founded and sponsors the Penn State Latina/o Law Students Association.\n\nIn 2006, Backer founded the Coalition for Peace and Ethics, an independent, non-profit, non-partisan, tax-exempt research and information focused organization based in Washington, D.C. As part of its research mission, CPE sponsors research oriented working papers, preliminary scientific or technical paper. The authors of these working papers have released them to share ideas about a topic or to elicit feedback before submitting to a peer reviewed conference or academic journal. These working papers are preliminary versions that are being shared to a broad research community, with the aim of contributing to scholarly debate and soliciting constructive feedback.\n\nBacker is also a member of the American Law Institute and the European Corporate Governance Institute. He served as the chair of the Penn State University Faculty Senate for 2012–2013.\n\nFor his work on transnational constitutionalism, Backer has argued that after World War II, transnational constitutionalism embraced universal human rights as the core feature that emerged with the introduction of post-conflict German and Japanese constitutions. He also has examined the emergence of theocratic constitutionalism starting from the Iranian 1979 constitution. Backer argues that constitutionalism is the legal process in which each state harmonizes with international norms and laws. \nBacker is well known for his works on Chinese Constitutionalism. According to Backer, China is evolving towards a \"single party constitutionalist state \"that is grounded in its unique form of \"party-state constitutionalism.\" Backer argued that the Chinese constitutionalist state differs from the Western model in that the CCP plays a central role in the Chinese constitutional order. In order to articulate his conception of the Chinese \"single-party constitutionalist state\" as a new model of constitutionalist governance, Backer delineated the history for the Chinese state-party system that began from Mao Zedong, and was subsequently improved and strengthened through the works of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. Backer acknowledged that Mao Zedong Thought has had a profound impact on the shaping of China's constitutionalist system, especially in regard to the idea of the Party's role as an outsider. \"The CCP was not merely a vanguard party, but for a long time a revolutionary party. Even after the end of the civil war, the CCP continued to think of itself as outside the apparatus.\" Therefore, in terms of the relationship between the CCP and the state, there was a lengthy process of internalization where the Party as an outsider became internalized into the state through its Mass Line.\n\nBacker has also written extensively on the imposition of binding human rights norms on multinational corporations, where \"the norms internationalize and adopt an enterprise liability model as the basis for determining the scope of liability for groups of related companies. This approach ... eliminates one of the greatest complaints about globalization through large webs of interconnected but legally independent corporations forming one large enterprise.\" Backer is also known for his work on the Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), where he suggested that states have deployed their private global investments (SWFs) as instruments for public global governance.\n\n\"Gods Over Constitution: Transnational Constitutionalism in the 21st century\" (Surry, \nEng.: Ashgate Publishing, forthcoming 2013) .\n\n\"Lawyers Making Meaning: The Semiotics of Law in Legal Education II\" (Dordrecht: Springer, 2012) (with Jan M.

Its essence is the realization that an energy or life-force, conferred by Almighty Jah (God), exists within, and flows through, all people and all living things.

A primary goal in Rastafarian meditation is maintaining awareness of I and I.\n\nA primary goal in a Rastafarian's life is to expand his or her Livity. In Rastafarian philosophy, Livity can be enhanced by intense prayer and meditation (often enhanced by sacramental cannabis use), adherence to an Ital diet, and perhaps most importantly, loving behavior toward others. Livity has a strong focus on living a natural lifestyle which includes the consumption of natural foods and growth of natural hair. This expression of love for others is done in recognition of a central love energy within all people, a concept often referred to as \"One Love\". One Love was coined by Marcus Garvey to refer to the Unity and Love of black people by black people.\n"}
{"id": "15390174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15390174", "title": "Medical Priority Dispatch System", "text": "Medical Priority Dispatch System\n\nThe Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS), sometimes referred to as the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS) is a unified system used to dispatch appropriate aid to medical emergencies including systematized caller interrogation and pre-arrival instructions. Priority Dispatch Corporation is licensed to design and publish MPDS and its various products, with research supported by the International Academy of Emergency Medical Dispatch (IAEMD). Priority Dispatch Corporation, in conjunction with the International Academies of Emergency Dispatch, have also produced similar systems for Police (Police Priority Dispatch System, PPDS) and Fire (Fire Priority Dispatch System, FPDS)\n\nMPDS was developed by Jeff Clawson from 1976 to 1979 when he worked as an emergency medical technician and dispatcher prior to medical school. He designed a set of standardized protocols to triage patients via the telephone and thus improve the emergency response system. Protocols were first alphabetized by chief complaint that included key questions to ask the caller, pre-arrival instructions, and dispatch priorities. After many revisions, these simple cards have evolved into MPDS.\n\nMPDS today still starts with the dispatcher asking the caller key questions. These questions allow the dispatchers to categorize the call by chief complaint and set a determinant level ranging from A (minor) to E (immediately life-threatening) relating to the severity of the patient's condition. The system also uses the determinant O which may be a referral to another service or other situation that may not actually require an ambulance response. Another sub-category code is used to further categorize the patient. \nThe system is often used in the form of a software system called ProQA, which is also produced by Priority Dispatch Corp.\n\nEach dispatch determinant is made up of three pieces of information, which builds the determinant in a number-letter-number format. The first component, a number from 1 to 36, indicates a complaint or specific protocol from the MPDS: the selection of this card is based on the initial questions asked by the emergency dispatcher. The second component, a letter A through E (including the Greek character Ω), is the response determinant indicating the potential severity of injury or illness based on information provided by the caller and the recommended type of response. The third component, a number, is the sub-determinant and provides more specific information about the patient's specific condition. For instance, a suspected cardiac or respiratory arrest where the patient is not breathing is given the MPDS code 9-E-1, whereas a superficial animal bite has the code 3-A-3. The MPDS codes allow emergency medical service providers to determine the appropriate response mode (e.g. \"routine\" or \"lights and sirens\") and resources to be assigned to the event. Some protocols also utilise a single-letter suffix which may be added to the end of the code to provide additional information, e.g. the code 6-D-1 is a patient with breathing difficulties who is not alert, 6-D-1A is a patient with breathing difficulties who is not alert and also has asthma, and 6-D-1E is a patient with breathing difficulties who is not alert and has emphysema/COAD/COPD.\n\nThis Protocol was created to handle the influx of emergency calls during the H1N1 pandemic: it directed that Standard EMS Resources be delayed until patients could be assessed by a Flu Response Unit (FRU), a single provider that could attend a patient and determine what additional resources were required for patient care to reduce the risk of pandemic exposure to EMS Personnel.\n\nAs well as triaging emergency calls, MPDS also provides instructions for the dispatcher to give to the caller whilst assistance is en route. These post-dispatch and pre-arrival instructions are intended both to keep the caller and the patient safe, but also, where necessary, to turn the caller into the \"first first responder\" by giving them potentially life-saving instructions. They include:\n\nWhilst MPDS uses the determinants to provide a recommendation as to the type of response that may be appropriate, some countries use a different response approach. For example, in the United Kingdom, typically all front-line emergency ambulances have advanced life support trained crews, meaning that the ALS/BLS distinction becomes impossible to implement. Instead, each individual response code is assigned to one of several categories, as determined by the Government, with associated response targets for each.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> This may include an emergency ambulance, a rapid response car, ambulance officers, or specialist crews e.g. HART. Other basic life support responses may also be sent, e.g. Community First Responder.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> If an emergency ambulance is unlikely to reach the patient within the average response time, a rapid response car and/or Community First Responder may also be dispatched.\n\nThe exact nature of the response sent may vary slightly between Ambulance Trusts. Following a Category 2, 3, or 5 telephone triage, the patient may receive an ambulance response (which could be Category 1-4 depending on the outcome of the triage), may be referred to another service or provider, or treatment may be completed over the phone.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "478276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=478276", "title": "Phaethon", "text": "Phaethon\n\nPhaethon (; , \"Phaéthōn\", ) was the Ancient Greek name for the planet Jupiter, the motions and cycles of which were personified in poetry and myth.\n\nPhaethon was said to be the son of the Oceanid Clymene and the solar deity Helios. Alternatively, less common genealogies make him a son of Clymenus by Oceanid Merope, of Helios and Rhodos (thus a full brother of the Heliadae) or of Helios and Prote. \n\nPhaethon, challenged by his playmates, sought assurance from his mother that his father was the sun god Helios. She gave him the requested assurance and told him to turn to his father for confirmation. He asked his father for some proof that would demonstrate his relationship with the sun. When the god promised to grant him whatever he wanted, he insisted on being allowed to drive the sun chariot for a day. According to some accounts Helios tried to dissuade Phaethon, telling him that even Zeus was not strong enough to steer these horses, but reluctantly kept his promise. Placed in charge of the chariot, Phaethon was unable to control the horses. In some versions, the Earth first froze when the horses climbed too high, but when the chariot then scorched the Earth by swinging too near, Zeus decided to prevent disaster by striking it down with a thunderbolt. Phaethon fell to earth and was killed in the process.\n\nPhaethon was the good friend or lover of Cycnus (king of Liguria), who profoundly mourned his death and was turned into a swan. Phaethon's seven sisters, the Heliades, also mourned his loss, keeping vigil where Phaethon fell to Earth until the gods turned the sisters into poplar trees, and their tears into amber.\n\nIn Plato's \"Timaeus\", Critias tells the story of Atlantis as recounted to Solon by an Egyptian priest, who prefaced the story by saying:\"\"There have been, and will be again, many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story that even you [Greeks] have preserved, that once upon a time, Phaethon, the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs after long intervals.\"\"\n\nIn the version of the myth told by Ovid in the \"Metamorphoses\", Phaethon ascends into heaven, the home of his suspected father. His mother Clymene had boasted that his father was the Sun-God or Phoebus. Phaethon went to his father who swore by the river Styx to give Phaethon anything he would ask for in order to prove his divine sonship. Phaethon wanted to drive the chariot of the sun for a day. Phoebus tried to talk him out of it by telling him that not even Jupiter (the king of the gods) would dare to drive it, as the chariot was fiery hot and the horses breathed out flames. He said:\"The first part of the track is steep, and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb. In mid-heaven it is highest, where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me, and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear. The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control. Then even Tethys herself, who receives me in her submissive waves, is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong. Moreover the rushing sky is constantly turning, and drags along the remote stars, and whirls them in rapid orbits. I move the opposite way, and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things, and I ride contrary to its swift rotation. Suppose you are given the chariot. What will you do? Will you be able to counter the turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts. The way runs through ambush, and apparitions of wild beasts! Even if you keep your course, and do not steer awry, you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull, Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer, raging Leo and the Lion's jaw, Scorpio's cruel pincers sweeping out to encircle you from one side, and Cancer's crab-claws reaching out from the other. You will not easily rule those proud horses, breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests. They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot, and their necks resist the reins. Beware my boy, that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you, while something can still be done to set right your request!\"\nPhaethon was adamant. When the day came, the fierce horses that drew the chariot felt that it was empty because of the lack of the sun-god's weight and went out of control. Terrified, Phaethon dropped the reins. The horses veered from their course, scorching the earth, burning the vegetation, bringing the blood of the Ethiopians to the surface of their skin and so turning it black, changing much of Africa into desert, drying up rivers and lakes and shrinking the sea. Earth cried out to Jupiter who was forced to intervene by striking Phaethon with a lightning bolt. Like a falling star, Phaethon plunged blazing into the river Eridanos.\n\nThe epitaph on his tomb was:\n\nPhoebus, stricken with grief at his son's death, at first refused to resume his work of driving his chariot, but at the appeal of the other gods, including Jupiter, returned to his task.\n\nAccording to Clement of Alexandria in his \"Stromata\", \"...in the time of Crotopus occurred the burning of Phaethon, and the deluges of Deucalion.\n\nIn \"The Twelve Caesars\", Suetonius attributes to the emperor Tiberius the following repeated remark about the future emperor Gaius Caligula: \"That to allow Gaius to live would prove the ruin of himself and of all men, and that he was raising a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world\".\n\nFragments of Euripides' tragedy on this subject suggest that, in his account, \"Phaethon\" survives. In reconstructing the lost play and discussing the fragments, James Diggle has discussed the treatment of the Phaethon myth (Diggle 2004).\n\nIn the \"True History\" by the satirical Greek writer Lucian, Phaëthon is king of the sun and is at war with the moon.\n\nThe name \"Phaethon\", which means \"Shining One\", was given also to Phaethon (son of Eos), to one of the horses of Eos (the Dawn), the Sun, the constellation Auriga, and the planet Jupiter, while as an adjective it was used to describe the sun and the moon. In some accounts the planet referred to by this name is not Jupiter but Saturn.\n\nIn modern times, an asteroid whose orbit brings it close to the sun has been named \"3200 Phaethon\" after the mythological Phaethon. \n\nThe French form of the name \"Phaethon\" is \"Phaéton\". This form of the word is applied to a kind of carriage.\n\nAn order, family, and genus of birds bear the name Phaethon in their taxonomic nomenclature, the tropicbirds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1196767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1196767", "title": "Phaic Tăn", "text": "Phaic Tăn\n\nPhaic Tăn (subtitled \"Sunstroke on a Shoestring\") is a parody travel guidebook examining imaginary country Phaic Tăn. The book was written by Australians Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro, and Rob Sitch. It is the effective sequel to \"Molvanîa\", which was also published by Jetlag Travel and written by Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro, and Rob Sitch.\n\nThe Kingdom of Phaic Tăn is a composite creation of a number of stereotypes and clichés about Indochinese countries.\n\nPhaic Tăn is said to be situated in Indochina. Place names in Phaic Tăn initially seem to be Vietnamese or Thai, but they form English language puns, hence the capital is called \"Bumpattabumpah\" (\"bumper to bumper\"). \"Phaic Tăn\" can be read as \"Fake Tan\". Also, the districts are the mountainous \"Pha Phlung\" (\"far flung\"), the infertile \"Sukkondat\" (\"suck on that\"), the hyper \"Buhng Lunhg\" (\"bung lung\"; Australian slang 'bung', meaning 'failed'), and the exotic \"Thong On\".\n\nThe country was formerly a colony of France, but was liberated in the early 20th century through student and Communist uprisings. A Marxist dictatorship under Chau Quoc continued until his death in 1947, which prompted the country to launch into a lengthy civil war. Eventually a CIA-backed coup (\"Operation Freedom\") made the country into a military dictatorship which it remains to this day. The country has a popular royal family, though the current king has been deposed no fewer than 25 times.\n\nLike \"Molvanîa\", the humour of the book comes from the guide's attempts to present Phaic Tăn as an attractive, enjoyable country when it is really little more than a squalid, third-world dump. The country is frequently plagued by monsoons and earthquakes and many armed militia groups still patrol the streets.\n\nThe Phaic Tăn people are presented to be extremely superstitious, and obsessed with the concept of luck. The index of the book contains a list of almost 600 numbers the Phaic Tănese consider lucky, plus two considered unlucky (3 and 6). Turning left while driving is also considered unlucky, which causes a lot of traffic problems. Also unlucky is asking for a non-exotic massage, having more than 5 holes in Quic Pot, and to lose a lottery.\n\nThe current king is Sukhimbol Tralanhng III, ninth king of the Angit dynasty. King Falanhng prides himself on being something of a musician and composer. In fact, the country's national anthem was actually written by him and whenever it is played Phaic Tănese will immediately stand and place one hand over each ear. His wife is the very overweight Suahm Luprang, his crown prince is the perverted Ferduk, his daughter is the also overweight (and embarrassed) Buk Phang, and his youngest son is Luat the Brooding, who was arrested for misusing a gun.\n\nAccording to the book, Phaic Tăn is a country situated in Indochina of South-east Asia. It is shown in the book's map as being bounded to the south by the Lhong Chuk Sea and the Pong and Kut Rivers to the north and east respectively.\n\nPhaic Tăn is depicted as being roughly 650 kilometres abroad from east-west at its broadest point and the same distance from its far geographical north-east tip to the Pong Delta in the country's south-east.\n\nThe country is divided by several rivers, including the Sirikan, Upper Kut and the Nahkthong. The country's major rivers are the Pong and Nahkthong, which both finish in the Pong and Nahkthong Deltas respectively.\n\nPhaic Tăn is made up of four provinces (going in order clockwise), Sukkondat, Pha Phlung, Buhng Lung and Thong On. The provinces are connected by roads, but not by rail, as rail gauges vary throughout the country and sometimes even on the same line.\n\nIn one page the country's location is contradicted from being in Indochina to being between North and South Korea.\n\nThe capital city of Phaic Tăn is Bumpattabumpah, which is situated in Buhng Lung in a roughly central position on the Pong River and at the west end of the Upper Kut River. Bumpattabumpah is Phaic Tăn's largest city, and presumably the most populous.\n\nAccording to the book, Bumpattabumpah means \"water convergence\" and refers to the fact that the city is situated where the country's main river, the Pong meets untreated effluent from a sewage treatment plant further upstream.\nAlso, Bumpattabumpah was previously named \"Phxux Xauan\" but was changed because a survey revealed that less than 12% of the population were able to pronounce it.\n\nAn in-book map of Bumpattabumpah shows the names of its suburbs, all English-language puns: Qic Phuk, Phlat Tiht and Dud Bhonk. Many of the names of the roads throughout the city are also English puns, as is the name of the city's and country's major airport, Phlat Chat Airport.\n\nHigh smog levels in the capital city mean that office blocks require no window tinting, a result of heavy amounts of air pollution. In 1997, developers announced plans to build the tallest office block in the world. Construction actually began but only a short while after the foundations were dug the Asian economic crisis hit, meaning the project was completely shelved. Bumpattabumpah now boasts the largest unfenced hole in the world.\n\nSukkondat is traditionally Phaic Tăn's poorest province, due to the infertility of its soil, lack of natural resources and high number of casinos. An agricultural province, farmers harvest hay in order to camouflage their true primary crop, opium. The capital of the province is Sloh Phan, which is located about ninety kilometres north-east of Gunsa Wah, Phaic Tăn's tallest peak, at 2150 metres in height. Despite the fact that Sukkondat receives less than 2% of all visitors to Phaic Tăn every year, this statistic hasn't stopped its local Tourism Bureau from declaring the province 'the place to be'.\n\nPha Phlung in the country's northeast is mountainous and renowned for its rainforests, waterfalls and mud-slides. Pha Phlung is traditionally known as the 'Land Of A Thousand Tigers' and while actual numbers may be closer to seven (counting five in the Lom Buak Grand Circus), nature walks through Pha Phlung are an excellent way to see nature and wildlife up close. The capital of this wet and humid province is Nham Pong.\n\nAccording to the book, Buhng Lung is a busy province where all car horns have cruise control, set to go off every ten seconds. The Pong Delta is located in the south-east of the Buhng Lung province. The capital city of Bumpattabumpah is located in the north of the province.\n\nThong On is an exotic province of which Pattaponga, located on the coast of Kru Kut Bay, is the capital. The coast is composed of many beaches. Of particular note is Zou Kow Bow Beach, which is said to have the whitest sand of any beach in the world. The beach sand's whiteness was formed in the 1980s by the rare combination of global warming and a huge spill from a tanker carrying laundry bleach.\n\nThe Phaic Tănese flag has the design of a ping-pong (table tennis) table. It is known as the Phing Pong, and is noted to be the world's only hinged flag, which while unconventional, \"makes flag-folding ceremonies easier\".\n\nThe Phaic Tănese language is a tonal language with four tones, sharing similarities with Chinese. There is also a fifth tone emerging, but this tone is largely restricted to use by rappers. It is spoken with an average of 192 syllables per minute.\n\nThe Phaic Tăn website features a spoof soap opera called \"Pyangtru Yix Qaugen\" (Hospital of Hearts), in which the characters (Doctor Lahbkot, 3-star General Kpow and his much younger millionairess wife) speak in what appears to be a dialect of Chinese spoken in Taiwan and parts of Fujian, Vietnamese and some heavily accented garbled sounds made to resemble Korean, subtitled in a stilted form of English, with curious turns of phrase and double entendres. This is a parody of the English subtitles often encountered on kung fu movies, or an attempt at Engrish.\n\n\nThis book advertises other (fictional) travel guides on the industrialized Costa del Pom (Iberia), Pfaffland (Scandinavia), unappetizing Gastronesia (South Asia), Sherpastan (the Himalayas), and Cartelombia (South America), as well as such specialized guides as \"Travel for Germans\", \"Family Vacations\", \"Cycling the World\", \"Hair Raising Drives\", \"Arduous Walks\", \"Travel for Seniors\", \"Tax Havens\", and \"Let's Go Game Hunting\". It also advertises its rather corrupt website.\n\n\n"}

Circuits have all held that a qualified reporter's privilege exists. In the recent case of \"U.S. v. Sterling\", the Fourth expressly denied a reporter's privilege exists under \"Branzburg\". Furthermore, forty states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes called shield laws protecting journalists' anonymous sources.\n\nThe United States Department of Justice created self-imposed guidelines intended to protect the news media by regulating the use of subpoenas against the press. These guidelines state that the government \"should have made all reasonable attempts to obtain the information from alternative, non-media sources” before considering issuing a subpoena to a member of the news media. Furthermore, the guidelines require that federal prosecutors negotiate with the press, explaining the specific needs of the case.\n\nBefore any subpoena may be issued, the attorney general must approve the issuance. The attorney general’s review for a subpoena to a member of the news media shall be based on the following criteria:\n\nWhile these guidelines seem extremely protective of the press, they explicitly deny the creation of “any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law.” Nor does the policy have any substantive punishment for the federal government violations. If the federal prosecutors fail to obtain approval from the attorney general, the extent of the authorized punishment is “an administrative reprimand or other appropriate disciplinary action.” In fact, some courts have found that the guidelines “create no enforceable right.” Therefore, in circuits taking this approach, the news media have no right to appeal for enforcement of these policies before being compelled to testify.\n\nThe issue of a reporter's privilege came to the forefront of media attention in the 2005 case\" In re Miller\", involving reporters Judith Miller and Matthew Cooper. Miller and Cooper were both served with grand jury subpoenas for testimony and information, including notes and documents pertaining to conversations with specific and all other official sources relating the Plame affair. Both refused to submit to the subpoenas, claiming a reporter’s privilege. The federal district court held both Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the orders of contempt.\n\nMiller and Cooper, in their appeal to the appellate court pleaded several defenses including a First Amendment reporter’s privilege and a common law reporter’s privilege. The appellate court rejected both the First Amendment and common law claims for privilege. The court held Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court and sentenced both to eighteen months of jail time. The sentence was stayed pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case. Judith Miller began serving the remaining four months of the original eighteen-month sentence on July 6, 2005. Matthew Cooper’s confidential source released him from their confidentiality agreement, so he chose to comply with the subpoena and has agreed to testify before the grand jury.\n\nIn 2004, two significant bills were introduced in the United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate to create a federal shield law. The first bill was introduced in identical form in both the Senate and the House by Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Representative Mike Pence (R-IN). Senator Christopher Dodd introduced separate legislation that created a seemingly broader protection than the Pence/Lugar bill.\n\nIn 2006, Rodney A. Smolla testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the topic of reporter's privilege.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, in a reaction to the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, John Ensign (R-NV) introduced S.4004 to amend section 798 of title 18, United States Code, to provide penalties for disclosure of classified information related to certain intelligence activities and for other purposes. While titled the SHIELD Act, the proposed legislation has little in common with shield laws in the United States.\n\n"}

It is located in the east quarter of Bab Diwan. The top of the minaret offers a panoramic view of the facade of the medina facing the sea. The choice of this location for the building is linked to the close relationship between the family of the saint who is buried there, Sidi Amar Kammoun, and the sea, since his father was a sailor (rais in Tunisian dialect).\n\nThe mausoleum was founded in the 18th century by order of Murad II Bey (1666-1675) to express gratitude to Sidi Amar Kammoun who treated him for a disease he got during one of his official visits to Sfax. The minaret was added later between 1636 and 1666 in two stages by Sidi Amar Kammoun, who himself took in charge all the expenses of his construction thanks to his personal fortune.\n\nApart from its religious and spiritual role, the mausoleum provides a very important defensive role during several crises thanks to its strategic geographical situation which allows the surveillance of the coastal facade of the medina from the minaret not only during a conflict with Sicily but also during the conquest of Tunisia by France.\n\nComparing to the other mausoleums of the medina, Sidi Amar Kammoun mausoleum differs by the hybrid architecture of its minaret which combines both the old local style and Moroccan influences imported by the Hafsids and the Ottomans.\n\nThe minaret, of square shape, culminates at a height of 9,30 meters. Its summit is equipped with a platform crowned with merlons2.\n\nThe north facade of the minaret is decorated with two rectangular commemorative plaques, contiguous just below the engraved calligraphy band. The right plate measures 49 cm high and 25 cm long, while the left, which is currently at risk of losing all its details, is 50 cm high and 25 cm long. The texts of nine lines each are written with a partially punctuated Tunisian style. Apart from these plates, the facades are richly decorated with moldings, serrations and architectural elements.\n\nSidi Amar Kammoun represents one of the most important icons of Sfaxian Sufism of the 18th century. Nowadays, it still keeps very important place in the Sfaxian community. Mahmoud Megdiche has devoted a big part of his book \"Nouzhat El Antha\"r (Arabic: نزهة الأنظار) to highlight his qualities and accomplishments.\n\nHe received much of his education from his master, Sheikh Sidi Ameur El Mzoughi, and was very close to Murad II Bey.\n"}

The series was written by Gardner Fox and was drawn by Carmine Infantino for almost the whole series.\n\n\"Space Museum\" first appeared in the story \"The World of Doomed Spacemen\" in \"Strange Adventures\" #104 (May 1959), written by creator Gardner Fox under the editorship of Julius Schwartz. The series of 8-page stories was published in rotation with two others, \"The Atomic Knights\" and \"Star Hawkins\", and appeared in every third issue of \"Strange Adventures\" from #106 - 157 (July 1959 - October 1963), with one last story, \"Space Museum of the Dead World,\" in issue #161 (February 1964) - a total of 20 stories. With the exception of the first tale, which was drawn by Mike Sekowsky and Bernard Sachs, all the other Space Museum stories were drawn by Carmine Infantino. Only the initial story featured on the cover of \"Strange Adventures\".\n\nStory Listing\n\nIssue Title\n\nThe first three \"Space Museum\" stories were reprinted in the DC Comics science fiction reprint anthology, \"From Beyond the Unknown\" #23 -25 (July/August 1973 - November/December 1973), but the title was then cancelled. Eighteen years later writer Gerry Conway re-introduced the Space Museum concept in \"The Secret that Time Forgot\" in \"Justice League of America\" #206 (September 1982), and in 1984 writer Paul Kupperberg followed in \"The New Adventures of Superboy\" #50 (February 1984), this in a 30th-century Legion of Superheroes framing sequence by Keith Giffen around a modern-day Superboy story by Kurt Schaffenberger. Two years later Dan Jurgens returned to the original 25th century Space Museum for the location of Booster Gold's origin story. With the exception of the retrospective origin story of the Museum, \"The Startling Secret of The Space Museum\" in \"Secret Origins\" #50 (August 1990) by editor Mark Waid and Gerard Jones (with Carmine Infantino again returning to the artwork), and two stories set in the Museum - \"When Robots Attack\" in \"Legionnaires\" #68 (Feb 1999) by Roger Stern and Tom McGraw, and \"Booster Gold\" #0 (April 2008) - the few other references since have all been in retellings of or allusions to Booster Gold's origin.\n\n\"Space Museum\" in \"Strange Adventures\" was an anthology series set in the 25th century featuring mainly unlinked heroic tales of outer space adventure; with a regular framing sequence that opens and closes each episode with the only continuing characters - Howard Parker and his young son Tommy (and on three occasions his mother) making their monthly visit to the Space Museum, later established as being in Metropolis. It is a museum dedicated to showcasing the history of five centuries of human space travel, and features many exhibits in transparent display cases, each artifact from an adventure an Earth space traveller had had in outer space. The objects in the display cases are often ordinary, although somehow they were used to either save the Earth or some other planet from disaster: \"Behind every object in the Space Museum there's a tale of heroism, daring, self sacrifice.\" During these visits Tommy always asks his father about one exhibit in particular, and Howard Parker then tells his son the story behind that exhibit, including:\n\nOnly one tale does not fit into the normal narrative sequence, when Tommy and two of his friends in the Interplanetary Boy Scouts, using the skills Tommy has learned from the heroic stories he has been told, rescue Earth from aliens bent on stealing all its energy, and also rescue the Space Museum, which has been stolen by them.\n\nIt is eventually revealed that the founding of the Space Museum, on the site of an old Military Surplus warehouse where hundreds of years worth of space history has piled up, came about because Tommy's father was a Space Marine guard there, and he \"liberated\" some of the momentoes, keeping them in his military footlocker. Because of his knowledge of space history, Tommy's father recognizes aliens who had attacked Earth before trying again (by pretending to be scrap dealers and taking the artifacts from the warehouse to use as weapons against humanity). He is able to use the objects he has saved to stop the aliens, although demolishing the warehouse at the same time. His earlier wish (\"People in my time have become jaded, bored with space travel. If only they were exposed to the heroism of Earth's star-spanning pioneers, their sense of adventure might be awakened.\") is fulfilled when the military realize the value of \"historical consciousness\" and create the Space Museum on the site.\n\nThe Space Museum also figures prominently in the origin of the superhero Booster Gold. In 2462 Michael Carter, a disgraced ex-football player is working as a night watchman in the Museum, and studies the history. He deactivates and steals Skeets, a robot Museum guard with an encyclopaedic knowledge of 20th century Earth history, together with an alien power suit, some power gloves and control bands, mystic power rods, a Legion Flight Ring, a forcefield belt, a credit card and other unspecified items from the displays, and escapes in Rip Hunter's Time Sphere, a time travel device from the 1960s, to journey back to the 1980s, become a superhero, and get rich and famous on the franchising opportunities.\n\nAs an adult Tommy Parker took his own son Gardner to the Museum and told him a story of the exhibits, something he had hoped for years before. At some later point Ultra the Multi-Alien is known to have searched for the cosmic staff of Prince Gavin, Starman, as an artifact for the Museum.\n\nBy 2984 the Space Museum has been renamed \"The Museum of Heroes and Legends\", and has a whole wing dedicated to The Legion of Superheroes, as well as one to Earth's historical superheroes. That year one of the \"Dial H for Hero\" H-Dials is stolen from the museum by a petty crook while Chameleon Boy is attending a ceremony there. The villain escapes to 1984 with the help of the Dial, which is ripped to pieces by Krypto the Superdog before eventually being returned to the Museum in pieces by Chameleon Boy, where the Curator reveals they have another one. The Museum appears to have been renamed the \"Time and History Museum\" some time later, and it is partly demolished by Xotar the Conqueror, a minor Justice League of America foe, on a mission to conquer the 30th century\n\nIn the non-continuity series \"Twilight\" by Howard Chaykin, in the 22nd century Karel Sorensen of the Star Rovers creates a Church in her name and headquarters it at the Space Museum.\n\n\n"}

The tradition of the archive dates back to the late 13th century, when Speyer became a Free Imperial Town of the Holy Roman Empire in 1294. \n\nNow it is one of the oldest offices in Speyer. In addition to a large number of historically important documents and archives, it also offers today a large collection of photo and newspaper collections, \n\nThe most important documents were kept in the so-called \"Rote Lade\". This \"red box\" is a massive metal cabinet with a complicated closing mechanism. It is still in the city archives and one of the unique items, which are shown in regularly changing exhibitions in the city archives. The key to this archive was in the custody of municipal officials. The \"Archivarius\", the municipal archivist belonged to the city councilors or the syndics.\n\nThe beginnings of the archives of the imperial city of Speyer were already published in the 14th / 15th century. On December 18, 1498, emperor Maximilian I asked the council of the city of Speyer to send him the oldest German document in the original from his archive. Other personalities, such as Christoph Lehmann (1568–1638), a municipal clerk and writer of a chronicle, also used the archive intensively. Later, his meaning receded, and only a few connoisseurs knew about him. Between 1527 and 1689, Speyer had been the seat of the \"Reichskammergericht\" (Imperial Chamber Court). \n\nThus, over time, the rumor grew that the sources of the city's history had been lost during the demolition of Speyer in the Nine Years' War (1689). In fact the city archives had been fled to Frankfurt and Strasbourg and they had been kept in a completeness, as they can not show too many cities in this German region. The remaining documents had been stored since 1726 in the then new townhall. The historical archive magazine with its transportable wall cabinets is still preserved today.\n\nIn 1816 Speyer became the capital of the Bavarian Palatinate, which was one of the administrative districts of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The administration of the archive was assigned to an official of the Royal District Archives, Speyer, as a salaried office. As a result of the care provided by specialists, there was a change in the order, the preservation and the use of the archival materials. In 1909 the city archives the move to the new fire-resistant magazine took place.\n\nIn March 1995, the Stadtarchiv finally moved to its present premises in Johannesstrasse 22a. This former factory building was previously used by the Pfälzische Landesbibliothek.\n\nSince 1995, the \"Memory of the City\" is owner of a large reading room, which is also used as a lecture room, as well as two magazines and office spaces. Through the participation in the DFG project \"Virtual German Urkundennetzwerk\" (VdU), in which all documents have been digitized, the user has the opportunity to view Speyer documents in the virtual archive \"Monasterium\". The archive is currently also involved in the EU project \"European network on archival cooperation\" (\"ENArC\"), as well as in the interregional project \"Archivum Rhenanum\".\n\nIn addition, the City Archives Speyer regularly offer changing exhibitions, which inform about old and new stocks and innovations. Since 2011, the Stadtarchiv Speyer, which is active on Twitter, Facebook and Slideshare among others, belongs to the comparatively few German archives, which are intensively engaged in Web 2.0.\n\nAs a result of a restructuring of the departments of the City Administration of Speyer, the Stadtarchiv has been operating since May 2012 as its own department: \"Abteilung Kulturelles Erbe (Stadtarchiv, Museen, Gedenkstätten)\", \"Department of Cultural Heritage (City Archives, Museums, Memorials)\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4515396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4515396", "title": "Stormbreaker (film)", "text": "Stormbreaker (film)\n\nStormbreaker (titled Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker in the United States) is a 2006 action spy film directed by Geoffrey Sax. The screenplay by Anthony Horowitz is based on his 2000 novel \"Stormbreaker\", the first novel in the \"Alex Rider\" series. The film stars Alex Pettyfer as Alex Rider, and also stars Mickey Rourke, Bill Nighy, Sophie Okonedo, Alicia Silverstone, Sarah Bolger, Stephen Fry and Ewan McGregor. \"Stormbreaker\" was an international co-production between companies and financiers from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany.\n\nThe film's plot follows a teenage boy who is recruited by MI6 after his uncle, a secret agent, is killed in action. He is sent on a mission in Cornwall to gather intelligence behind \"Stormbreaker\", an advanced computer system being provided to schools across Britain, and its creator, billionaire Darrius Sayle.\n\nIntended to be the first entry in a film franchise, \"Stormbreaker\" grossed between $20.7 and $23.9 million worldwide upon its theatrical release, failing to recoup its $40 million budget and making the film a box office bomb. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film was largely criticised for its lack of originality and believability. As a result of these factors, plans to produce further \"Alex Rider\" films were dropped.\n\nAlex Rider is a 14-year-old schoolboy who lives with his uncle Ian and their housekeeper Jack Starbright. Ian is supposedly a bank manager and is, much to Alex's regret, often away from home. One day, Alex is told that his uncle has died in a car crash, but quickly discovers that his uncle was in fact a spy working for MI6 and was murdered.\n\nHe is then recruited by his uncle's former employers, Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones of the Special Operations Division of MI6, who explain to Alex that his uncle has been training him as a spy. Alex initially refuses to cooperate but agrees when they threaten to not renew the visa and deport Jack as a result of her visa running out seven years before. Alex is then sent to a military training camp in the Brecon Beacons, the home of the Special Air Service. At first, his fellow trainees look down on him because of his age, but he soon gains their respect for his capabilities.\n\nHe sets off on his first mission, aided by gadgets from Smithers. Billionaire Darrius Sayle is donating free high-powered computer systems codenamed \"Stormbreaker\" to every school in the United Kingdom. MI6 are suspicious of his seemingly generous plans and send Alex undercover as a competition winner to investigate. There, he meets Sayle himself and his two accomplices, Mr. Grin and Nadia Vole, and is shown the \"Stormbreaker\" computer in action. Later, while Alex is having dinner with Sayle, the suspicious Vole steals Alex's phone and tracks the SIM card to his house in Chelsea. She goes there and finds Alex's true identity; while there, she is disturbed by and consequently fights Jack. Despite being outclassed, Jack wins with the help of a blowfish, leaving Nadia to flee the scene. That night, Alex sneaks out of his bedroom window to observe a midnight delivery of mysterious containers to Sayle's lair.\n\nThe next day, Alex finds himself in trouble when his cover is blown. After attempting to escape from the facility, he is captured, and Sayle explains his true reasons behind \"Stormbreaker\" – each system contains a modified strain of the smallpox virus which, upon activation in the \"Stormbreaker\" release, will kill all of the country's schoolchildren. Sayle leaves Alex tied up and departs for the London Science Museum. Nadia drops Alex into a water-tank to be killed by a giant Portuguese Man o' War, but he escapes using the metal-disintegrating spot cream supplied by Smithers, Nadia is subdued when she is hit by the jellyfish, rupturing the tank in the process. Alex then hitches a ride on a Mil Mi-8 helicopter piloted by Mr. Grin, using a sodium pentothal arrow to gain Mr. Grin's obedience. Alex parachutes out of the helicopter and lands just as the Prime Minister is about to press the button which will activate the computers. Alex uses a rifle to shoot the podium, which destroys the button, and ruins Sayle's plan.\n\nFurious, Sayle leaves to carry out his back-up plan, and Alex, with the help of school friend Sabina Pleasure pursues Sayle through the streets of London. Fifty floors up on one of Sayle's skyscrapers, Alex reaches him and unplugs his backup transmitter. Sayle chases him out onto the roof and pushes both Alex & Sabina off the roof, leaving them hanging by a dislodged cable. Unexpectedly, Yassen arrives in a helicopter and shoots Sayle (in the same manner he did Ian) before rescuing Alex. Yassen then tells Alex that Sayle had become an embarrassment to his employers, and that Alex should forget about him, but Alex refuses saying that the killing of his uncle Ian means they are still enemies.\n\nAlex returns to school; he and Sabina are talking about what happened and he says that it will never happen again. The film ends with someone observing Alex from a distance. He notices it and realizes that it's not the end.\n\n\n\"Stormbreaker\" was intended by the novel's author, Anthony Horowitz, to be the first entry in a film franchise based on his \"Alex Rider\" series. Horowitz, already an established and prolific screenwriter in British television, wrote the screenplay and worked very closely throughout the film's production with director Geoffrey Sax and producers Marc and Peter Samuelson. The Weinstein Company acquired the North American rights to the film, which was filmed in Summer 2005 with six weeks on the Isle of Man and a further six weeks in London. Some of the scenes of the school were filmed in The Grey Coat Hospital and Ballakermeen High School, Douglas, Isle of Man.\n\nIn 2005, Alex Pettyfer was cast as Alex Rider. He was picked out of 500 hopefuls who auditioned for the role. Pettyfer was originally offered a role in the then-upcoming film \"Eragon\" but turned it down, noting that he preferred \"Stormbreaker\" because it would be filmed nearer home while Eragon would film in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn June 2006, the producers signed a deal with Nintendo that made the Nintendo DS a prominent feature in the film, much like the Power Glove in \"The Wizard\". This is an upgrade from the Game Boy Color that Alex used in the novel version. In addition to the Nintendo marketing in the film, Alex's mobile phone is a Nokia 7710 and he uses a sodium pentothal pen to get to London, not a gun.\n\nIn August 2006, the film was retitled \"Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker\" for North American release. A new poster and trailer were released along with the announcement. It was also revealed that the US premiere would take place on the Intrepid aircraft carrier at the Hudson River, New York City.\n\nThe name of the villain also changed from Herod Sayle to Darrius Sayle, with his nationality switched from Lebanese (Egyptian in the US version of the novel) to American. This was because Mickey Rourke was already in talks to take on the role, so Horowitz adapted the character to suit him.\n\n\"Stormbreaker\" was distributed by Entertainment Film Distributors in the United Kingdom, where the film made $2,313,496 on its opening weekend, well below its expected target of blockbuster status. The film's grosses gradually declined each week for the remainder of its run, totalling of $12,872,046, making up more than half of what would become the film's final worldwide gross. In the United States, the film was distributed by The Weinstein Company in 221 theatres and grossed $215,177, with an average of $973 per screen and ranking No. 27 during its opening weekend. The film earned $677,646 in the United States and $23,260,224 internationally for a total of $23,937,870 on an estimated budget of $40 million. The Numbers reported a worldwide gross of $20.7 million. In Germany, the film was given a direct-to-video release.\n\nIn a 2007 interview for Reuters, Horowitz blamed \"Stormbreaker\"s financial failings on The Weinstein Company's handling of the film's distribution on the American market, particularly their decision to not give it a wide release. According to the writer, \"Harvey Weinstein decided not to distribute it. It is one of the most bizarre and annoying things that the film didn't get given its shot in America. To this day I don't know why.\"\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has a score of 34% based on 67 reviews with an average rating of 4.7 out of 10. The critical consensus states \"Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker is strictly children's fare, as it lacks originality, excitement, and believabiltity.\" The film also has a score of 42 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 20 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nBBC critic Neil Smith gave the film three out of five stars but criticised the \"unsubtle turns\" from both Bill Nighy and Stephen Fry. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" branded the film as \"a lame and disappointing affair\". Although likening it to both the \"Harry Potter\" and \"James Bond\" series, reviewer Ray Bennett said the film \"lacks any kind of suspense\" due to the script. He ended saying that \"Stormbreaker\" was unlikely to have a \"license to kill at the box-office\". \"Cinema Blend\" editor-in-chief Josh Tyler gave the film two and a half stars out of five, and said that, \"Most of the problems with \"Stormbreaker\" all boil down to believability.\" \"Boston.com\"s reporter Wesley Morris also gave \"Stormbreaker\" two stars out of five, and said that \"Geoffrey Sax's filmmaking holds few surprises... but it's swift and competent, despite too many shots of cars on roads that bloat the running time.\"\n\nPrior to or after \"Stormbreaker\"s theatrical release, Horowitz had written a screenplay based on \"Point Blanc\", but stated that the chances of further films based on the \"Alex Rider\" novels were \"fairly slim\" due to the film's underperformance at the box office. The Weinstein Company eventually cancelled their plans for a sequel, and Horowitz later expressed that the novels \"do not translate well to the big screen\".\n\n"}

Minister of Safety and Security (Women's Legal Centre Trust, as Amicus Curiae), an important case in the South African of law of delict as well as the country's criminal law, the appellant, Ghia Van Eeden, was assaulted, raped, and robbed by a known, dangerous criminal who had escaped from police custody. The court held that the state was obliged to protect individuals by taking active steps to prevent violations of the constitutional right to freedom and security of the person, \"inter alia\" by protecting everyone from violent crime. It was also obliged under international law to protect women specifically from violent crime.\n\nIn light of these imperatives, the court could no longer support the requirement of a special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant for the imposition of a legal duty; it held that the police have a duty to protect the public in general from known dangerous criminals in their custody.\n\n"}

The work also indicates the high esteem in which Duke Odo of Aquitaine was held, in contrast to the negative picture provided by the \"Continuations of Fredegar\", which were compiled on the instructions of Duke Childebrand, half-brother of Odo's rival Charles Martel.\n\n"}
