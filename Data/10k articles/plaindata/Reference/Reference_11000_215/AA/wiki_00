The parents had married the year before against the Kutzenok family's wishes. The Pilipovetskys moved at the age of six and he went to high school in Herzliya. In July 1921 his family were early settlers in the new city of Tel Aviv in Palestine (the land that was to become the State of Israel). He attended the University of Jerusalem graduating in History and Philosophy. He had been brought up with encyclopedias. His mother published the eight-volume \"General Enclopedia\". Peli's dream was to create a new encyclopedia in the language of Hebrew.\n\nIn 1944 a committee was formed to work out the aims and objectives of a project to create an encyclopedia in Hebrew. In 1948 work was started, and Chaim Weizmann was the first president of the project. He was also to be the first president of the new state of Israel.

Apotropaic observances may also be practiced out of vague superstition or out of tradition, as in good luck charms (perhaps some token on a charm bracelet), amulets, or gestures such as crossed fingers or knocking on wood. The Greeks made offerings to the \"averting gods\" (), chthonic deities and heroes who grant safety and deflect evil.\n\nApotropaic magical rituals were practiced throughout the ancient Near East and Egypt. Fearsome deities were invoked via ritual in order to protect individuals by warding away evil spirits. In ancient Egypt, these household rituals (performed in the home, not in state-run temples) were embodied by the deity who personified magic itself, Heka. The two gods most frequently invoked in these rituals were the hippopotamus-formed fertility goddess, Taweret, and the lion-demon, Bes (who developed from the early apotropaic dwarf demon-god, Aha, literally \"fighter\").\n\nObjects were often used in these rituals in order to facilitate communication with the gods. One of the most commonly found magical objects, the ivory apotropaic wand (birth tusk), gained widespread popularity in the Middle Kingdom (ca. 1550 – 1069 BCE). These wands were used to protect expectant mothers and children from malevolent forces, and were adorned with processions of apotropaic solar deities. Likewise, protective amulets bearing the likenesses of gods and goddesses like Taweret were commonly worn. Water came to be used frequently in ritual as well, wherein libation vessels in the shape of Taweret were used to pour healing water over an individual. In much later periods (when Egypt came under the Greek Ptolemies), stele featuring the god Horus were used in similar rituals; water would be poured over the stele and—after ritually acquiring healing powers—was collected in a basin for an afflicted person to drink.\n\nAmong the ancient Greeks, the most widely used image intended to avert evil was that of the Gorgon, the head of which now may be called the \"Gorgoneion\", which features wild eyes, fangs, and protruding tongue. The full figure of the Gorgon holds the apex of the oldest remaining Greek temple where she is flanked by two lionesses. The Gorgon head was mounted on the aegis and shield of Athena.\n\nEyes were often painted to ward off the evil eye. An exaggerated apotropaic eye or a pair of eyes were painted on Greek drinking vessels called \"kylikes\" (eye-cups) from the 6th century BCE. The exaggerated eyes may have been intended to prevent evil spirits from entering the mouth while drinking. Fishing boats in some parts of the Mediterranean region still have stylised eyes painted on the bows. The defunct Turkish budget airline, Fly Air, adopted the symbol \"nazar boncuğu\" (\"nazar bonjuk\") on the vertical stabilizer (fin) of its aeroplanes. The apotropaic Yiddish expression, \"\" (\"no evil eye\", , in modern Hebrew \"בלי עין הרע\"-\"Bli ein ha'ra\") is somewhat equivalent to the expression, \"Knock on wood.\"\n\nPeople believed that the doorways and windows of buildings were particularly vulnerable to the entry or passage of evil. On churches and castles, gargoyles or other grotesque faces and figures such as \"sheela na gigs\" and hunky punks were carved to frighten away witches and other malign influences. Figures may also have been carved at fireplaces or chimneys; in some cases, simple geometric or letter carvings were used for these. When a wooden post was used to support a chimney opening, this was often an easier material for amateur carving. To discourage witchcraft, rowan wood may have been chosen for the post or mantel.\n\nSimilarly the grotesque faces carved into pumpkin lanterns (and their earlier counterparts, made from turnips, swedes or beets) at Halloween are meant to avert evil: this season was \"Samhain\", the Celtic new year. As a \"time between times\", it was believed to be a period when souls of the dead and other dangerous spirits walked the earth. Many European peoples had such associations with the period following the harvest in the fall. (\"See also:\" Celtic calendar)\n\nMirrors and other shiny objects were believed to deflect the evil eye. Traditional English \"Plough Jags\" (performers of a regional variant of the mummers play) sometimes decorated their costumes (particularly their hats) with shiny items, to the extent of borrowing silver plate for the purpose. \"Witch balls\" are shiny blown glass ornaments, like Christmas baubles, that were hung in windows.\n\nItems and symbols such as crosses, crucifixes, silver bullets, wild roses and garlic were believed to ward off or destroy vampires.\n\nIn Ireland and Great Britain, magpies are traditionally thought to bring bad luck. Many people repeated various rhymes or salutations to placate them.\n\nA worn-out man's buckle shoe from the 18th century was found in the wainscoting of the Combination Room, St John's College, Cambridge. This was placed in the wall \"as an apotropaic item intended to ward off evil and bad luck.\" The discovery was interesting, because this kind of magic is a silent tradition in England. After the repairs were done to the wall, the shoe was re-interred along with some current coins, a custom when dealing with finds like this. Replacing the shoe and concealing it respects the original desire of the owner.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, \"phalloi\" were believed to have apotropaic qualities. Often stone reliefs would be placed above doorways, and three-dimensional versions were erected across the Greek world. Most notable of these were the urban monuments found on the island of Delos. Grotesque, satyr-like bearded faces, sometimes with the pointed cap of the workman, were carved over the doors of ovens and kilns, to protect the work from fire and mishap.\n\nA similar use of phallic representations to ward off the evil eye remains popular in modern Bhutan. It is associated with the 500-year-old Buddhist tradition of Drukpa Kunley. It is paralleled by other South Asian uses of the lingam symbol.\n\nIn Roman art, apotropaic imagery was a common theme. Envy was thought to bring bad luck to the person envied. To avoid envy, Romans sought to incite laughter in their guests by using humorous images. Images such as large phalluses (see \"fascinus\"), deformities like hunchbacks, or Pygmies and other non-Roman subjects were common. Romans saw deformity as comical and believed that such images could be used to deflect the evil eye.\n\nIn Europe, apotropaic figureheads carved onto the prow of sailing ships are considered to have been a replacement for the sacrifice of a thrall during the Age of Invasions by Saxon and Viking sailors, to avoid bad luck on the voyage. Dredging of the Thames under London Bridge led to the discovery of a large number of bent and broken knives, daggers, swords and coins, from the modern period and dating back to Celtic times. This custom seems to have been to avoid bad luck, particularly when setting off on a voyage. Similarly, the burial of an old boot or shoe by the lintel of the back door of a house seems to have had a similar intention.\n\nApotropaic marks such as the initials of the Virgin Mary were scratched near the openings of buildings in England to ward off witches.\n\nIt is difficult to differentiate between items supposed to avert evil and items intended to attract good fortune, but generally a talisman brings good luck whereas an amulet wards off or protects against and is therefore apotropaic.\nIn Western culture, a horseshoe was often nailed up over, or close by, doorways, normally with the ends pointing upwards; it is said to collect good luck, or to stop the luck from falling out (see Oakham's horseshoes). Model horseshoes (of card or plastic) are given as good-luck tokens, particularly at weddings, and small paper horseshoes feature in confetti.\nIrish Travelers and Roma often sell white heather to \"bring good luck\". (Sometimes white sea-lavender, a species of \"Limonium\", is sold instead.)\n\nIn Ireland, St Brigid's crosses, woven from rush, were kept indoors (in houses and animal houses) to keep away illness for the year.\n\nIn some Native American cultures, a dreamcatcher made of yarn like a web is placed above a bed or sleeping area to protect sleeping children from nightmares.\n\nAshkenazi Jews' apotropaic names were often given not at birth but during serious illness. An example is Nekras (\"Некрас\", \"not handsome\" in Russian), with the hope the child would be handsome, and Yiddish names Alter and Alte (\"old\").\n\nAmong Serbian names are many apotropaic names (\"zaštitna imena\", \"protective names\"), such as Vuk (and its many derivatives) and Staniša.\n\nSome traditional Taiwanese names referenced domestic animals such as \"buffalo\" (水牛) and \"dog\" (狗, 犬), or humble elements of the landscape like \"soil\" and \"water\" (土, 水). They conveyed contentment with a peaceful and low-profile life.\n\n\n"}

The celebration features \"Busó\"s (people wearing traditional masks) and includes folk music, masquerading, parades and dancing. Busójárás lasts six days, usually during February.

{"id": "3176113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3176113", "title": "Chain migration", "text": "Chain migration\n\nChain migration is a term used by scholars to refer to the social process by which migrants from a particular town follow others from that town to a particular destination. The destination may be in another country or in a new location within the same country. Chain migration can be defined as a “movement in which prospective migrants learn of opportunities, are provided with transportation, and have initial accommodation and employment arranged by means of primary social relationships with previous migrants.” Or, more simply put: \"The dynamic underlying 'chain migration' is so simple that it sounds like common sense: People are more likely to move to where people they know live, and each new immigrant makes people \"they\" know more likely to move there in turn.\"\n\nDifferent groups of immigrants have employed chain migration among the different strategies used to enter, work, and live in the various republics of the Americas throughout their history. Social networks for migration are universal and not limited to specific nations, cultures, or crises. One group of immigrants to the British colonies in North America (and later the United States) was African slaves brought over forcibly; the circumstances of their migration do not fit the criteria of chain migration of free labor. Other groups, such as Germans fleeing chaos in Europe in the mid-1800s, Irish fleeing famine in Ireland in the same years, Eastern European Jews who emigrated from the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and Italians and Japanese escaping poverty and seeking better economic conditions in the same period, did use chain migration strategies extensively, with resulting \"colonies\" of immigrants from the same villages, towns, and cities settling in enclaves in such cities as Boston, New York, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Toronto, Montreal, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Havana from the mid-1800s through the mid-1900s. \n\nItalian immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century relied on a system of both chain and return migration. Chain migration helped Italian men immigrate to such cities as New York in the United States and Buenos Aires in Argentina for work as migrant laborers. Italians generally left Italy due to dire economic conditions and returned wealthy by Italian standards after working in the Americas for a number of years. Italian immigrants were called \"ritorni\" in Italy and grouped with other Southern and Eastern European migrant laborers under the term “birds of passage” in America. However, after the passage in the United States of the Immigration Act of 1924, return migration was limited and led more Italians to become naturalized citizens. The networks that had been built up by information and money due to chain and return migration provided incentives for Italian permanent migration. Mexican migration to the United States from the 1940s to the 1990s followed some of the same patterns as Italian immigration. \n\nWhile immigrants to the United States from European nations during the period before the McCarran–Walter Act of 1952 were able to immigrate legally if with relative levels of ease depending on country of origin, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 barred almost all Chinese from immigrating to the United States. Nonetheless, many Chinese immigrants arrived in America by obtaining false documents. The Chinese Exclusion Act allowed the Chinese Americans already settled in the United States to stay and provided for limited numbers of family members of Chinese Americans to immigrate with the correct paperwork. This loophole and the fateful 1906 earthquake that destroyed San Francisco’s public records provided Chinese immigrants, almost entirely men, with the potential to immigrate with false documents stating their familial relationship to a Chinese American. These Chinese immigrants were called “paper sons,” because of their false papers. “Paper sons” relied on networks built by chain migration to buy documentation, develop strategies for convincing authorities on Angel Island of their legal status, and for starting a life in America.\n\nThe information and personal connections that lead to chain migration lead to transplanted communities from one nation to another. Throughout the history of the Americas, ethnic enclaves have been built and sustained by immigration. Different ethnic groups claimed distinct physical space in city neighborhoods to provide a reception for chain migration and maintain the community network it created. Examples of this trend include the many neighborhoods called Kleindeutschland, Little Italy, and Chinatown throughout the United States. \n\nThe same was true of rural areas in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Some rural towns in the Midwestern United States and in southern Brazil were founded by immigrants and directly advertised in home countries. (Prominent examples include New Glarus, Wisconsin in the United States and Blumenau, Santa Catarina in Brazil.) This case was especially true for many agricultural German immigrants of the nineteenth century. Certain towns were built on a homogeneous group from a particular German principality. Additionally, many of these towns exclusively spoke German until the mid-1900s in the United States and the late 1900s in Brazil. These enclaves and their contemporaries represent the close relationship between family, community, and immigration.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, distinct Italian provinces and towns immigrated to the United States and Argentina via chain migration. Regional ties in Italy initially divided Italian ethnic identity in cities like New York and Buenos Aires, and certain enclaves included only Southern Italians or immigrants from Naples. The community ties remained strong with first generation immigrants concerning social life. These communities were originally composed of only men who immigrated for work. Once they had made enough money, many Italian men interested in settling began to bring their wives and families to their new homes in the Americas.\n\nThe effects of Chinese Exclusion and discrimination prevented Chinese residents from assimilating into United States society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Those factors, as well as social and cultural ties, precipitated the rise of Chinatowns as ethnic enclaves for Chinese Americans. Chain migration and the pseudo-familial nature of “paper sons” produced a relatively cohesive community that maintained ties with China.\n\nSingle, young, male laborers were initially the largest group using chain migration to the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. However, each immigrant group maintained a unique composition due to circumstances in home countries, goals of migration, and American immigration laws. \n\nFor example, Irish migration after 1880 had a 53.6% female majority, the only migrant group with that distinction. Irish men and women faced economic crisis, overpopulation, and problematic inheritance laws for large families, thereby compelling many of Ireland’s daughters to leave with her sons. Italian chain migration was initially wholly male based on intent to return, but became a source of family reunification when wives eventually immigrated. \n\nChinese chain migration was almost exclusively male until 1946, when the War Brides Act allowed Chinese wives of American citizens to immigrate without regard to Chinese immigration quotas. Before that time, chain migration was limited to “paper sons” and actual sons from China. The imbalanced sex ratio of Chinese immigrants was due to Chinese exclusion laws and the inability to bring current wives or to marry and return to the United States, inhibiting the corrective measure of chain migration. When immigrant groups react to economic pull factors in labor markets, chain migration via family has been used informally to balance out the gender ratio in ethnic immigrant communities.\n\nRemittances contribute to chain migration by aiding in both funding and interest in migration. Ralitza Dimova and Francois Charles Wolff argue that besides the recognized benefits remittances provide to the economies of the home countries of immigrants, money sent home can lead to chain migration. Dimova and Wolff posit that remittances can provide the necessary capital. H. van Dalen et al. “find that recipients of remittances are more likely to consider migrating than non-recipients. This study also references the fact that causes of chain migration through remittances tend to be variable but include such pull factors as family ties and the possibility of success.”\n\nBesides the monetary remittances sent to families in the home country, immigrants’ letters generally included valuable information about their new life, their work, and information to guide other prospective immigrants in the family or community to ease their journey. Understanding the necessary steps, whether it is what port to leave from or who to seek out to get a job and apartment, was and is vital for successful immigration.\n\nIt was common in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries for companies and even states to advertise to potential European immigrants in their home countries. These advertisements in magazines and pamphlets made information available for immigrants to find travel and decide where to settle once in the United States. Most of the advertising was done in the effort of settling the land in the Midwestern states in the wake of the Homestead Act of 1862. Consequently, many of the peoples whom this propaganda targeted were already living agricultural lives in Northern and Eastern Europe. Additionally, once the chain of migration had begun from a farm town in Europe, the pamphlets along with letters and remittances sent from America made migration an accessible opportunity for more and more of the people of that community. This chain eventually led to partial community transplantation and development of rural ethnic enclaves in the Midwest. \n\nOne example of this phenomenon is the chain migration of Czechs to Nebraska in the late nineteenth century. They were attracted by “glowing reports in Czech-language newspapers and magazines published [in Nebraska] and sent back home. Railroads, like the Burlington & Missouri Railroad, advertised large tracts of Nebraska land for sale in Czech. Many similar advertisements were read in German principalities at the same time, accounting for parallel chain migration to the Great Plains. While the pull factor of these advertisements represent the potential for chain migration, and did in fact produce it, they must be understood within the context of the push factors all potential immigrants weigh when determining to leave their home country. In the case of Czech chain migration to Nebraska and many other similar circumstances in Europe, the various push factors provided the impetus to leave but the pull factors provided by pamphlets and letters provided the chain migration structure to the eventual immigration.\n\nWhile the networks and effects of chain migration are in evidence regardless of laws limiting immigration, the changing goals and provisions of immigration legislation nonetheless affect how the system of chain migration works. Exclusion and quotas have affected who chain migration draws as potential immigrants as well as how immigrants deal with their status once in the new country. However, family reunification policies in immigration law have served to promote chain migration through extended family visas. \n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and its successors creating the Asiatic Barred Zone, and the National Origins quota system built by the Immigration Act of 1924 were effective in limiting chain migration but could not end it entirely. Chinese immigrants took advantage of loopholes and false documents to enter the United States until the McCarran—Walter Act of 1952 gave them a migration quota. \n\nOther migrant groups were limited in number by the National Origins quota system, which designated national quotas based on census ratios from 1890. These ratios heavily favored Western European nations and older migrant groups, such as the English, Irish, and Germans. The ratios attempted to limit the rising number of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. The National Origins quota system provided limited family reunification as a means for chain migration and placed a preference on naturalization. If an immigrant became a U.S. citizen, he or she had the ability to obtain non-quota visas for more family members, but as a resident that number was capped annually. Additionally, the Immigration Act of 1924 formally opened the door to chain migration from the entire western hemisphere, placing that group under non-quota status.\n\nThe abolition of the National Origins quota system came with the Hart–Celler Act of 1965. This legislation placed a heavy emphasis on family reunification, designating 74% of visas for that purpose. There was no limit on spouses, unmarried minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens. The percentages for family reunification were as follows: Unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens (20%), spouses and unmarried children of permanent residents aliens (20%), married children of U.S. citizens (10%), brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens over age 21 (24%). These new visa preferences created a swell of new chain migration and immigration in general. The Third World began to outpace European immigration to America for the first time in history, surpassing it by the end of the 1960s and doubling the numbers of European migration by the end of the 1970s.\n\nIn reaction to the flood of new immigrants brought by the Hart–Celler Act, and increasing numbers of undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Latin America, Congress attempted to reverse the consequences of the 1965 legislation by enforcing border patrol, using amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and proposing limits to family reunification policies. The effects of the ending the Bracero Program were increased undocumented Mexican migration because of the social capital gained during that period. Chain migration had provided relatively easy access to migration for Mexicans that the immigration legislation of the 1980s to the present has attempted to deal with.\n\nIn the United States, the term 'chain migration' is used by advocates of limiting immigration to partially explain the volume and national origins of legal immigration since 1965. U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (or \"Green card\" holders) may petition for visas for their immediate relatives including their children, spouses, parents, siblings. Advocates of immigration restriction believe the family unification policy is too permissive, leads to higher than expected levels of immigration, and what they consider the wrong type of immigrants. In its place, they favor increasing the number of immigrants with particular job skills. In practice, however, the wait times from when a family reunification petition is filed until the adult relative is able to enter the U.S. can be as long as 15–20 years (as of 2006). This is a result of backlogs in obtaining a visa number and visa number quotas that only allow 226,000 family-based visas to be issued annually. \n\nThere are four family-based preference levels, data valid as of June 2009:\n\n\nBacklogs in obtaining visa numbers range from four-and-a-half years (for preference level 2A) to 23-years (for preference level 4 immigrants from the Philippines).\n\nWhile some backlogs have remained relatively steady for some time, since 1995, backlogs for other family-sponsored preferences have steadily increased (see image to the right).\n\nAccording to James Coleman, “social capital…is created when the relations among persons change in ways that facilitate action.” Douglas Massey, Jorge Durand and Nolan J. Malone assert that “each act of migration creates social capital among people to whom the migrant is related, thereby raising the odds of their migration.” In the context of migration, social capital refers to relationships, forms of knowledge and skills that advance one’s potential migration. One example is the positive impact of social capital on subsequent migration in China. Massey et al. link their definition to Gunnar Myrdal’s theory of cumulative causation of migration, stating that, “each act of migration alters the social context within which subsequent migration decisions are made, thus increasing the likelihood of additional movement. Once the number of network connections in a community reaches a critical threshold, migration becomes self-perpetuating.”\n\nDuring the debate on immigration policy following Donald Trump's rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the use of the term \"chain migration\" became contentious.\n\n\n"}

In keeping with the cultural mandate, reconstructionists advocate theonomy and the restoration of certain biblical laws said to have continuing applicability. The movement declined in the 1990s and was declared dead in a 2008 \"Church History\" journal article, although Christian reconstructionist organizations such as the Chalcedon Foundation and American Vision are active today. Christian reconstructionists are usually postmillennialists and followers of the presuppositional apologetics of Cornelius Van Til. \n\nA Christian denomination that advocates the view of Christian reconstructionism is the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States. Most Reformed Christians, however, disavow Christian reconstructionism and hold to classical covenant theology, the traditional Reformed view of the relationship between the Old Covenant and Christianity.\n\nChristian reconstructionists advocate a theonomic government and libertarian economic principles. They maintain a distinction of spheres of authority between family, church, and state. For example, the enforcement of moral sanctions under theonomy is carried out by the family and church government, and sanctions for moral offenses are outside the authority of civil government (which is limited to criminal matters, courts and national defense). However, some believe these distinctions become blurred, as the application of theonomy implies an increase in the authority of the civil government. Reconstructionists argue, though, that under theonomy, the authority of the state is severely limited to a point where only the judicial branch exists (e.g., a homosexual does not fear of a police force breaking in their house at night, since, under theonomy, there is no executive branch and therefore no police). Reconstructionists also say that the theocratic government is not an oligarchy or monarchy of man communicating with God, but rather, a national recognition of existing laws. Prominent advocates of Christian reconstructionism have written that according to their understanding, God's law approves of the death penalty not only for murder, but also for propagators of all forms of idolatry, open homosexuals, adulterers, practitioners of witchcraft, blasphemers, and perhaps even recalcitrant youths (see the List of capital crimes in the Bible).\n\nConversely, Christian reconstructionism's founder, Rousas Rushdoony, wrote in \"The Institutes of Biblical Law\" (the founding document of reconstructionism) that Old Testament law should be applied to modern society, and he advocates the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence would include murder, homosexuality, adultery, incest, lying about one's virginity, bestiality, witchcraft, idolatry or apostasy, public blasphemy, false prophesying, kidnapping, rape, and bearing false witness in a capital case.\n\nKayser points out that the Bible advocates justice, and that biblical punishments prescribed for crimes are the \"maximum\" allowable to maintain justice and not the only available option, because lesser punishments are authorized as well.\n\nRousas Rushdoony wrote in his \"magnum opus\", \"The Institutes of Biblical Law\": \n\"The heresy of democracy has since [the days of colonial New England] worked havoc in church and state\"\nand: \"Christianity and democracy are inevitably enemies\", and he said elsewhere that \"Christianity is completely and radically anti-democratic; it is \"committed to spiritual aristocracy\",\" and characterized democracy as \"the great love of the failures and cowards of life\". He nevertheless repeatedly expressed his opposition to any sort of violent revolution and advocated instead the gradual reformation (often termed \"regeneration\" in his writings) of society from the bottom up, beginning with the individual and the family and from there gradually reforming other spheres of authority, including the church and the state.\n\nRushdoony believed that a republic is a better form of civil government than a democracy. According to Rushdoony, a republic avoided mob rule and the rule of the \"51%\" of society; in other words \"might does not make right\" in a republic. Rushdoony wrote that America's separation of powers between 3 branches of government is a far more neutral and better method of civil government than a direct democracy, stating \"[t]he [American] Constitution was designed to perpetuate a Christian order\". Rushdoony argues that the Constitution's purpose was to protect religion from the federal government and to preserve \"states' rights.\"\n\nDouglas W. Kennard, a Professor Theology and Philosophy at the Houston Graduate School of Theology, wrote with regard to Christian reconstructionism, that Christians of non-Reformed traditions, such as some \"Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, [and] Orthodox\", would be \"under threat of capital punishment as fostered by the extreme Theonomist.\" On the other hand, Ligon Duncan has stated that \"Roman Catholics to Episcopalians to Presbyterians to Pentecostals\", as well as \"Arminian and Calvinist, charismatic and non-charismatic, high Church and low Church traditions are all represented in the broader umbrella of Reconstructionism (often in the form of the \"Christian America\" movement).\"\n\nAlthough relatively small in terms of the number of self-described adherents, Christian reconstructionism has played a role in promoting the trend toward explicitly Christian politics in the larger American Christian right. This is the wider trend to which some critics refer, generally, as dominionism. They also allegedly have influence disproportionate to their numbers among advocates of the growth of the Christian homeschooling and other Christian education movements that seek independence from the direct oversight or support of the civil government. Because their numbers are so small compared to their influence, they are sometimes accused of being secretive and conspiratorial.\n\nIn Matthew 28:18, Jesus says, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\" This verse is seen as an announcement by Jesus that he has assumed authority over all earthly authority. In that light, some theologians interpret the Great Commission as a command to exercise that authority in his name, bringing all things (including societies and cultures) into subjection under his commands. Rousas Rushdoony, for example, interpreted the Great Commission as a republication of the \"creation mandate\", referring to Genesis 1:28\nFor Rushdoony, the idea of dominion implied a form of Christian theocracy or, more accurately, a theonomy. For example, he wrote that:\nElsewhere he wrote:\nAccording to sociologist and professor of religion William Martin, author of \"With God on Our Side\":\nMichael Horton of Westminster Seminary California has warned against the seductiveness of power-religion. The Christian rhetoric of the movement is weak, he argues, against the logic of its authoritarian and legalistic program, which will always drive reconstructionism toward sub-Christian ideas about sin, and the perfectibility of human nature (such as to imagine that, if Christians are in power, they won't be inclined to do evil). On the contrary, Horton and others maintain, God's Law can, often has been, and will be put to evil uses by Christians and others, in the state, in churches, in the marketplace, and in families; and these crimes are aggravated, because to oppose a wrong committed through abuse of God's law, a critic must bear being labeled an enemy of God's law.\n\nJ. Ligon Duncan of the Department of Systematic Theology of Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi, warns that \"Theonomy, in gross violation of biblical patterns and common sense, ignores the context of the giving of the law to the redemptive community of the Old Testament. This constitutes an approach to the nature of the civil law very different from Calvin and the rest of the Reformed tradition, which sees the civil law as God's application of his eternal standards to the particular exigencies of his people.\" Duncan rejects the reconstructionist's insistence that \"the Old Testament civil case law is normative for the civil magistrate and government in the New Covenant era\". He views their denial of the threefold distinction between moral, civil, and ceremonial law as representing one of the severe flaws in the reconstructionist hermeneutic.\n\nProfessor Meredith Kline, whose own theology has influenced the method of several reconstructionist theologians, has adamantly maintained that reconstructionism makes the mistake of failing to understand the special prophetic role of biblical Israel, including the laws and sanctions, calling it \"a delusive and grotesque perversion of the teachings of scripture.\" Kline's student, Lee Irons, furthers the critique:\n\nRodney Clapp wrote that reconstructionism is an anti-democratic movement.\n\nIn an April 2009 article in \"Christianity Today\" about controversial theologian and writer Douglas Wilson, the magazine described reconstructionism as outside the 'mainstream' views of evangelical Christians. It also stated that it \"borders on a call for outright theocracy\".\n\nGeorge M. Marsden, a professor of history at the University of Notre Dame, has remarked in \"Christianity Today\" that \"Reconstructionism in its pure form is a radical movement\". He also wrote, \"[t]he positive proposals of Reconstructionists are so far out of line with American evangelical commitments to American republican ideals such as religious freedom that the number of true believers in the movement is small.\"\n\nPopular religious author, feminist, and former Roman Catholic nun, Karen Armstrong sees a potential for \"fascism\" in Christian reconstructionism, and sees the eventual Dominion envisioned by theologians R. J. Rushdoony and Gary North as: \"totalitarian. There is no room for any other view or policy, no democratic tolerance for rival parties, no individual freedom.\"\n\nTraditional Reformed Christians have argued that Christian reconstructionists have \"significantly misunderstood the positions of Calvin, other Reformed teachers and the Westminster Confession concerning the relationship between the Sinai covenant's ethical stipulations and the Christian obligation to the Mosaic judicial laws today.\"\n\nSome sociologists and critics refer to reconstructionism as a type of dominionism. These critics claim that the frequent use of the word \"dominion\" by reconstructionist writers, strongly associates the critical term \"dominionism\" with this movement. As an ideological form of \"dominionism\", reconstructionism is sometimes held up as the most typical form of dominion theology.\n\nThe Protestant theologian Francis Schaeffer is linked with the movement by some critics, but some reconstructionist thinkers are highly critical of Schaeffer's positions and he himself disavowed any connection or affiliation with reconstructionism, though he did cordially correspond with Rushdoony on occasion. Authors Sara Diamond and Fred Clarkson suggest that Schaeffer shared with reconstructionism the tendency toward dominionism.\n\nChristian reconstructionists object to the \"dominionism\" and the \"dominion theology\" labels, which they say misrepresent their views. Some separate Christian cultural and political movements object to being described with the label \"dominionism\", because in their mind the word implies attachment to reconstructionism. In reconstructionism the idea of \"godly\" dominion, subject to God, is contrasted with the \"autonomous\" dominion of mankind in rebellion against God.\n\n\n\nhttps://chalcedon.edu/resources/books/the-nature-of-the-american-system\n"}

The circumstances of one's social class do not cause the onset of a mental disorder, but rather, an individual's deteriorating mental health occurs first, resulting in low social class attainment. The drift hypothesis is the opposing theory of the social causation thesis, which says being in a lower social class is a contributor to the development of a mental illness.\n\nA study by E. M. Goldberg and S. L. Morrison looked at the relationship between schizophrenia and social class. They wanted to find out if men, before they had been admitted to a mental hospital, drifted down the occupational scale to unskilled jobs because of their developing illness, or if it was because they were born into families with a lower social class attainment, that they developed their mental illness. They looked at men who had their first admission in a mental hospital between the ages of 25–34. They also looked at their fathers' occupation, in order to see if the social class they grew up in played a role in the development of schizophrenia. They found the men had grown up in families whose social class was similar to the general population. So the social class they grew up in did not seem to be a contributor to the development of their schizophrenia.\n\nThe main opposition to the drift hypothesis is the social causation thesis, which says social class position is causally related to the probability of mental illness. John W. Fox, from the University of Northern Colorado, conducted a study in 1990 that looked at previous studies concerning the relationship between social class and mental illness. These studies he looked at supported the drift hypothesis, but when he examined them, he found their conclusions were \"based on assumptions and methods that lacked empirical support.\" Another statement in Fox's study was, in studies done on social class and mental illness, \"identify drift as an individual's downward intergenerational social mobility after the onset of mental illness, rather than as residential drift from higher to lower class status areas\". So depending on what one's definition of drift hypothesis is, there will be data either to support or refute the validity of it.\n\nFrom an economic perspective of social class and mental illness, the social causation thesis is the ruling theory. People who are unemployed have been shown to have an increased amount of distress; have more physical health problems, which are often seen to be contributors of depression; and experience more frequent and more uncontrollable life events, which studies have shown increase the risk of developing some form of mental illness.\n\nWhen looking at the gender differences in people who have mental illnesses, women are overly represented. Women are also the majority of people who are in poverty. Deborah Belle, a professor at Boston University, did a literature review on poverty and women's mental health and examined the psychological stressors that poor women and mothers experience. \"A number of community studies conducted in the 1970s reported that mothers who were in financially strained circumstances were more likely to develop depressive symptoms than other women.\n\nThe reality is people who become mentally ill suffer a substantial loss of income. With this comes the need to accept public housing or food or utilities, if the person can find them. Often mentally ill people are unable to manage for themselves so a team of social workers has to intervene.\n"}

The series is named after a minor group in the War, a fictional time travelling cult / rebel group / organized crime syndicate originally created by author Lawrence Miles for BBC Books' \"Doctor Who\" novels.\n\nOriginally a subplot in the Eighth Doctor Adventures, the War involves several characters and concepts evolved from the original \"Doctor Who\" set-up. In several cases, the \"Faction Paradox\" series still features these groups, albeit with names changed for reasons both literary (most of the groups or items mentioned are described from different perspectives) and legal (the Faction and the Enemy are Miles's creations, but other elements are not — thus the Great Houses are the Faction Paradox range's equivalent to \"Doctor Who\"'s Time Lords). Faction Paradox themselves are \"not\" the enemy in this War, and play a neutral part, willing to act against both sides in their own interests. Lawrence Miles has described them as \"a ritualistic time-travelling guerrilla organisation\".\n\nThe semi-mythical founder of Faction Paradox is Grandfather Paradox, named after the grandfather paradox of time travel theory. Originally a member of the Great Houses himself, the Grandfather created a new group after he became frustrated with the ways of the Great Houses. Faction Paradox therefore takes a good deal of pleasure in irritating the Great Houses, and many of their traditions and rituals are aligned in direct opposition to the way the Great Houses do things. Their time machines are bigger on the inside, in much the same way as TARDISes are, and the familial titles its members use (eg \"Father\", \"Cousin\") reference family units which the Great Houses lost when they became sterile.\n\nFaction Paradox also take a perverse pride in causing time paradoxes (something that is against the laws of the Great Houses) and achieving impossible or absurd effects for their own sake. For instance, they typically wear ritual skull masks which are in fact the skulls of vampirised members of the Great Houses who, in the Great Houses' version of history, never existed. Their stronghold on Earth exists in a version of London, within what they call \"The Eleven-Day Empire\", bought from the British government in 1752. In that year, the British Empire first adopted the Gregorian calendar, and in so doing had to correct their dating scheme by 11 days (2 September 1752 being followed by 14 September 1752). Faction Paradox claimed the missing 11 days as their base (building on the illogicity that only the numbering scheme changed and no days were actually \"missing\").\n\nAfter a brief mention of Grandfather Paradox in the Virgin New Adventures novel \"Christmas on a Rational Planet\", Faction Paradox and the War in Heaven made their debut in BBC Books' Eighth Doctor novels.\n\nThe most relevant books to the \"Faction Paradox\" universe are\n\nSeveral other \"Doctor Who\" novels featured or referenced Faction Paradox, most notably \"The Ancestor Cell\" (written by Stephen Cole and Peter Anghelides in 2000), \"The Quantum Archangel\" (written by Craig Hinton in 2001), and \"The Gallifrey Chronicles\" (written by Lance Parkin in 2005), but were contradicted or otherwise ignored in the \"Faction Paradox\" series.\n\nA series of full-cast audio dramas dubbed \"The Faction Paradox Protocols\" was produced by BBV between 2001 and 2004. All were written by Lawrence Miles. These stories centred on two Cousins of the Faction, Justine and Eliza. (Justine had previously featured in the BBC novel \"Alien Bodies\", and Eliza appeared in \"Dead Romance\" as \"Christine Summerfield\".) The first two stories were set in the Eleven-Day Empire; the second two in 18th century London; and the last two were split between Justine's pre-Faction past and the Great Houses' prison facility. Although there were six releases and an ongoing story, each pair (usually released close together) formed a two-part story. In order they were:\n\n\nIn 2002 Mad Norwegian Press published a multi-author faux-encyclopedia to the first 50 years of the War in Heaven, edited by Faction Paradox creator Lawrence Miles, as a companion to the BBV audios. After the success of \"The Book of the War\", Mad Norwegian began publishing a \"Faction Paradox\" series of novels set in the same universe. These novels roam the ongoing War in Heaven; despite the series' name, the Faction and its members are not the focus, sometimes featuring only as minor characters, and sometimes not appearing at all. The books also featured characters from the \"Doctor Who\" novels, including Chris Cwej and Compassion.\n\n\nMad Norwegian also republished the Virgin New Adventures novel \"Dead Romance\" as part of their \"Faction Paradox\" line in 2003.\n\nIn 2003, the first two issues of a Faction Paradox comic were produced by Mad Norwegian and published by Image Comics. The series was subsequently cancelled. The comic was written by Lawrence Miles with art from Jim Calafiore and inks by Peter Palmiotti. It was set after the events of the War in Heaven, though due to its short run it did not give much detail on the post-War universe. It tied into events described in \"The Faction Paradox Protocols\", \"The Book of the War\", and \"The Adventuress of Henrietta Street\".\n\nIn 2004 Magic Bullet Productions, known for their \"Kaldor City\" audio dramas, obtained the license to produce further \"Faction Paradox\" audios, dubbed \"The True History of Faction Paradox\". The narrative of this series continued from \"The Faction Paradox Protocols\", although the first CD was also written to be accessible to newcomers. Like the BBV audios, these stories focused on Cousin Justine and Cousin Eliza, but the characters were recast.\n\nThe dramas in the series, released between 2005 and 2009, have featured guest stars including Julian Glover, Peter Miles, Philip Madoc and Gabriel Woolf. Woolf plays the ancient Egyptian god Sutekh, whom he had previously played in the 1975 \"Doctor Who\" story \"Pyramids of Mars\". The six titles are:\n\n\nIn 2007, New Zealand-based publisher Random Static announced they would be publishing further \"Faction Paradox\" novels. What turned out to be the sole title of the new range was published in January 2008. The cover art, by Emma Weakley, won the Sir Julius Vogel Award for Best Artwork in 2009.\n\nIn June 2010 Obverse Books acquired a license to produce collections of \"Faction Paradox\" short stories and longer fiction.\n\n\nIn 2012, Obverse Books launched a series of anthologies set in the City of the Saved, a setting first introduced and explored in the \"Faction Paradox\" series.\n\n"}
{"id": "332112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332112", "title": "Four-Corner Method", "text": "Four-Corner Method\n\nThe Four-Corner Method () is a character-input method used for encoding Chinese characters into either a computer or a manual typewriter, using four or five numerical digits per character. The Four-Corner Method is also known as the Four-Corner System.\n\nThe four digits encode the shapes found in the four corners of the symbol, top-left to bottom-right. Although this does not uniquely identify a Chinese character, it leaves only a very short list of possibilities. A fifth digit can be added to describe an extra part above the bottom-right if necessary.\n\nThe Four-Corner Method was invented in the 1920s by Wang Yunwu (王雲五), the editor in chief at Commercial Press Ltd., China. Its development was based mainly on contributions by the Russian scholar Otto Rosenberg in the early 20th century, as well as experiments by Lin Yutang and others. Its original purpose was to aid telegraphers in looking up Chinese telegraph code (CST) numbers in use at that time from long lists of characters. This was mentioned by Wang Yunwu in an introductory pamphlet called \"Sijiaohaoma Jianzifa\" in 1926. Introductory essays for this pamphlet were written by Cai Yuanpei and Hu Shi.\n\nThe four digits used to encode each character are chosen according to the \"shape\" of the four corners of each character, i.e. the upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right corners. The shapes can be memorized using a Chinese poem that Hu Shi composed, called \"Bihuahaoma Ge\", as a \"memory key\" to the system:\n\nIn the 1950s, lexicographers in the People's Republic of China changed the poem somewhat in order to avoid association with Hu Shi, although the contents remain generally unchanged. For various reasons, his name was \"unmentionable\" at the time the new version was composed. The 1950s version is as follows:\n\nSeveral other notes:\n\nThere have been scores, maybe hundreds, of such numerical and alpha-numerical systems proposed or popularized (such as Lin Yutang's \"Instant Index\", Trindex, Head-tail, Wang An's Sanjiahaoma, Halpern); some Chinese refer to these generically as \"sijiaohaoma\" (after the original pamphlet) though this is not correct.\n\nOver time, the Four-Corner Method has gone through some changes.\n\nThe first (revised) version was published in Shanghai in 1928. It was quickly adopted and popularized as a method for (among other things):\n\nThe Wang Yun-wu Da Cidian (Wang Yun-wu Ta Tz'u-tien) of 1928 was remarkable for its time, and although the pronunciations were very much in line with today's Standard Chinese, the lack of a phonetic index diminished its overall usefulness. The northern Mandarin pronunciations were given in the \"Guoyu Luomazi\", devised by linguist Zhao Yuanren, as well as in Mandarin Phonetic System (MPS) characters with a dotted corner for tone. It also delineated parts of speech, and all compounds were listed by the four-corner method as well. It was extremely modern. It used some arcane styles of characters as a citation form, and had a few errors and some important omissions.\n\nThe famed lexicographer and editor of \"Ciyuan\", Lu Erkui (Lu Er-k'ui), as well as other lexicographers, became early proponents of the Four-Corner Method. By 1931, it was used extensively by the Commercial Press to index virtually all classical reference works and collections of China, such as the Pei Wen Yun Fu and Si Ku Quan Shu, as well as many modern ones.\n\nHospital, personnel and police records were organized just like the biographical indexes and dynastic histories of former times. For a while (Nash, Trindex, 1930), it seemed that the Kang Xi Bushou (K'ang-hsi Pu-shou) 214 Radical System, left by the Qing (Ch'ing) Dynasty, was being replaced by the Four-Corner Method.\n\nInternationally, Harvard and other universities were using the method for their book collections, and the KMT Nanjing government (the main political and governmental body prior to 1949) seemed to have selected this numerical system as its standard. It was taught in primary schools to children in Shanghai and other locations during the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, up to the outbreak of general war with Japan in 1937.\n\nThe Four-Corner Method was extremely popular in government education circles to promote spoken language unification until pronunciation-based systems became fashionable in the mid-1930s.\n\nThe first large-scale project to promote spoken language unification was in 1936: Wang Li's 4-volume Mandarin Phonetic System (MPS) entry, Guoyu Cidian (Kuo-yu Tz'u-tien). In 1949 it was re-edited into the MPS Hanyu Da Cidian with Kang Xi 214 radical index, and a small Four Corner dictionary was available as the Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian of 1953. After 1949, limited use of MPS and the original Four-Corner Method continued under the People's Government, until the introduction of pinyin in 1958 and after. Today's Chinese dictionaries still contain MPS characters below each Pinyin class entry and sometimes in a phonetics chart in tables (Xinhua Cidian), while main entries are all in Hanyu Pinyin order. There is one all-sijiaohaoma small dictionary (Third Revision, below).\n\nA minor Second Revision was made during and just after World War II. This was used by most postwar lexicographers including Morohashi Tetsuji, who created his 12-volume Sino-Japanese dictionary, the Dai Kan-Wa jiten and included the Four Corner index among several other lookup methods. Oshanin (USSR) included a Four Corner index in his Chinese-Russian dictionary and in new China, an extraordinary project of the 25 Histories (Ershi wu shi) was published in the early 1950s with a Four Corner index volume containing the entire content.\n\nThen, in 1958, with the introduction of Pinyin, a small \"Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian\" was produced by the Beijing Commercial Press, but the rapid Han character simplification of the following years made the small (30,000 compound) book obsolete in China. Overseas and in Hong Kong, it remained popular for a number of years as a high speed key to phonetic dictionaries and indexes. It was used by those partly literate in Chinese or—in some areas—unfamiliar with Standard Chinese, especially Hanyu Pinyin.\n\nWang Yunwu produced a \"Xiao Cidian\" and \"Zonghe Cidian\" in the late 1940s. In Taiwan, \"Zonghe Cidian\" remains in print with an auxiliary section of rare characters. The telecode number, radical and stroke counts are shown for each character in a convenient size, but a phonetic index is still lacking. Also, it's all in traditional Chinese characters, and it contains a lot of obsolete information. Still, it is convenient for reading old Republic-period materials and literature, and as a handy finder for pronunciations.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the Four-Corner Method underwent a radical Third Revision during the compilation of the experimental volume of the Xiandai Hanyu Cidian, Commercial Press, Beijing, 1972. Another medium-sized dictionary, the Xinhua Zidian, appeared with this index as well, but in the late 1990s the four-corner index disappeared from newer editions. Both works now use only the Pinyin main entry and multi-door radical index systems that make it possible to look up a character with perhaps a wrong radical (i.e., characters appear redundantly under different radicals) and the number of strokes and variant forms are greatly reduced, and many more people are literate and capable of transcribing Mandarin Chinese with Pinyin. The use of stroke counting and radicals puts memorization of the character ahead of sheer speed in handling it. This method is more supportive of mass literacy than classical scholarship or processing and filing names or characters for the majority in China today. The four-corner method is ultimately for readers, researchers, editors and fileclerks, not for writers who seek a character that they know in speech or recitation. In China today, a new version of the excellent small \"Xin Sijiaohaoma Cidian\", soft cover from Commercial Press, Beijing, has been available since the late 1970s, updated in several new editions and printings. It uses the Third Revision and enjoys some popularity.\n\nThe main purpose of the original four-corner system today is in doing academic research or handling large numbers of characters, terms, index cards, or names. It is also used in computer entry, where a smaller list of items is created to browse from than with other systems. The Xinhua Zidian large type edition is available with a four-corner index for those whose failing eyesight precludes browsing and counting strokes.\n\nIn China today, many famous KMT period reference books and collections with four-corner indexes are being reprinted for sale to scholars and those interested in Old Chinese language or historical studies.\n\nThe four-corner method, in its three revisions, was supported by the Chinese state for a while, and is found in numerous older reference works and some still in publication. The small Kangorin Sino-Japanese Dictionary by Yoneyama had a four-corner index when it was introduced in the 1980s, but it has been since deleted.\n\nThe four-corner method is not in common usage in China or Taiwan today, although dictionaries with it are available in many bookshops and libraries for those who need or desire to learn or use it. It is identified, in public opinion, with the time when many Chinese were illiterate and the language was not yet unified; more Chinese today use the dictionary to help them write, not read. But it is useful for scholars, clerks, editors, compilers, and especially for foreigners who read Chinese.

In January 2011 some ministerial resignations from the Government were described by its opponent Michael Noonan as \"...bizarre, grotesque and to some extent unbelievable.\"\n\nThe murderer, Malcolm Edward MacArthur, born 17 April 1945, was a well-known eccentric character in Dublin social circles and never held a job, as he lived off his inheritance from the sale of his father's farm, after his death in 1974. However, as his money ran out, MacArthur decided to fund his lifestyle by robbery. First he decided to purchase a gun and responded to an advertisement by Dónal Dunne, a farmer in Edenderry, County Offaly, who had a shotgun for sale. However, having no transport and needing to get from Dublin to Edenderry, he decided to steal a car.\n\nOn 22 July 1982, a nurse named Bridie Gargan (aged 27) had been sunbathing in the Phoenix Park in Dublin during her time off work. MacArthur, intending to steal her car, bludgeoned her with a hammer. In the ensuing confusion, MacArthur drove off, leaving the dying Gargan on the back seat.\n\nAt this point a passing ambulance became involved and escorted MacArthur to the hospital, as the driver mistook him for a doctor because of a windscreen sticker which Gargan had. MacArthur later abandoned the car nearby. Three days later, having found alternative means to get to Edenderry, MacArthur visited the farmer Dónal Dunne and murdered him with his own shotgun after examining it. MacArthur then stole Dunne's car and drove it to Dublin. These two violent murders created a sensation, as unmotivated murder in Ireland, coupled with the youth and respectability of the nurse and farmer, was an unusual set of circumstances.\n\nThe Garda Síochána (Irish police) soon had a description of the person they wanted.\n\nMacArthur was acquainted with Patrick Connolly, the then Attorney General, who was the chief legal advisor to the Irish Government. Both attended a match in Croke Park, several days after the murder, and this led to a discussion between Connolly, MacArthur, and the then Garda Commissioner, Patrick McLoughlin, regarding the murder. (MacArthur even asked McLoughlin about the investigation of the \"dreadful\" murder.) On 13 August 1982, after a massive search, MacArthur was arrested on the private property of Connolly, and had been staying in the property for some time as a guest. Connolly, who had been getting ready for holiday, continued on his journey to the United States and did not give any interview to the Gardaí on the matter.\n\nA serious effort was made to prevent the relationship between Connolly and MacArthur becoming public and indeed it was claimed that this was homosexual, something that was later discounted. Connolly was promptly requested to return to Ireland where he then resigned on 16 August. Haughey attempted to distance himself from the fiasco and described the event as \"a bizarre happening, an unprecedented situation, a grotesque situation, an almost unbelievable mischance.\"\n\nMacArthur admitted his guilt of the murder of the nurse. Because of this, he was not tried for Dunne's murder as the state entered a plea of \"nolle prosequi\". This led to a petition of 10,000 signatures to ensure MacArthur would be tried for his murder. This was unsuccessful and MacArthur received a life sentence for just one murder.\n\nIn 2003 the parole board recommended that MacArthur be put on a temporary release program which would eventually lead to his release. Michael McDowell, the then Minister for Justice, who was also a member of MacArthur's defence team in the murder trial, decided that he would take no part in the decision for fear of a conflict of interest.\n\nIn July 2004 it was decided to keep MacArthur in prison, as relatives – including his mother – considered him dangerous.\n\nMacArthur was allowed to spend Christmas Day 2005 with a relative outside prison and was also allowed a five-hour Christmas parole in 2006.\n\nMacArthur was released from Shelton Abbey prison on 17 September 2012.\n\nMacArthur's story inspired John Banville's 1989 novel, \"The Book of Evidence\".\n\n"}

In addition, Sweet published works on larger issues of phonetics and grammar in language and the teaching of languages. Many of his ideas have remained influential, and a number of his works continue to be in print, being used as course texts at colleges and universities.\n\nHenry Sweet was born in St. Pancras in London. He was educated at Bruce Castle School and King's College School, London. In 1864, he spent a short time studying at the Heidelberg University. Upon his return to England, he took up an office job with a trading company in London. Five years later, aged twenty-four, he won a scholarship in German and entered Balliol College in Oxford.\n\nSweet neglected his formal academic coursework, concentrating instead on pursuing excellence in his private studies. Early recognition came in his first year at Oxford, when the prestigious Philological Society (whose President he was destined to become later on) published a paper of his on Old English. In 1871, still an undergraduate, he edited King Alfred's translation of the \"Cura Pastoralis\" for the Early English Text Society (\"King Alfred's West-Saxon Version of Gregory's Pastoral Care: With an English Translation, the Latin Text, Notes, and an Introduction\"), his commentary establishing the foundation for Old English dialectology. He graduated, nearly thirty years old, with a fourth-class degree in \"literae humaniores\". Subsequent works on Old English included \"An Anglo-Saxon Reader\" (1876), \"The Oldest English Texts\" (1885) and \"A Student's Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon\" (1896).\n\nSweet, like his contemporary Walter Skeat, felt under particular pressure from German scholars in English studies who, often state-employed, tenured, and accompanied by their comitatus of eager graduate students, \"annexed\" the historical study of English. Dismayed by the \"swarms of young program-mongers turned out every year by German universities,\" he felt that \"no English dilettante can hope to compete with them—except by Germanizing himself and losing all his nationality.\"\n\nIn 1877, Sweet published \"A Handbook of Phonetics\", which attracted international attention among scholars and teachers of English in Europe. He followed up with the \"Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Englisch\" (1885), which was subsequently adapted as \"A Primer of Spoken English\" (1890). This included the first scientific description of educated London speech, later known as received pronunciation, with specimens of connected speech represented in phonetic script. In addition, he developed a version of shorthand called Current Shorthand, which had both orthographic and phonetic modes. His emphasis on spoken language and phonetics made him a pioneer in language teaching, a subject which he covered in detail in \"The Practical Study of Languages\" (1899). In 1901, Sweet was made reader in phonetics at Oxford. \"The Sounds of English\" (1908) was his last book on English pronunciation.\n\nOther books by Sweet include \"An Icelandic Primer with Grammar, Notes and Glossary\" (1886), \"The History of Language\" (1900; 1995: ; 2007: ), and a number of other works he edited for the Early English Text Society. Sweet was also closely involved in the early history of the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nDespite the recognition he received for his scholarly work, Sweet never received a university professorship, a fact that disturbed him greatly, although he was appointed reader. He had done poorly as a student at Oxford, he had annoyed many people through bluntness, and he failed to make every effort to gather official support. His relationship with the Oxford University Press was often strained.\n\nSweet died on 30 April 1912 in Oxford, of pernicious anemia; he left no children.\n\nIn \"Who's Who, 1911\", Sweet gave his recreations as: \n\nSweet has retained a reputation as \"the man who taught Europe phonetics\". His work established an applied linguistics tradition in language teaching which has continued without interruption to the present day.\n\nA bibliography and \"Collected Papers\" were published by H. C. Wyld.\n\nIn the preface to his play \"Pygmalion\", George Bernard Shaw, after describing Sweet, stated that \"[Henry] Higgins is not a portrait of Sweet, to whom the adventure of Eliza Doolittle would have been impossible; still, as will be seen, there are touches of Sweet in the play.\"\n\nThe Henry Sweet Society for the History of Linguistic Ideas (founded 1984) is named after him. It holds annual colloquia, and publishes the journal \"Language and History\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "811108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=811108", "title": "Isra and Mi'raj", "text": "Isra and Mi'raj\n\nThe Isra and Mi'raj (, ') are the two parts of a Night Journey\"' that, according to Islam, Muhammad took during a single night around the year 621 CE. It has been described as both a physical and spiritual journey. A brief sketch of the story is in surah al-Isra of the Quran, and other details come from the hadith, which are collections of the reports, teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad. In the \"Isra’\", Muhammad traveled on the steed Buraq to \"the farthest mosque\". Traditionally, later Muslims identified the mosque as a location in the physical world, the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. At the mosque, Muhammad led other prophets in prayer. He then ascended to the heavens in the \"Mi‘raj\". The remembrance of this journey is one of the most significant events in the Islamic calendar.\n\nThe events of Isra and Mi'raj are referred to briefly in the Qur'an. For greater detail, they have been discussed in Hadith literature, reported sayings of the prophet which supplement the Qur'an. Of the \"hadith\", two of the best known are by Anas ibn Malik, who would have been a young boy at the time of Muhammad's journey of Mi'raj. Ibn 'Abbas is another source that challenges the usual description of the Mi'raj. He was also a young boy at the time of the journey.\n\nWithin the Qur'an itself, surat al-Isra, the 17th chapter. In it, the first verse briefly describes the Isra. There is also some information in a later verse and another surah, an-Najm, which some scholars say is related to the Isra and Mi'raj.\n\nThe place referred to in the Qur'an as \"the Farthest Masjid\" (, ), from surat al-Isra, has been historically considered as referring to the site of the modern-day al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The Jerusalem interpretation was advanced by the earliest biographer of Muhammad (ca. 570 - 632) – Ibn Ishaq (ca. 704 - 761/770) – and is supported by numerous \"ahadith\". The building of the Masjid in Jerusalem was not present during Muhammad's lifetime, and the term used for mosque (\"masjid\" ()) literally means \"Place of prostration,\" and includes monotheistic places of worship, but does not lend itself exclusively to physical structures but a \"location\", as Muhammad stated \"The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying.\" Therefore, the phrase \"Al-Masjidil-Aqsa\" means that there was a place, but not necessarily a building, where Muhammad prostrated to God or worshipped Him, in the \"Blessed Region.\" When the Rashid caliph ‘Umar conquered Jerusalem after Muhammad's death, a prayer house was rebuilt on the site. The structure was expanded by the Umayyad caliph ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and finished by his son al-Walid I in 705. The building was repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and rebuilt, until the reconstruction in 1033 CE, by the Fatimid caliph ‘Ali az-Zahir, and that version of the structure is what can be seen in the present day.\n\nIslamic scholars such as Heribert Busse and Neal Robinson, believe that Jerusalem is the originally intended interpretation of the Qur’an. Muslims used to pray towards Jerusalem, but according to the following verses of their Quran, God changed this direction, the Qiblah, to instead direct to \"al-Masjid al-Haram\":\nFrom various hadiths we learn much greater detail. The Isra’ is the part of the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem. It began when Muhammad was in the Great Mosque, and the Archangel Jibrīl (or Jibrāʾīl, Gabriel) came to him, and brought Buraq, the traditional heavenly steed of the prophets. Buraq carried Muhammad to al-Aqsa Mosque, the \"Farthest Mosque\", in Jerusalem. Muhammad alighted, tethered Buraq to the Temple Mount and performed prayer, where on God's command he was tested by Gabriel. It was told by Anas ibn Malik that Muhammad said: \"Jibra'il brought me a vessel of wine, a vessel of water and a vessel of milk, and I chose the milk. Jibra'il said: 'You have chosen the Fitrah (natural instinct).'\" In the second part of the journey, the Mi'raj (an Arabic word that literally means \"ladder\"), Jibra'il took him to the heavens, where he toured the \"seven stages of heaven\", and spoke with the earlier prophets such as Abraham (ʾIbrāhīm), Moses (Musa), John the Baptist (Yaḥyā ibn Zakarīyā), and Jesus (Isa). Muhammad was then taken to Sidrat al-Muntaha – a holy tree in the seventh heaven that Gabriel was not allowed to pass. According to Islamic tradition, God instructed Muhammad that Muslims must pray fifty times per day; however, Moses told Muhammad that it was very difficult for the people and urged Muhammad to ask for a reduction, until finally it was reduced to five times per day.\n\nThere are different accounts of what occurred during the Mi‘raj, but most narratives have the same elements: Muhammad ascended into heaven with the angel Gabriel and met a different prophet at each of the seven levels of heaven; first Adam, then John the Baptist and Jesus, then Joseph, then Idris, then Aaron, then Moses, and lastly Abraham. After Muhammad meets with Abraham, he continues on to meet God without Gabriel. God tells Muhammad that his people must pray 50 times a day, but as Muhammad descends back to Earth, he meets Moses who tells Muhammad to go back to God and ask for fewer prayers because 50 is too many. Muhammad goes between Moses and God nine times, until the prayers are reduced to the five daily prayers, which God will reward tenfold. That again, Moses told Muhammad to ask for even lesser but Muhammad felt ashamed and said that even with lesser prayer times, his followers might not even perform diligently and said he is thankful for the five.\n\nAl-Tabari is a classic and authentic source for Islamic research. His description of the Mi’raj is just as simplified as the description given above, which is where other narratives and hadiths of the Mi’raj stem from, as well as word of mouth. While this is the simplest description of the Mi’raj, others include more details about the prophets that Muhammad meets. In accounts written by Muslim, Bukhari, Ibn Ishaq, Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, physical descriptions of the prophets are given. Adam is described first as being Muhammad’s father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets. Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi’raj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad’s. Aaron is described as Muhammad’s brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad’s father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.\n\nSome narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad’s chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad’s chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place—before or after the ascent—but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad’s spiritual righteousness.\n\nMany Muslim scholars like Saeed bin Khalfan Alkhalili, Nasir Kharousi, Farqad Alqazwini and Zakariya bin Khalifa Almahrami rejected the story of Mi'raj for not being mentioned in the Quran.\n\nIbn ‘Abbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), Half-Fire Half-Snow angel (who provides an example of God’s power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the Angel of Death (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the Guardian of Hellfire (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn ‘Abbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad’s ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn ‘Abbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called cherubim. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God’s creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn ‘Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets. These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn ‘Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.\n\nSome debates that Ibn ‘Abbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad’s encounter with God. Ibn ‘Abbas illustrates God as a human who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn ‘Abbas’s authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn ‘Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn ‘Abbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn ‘Abbas’s Primitive Version.\n\nThe \"Lailat al-Mi'raj\" (, ), also known as \"Shab-e-Mi'raj\" (, , , ) in Iran, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, and \"Miraç Kandili\" in Turkish, is the Muslim holiday celebrating the Isra and Miʿraj. Some Muslims celebrate this event by offering optional prayers during this night, and in some Muslim countries, by illuminating cities with electric lights and candles. The celebrations around this day tend to focus on every Muslim who wants to celebrate it. Worshippers gather into mosques and perform prayer and supplication. Some people may pass their knowledge on to others by telling them the story on how Muhammad's heart was purified by the archangel Gabriel, who filled him with knowledge and faith in preparation to enter the seven levels of heaven. After salah, food and treats are served.\n\nAl-Aqsa Mosque marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven. The exact date of the Journey is not clear, but is celebrated as though it took place before the Hegira and after Muhammad's visit to the people of Ta'if. It is considered by some to have happened just over a year before the Hijrah, on the 27th of Rajab; but this date is not always recognized. This date would correspond to the Julian date of February 26, 621, or, if from the previous year, March 8, 620. In Twelver Iran for example, Rajab 27 is the day of Muhammad's first calling or \"Mab'as\". The al-Aqsa Mosque and surrounding area, marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven, is the third-holiest place on earth for Muslims.\n\nMany sects and offshoots belonging to Islamic mysticism interpret Muhammad's night ascent – the Isra and Mi'raj – to be an out-of-body experience through nonphysical environments, unlike the Sunni Muslims or mainstream Islam. The mystics claim Muhammad was transported to Jerusalem and onward to the Seven Heavens, even though \"the apostle's body remained where it was.\" Esoteric interpretations of the Quran emphasise the spiritual significance of Miʿraj, seeing it as a symbol of the soul's journey and the potential of humans to rise above the comforts of material life through prayer, piety and discipline.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1937542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1937542", "title": "Living in Oblivion", "text": "Living in Oblivion\n\nLiving in Oblivion is an independent dark comedy film, written and directed by Tom DiCillo and starring Steve Buscemi, Catherine Keener, Dermot Mulroney, Danielle von Zerneck and James LeGros. The film won Tom DiCillo the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival. The film was acclaimed by critics, and currently has a score of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes. It marked Peter Dinklage's film debut.\n\nThe film is divided into three parts, all of which concern the making of a low-budget movie featuring the same director, crew and substantially the same cast.\n\nPart one: Director Nick Reve (Steve Buscemi) is shooting a low-budget independent film in the middle of New York City. The catering crew are under-funded and apathetic, deciding not to replace a carton of milk that has been on the craft service table for a week. The scene being shot is a difficult one: a young woman, Ellen, reproaches her elderly mother (Rica Martens) for not intervening when the father beat Ellen as a child. However, on the set, just about everything that can go wrong does go wrong: shots are spoiled because of how the mic boom is visible; the camera assistant fails to keep the shot in focus; Cora, the actress playing the mother, forgets her lines; and Nicole, the actress playing Ellen, becomes increasingly unfocused and careless. A dispirited Nick calls for a rehearsal without camera to refresh the actors. However, when Nicole (Catherine Keener) berates herself for acting badly, Cora (Rica Martens) reassures her with a gesture that reminds Nicole of a similar gesture made by her own terminally ill mother. Nicole is so upset by the memory that she turns in an unexpectedly passionate performance; and Cora, startled by Nicole's sudden intensity, is equally good. Watching them, Nick becomes enthusiastic all over again. Unfortunately, it was not captured on film; cinematographer and camera operator Wolf (Dermot Mulroney), who has been diluting the sub-standard coffee with the spoiled milk, was vomiting in the toilet throughout. Nick ruefully calls for another take. This time, a sudden and insistent beeping sound distracts the actors. Nobody can tell where it's coming from; and Nick flies into a rage, berating everyone on the crew and cast for their inadequacies. He then wakes up in his own bed; the beeping sound was his own alarm clock. He has dreamed the entire segment. It is 4.30am; and he is due on set.\n\nPart two: Early the same morning, the film's lead actor Chad Palomino (James LeGros) is getting dressed in Nicole's hotel room. They have spent the night together, and Chad suggests that they might get together again later; Nicole politely declines. Chad and Nicole arrive on the set separately. Nicole's character \"Ellen\" and Chad's character \"Damian\" have been in love for years but have never admitted it until the scene being shot on this day. Shooting the scene is made practically impossible by Chad's irregular acting. He keeps changing his mind about where to stand and continually moves to places where he is either invisible or badly lit by scenic light. Nicole becomes increasingly frustrated by Chad's egomania; and, when he starts to stroke her head, she briefly loses her cool, then apologizes. An irritated Chad demands a private talk with Nick. He tells Nick that he has slept with Nicole and makes out that it was she, not he, who had wanted to continue the relationship. Desperate to keep Chad happy, Nick agrees that Nicole is not very good. Nicole overhears this conversation on the sound mixer's headphones. Pretending to be contrite, she asks Nick if they can improvise a little; but, when they do so, she announces to everyone that, although she slept with Chad, she is not at all interested in him. Chad loses his temper and quits the movie. Relieved that he will no longer have to please Chad, Nick calls him a \"Hostess Twinkie motherfucker\" and a fight breaks out. Nick beats Chad senseless and fires him. He apologises to Nicole and confesses that he loves her. They kiss—then Nicole abruptly wakes up, still in her bed, having dreamed the entire segment.\n\nPart three: Later the same day, the crew is setting up for a dream sequence in which Nicole, as Ellen, stands still while a dwarf walks around her holding an apple. Nick claims to have learned a lesson from his own dream: That sometimes, \"you just got to roll with things.\" Nicole admits that she had a dream with Nick in it but doesn't tell him what happened. Nick manages to keep up his positive attitude despite the various mishaps that occur: The smoke machine fails to work, then it catches fire, then his senile mother Cora arrives on the set. However, the ill-tempered dwarf actor Tito (Peter Dinklage) complains that the dream sequence is a cliché (\"\"I\" don't even have dreams with dwarves in them!\") and walks off the set in disgust. Nick's confidence collapses, and he announces that the movie is over. At that moment, his mother intervenes, grabbing the apple, moving to Tito's mark and announcing that she is \"ready\". The crew scrambles to shoot the scene, and her manic performance injects fresh energy and conviction into it. Nick is delighted and decides to keep the new dream sequence, and there is a tense moment while the sound mixer records 30 seconds of room tone. The entire cast and crew manages to remain silent, and during this moment they each daydream about different things. They go on to shooting the next sequence.\n\n\nDiCillo got inspiration for the film from the frustrations he experienced when making the film \"Johnny Suede\", and his long struggle to make his next intended film, \"Box of Moonlight\". \"Living in Oblivion\" was rejected by all producers but the actors and friends of the director felt so strongly about the project that they financed it. Two of the producers, Michael Griffiths and Hilary Gilford, were given parts in the movie to thank them for providing finance. Griffiths plays Speedo, the sound mixer; Gilford plays the unnamed Script girl. The film is divided into three parts. The first part was shot in five days and after DiCillo realized that it was too short to be a feature and too long to be a short he expanded it into a full feature film with parts two and three. The film title was taken from the hit 80's song by synth pop artists Anything Box.\n\nThe film won Tom DiCillo the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival.

{"id": "28969195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28969195", "title": "Map collection", "text": "Map collection\n\nA map collection is a storage facility for maps, usually in a library, archive, or museum, or at a map publisher or public-benefit corporation, and the maps and other cartographic items stored within that facility.\n\nSometimes, map collections are combined with graphic sheets, manuscripts and rare prints in a single department. In such cases, the expression \"map collection\" refers to the whole of the cartographic collection holdings.\n\nEven in medieval libraries, maps formed part of the inventories. According to scholars of the renaissance, maps were collected from the 15th century, either at the court or at naval academies to prepare for voyages of discovery. Over time, new techniques, such as copper engraving, reduced production costs, and assisted in spreading maps more widely.\n\nBy the 17th century, private map collections were often the basis for public map collections. As early as 1571, for example, the Court Library in Munich, Bavaria, (now the Bavarian State Library) became the owner of the Fugger collection. In 1823, the British Museum in London acquired the King's Library, which had been inherited and greatly enlarged by George III of the United Kingdom, and donated to the Museum by his heir, George IV of the United Kingdom. The King's Library included a collection of approximately 50,000 maps, plans and views, which are now housed at the British Library and known as the King's Topographical Collection.\n\nIn the development of public map collections, the geographical societies were important. They exerted great influence on the establishment and collection policy of such collections, or even stored their own collections at such institutions. So, for example, in 1680 Vincenzo Coronelli founded the \"Accademia Cosmographicae degli Argonauti\", which existed until 1718. In Nuremberg, the \"Kosmographische Gesellschaft\" was established in 1740, while a namesake organization came into existence in Vienna in 1790. The \"Société de Géographie de Paris\", founded in 1821, was the first modern geographic society.\n\nEspecially in the 19th century, many map collections were either newly established, or merged with existing collections of catographic materials held by libraries under the responsibility of specialist librarians.\n\n\nNewly published maps, like books, are recorded in national bibliographies. Thus, the title, author(s), imprint and ISBN of any recently published map are mentioned in official records. Additionally, various data specific to a map, such as scale, map projection, geographical coordinates and map format, are included in the records of that map.\n\nMost academic map collection owners now index at least the most important parts of the collection in electronic catalogues that can be viewed online.\n\nOlder collections or private collections are often described in bibliophile catalogues. In such catalogues, at least representative parts of the collection are shown. Bibliophile catalogues provide evidence of the collection's stock that can be used in the event of theft. Also, the use of a collection's rarities can thereby be noticeably limited, as in many cases the image and scientific description of the map is sufficient for the required purpose, and thus the original map is left undisturbed.\n\nHoldings in archives are often not indexed on a single sheet by sheet basis, but on a basis under which a sheet can be found in the records only with the assistance of a finding aid. Archive staff, often not trained in cartographic matters, can be cautious in describing an unwieldy, and in some ways reputedly \"foreign\" document type. For that reason, significant characteristics such as the projection and map scale of an individual sheet will often be omitted from an index to a map collection. These circumstances make it difficult for users of such indexes to search for a specific map in an archive, but still allow persistent researchers to make some 'discoveries'.\n\nThe authoritative guide \"World directory of map collections\" (2000) lists 714 map collections in 121 countries. With few exceptions, the most valuable map collections are held in either Europe or North America. There are also some map collections in South America, Africa and South Asia, but those collections are comparatively rare and of much lower value.\n\nIndisputably the largest map collection in Austria is the Map Department of the Austrian National Library in Vienna. It has about 275,000 maps, 240,000 geographic-topographic views, 570 globes, 80 reliefs and models of fortresses, and about 75,000 volumes of technical literature and atlases,\n\nAlso a department of the Austrian National Library is the world's only public Globe Museum, at the Palais Mollard, Vienna.\n\nThe Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels has a collection of over 200,000 maps, atlases, cartographic books and globes. Most of these items relate either to Belgium, or to its former colony the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris ranks among the top three worldwide collections of cartographic materials. It holds stocks of atlases, maps, map series, globes, geography games, city maps, building plans and relief maps.\n\nThe largest map collections in Germany are those of the Berlin State Library, the Bavarian State Library in Munich and the Göttingen State and University Library.\n\nNot currently publicly available is the collection of the publisher Justus Perthes in Gotha, which is owned by the state of Thuringia and presently housed at the University of Erfurt.\n\nThe National Library of Spain in Madrid has a collection of over 500,000 maps.\n\nIn Switzerland, there are major map collections in several libraries. The map collection in ETH Zurich's is the largest, and specialises in thematic maps. The map collection of the Zentralbibliothek Zürich covers to a large extent the various official topographic map series and national atlases.\n\nLocated in Bern is the , a former private collection of Johann Friedrich von Ryhiner with a focus on the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nMajor map collections are held at the British Library in London, the National Library of Scotland (available free online), the National Library of Wales and the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford.\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada in Ottawa has a collection of some two million cartographic items.\n\nThe world's largest collection of maps is held by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It includes around 5.2 million maps.\n\nThe Osher Map Library located on the University of Southern Maine's Portland Campus has a large collection of maps, atlases, and globes.\n\nThe map collection of the National Library of Australia in Canberra includes over 600,000 maps and 2,500 atlases.\n\nAs with books in libraries, map collections now put more weight on creation of digital documents. These include maps and atlases on CD-ROM and DVD and in some cases the provision of Geodata. Such new forms of publication present map collections with major problems, as not just \"mere\" text and some inline images need to be kept, but very large amounts of data, up to several Gigabytes, that may eventually be required to operate specialised geographic information systems.\n\nAlso, the long-term storage of cartographic data is an unresolved issue that is particularly important for archives.\n\nThe digitization of analogue map stocks also offers the opportunity to link library catalogues directly with the images (or at least with so-called thumbnails). Also, digitally processed sheet indexes to individual sheets of map series allow for more targeted research from one's own workplace.\n\n\n\"This article is based upon a translation of the version as at October 2010.\"\n"}

{"id": "17841938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17841938", "title": "MobileMe", "text": "MobileMe\n\nMobileMe (iTools before 2002; .Mac before 2008) is a subscription-based collection of online services and software offered by Apple Inc. All services were gradually transitioned and eventually replaced by iCloud and the service ceased as of June 30, 2012, with transfers to iCloud available until July 31, 2012. Afterwards, all data was deleted, and the email addresses of accounts not transferred to iCloud were marked as unused.\n\nOriginally launched on January 5, 2000, as iTools, a free collection of Internet-based services for users of Mac OS 9, Apple relaunched it as .Mac on July 17, 2002, when it became a paid subscription service primarily designed for users of Mac OS X. Apple relaunched the service again as \"MobileMe\" on July 9, 2008 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2008, now targeting Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, iPhone, and iPod Touch users.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, Apple discontinued offering MobileMe at its retail stores, with MobileMe retail boxes eventually removed from resellers as well. Additionally, Apple stopped accepting new subscriptions for MobileMe. On June 6, 2011, Apple announced that a new service called iCloud would replace MobileMe sometime in the fall. At the iPhone 4S special event on October 4, 2011, Apple announced it would finally launch iCloud on October 12, 2011, to replace MobileMe for new users, with current users having access until June 30, 2012 (on that day the service would cease).\n\nMobileMe was shut down on June 30, 2012, with user data available for retrieval until July 31, 2012, when the site finally closed completely.\n\niTools and .Mac were designed primarily to provide Internet services for Mac owners. All members of iTools and .Mac received a @mac.com email address, showing the services tied to the Mac hardware. However, with the release of the iPhone 3G in 2008, the renamed service, MobileMe, began providing Internet services for OS X, iOS, and Windows. Members of MobileMe were given a @me.com email address (though users of the current @mac.com email address could also continue to use those, with both domains being interchangeable with the same email account), were also no longer restricted to OS X software such as Mail and iCal, and they could access personal data from any computer connected to the Internet using the web interface at me.com or a number of supported applications, including Microsoft Outlook, as long as the user used version 2003 or later. Apple support for MobileMe was available via chat and telephone (the latter restricted to US/Canada users only).\n\nMobileMe allowed users to track the location of their iOS devices via the web portal at me.com. A user could see the device's approximate location on a map (along with a circle showing the radius of inaccuracy), display a message and/or play a sound on the device (even if it is set to silent), change the password on the device, and remotely erase its contents. An app was also released by Apple which allowed users to locate their iPhone from another device running iOS 4. The feature was first announced on June 10, 2009 and was included in iOS 3.0 as a feature for MobileMe users. Find My iPhone was made free of charge with the release of iOS 4.2.1 software update on November 22, 2010 for devices introduced in 2010.\n\nMobileMe had two different plans. The \"Individual\" plan included 20 GB of email and file storage and 200 GB of monthly data transfer. The \"Family Pack\" plan included 40 GB of storage split among one 20 GB individual (primary) and four 5 GB sub-accounts, each sub-account having its own email address, online storage, and being able to use all the MobileMe features. Family members also had a Shared folder in their iDisk with which they could share access to data among themselves. Both the primary account and sub-accounts had read/write access to this folder and were limited to the free space available in the primary user's iDisk.\n\n\"Individual plan\" was priced at $99, \"Family Pack\"—at $149.\n\nMembers could buy additional storage in 20 GB or 40 GB allocations, however, sub-account storage could not be upgraded. In a family account, the amount of storage is designated per account.\n\nNotes (from the Mail app on a Mac computer, and the Notes app on the iPhone) were synced via the MobileMe service, however were unable to be viewed or edited online. To Do lists (controlled from the Mail app and the iCal app on a Mac computer) were viewable and editable through the MobileMe website (under the Calendar tab), but were not viewable or editable on an iPhone. With the announcement of iOS 4 the sync for Notes over IMAP (including MobileMe) was implemented.\n\nMobileMe maintained a synchronized address book and calendar feature using Push functions. When a user made a change to a contact or event on one device, it was automatically synced to the MobileMe servers and, by extension, all the user's other devices. Supported devices included the iPhone, Address Book and iCal on OS X, or Microsoft Outlook 2003 or later on Microsoft Windows. Subscription calendars in iCal on a Mac computer were not viewable on the online MobileMe service (although \"Birthdays\" was viewable online; as it gathered its information from Address Book, rather than CalDAV or iCalendar (.ics) subscription calendars). Conversely, on the iPhone \"Birthdays\" from Contacts on the iPhone were not viewable on the Calendar app (nor any other method; except looking them up individually in Contacts. Birthdays Calendar was added on iOS 4.3), but subscription calendars were available to view in Calendar by adding them through Settings>Mail, Contacts, Calendar>Add Account.\n\nMobileMe had a public photo and video gallery feature. Photos and videos could be uploaded in the web browser at me.com, synced by iPhoto or Aperture on OS X, or uploaded from the iPhone and iPod Touch. Users could also upload movies from within applications available on the Mac, including iPhoto and iMovie. MobileMe also provided the user with an email address that is used only for uploading photos and videos. All uploads by viewers of the Gallery (either by the iPhone or iPod Touch, me.com, or sent by the dedicated email address), were synced back to iPhoto or Aperture. Galleries could be made public or private, or could be password protected (but only through iPhoto or iMovie on OS X).\n\nMobileMe featured iDisk, an online storage repository accessible via a web browser at me.com, Finder on OS X, various apps for iOS devices, or as a remote disk in Microsoft Windows. It also allowed sharing of files by selecting a given file using me.com/iDisk or the iDisk iPhone app, and then clicking a Share button that generated a unique link to this file, protected by password, that could then be shared by email. Another way to use iDisk to share several files easily was by placing them in the iDisk Public Folder, which could also be password protected.\n\nUsers of Mac OS X v10.5 or later could use the iLife '08, iLife '09, or iLife '11 application iWeb to publish websites hosted on their MobileMe account, either to a domain name that they controlled or to a page on the me.com website. Users without iWeb could also publish websites by placing files to the Web/Sites folder in iDisk. However, the web host didn't support any server-side language such as PHP.\n\nMobileMe used Ajax and Dynamic HTML to simulate the look and feel of desktop applications within the user's web browser. Applications on me.com included Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Gallery, Find My iPhone, and iDisk access, plus an Account section. Most of the me.com web applications were built on top of the open source SproutCore Javascript framework. Users could also configure features such as email aliases or domain names for the iWeb Publish feature.\n\nSupported browsers for me.com on both Mac and Windows were Safari 3.1 or later, and Firefox 3.5 or later, while Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 7 were Windows-only. Safari 3.0, and Firefox 3.0 would run the web applications, but were not fully supported.\n\nMobileMe was accessible from Linux using Firefox 3 despite a warning that would be presented to the user upon entry. Success was also reported using the Konqueror browser on Linux, however this was not confirmed by Apple.\n\nMobileMe users could connect to the AIM service with their @mac.com or @me.com accounts. MobileMe connections were secured by SSL encryption. In addition, iChat users using a MobileMe account could encrypt their chats with other MobileMe members using iChat. Users could also access the MobileMe Chat account on iOS devices using the free or paid-for versions of the AIM app provided by AOL, or any other iOS app that supported the AIM protocol.\n\nUsers who wished to sync their MobileMe data with a PC had to download and install Apple's MobileMe Control Panel. To install, the user first had to download and install the latest version of iTunes, and then install MobileMe Control Panel. After installation, the user signed into the control panel using their username and password, and could control sync settings for contacts, calendars, bookmarks, and iDisk settings such as public folder access, in a similar manner to the MobileMe preference panel built into .\n\nThe MobileMe Mail Beta was released on May 13, 2010. It included many new features such as photo inserting, font changing, wide screen views and much more. It was released as a final version on June 18, 2010.\n\nMobileMe Calendar Beta was released on July 6, 2010. MobileMe Calendar Beta included a new web application at me.com with redesigned day, week, and month views, as well as a new list view to make scanning events easier. Performance was also improved. It also featured new sharing options that allowed invited users to edit a shared calendar. It supported invitations through RSVPs, which sent an email to invited persons, which they answered by clicking a simple link (they didn't have to be MobileMe members). It also supported CalDAV standard for compatibility with multiple devices. However, with these updates came some decreased functionality. The capability to publish iCal calendars as publicly viewable web pages was removed. Users wishing to view a public calendar had to then manually subscribe with a CalDAV compatible calendar device. Compatibility with Microsoft Outlook suffered too, since Outlook users could not sync their primary Outlook calendar to a MobileMe calendar anymore; the only way to integrate MobileMe with Outlook was then to have a MobileMe calendar linked in through CalDAV. This meant that a MobileMe calendar was always seen by Outlook as a secondary calendar, and alarms and notifications did not work.\n\nThe table below illustrates the pricing structure previous to Apple discontinuing purchases on June 6, 2011 as part of the move to iCloud. Current users were encouraged to use MobileMe services inside iCloud (account migration happening automatically anyway), but could continue to use their MobileMe services and access the me.com website until it was shut down on June 30, 2012 (although limited access beyond that date was available to download content). Users wishing to cancel MobileMe—thus immediately end all services—could gain full refunds if purchased within 45 days of June 6, 2011, or partial refunds if purchased 46 days or more; however, it was unclear whether this refund policy applied when the iCloud service launched in Fall 2011.\n\nMobileMe, like .Mac and iTools before it, was closely integrated with . Having a MobileMe account extended the functions of many programs, mostly within the iLife suite. Most notably, any iDisk could be mounted as any other volume on the desktop. Furthermore, it was possible to mount the public portion of another user's iDisk. This mechanism was one of the early ways to receive free software as part of .Mac. It was possible to queue files for upload to an offline iDisk, though they were only uploaded when the iDisk was mounted. iDisk commands were located in the \"Go\" menu of the Finder.\n\nAdditionally, any Address Book entries, iCal events and to-do entries, Safari bookmarks and keychains, mail accounts, mail rules, mail signatures, and smart mailboxes could be synced with the iDisk, allowing easy synchronization between multiple computers. iWeb allowed users to create web pages that could be uploaded to iDisk and published. iPhoto could be used for one-click web-publishing of photo albums. iCal could be used to publish calendars to the web. Also, Backup software could be used to make backups to iDisk or local media.\n\nWith the prior .Mac service, the iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand and iTunes libraries could easily be uploaded to any iDisk (subject to various licensing agreements).\n\nMobileMe integrated with various applications on iOS devices. This included iCal syncing with Calendar, Address Book syncing with Contacts, Mail syncing across devices, Safari Bookmarks syncing across devices. Apple later introduced the MobileMe iDisk app on July 29, 2009, the MobileMe Gallery app on January 14, 2010, and the Find My iPhone app on June 18, 2010, that allowed mobile access to the Find My iPhone feature (initially only available for MobileMe users, later made free to all iOS device users). While initially only iPhone and iPod Touch apps, following updates, they were made \"universal\" app (compatible for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad). In August 2010, Apple introduced a feature that allowed users to stream music that's stored on their iDisk in the background from their device.\n\nThere were subdirectory (private) and subdomain (public) access points to each MobileMe user's individual account functions. These provided direct web access to each MobileMe user's account, via links to each function directly. See list:\n\nPrivate:\n\nPublic:\n\nThe original collection of Internet software and services now known as iCloud was first called iTools. Announced and released at Macworld Expo San Francisco on January 5, 2000, iTools was made available free of charge for Mac users.\n\nServices offered by iTools included the first availability of @mac.com email addresses, which could only be accessed through an email client (e.g. the Mail app); iCards, a free greeting card service; iReview, a collection of reviews of popular web sites; HomePage, a free web page publishing service; the first version of iDisk, an online data storage system; and KidSafe, a directory of family-friendly web sites.\n\niTools was primarily a Mac-only offering and provided only limited, discussion board-based technical support. However, some features of iTools were accessible via non-Mac platforms although a Mac was required to create an account.\n\nFor example, modifying HomePage content was possible using a web browser on Windows or via Linux.\n\nAlthough the original version of iDisk used AppleShare IP for transport and required , it was eventually updated to use WebDAV technology and therefore opened up access to non-Mac operating systems. Apple even offered an application for use with Windows XP.\n\nAs costs rose, most particularly due to iDisk storage space, the wide demand for @mac.com email accounts, and increasing support needs, iTools was renamed .Mac at Macworld Expo New York on July 17, 2002, as a subscription-based suite of services with a dedicated technical support team.\n\nThe new .Mac offered several tools to subscribers, including upgraded versions of HomePage, the personal web hosting service; iDisk, the online disk storage service; @mac.com, the email service provider offering both POP and IMAP protocols; and iCards, the online greeting card service. New services offered by .Mac included Backup, a personal backup solution that allowed users to archive data to their iDisk, CD or DVD; and McAfee Virex, a virus scanner given to .Mac subscribers until June 15, 2005.\n\nApple announced on September 17, 2002 that more than 100,000 people had subscribed to .Mac since its launch earlier that year. Existing iTools accounts were transitioned to .Mac accounts during a free trial period that ended on September 30, 2002. This move generated a mixed reaction among Mac users, some believing .Mac was overpriced.\n\n.Mac occasionally received new features. In October 2006, Apple launched an update to its .Mac Mail service whose interface was close to that of Mac OS X Mail. The new functionality was built on top of Ajax and provided drag-and-drop, a live-updating three-way split view, and the ability to resize panels. v10.5 Leopard used .Mac to provide dynamic DNS services for its Back to My Mac feature, a remote desktop service.\n\nOn August 7, 2007, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs announced new features for .Mac, including a new Web Gallery feature, similar to a combination of the features of Flickr and YouTube. Each .Mac account now came with 10 GB of storage space that could be divided between email storage for an @mac.com email address and the user's iDisk. An account preference allowed the user to decide how much storage space to allocate to either service as they see fit. Users who wanted additional storage capacity could buy up to a total of 30 GB for a higher annual fee. The storage space for both email and an iDisk could be used in any way the user wanted, subject to the terms of the .Mac license agreement.\n\n.Mac was also offered in a boxed version, available at stores and online (as a physical product). The box contained an activation code that was entered when registering or renewing a subscription.\n\nInitial speculation about a new service to replace .Mac came in early June 2008, when Apple bought the me.com domain name. At WWDC on June 9, 2008, Apple announced that .Mac would be replaced by MobileMe. This was launched on July 9, 2008: mac.com was taken offline from 08:00 to 12:00 that day, and the MobileMe service went live between 20:00 and 02:00 (both Pacific Time). MobileMe was taken offline a short time later, leaving customers redirected to the MobileMe information page, where there was no option to log in. After several hours of infrequent service, MobileMe officially went live during July 11, 2008.\n\nSeveral .Mac features were removed after the transition to MobileMe:\n\nThe launch of MobileMe was plagued by various issues. MobileMe, as a .Mac successor, was initially criticized during its launch for being unstable and for having syncing problems. There were reports of users being unable to access any of the Mail functions of MobileMe. This was suspected to be related to the .Mac to MobileMe switch-over. The free trial of MobileMe inadvertently charged some Australian and European customers’ credit cards, leading Apple to issue refunds and extend the free trial to four months. Because of the problems with switching over .Mac accounts and other issues, Apple created a status news page and revamped their support page.\n\nInitial versions of the Windows MobileMe Control Panel allowed synchronization of corporate Outlook accounts with MobileMe. A mid-2008 update to the Control Panel removed the ability to synchronize Outlook to MobileMe when Outlook is using Microsoft Exchange Server Calendars and Contacts. According to Apple Support, this is by design and is not a bug that will be fixed. There was no support for synchronizing even standalone Outlook Tasks and Notes to MobileMe.\n\nIn May 2011, \"Fortune\" magazine reported that during the summer of 2008, after MobileMe had launched to mostly negative reviews, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs summoned the MobileMe team to a meeting in the Town Hall auditorium at 4 Infinite Loop. After asking them \"what MobileMe is supposed to do\", when someone answered, Jobs reportedly shot back, \"So why the fuck doesn't it do that?\"\n\nIn an internal email sent to Apple employees on August 4, 2008, Jobs admitted that MobileMe was launched too hurriedly and “not up to Apple’s standards”. He wrote that “it was a mistake to launch MobileMe at the same time as iPhone 3G, iPhone 2.0 software, and the App Store”. On August 18, 2008, it was announced that MobileMe subscribers would be offered a 60-day extension in addition to the one-month extension previously offered.\n\nFrom early 2011 onwards, MobileMe retail boxes began being removed entirely from sale at all Apple Stores, with stock slowly being discontinued from other stores, and from June 6, 2011 users were prevented from subscribing or renewing to the MobileMe service via Apple's website. On June 6, 2011, at WWDC 2011, iCloud's release was announced for sometime in fall 2011, entirely replacing the MobileMe service which would be discontinued, however both would continue to be run concurrently for current MobileMe subscribers through June 30, 2012. Because of MobileMe's perceived public failings, Steve Jobs anticipated skepticism to his claim that iCloud \"just works\", and asked rhetorically, \"Why should I believe them? They're the ones that brought me MobileMe!\".\n\nOn October 12, 2011, alongside the release of iOS 5 and iPhone 4S, iCloud was released to new users, with current MobileMe subscribers being able to move over to iCloud either immediately or anytime before June 30, 2012 when MobileMe would be permanently discontinued (except for limited download abilities). In addition to MobileMe's email and calendar services, iCloud syncs files across multiple devices. As promised at WWDC 2011, Apple began the service during fall 2011, giving every user of either or both iOS 5 or Mac OS X Lion 5 GB of cloud data storage for the basic service free at the point of usage, with additional paid-for tiers for more data storage also being available. @me.com was retained as the default email domain address for new iCloud users. A year later, around fall 2012, Apple started to sign-up new users to free @icloud.com email addresses, with previous @me.com users also able to continue using that email domain concurrently; as done on previous service changes.\n\nAs a first step, Apple sent \"30 days left\" emails to all existing users of MobileMe on June 1, 2012, which they then followed with \"7 days left\" emails on June 23, 2012, advising users \"Download your photos and files. MobileMe ends June 30.

The trusses for the double bridge were assembled in a field next to the chosen site. Measuring 168 feet in length, with two vehicle lanes and a footpath (attached after its original construction), it is an impressive example of the engineering principles and bridge-builder’s craft practiced during the 19th century. The bridge was lighted by kerosene lamps.\n\nDuring the 1927 Flood the water rose seven feet above its floor.\n\nThe bridge replaced a ferry that existed in its place before, connecting two neighborhoods of Cambridge, Vermont \n\nIn the late 1940s, Electra Havemeyer Webb of Shelburne Museum, sought to preserve early American life and asked the VT Highway Department to help find a bridge worth preserving. When it was learned that the \"Big Bridge\" (as it was known at the time) was to be replaced, this \"double-barreled\" bridge with its walkway was too much to resist.\n\nThe Museum dismantled the Covered Bridge in 1949 and moved it to the Museum grounds. The beams still bear the identifying numbers for reconstruction. By situating it above a man-made pond, extensive landscaping integrated the bridge into the grounds. The Covered Bridge served for many years as the Museum’s entrance, but when automobile traffic proved too taxing, the Museum relocated the entrance and retired the bridge from duty.\n\nThe current bridge in its original place is The Wrong Way Bridge on State Route 15.\n\nWhile many associate covered bridges with New England, the first covered bridges in the United States were built in Pennsylvania. Artist and inventor Charles Willson Peale received the first patent for a covered bridge in 1797. While his project never came to fruition, seven years later the Town Board of Philadelphia voted to erect what would become the first covered bridge across the Schuylkill River; it was only enclosed by chance after a shareholder of the building company suggested covering it. Roofing a bridge protected the structure from severe weather while adding structural stability, and, as a further benefit, shielded farm animals from frightening views.\n\nIn 1804, Connecticut inventor Theodore Burr engineered his design for an arch truss bridge, also called a king-post arch design, and patented it in 1817. Shelburne Museum’s Covered Bridge is an example of Burr’s creative engineering. Because inventors receive royalties from bridge patents based on a bridge’s length, there was great incentive to devise ways of increasing a bridge’s possible span and the frequently used king-post design could only extend so far. Burr’s design, which bolted a single arched timber to the king-post braces, added such stability that not only did the king-post trusses become secondary supports but also the bridge’s possible reach greatly increased.\n\n\n"}

The piece of bread is the oldest surviving viennoiserie and formed bakery product from Europe. The find, along with a reconstruction, are in the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.\n\nIn May 1952 one of Helms-Museum’s staff, Willi Rühland, discovered a dark discoloration in a freshly cut clay wall on the north side of the municipal loam mine of Ovelgönne at . The irregular pit had a depth of and a width of . The backfilling of the pit was irregularly mixed up with shards of pottery, pieces of charcoal, lumps of clay, and stones, suggesting an Iron Age rubbish pit. Half down the pit, the remains of the charred bread was found.\n\nThe Ovelgönne bread roll originally had two tip-shaped ends. Due to its regular shape, it is categorized among the formed bakery products having a predefined shape. The strongly charred loaf of bread was aborted at about the half its length. The surviving part of the bread has a length of , a width of and a height of , having a weight of only. The point of the remaining end is missing. The colour of the surface is pearl grey to slate grey, the underside is grey to black. The top of the roll has a fine and slightly curved incision, which is designed to prevent tearing during the baking process. Nearly in the center of the resulting surface on the top is a deep and × depression, which was pressed into it with a round tool at an angle of approximately 45°. A second hole was most likely also on the missing half of the loaf. The bread had no pronounced crust and it was baked from a very finely ground and sifted wheat flour. A microscopic examination of the surface showed that the dough contained only remarkable small traces of wear fine millstones. The dough itself was kneaded thoroughly and showed only very small porosity, suggesting that neither a wild yeast fermentation nor a sourdough were used to leaven the bread loaf. Possibly for lightening of the dough, protein or fat was added. The baking process must have taken place in an oven on a stone surface which was good, but not completely cleaned of coal, as small charcoal remains have been reflected in the pores of the base. The bread was baked at an excessive top heat, compared to today's baking practice. Sandy deposits in the inner parts of the fracture surface indicates that the bread was broken apart before its discovery. A radiological examination performed in Bern (Switzerland) showed that the superficial incision widened inwards slightly. The radiological images also showed two, mysterious metal particles of × and × , embedded in the dough.\n\nFrom his investigation of numerous archaeological bread finds, Max Währen receonstructed the original size of the complete bread roll, considering a 15% shrinkage by the charring to estimated × × .\n\nDue to typological determination of the ceramic vessel shards found in the pit, the Ovelgönne bread roll was dated to the early Iron Age, around 800-500 B.C.\n\nThe circumstances and the location of the Ovelgönne bread roll in the pit is the subject of debate. Some authors suggest a cultic context. This is attributed to the halving of the bread roll before its deposition and the baked in metal pieces. Whether the metal pieces were deliberately baked in or accidentally fell into the dough is unclear. Währen questions whether \"the Ovelgönne bread roll was a technical creation or a replica of a profane or ritual object.\" He sums up the importance of the object up as follows:\n\nHis opinion is based on the remarkable subtlety of the used wheat flour, which is close to grain sizes of modern flours, as well as the incision and the dipped in holes. Such dipped in holes are also known from an ancient Egyptian find dating around 2000-1778 BCE as well as from mosaics at the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna dating to the 6th Century. However, the dipped in hole on the Ovelgönne bread roll is the earliest prehistoric evidence for this technique in Europe.\n\n\n"}

In 1928 he joined the Marian Congregations of São Paulo and soon became a leader of that organization. In 1933 he helped organize the Catholic Electoral League and was elected to the nation’s Constitutional Convention by the \"Catholic bloc\", and at 24 was the youngest congressman in Brazil's history. His view of the Church has been described as ultramontanist and his political ideology anti-Communist.\n\nHe assumed the chair of Modern and Contemporary History at the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo. He was also the first president of the São Paulo Archdiocesan Board of Catholic Action. Corrêa de Oliveira became concerned with what he saw as progressivist deviations within Brazilian Catholic Action, associated with the ideas of the French Catholic philosopher, Jacques Maritain and attacked these changes in his 1943 book, \"In Defense of Catholic Action\".\n\nWith the arrival of a new archbishop in São Paulo in 1944, Corrêa de Oliveira lost his position as diocesan head of Catholic Action and in 1947 his directorship of the Catholic weekly \"Legionário\", which he had supervised since 1935. In 1951 he founded the magazine \"O Catolicismo\", together with the conservative bishops Antônio de Castro Mayer and Geraldo de Proença Sigaud. From 1968 to 1990 he wrote a column for the \"Folha de S.Paulo\", the city’s largest daily newspaper.\n\nCorrêa de Oliveira's Catholic social activism found new targets with the advent of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (founded in 1952) and the Latin American Episcopal Conference (CELAM) (founded in 1955) supporting liberation theology, and also with the Cuban revolution of 1959. To put his ideas into action, he founded the Brazilian Society for the Defence of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP) in 1960.\n\nCorrêa de Oliveira travelled to Rome for the opening session of Vatican II, describing it as \"a point in history as sad as the Death of Our Lord\" in which the Church was faced by the generalized, co-ordinated, and audacious action of its internal enemies. Oliveira was accompanied by members of the Brazilian TFP who brought twenty trunks of TFP literature. During the first session of the Council Oliveira provided a secretariat which served Brazilian bishops Antônio de Castro Mayer and Geraldo de Proença Sigaud and other bishops of the traditional faction, who ultimately formed the \"Coetus Internationalis Patrum\". Corrêa de Oliveira's opposition to the direction of the Council continued, and in a 1976 addendum to his book, \"Revolution and Counter-Revolution\", he described Vatican II as \"one of the greatest calamities, if not the greatest, in the history of the Church\". His strong opposition led to him being described as a \"revanchist\" within the ultra-traditional faction. However Plinio and those bishops drifted apart, as not all of them demonstrated obedience to the Chair of St. Peter, to which Corrêa de Oliveira was completely devoted to.\n\nHe served as president of the Brazilian TFP's national council until his death in 1995. His treatise, \"Revolution and Counter-Revolution\", inspired the founding of autonomous TFP groups in nearly 20 countries worldwide. An admirer of Thomas Aquinas, he was the author of 15 books and over 2,500 essays and articles. His works include: \"In Defense of Catholic Action\", \"Revolution and Counter-Revolution\", \"The Church and the Communist State: The Impossible Coexistence\", \"Nobility and Analogous Traditional Elites in the Allocutions of Pius XII\", and many others.\n\n"}

Korherr eventually held the rank of SS-Sturmbannführer.\n\nKorherr received his doctorate in 1926 and worked for the before Hitler's rise to power. He served as chairman of the Bavarian anti-separatist \"Reich und Heimat\" Committee in 1930-33, and became member of the Catholic Bavarian People's Party. On 1 January 1934 his department was taken over by the Bavarian Statistical Office, and he was transferred there.\n\nIn 1935-40 Korherr was Director of the Statistical Office of the city of Würzburg.<ref name=\"Götz/angaben\"> \"(also in)\" </ref> Following the invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II, on 9 December 1940 Himmler brought Korherr to Reichsführer-SS office, to study the progress of resettlement for him. Korherr's incredible problems with the SS began only when the German advance on the Russian front had been halted, resulting in the most damning statistic often attributed to him.<ref name=\"Götz/info\"></ref>\n\nDuring World War II Korherr was commissioned by Heinrich Himmler to calculate the number of Jews in Europe subject to \"special treatment\" (\"Sonderbehandlung\", an SS code name for mass murder) from 1937 to December 1942. Korherr completed his Korherr Report in January 1943 and handed it over to \"SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer\" Dr. Rudolf Brandt on the 23 March of that year. It was a 16-page document on the progress of the Holocaust as reflected in the dwindling numbers of Jews in Germany and German-occupied Europe. It included a seven-page supplement about the deportations in the first three months of 1943. The report was released under the title \"Die Endlösung der Judenfrage\" (). Korherr calculated that the number had fallen by 4 million, of whom 1,274,166 victims were delivered to camps for 'special treatment'. The exacting number of 1,274,166 Jews appeared in the Telegram sent by \"SS-Sturmbannführer\" Hermann Höfle on 11 January 1943 suggesting that both of them used data collected by the German Transport Authority. Himmler returned the document to its author and demanded a more innocuous word in place of the \"Sonderbehandlung\" to divert and obscure the crimes. Korherr replaced the phrase with \"Durchgeschleust\" suggesting that the quoted numbers of Jews had \"passed through\" the so-called \"Durchgangslager\" (transit camps). A summary of his report was delivered to Adolf Hitler by Brandt.\n\nIn 1945-46 he was under so-called 'automatic arrest' as state functionary, however he did not face the Nuremberg Trials, because his Report was not revealed and he later claimed he never heard about the extermination before 1945.\n\nLater Korherr worked at the Federal Ministry of Finance in West Germany. He also lectured at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 1959–62. Korherr died in the city of Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, on 24 November 1989 at the age of 86.\n"}
{"id": "151774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151774", "title": "SPQR", "text": "SPQR\n\nSPQR is an initialism of a phrase in (\"The Roman Senate and People\", or more freely as \"The Senate and People of Rome\"; ), referring to the government of the ancient Roman Republic. It appears on Roman currency, at the end of documents made public by inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public works.\n\nThe phrase commonly appears in the Roman political, legal, and historical literature, such as the speeches of Cicero and \"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\" (\"Books from the Founding of the City\") of Livy.\n\nToday this initialism is used as an official emblem of the modern-day comune (municipality) of Rome.\n\nSPQR: \"Senātus Populusque Rōmānus\".\nIn Latin, \"Senātus\" is a nominative singular noun meaning \"Senate\". \"Populusque\" is compounded from the nominative noun \"Populus\", \"the People\", and \"-que\", an enclitic particle meaning \"and\" which connects the two nominative nouns. The last word, \"Rōmānus\" (\"Roman\") is an adjective modifying the whole of \"Senātus Populusque\": the \"Roman Senate and People\", taken as a whole.\n\nThus, the phrase is translated literally as \"The Roman Senate and People\", or more freely as \"The Senate and People of Rome\".\n\nThe title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from c. 80 BC onwards. Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on coins, was simply \"ROMA\". The abbreviation last appears on coins of Constantine the Great (ruled 312–337 AD), the first Roman emperor to support Christianity.\n\nThe two legal entities mentioned, \"Senātus\" and the \"Populus Rōmānus\", are sovereign when combined. However, where \"populus\" is sovereign alone, \"Senātus\" is not. Under the Roman Kingdom, neither entity was sovereign. The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than the foundation of the Republic.\n\nThis signature continued in use under the Roman Empire. The emperors were considered the \"de jure\" representatives of the people even though the \"senātūs consulta\", or decrees of the Senate, were made at the \"de facto\" pleasure of the emperor.\n\n\"Populus Rōmānus\" in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government of the People. When the Romans named governments of other countries, they used populus in the singular or plural, such as \"populī Prīscōrum Latīnōrum\", \"the governments of the Old Latins\". \"Rōmānus\" is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in \"cīvis Rōmānus\", \"Roman citizen\".\n\nThe Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases as \"dignitās\", \"maiestās\", \"auctoritās\", \"lībertās populī Rōmānī\", the \"dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people\". They were a \"populus līber\", \"a free people\". There was an \"exercitus, imperium, iudicia, honorēs, consulēs, voluntās\" of this same \"populus\": \"the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people\". They appear in early Latin as \"Popolus\" and \"Poplus\", so the habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.\n\nThe Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the consuls and praetors, and the \"comitia centuriāta\", \"committee of the centuries\", whose will came to be safeguarded by the Tribunes.\n\nOne of the ways the emperor Commodus (180–192) paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order is provocatively reversed (\"Populus Senatusque...\").\n\nBeginning in 1184, the Commune of Rome struck coins in the name of the SENATVS P Q R. From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.\n\nDuring the regime of Benito Mussolini, SPQR was emblazoned on a number of public buildings and manhole covers in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a \"New Roman Empire\".\n\nEven in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used as the municipal symbol of the city of Rome.\n\n\"SPQx\" is sometimes used as an assertion of municipal pride and civic rights. The Italian town of Reggio Emilia, for instance, has SPQR in its coat of arms, standing for \"Senatus Populusque Regiensis\". There have been confirmed usages and reports of the deployment of the \"SPQx\" template in;\n\nSome members of white supremacist groups have been using the acronym SPQR on flags, on their person (such as tattoos) and other forms of identification. The movement's enthusiasm for other symbols of republican Rome, such as the axe and bundled rods known as fasces, is documented, as well as their interest in some aspects of republican and imperial Rome. That use was discussed on Stormfront's bulletin boards and was noticed at white supremacist demonstrations.\n\nWhite supremacists tend to associate \"SPQR\" with the militaristic ethos of the Roman legions. There is no clear evidence that it appeared regularly on Roman military insignia and equipment, but SPQR was heavily used by Mussolini's fascist regime.\n\nWhile some white supremacists have adopted SPQR as a sort of badge, one should not confuse that usage with the large number of groups and individuals who also use it for other purposes.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the letters \"SPQR\" could sometimes be seen displayed on London market traders' stalls, meaning \"Small Profits, Quick Returns\".\n\n\"MPQN\", standing for \"Metallica Populusque Nimus\", appears on the cover of the Metallica live DVD \"Français Pour une Nuit\", which was recorded in the Arena of Nîmes, a remodelled Roman amphiteatre.\n\nThe Italians have long used a different and humorous expansion of this acronym, \"Sono Pazzi Questi Romani\" (literally: \"They're crazy, these Romans\").\nIn the Asterix and Obelix comics, Obelix often uses the French translation of this phrase, \"Ils sont fous ces Romains\", and in the Italian editions, the original phrase is used.\n\nIn the cover of the Spanish Mort & Phil comic album \"\", Mort is carried on a litter as a Roman emperor, while his partner Phil holds a Roman standard topped by an umbrella with the \"tituli\" SPOR and SI LLUEVE (a pun, since \"Es por si llueve\" means \"Just in case it rains\" in Spanish).\n\nIn \"The Heroes of Olympus\" series by Rick Riordan, SPQR is tattooed on the arms of members of the Roman Legion. In the film \"Gladiator\" the protagonist sports a similar tattoo.\n\nThe \"SPQR\" series is a collection of historical mystery stories by John Maddox Roberts set in the time of the Roman Republic.\n\nS.P.Q.R. Records was an American popular music record label, a subsidiary of Legrand Records, which flourished in the 1960s and included Gary U.S. Bonds among its artists. The label was founded by Frank Guida, who is believed to have adopted the name in allusion to his Italian origins.\n\nIn the Internet meme Polandball, the Roman Empire is represented by SPQRball.\n\nThe football team A.S. Roma wore special edition shirts with SPQR on the chest for their match against city rivals S.S. Lazio on 29 April 2017.\n\nS.P.Q.R. is the fourth song on the critically acclaimed experimental rock album \"Deceit\" by This Heat. The song talks about atomic destruction and human morals using symbols of Rome.\n\n"}

It was adopted at the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2, 1836, and formally signed the next day after mistakes were noted in the text.\n\nIn October 1835, settlers in Mexican Texas launched the Texas Revolution.\n\nHowever, within Austin, many struggled with understanding what was the ultimate goal of the Revolution. Some believed that the goal should be total independence from Mexico, while others sought the reimplementation of the Mexican Constitution of 1824 (which offered greater freedoms than the centralist government declared in Mexico the prior year). To settle the issue, a convention was called for March 1836.\n\nThis convention differed from the previous Texas councils of 1832, 1833, and the 1835 Consultation. Many of the delegates to the 1836 convention were young men who had only recently arrived in Texas from the United States, in violation of the immigration ban of April, 1830, although many of them had participated in one of the battles in 1835. The only two known native Texans to sign are Jose Francisco Ruiz and Jose Antonio Navarro. Most of the delegates were members of the War Party and were adamant that Texas must declare its independence from Mexico. Forty-one delegates arrived in Washington-on-the-Brazos on February 28.\n\nThe convention was convened on March 1 with Richard Ellis as president. The delegates selected a committee of five to draft a declaration of independence; the committee was led by George Childress and also included Edward Conrad, James Gaines, Bailey Hardeman, and Collin McKinney. The committee submitted its draft within a mere 24 hours, leading historians to speculate that Childress had written much of it before his arrival at the Convention.\n\nThe declaration was approved on March 2 with no debate. Based primarily on the writings of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson, the declaration proclaimed that the Mexican government \"ceased to protect the lives, liberty, and property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers are derived\" and complained about \"arbitrary acts of oppression and tyranny\". Throughout the declaration are numerous references to the United States laws, rights, and customs. Omitted from the declaration was the fact that the author and many of the signatories were occupying Texas illegally, and therefore had no legal rights in the government of Mexico. The declaration makes clear that the men were accustomed to the laws and privileges of the United States, and were unfamiliar with the language, religion, and traditions of the nation that they were rebelling against.\n\nThe declaration officially established the Republic of Texas.\n\nAmong others, the declaration mentions the following reasons for the separation:\n\n\nBased upon the United States Declaration of Independence, the Texas Declaration also contains many memorable expressions of American political principles:\n\n\nSixty men signed the Texas Declaration of Independence. Three of them were born in Mexico. Fifty-seven of the sixty moved to Texas from the United States. Ten of them had lived in Texas for more than six years, while one-quarter of them had been in the province for less than a year. This is significant, because it indicates that the majority of signatories had moved to Texas after the Law of April 6, 1830, banning immigration, had taken effect, meaning that the majority were legally citizens of the United States, occupying Texas illegally. Fifty-nine of these men were delegates to the Convention, and one was the Convention Secretary, Herbert S. Kimble, who was not a delegate.\n\n\n\n\n"}

II, or the Tiberius Bede, is an 8th-century illuminated manuscript of Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\". It is one of only four surviving 8th-century manuscripts of Bede, another of which happens to be MS Cotton Tiberius A. XIV, produced at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey. As such it is one of the closest texts to Bede's autograph. The manuscript has 155 vellum folios. This manuscript may have been the Latin text on which the Alfredian Old English translation of Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\" was based. The manuscript is decorated with zoomorphic initials in a partly Insular and partly Continental style.\n\nThe manuscript has given its name to the 'Tiberius' group of manuscripts, connected on stylistic grounds and sometimes also known as the 'Canterbury' group, though the region of their production remains unknown – Mercia has also been suggested. Apart from the Tiberius Bede, the group includes: Vespasian Psalter, Stockholm Codex Aureus, Barberini Gospels, Book of Cerne, Blickling Psalter, Codex Bigotianus (BnF MS lat. 281, 298), Royal Bible (British Library MS Royal 1.E.vi), Royal Prayerbook, Book of Nunnaminster, Harleian Prayerbook, Saint Petersburg Gospels, Anglian collection manuscript V (British Library MS Cotton Vespasian B.vi, folios 104–109), BnF MS lat. 10861, Bodleian Library MS Hatton 93, Salisbury Cathedral Library MS 117, and a number of other manuscripts.\n\n"}

{"id": "197868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197868", "title": "World Book Encyclopedia", "text": "World Book Encyclopedia\n\nThe World Book Encyclopedia is an encyclopedia published in the United States. The company's \"mission is to enhance learning and reading for children around the world by developing trustworthy, engaging content to create products that will engage children of all ages at home, on the go, in the classroom or in libraries worldwide. We aspire to establish World Book as a renowned, global, adaptive, and mission-driven enterprise that helps kids learn and read throughout their entire childhood journey.\" The encyclopedia was designed to cover major areas of knowledge uniformly, but it shows particular strength in scientific, technical, and medical subjects. It is based in Chicago, Illinois. The first edition (1917) contained eight volumes. New editions have since appeared every year except 1920, 1924, and 1932, with major revisions in 1929 (13 volumes), 1947 (19 volumes), 1960 (20 volumes), 1971 (22 volumes), and 1988 (new typeface and page design, and some 10,000 new editorial features). Today, the company claims that World Book is the most up-to-date commercial encyclopedia, with over 2,500 pages updated in 2016 and more than 14,000 pages in total.\n\nWorld Book also publishes children's non-fiction and picture books under the Bright Connections Media imprint, and educational development and supplemental instructional resources through Incentive Publications by World Book.\n\nThe 1917 edition was published by the Hanson-Roach-Fowler Company, but within two years, \"World Book\" became the property of W.F. Quarrie & Company. In 1945, the \"World Book\" became the property of Field Enterprises. In 1978, \"World Book\" was purchased by Scott Fetzer Company, which in turn has been a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway since 1985.\n\nThe first edition of \"The World Book Encyclopedia\" was published (as simply \"The World Book\") in 1917. \"As a rule,\" writes founding editor Michael Vincent O'Shea (professor of education at the University of Wisconsin) in the preface of that first edition, \"encyclopedias are apt to be quite formal and technical. A faithful effort has been made in the World Book to avoid this common defect.\" Since the encyclopedia first appeared in print, it has grown from 8 volumes to 22 volumes, from a set with limited color plates to one with color throughout. Over the years, the \"World Book\" has been characterized by its design. Unlike most other encyclopedias, it is traditionally published in variously sized volumes, depending on the letter of the alphabet. Although most volumes cover exactly one letter completely, the letters with exceptionally numerous entries (\"C\" and \"S\") are divided between two volumes, while adjacent letters with relatively few entries (\"J\"–\"K\", \"N\"–\"O\", \"Q\"–\"R\", \"U\"–\"V\", and \"W\"–\"Z\") share a volume. \"World Book\" editors lay out major articles distinctly, often starting them on a page of their own, perhaps with a two-column heading. Materials are reviewed and authored by experts. It recognizes that one of the primary uses of general-purpose encyclopedias is students' work on school reports. For instance, every article for a U.S. state has a box giving information about such things as the official state bird and tree and each President of the United States gets a very distinctive look with an oversized portrait, a timeline and significant historical events that occurred during that president's administration.\n\nIn 1962 \"World Book\" produced a Braille edition, which filled 145 volumes and nearly 40,000 pages. It was the first encyclopedia in Braille. The project was mainly an effort in goodwill, for the company did not see its way clear to selling enough copies of the set to cover production costs. Eventually, all sets of the Braille edition were donated to several institutions for the blind. In 1964 the company also published a large-print edition.\n\nAn international version, aimed at English-speakers outside of North America, was also produced in 1992.\n\nSince 1998, in addition to the print and CD-ROM editions of the 22-volume, 13,800-page encyclopedia, \"World Book\" also publishes an online version called \"World Book Online\". The online version includes 23 subscription databases with all of the articles contained in the print set, as well as several thousand additional articles and the contents of every yearbook \"World Book\" has published since 1922. Articles are also available in Spanish. The online version contains links to current web sites and magazine articles, a news section, and video and audio samples.\n\n\"World Book Encyclopedia\" is also published in electronic form for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X. Electronic editions contain the entire text of the 22-volume \"World Book Encyclopedia\", plus illustrations, video clips, 3D panoramic views, and sounds. The articles bring together a complete story, multimedia content, an article outline, research aids and links to related information. Online updates to articles and a \"Month in Brief\" time browser are available by subscription.\n\nApple included a bundled copy of the Mac OS X Edition of \"World Book Encyclopedia\" when they made OS X the default operating system for all new computers. This edition had some Mac-only features including a more intuitive user interface, Sticky Notes sharing via Bonjour technology, \"Trivia Challenge\" game, a collection of editor-approved webcams, Notepad, speech capabilities and \"This Day in History\", \"Media Showcase\" and \"Librarian\" widgets.\n\nSince November 2007, both the Windows and Mac electronic editions of \"World Book Encyclopedia\" have been developed and published by Software MacKiev.\n\nOther \"World Book\" products include:\n\n\n"}
