However, educators and social commentators traditionally have advocated for eliminating AAVE usage through the public-education system for a variety of reasons, ranging from a continued belief that AAVE is intrinsically deficient to arguments that its use, by being stigmatized in certain social contexts, is socially limiting. Some of the harshest criticism of AAVE or its use has come from African Americans. A conspicuous example was the \"Pound Cake speech\", in which Bill Cosby criticized some African Americans for various social behaviors, including the way they talked.\n\nFaced with such attitudes, the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), a division of National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), issued a position statement on students' rights to their own language. This was adopted by CCCC members in April 1974 and appeared in a special issue of \"College Composition and Communication\" in Fall of 1974. The resolution was as follows:\n\nWe affirm the students' right to their own patterns and varieties of language—the dialects of their nurture or whatever dialects in which they find their own identity and style. Language scholars long ago denied that the myth of a standard American dialect has any validity. The claim that any one dialect is unacceptable amounts to an attempt of one social group to exert its dominance over another. Such a claim leads to false advice for speakers and writers and immoral advice for humans. A nation proud of its diverse heritage and its cultural and racial variety will preserve its heritage of dialects. We affirm strongly that teachers must have the experiences and training that will enable them to respect diversity and uphold the right of students to their own language.\n\nAround this time, pedagogical techniques similar to those used to teach English to speakers of foreign languages were shown to hold promise for speakers of AAVE. William Stewart experimented with the use of dialect readers—sets of text in both AAVE and standard English. The idea was that children could learn to read in their own dialect and then shift to \"Standard English\" with subsequent textbooks. developed a comprehensive set of dialect readers, called bridge readers, which included the same content in three different dialects: AAVE, a \"bridge\" version that was closer to \"Standard American English\" without being prohibitively formal, and a Standard English version. Despite studies that showed promise for such \"Standard English as a Second Dialect\" (SESD) programs, reaction to them was largely hostile and both Stewart's research and the Bridge Program were rejected for various political and social reasons, including strong resistance from parents.\n\nA more formal shift in the recognition of AAVE came in the \"Ann Arbor Decision\" of 1979 (\"Martin Luther King Junior Elementary School Children et al., v. Ann Arbor School District\"). In it, a federal judge of the Eastern District of Michigan ruled that in teaching black children to read, a school board must adjust to the children's dialect, not the children to the school, and that, by not taking students' language into consideration, teachers were contributing to the failure of such students to read and use mainstream English proficiently.\n\nNational attitudes towards AAVE were revisited when a controversial resolution from the Oakland (California) school board (Oakland Unified School District) on December 18, 1996, called for \"Ebonics\" to be recognized as a language of African Americans. In fact, ebonics would be classified as a \"second language\". The proposal was to implement a program similar to the Language Development Program for African American Students (LDPAAS) in Los Angeles, which began in 1988 and uses methods from the SESD programs mentioned above.\n\nLike other similar programs, the Oakland resolution was widely misunderstood as intended to teach AAVE and \"elevate it to the status of a written language.\" It gained national attention and was derided and criticized, most notably by Jesse Jackson and Kweisi Mfume who regarded it as an attempt to teach slang to children. The statement that \"African Language Systems are genetically based\" also contributed to the negative reaction because \"genetically\" was popularly misunderstood to imply that African Americans had a biological predisposition to a particular language. In an amended resolution, this phrase was removed and replaced with wording that states African American language systems \"have origins in West and Niger–Congo languages and are not merely dialects of English. . . .\"\n\nThe Oakland proposal was explained as follows: that black students would perform better in school and more easily learn standard American English if textbooks and teachers incorporated AAVE in teaching black children to speak Standard English rather than mistakenly equating nonstandard with substandard and dismissing AAVE as the latter. point to these linguistic barriers, and common reactions by teachers, as a primary cause of reading difficulties and poor school performance.\n\nMore recently, research has been conducted on the overrepresentation of African Americans in special education argue that this is because AAVE speech characteristics are often erroneously considered to be signs of speech development problems, prompting teachers to refer children to speech pathologists.\n\nAccording to Smitherman, the controversy and debates concerning AAVE in public schools imply deeper deterministic attitudes towards the African-American community as a whole. Smitherman describes this as a reflection of the \"power elite's perceived insignificance and hence rejection of Afro-American language and culture\". She also asserts that African Americans are forced to conform to European American society in order to succeed, and that conformity ultimately means the \"eradication of black language . . . and the adoption of the linguistic norms of the white middle class.\" The necessity for \"bi-dialectialism\" (AAVE and General American) means \"some blacks contend that being bi-dialectal not only causes a schism in the black personality, but it also implies such dialects are 'good enough' for blacks but not for whites.\" \n\nThe case of \"Martin Luther King Junior Elementary School Children et al. v. Ann Arbor School District\", known as the Ann Arbor Decision, is considered to have established an important precedent in the education of poor African American students who are Black English speakers.\n\nThe case was decided on July 12, 1979 by Judge Charles W. Joiner on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The suit was brought on behalf of poor black students at the school. Gabe Kaimowitz, lead counsel for the Plaintiffs, alleged that the students were denied equal protection of the laws, because applicable Michigan regulations did not recognize social, economic and cultural factors differing those pupils from others. Black middle class students at the school were not represented among the plaintiffs. Judge Joiner in 1977 and 1978 rejected five of the six claims. The sixth claim asserted that the Ann Arbor School District violated federal statutory law because it failed to take into account the home language of the children in the provision of education instruction. The court agreed. The judge ordered the school district to find a way to identify Black English speakers in the schools and to \"use that knowledge in teaching such students how to read standard English\". \n\nIn 1954, most of the United States had racially segregated schools, which was made legal by the \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" case in 1896. In the case it held that segregated public schools were constitutional as long as the black and white children in the schools were equal. Throughout the middle of the twentieth century many civil rights groups and leaders challenged the school board's racial segregation through legal and political action. One of the actions, Brown v. Board of Education was filed, and is an important and significant case, which ultimately led up to the Ann Arbor Decision. The Brown v. Board of Education case was filed against Topeka and it went over how it violated the 14th amendment. The case paved the way for integration in many public schools across the United States, but black students still faced many problems as stated in the Ann Arbor Decision. \n\nOn December 18, 1996, the Oakland Unified School District school board of Oakland, California, United States, passed a controversial resolution recognizing the legitimacy of Ebonicswhat mainstream linguists more commonly term African American English (AAE)as an African language. The resolution set off a firestorm of media criticism and ignited a national debate.\n\nFor students whose primary language was Ebonics, the Oakland resolution mandated some instruction in this, both for \"maintaining the legitimacy and richness of such language ... and to facilitate their acquisition and mastery of English language skills.\" This also included the proposed increase of salaries of those proficient in both Ebonics and Standard English to the level of those teaching limited English proficiency (LEP) students and the use of public funding to help teachers learn AAE themselves.\n\nSome interpretations of the controversial issues in the resolution include the idea that Ebonics is not a vernacular or dialect of English, that it is a separate language; a member of the African language family; that African Americans particular language and their dialects; that speakers of Ebonics should qualify for federally funded programs traditionally restricted to bilingual populations; and that students would be taught American Standard English via Ebonics. The Rev. Jesse Jackson condemned the resolution, saying \"I understand the attempt to reach out to these children, but this is an unacceptable surrender, borderlining on disgrace.\" His comments were seconded by former Secretary of Education William Bennett, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, and Senator Joe Lieberman. Jackson would later reverse his position, attributing his initial opposition to a misunderstanding of the school district's proposal. He said, \"They're not trying to teach Black English as a standard language. They're looking for tools to teach children standard English so they might be competitive.\"\n\nThe original resolution caused a great deal of consternation and anger, which fueled the controversy. On January 15, 1997, Oakland's school board passed an amended resolution. The original resolution used the phrase \"genetically based\" which was commonly understood to mean that African Americans have a biological predisposition to a particular language, while the authors of the resolution insisted that it was referring to \"linguistic\" genetics. This phrase was removed in the amended resolution and replaced with the statement that African American language systems \"have origins in West and Niger-Congo languages and are not merely dialects of English.\"\n\nSome linguists and associated organizations issued statements in support of recognizing the legitimacy of African American English as a language system:\n\nWalt Wolfram, a linguist at North Carolina State University, wrote that this controversy exposed the intensity of people's beliefs and opinions about language and language diversity, the persistent and widespread level of public misinformation about the issues of language variation and education, and the need for informed knowledge about language diversity and its role in education and in public life.\n\nHowever, in response to the amended resolution claiming that African American language systems \"are not merely dialects of English\", there have been some statements in opposition from linguists, since linguists do primarily regard African-American English as a dialect or variety of English. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "804126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=804126", "title": "Ascended master", "text": "Ascended master\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, Ascended Masters are believed to be spiritually enlightened beings who in past incarnations were ordinary humans, but who have undergone a series of spiritual transformations originally called initiations.\n\nBoth \"Mahatma\" and \"Ascended Master\" are terms used in the Ascended Master Teachings. Ascended Master is based on the theosophical concept of the Mahatma or Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. However, Mahatmas and Ascended Masters are believed by some to differ in certain respects.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, a \"Master\", \"Commoner\", \"Shaman\", or \"Spiritual Master\" is a human being who has taken the Fifth Initiation and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 5th dimension. An \"Ascended Master\" is a human being who has taken the Sixth Initiation, also referred to as Ascension, and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 6th dimension. An \"Ascended Master\" is a human being who has regained full union with his \"Mighty I AM Presence.\" When a human being has regained full union with his \"Mighty I AM Presence,\" that state of full union is referred to as \"Ascension.\" Technically, a human being \"ascends\" when he takes the Sixth Initiation, and not before then.\n\nA \"Chohan\" (Lord) of a \"Ray\" is an Ascended Master who has been placed in charge of one of the 12 \"Rays\" (until recently, 7 Rays were generally known, and 5 Rays were \"secret\"), due to having an extraordinary natural spiritual affinity for that Ray. A \"Ray\" is a concentrated stream of spiritual energy emanating, ultimately, from the Godhead. Each \"Ray\" is the embodiment/expression of one of the 12 great God-Qualities, such as Divine Will, Divine Wisdom, Divine Love, etc. The \"Chohans (Lords) of the Rays\" thus constitute a special grouping of Ascended Masters (Sixth Level Initiates).\n\nThose who have taken the Seventh Initiation hold the Senior Administrative Posts in the Great White Brotherhood on Earth. These senior administrative posts are divided into 3 departments: The Department of the Manu, the Department of the Planetary Christ, and the Department of the Mahachohan. \"\n\nA \"Lord of the World\" is a human being (or another organism) who has taken the Ninth Initiation. According to ascended master teaching, The Ninth Initiation is the highest Initiation possible on, what is believed to be a 9d-dimensional planet grid such as Earth by Ascended Master Teaching believers. They believe this will be until the end of 21 December, 2012. Sanat Kumara (a \"Lord of the Flame\" originally from the higher-dimensional levels of the planet Venus) was the original being who held the spiritual office of \"Lord of the World\" here on planet Earth.\n\nThe term \"Ascended Master\" was first used by Baird T. Spalding in 1924 in his series of books, \"The Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East\" (DeVorss and Co.). Godfre Ray King further popularized this concept of spiritual masters who had once lived on the earth in his book \"Unveiled Mysteries\" (1934) by Guy Ballard (1878-1939). Ballard was the founder of the first \"Ascended Master Teaching\" in modern times, known as The \"I AM\" Activity (in full: The \"I AM\" Religious Activity of the Saint Germain Foundation ). The teachings were continued and embellished by later organizations such as The Bridge to Freedom (founded 1951) (known in the 1980s as The New Age Church of the Christ, and later as The Bridge to Spiritual Freedom), The Summit Lighthouse (founded 1958) and its successor organization the Church Universal and Triumphant, and various other organizations such as the White Eagle Lodge (1936). A more modern form of the teachings, which did not rely on \"channeled\" messages, was given by a former associate of Godfre Ray King, Pearl Dorris, in Mount Shasta, California, beginning on October 20, 1972 and continuing until her death in Yreka, California in 1990 (See her biography: \"Lady Master Pearl, My Teacher\" by Peter Mt. Shasta, also the book she helped channel, \"Step by Step: Ascended Master Discourses\"). Her emphasis was on learning to feel and identify with the I AM Presence within, rather than invoking the \"Presence\" as an external mental principle. Under her tutelage, Peter Mt. Shasta was trained to continue the Masters' teachings, working today to incorporate the inner teachings of the Far East and their emphasis on self-observation, with the dynamic I AM teachings that uses affirmations to develop mastery in daily life. See \"Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II\". In Peter Mt. Shasta's third autobiographical book \"My Search in Tibet for the Secret Wish-Fulfilling Jewel\" he mentions the widely held belief in Tibet that yogis ascend, \"jalus\" (Tibetan), by dissolving the five elements and raising the Nirmanakaya and Sambogakaya bodies into the Dharmakaya (known also as Atman, Monad, or I AM Presence).\n\nThe rays, the divine evolutions of peoples and planets are represented by 7 colors (new age) and more 5 colors (new age gold or solar rays). The colors of new age and solar rays are (in order): 1 blue (power of faith); 2 yellow (obedience); 3 pink (beauty; geniality); 4 white (ascension; peace; light); 5 green (nature); 6 red (true resurrection); 7 violet (New Age of Master Saint Germain); 8 turquoise (lucidity); 9 magenta (divine wonder; justiciars); 10 gold (materialization of wealth); 11 orange (sunshine); 12 Opaline (renewal).\n\nStudents of Ascended Master Teachings organizations (also known as Ascended Master Activities) believe that the Presence of Life — God — individualizes as \"Mighty I AM Presences,\" which then incarnate in lower-dimensional subtle and gross bodies throughout the created universes. They believe that their Teachings have been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters. Ascended Masters are believed to be individuals who have lived in physical bodies, acquired the Wisdom and Mastery needed to become Immortal and Free of the cycles of \"re-embodiment\" and karma, and have attained their \"Ascension\" (the Sixth Initiation). They consider the Ascension to be the complete permanent union of the raised and purified outer self with their Mighty \"I AM\" Presence - that True Identity that is the unique Individualization of Almighty God residing in each person. This knowledge is believed to have previously been taught for millions of years only within \"Ascended Master Retreats\" and \"Mystery Schools\". It is believed by adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that this wisdom was partially released by the Theosophical Society beginning in 1875, by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey, and began to have more detailed public release in the 1930s by the \"Ascended Masters\" through Guy Ballard in the I AM Activity. However, theosophists maintain that the concept of Ascended Master is an exaggeration and corruption of the more modest theosophical concept of \"Master of the Ancient Wisdom.\" A similar problematic conflation of the term exits in the case of the Alice Bailey teachings. (p. 111)\nThe term \"Ascended Master\" was first introduced in 1934 by Guy Ballard [note :contradicts earlier statement \"The term \"Ascended Master\" was first used by Baird T. Spalding in 1924] in his work titled \"Unveiled Mysteries\", a book which he said was dictated to him by the Ascended Master St. Germain. Other Ascended Master Teachings are contained in The Bridge to Freedom (1951), Mark Prophet and Elizabeth Clare Prophet's The Summit Lighthouse (1958) (reorganized as the Church Universal and Triumphant in 1975), The Temple of The Presence (1995), The Hearts Center (2002), the I AM University (2004), and various other organizations such as the White Eagle Lodge (1936) and the Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (2006).\n\nOriginally presented by Helena P. Blavatsky in the 1870s, the idea of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Mahatmas was adopted by people who at some point had had a connection with the Theosophical movement, such as Alice Bailey, Helena Roerich, and Manly P. Hall. Later on many other organizations, especially in the United States, developed the concept of Ascended Masters, which departs from the theosophical one in several aspects.\n\nIt is believed that Ascended Masters are individuals who were formerly embodied on the Earth and learned the lessons of life during their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the matter planes, balanced at least 51% of negative karma, and fulfilled their Dharma (divine plan). An Ascended Master, in such an understanding, has become God-like and a source of unconditional \"Divine Love\" to all life, and through the Ascension has united with his or her own \"God Self,\" the \"I AM Presence.\"\n\nIt is further claimed by various groups and teachers that the Ascended Masters serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of Spirit, and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. According to these teachings, they remain attentive to the spiritual needs of humanity, and act to inspire and motivate its spiritual growth. In many traditions and organizations, they are considered part of the \"Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth\", and members of the \"Great Brotherhood of Light\", also known as the \"Great White Lodge,\" \"Great White Brotherhood,\" or \"Universal White Brotherhood\" (per Peter Deunov).\n\nAccording to Alice Bailey and Benjamin Creme there are sixty \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\", defined as beings who have reached the Fifth Level of Initiation or above, with Djwhal Khul in a pivotal role as the master who telepathically dictated the many esoteric teachings in Baileys' books. Elizabeth Clare Prophet revealed, by taking \"dictations\" from them, the names of many dozens of additional Ascended Masters that were previously unknown.\n\nThe concept of recognizing the spiritual self, one's own psychological and karma battles and how to overcome them, and eventual Ascension of all humanity is covered in James Redfield's \"Celestine Prophecy\" and its sequels, \"\" and \"\". These books, while controversial, are recent popularizations of the concept of Ascension.\n\nIn Ascended Master teachings there is also mention of Serapis Bey, a being who was incarnated as a high priest in one of the \"Temples of the Sacred Fire\" on Atlantis, and who migrated to Egypt at the time of the destruction of Atlantis. It is also believed that he was incarnated as the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III (who constructed the Temple of Luxor to the god Amon) and also as Leonidas, the King of Sparta, who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of Thermopylae against the invasion of Greece by Emperor Xerxes I of the Persian Empire. According to teachings of Agni Yoga, Serapis Bey purports to be, in past lives, the Roman king Numa Pompilius, and the philosophers Confucius, Plato and Seneca the Younger (Lucius Annaeus Seneca). He is referred to in the book \"Supermundane\" as \"The Thinker\".\n\nThis is properly called Isness; students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that there is One God, the \"Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life\", \"The One\", Who is the Source of all Love, Light, and Truth in existence, and that all forms of existence and consciousness emanate from this \"Allness of God\" - \"The One\". \"The Voice of the I AM\" states \"All Life is One\" and that there is \"One Substance, One Energy, One Power, One Intelligence\" as the Source of all consciousness and creation. This Divine Being and Mind is considered to be above and distinct from all creation (in the sense of classical theism), transcending all creation yet interpenetrating all existence. Belief in this one God stresses the essential unity of the spiritual and material components of the universe. God creates through Individualized Identities that have distinct Self-Consciousness and that make up the Spiritual Hierarchy of Creation, yet remain connected through the flow of the \"River of Life\" and \"Lifestream\" to the one undivided God — the All in All — the Good — the Source from which all Life, Light, and Love come.(or from which all things, yin & yang come. Even what one may perceive as darkness \"evil\" or \"bad\" is in someway working out for the Good and toward the elevation and ascension of all people. All things pervading or pouring out from the One perfect intelligent mind i.e. God), there is always an uninterrupted Oneness that is maintained with the Allness of God. From the One God all other realities, including Hierarchy, humanity and the material universe, are the result of a process of emanation.\n\nThis is properly called Atma Brahman; adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that each person is an incarnation of an \"Individualized Presence\" of the \"Most High Living God\" — the \"Mighty I AM Presence\" — as part of humans' very nature and being. God (as Life and Love) manifests in the 7 octaves of the created universe through individual Divine Identities. As embodied individuals, we are the outer expression of that God Self in form. It is our unique and immortal True Identity, yet always sharing in the Allness of the ONE GOD.\n\nThe founder of the Theosophical Society, Helen Blavatsky, in the late 19th century brought attention to the idea of secret initiatory knowledge, by claiming her ideas were based on traditions taught to her by a group of highly enlightened yogis which she called the Mahatmas or Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. These Mahatmas, she claimed, were physical beings living in the Himalayas, usually understood as Tibet:\n\nAfter Blavatsky's death in 1891, the concept of the Mahatmas was developed by her successors in the Theosophical Society leadership, Annie Besant and Charles W. Leadbeater, who described them in great detail and added Master Jesus and Maitreya. In Leadbeater's book, \"The Masters and the Path\" (1925), the Masters are presented as human beings full of wisdom and compassion, albeit still limited by human bodies, which they choose to retain in order to keep in touch with humanity and help in its evolution.\n\nLater organizations that used many of the teachings of Theosophy for their own purposes, developed concept of Ascended Masters which bears some important differences with the Theosophical one. The ascended master Saint Germain has been releasing the ancient teachings in a more modern and simplified form, as can be found in the books of Peter Mt. Shasta, which show how the Masters can work with those who have an open heart and the desire to benefit humanity.\n\nBelief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the beliefs of various organizations that have continued and expanded the concepts released in the original Saint Germain instruction in the 1930s through The \"I AM\" Activity. Examples of those believed by the ones proposing these teachings to be Ascended Masters would be the Master Jesus, Confucius, Gautama Buddha, Mary the Mother of Jesus, St. Paul of Tarsus, Megha Alcorn as known as Megan Sebastian, Ashtar Sheran, Merku, Sanat Kumara, Aaron as known as Alaje, Aleph, Hatton, (aka Hilarion), Melchizedek, Archangel Michael, Metatron, Kwan Yin, St. Germain and Kuthumi, as well as dozens of others.\n\n\"Unveiled Mysteries\" says:\n\nJesus is one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy and is one of the Ascended masters (also collectively called the Great White Brotherhood; with white being in reference to the light) in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by Alice Bailey and was later regarded by students of the \"Ascended Master Teachings\" as the Master of the Sixth Ray.\n\nIt is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was \"Chohan of the Sixth Ray\" until December 31, 1959, when, according to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Lady Master Nada fully took on that Office in the Spiritual Hierarchy. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with Kuthumi, on January 1, 1956, succeeding Maitreya, who took the Office of \"Planetary Buddha\" and \"Cosmic Christ\". This belief is not accepted by adherents of traditional Theosophy and the followers of Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme - they believe that the Master Jesus is still the Chohan of the Sixth Ray and that Maitreya is still the World Teacher.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the Prophet of the Church Universal and Triumphant, the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC. He did this in order to aid the white magicians in the war of the white magicians and the black magicians that was going on in Atlantis at that time.\n\nAccording to Alice A. Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as Joshua, the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and Joshua the High Priest in the sixth century BC.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Jesus was also incarnated as Joseph of the Coat of many colors in the 17th century BC/16th century BC (approximately between 1650 BC and 1550 BC), as well as King David (who lived c. 1037 BC until around 970 BC), and Elisha in the 9th century BC.\n\nAccording to the post-1900 publications of Theosophy (specifically, the writings of Charles W. Leadbeater, Alice A. Bailey, and Benjamin Creme, as well as the Ascended Master Teachings of Guy Ballard, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Geraldine Innocente, Joshua David Stone, and other Ascended Master Teachings teachers), Sanat Kumara is an \"advanced being\" of the Ninth Initiation (the highest Initiation possible on planet Earth) who is regarded as the Lord or Regent of Earth and of humanity, and the head of the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth who dwells in Shamballah, a city said by Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to be a floating city on the etheric plane above the Gobi Desert.\n\nIt is believed by these authors that he is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, which is composed of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Fifth Initiation), Ascended Masters (Sixth Initiation), Chohans and Bodhisattvas (Seventh Initiation), Buddhas (Eighth Initiation), and highly spiritually-evolved volunteers from other worlds, who have all joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.\n\nSanat Kumara was mentioned briefly by the theosophist Helena Blavatsky. She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the \"Lords of the Flame\", whom Christian tradition have misunderstood as Lucifer and the fallen angels.\n\nSanat Kumara gained greater prominence when her follower Charles W. Leadbeater wrote that Sanat Kumara was the \"King\" or \"Lord of the World\", and the head of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas who had revealed the principles of theosophy.\n\nLater theosophists such as Alice Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have embellished the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.\n\nThere is considerable difference between the concept of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy (as described by Blavatsky, Olcott, Sinnett, and others) and the current concept of Ascended Masters, developed by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet fifty-five years after the Theosophical Society was founded.\n\nThey added more than 200 new \"Ascended Masters\" that they claimed to receive dictations from in addition to receiving dictations from the original \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\" of Theosophy.\n\nThe Ascended Masters, as their name suggests, are supposed to be Masters who have experienced the miracle of ascension, as it is said Jesus did. The original teaching, channeled by Guy Ballard, was that a new Ascended Master would not die but would take the body up with him. This teaching of ascension is in direct opposition to the Theosophical teachings. Mahatma K.H. refers to the idea disparagingly in one of his letters to Sinnett:\nBlavatsky also rejects ascension as a fact, calling it \"an allegory as old as the world.\" In the Theosophical view, the Masters of Wisdom retain their physical bodies.\n\nThe Masters of the Wisdom are not like the Ascended ones, who are said to become Godlike, all-powerful beings beyond the laws of nature. In their teachings, the Theosophical Masters even denied that such beings exist. Mahatma K.H. wrote:\nIn their letters, the Mahatmas constantly talk about the \"immutable laws\" of the universe, and that they can help humanity only within the limits of these laws.\n\nProponents of the Ascended Masters sometimes attempt to account for these discrepancies by claiming that when the Theosophical Society (TS) was founded most of the Theosophical Mahatmas were still \"unascended Masters\". This leaves room to detach the Ascended Masters from the limitations. However, the Mahatma K.H. wrote: \"We are not infallible, all-foreseeing 'Mahatmas' at every hour of the day.\" As he explained: \"An adept—the highest as the lowest—is one only during the exercise of his occult powers.\" In fact, according to the Theosophical teachings, the higher the adept, the less we are likely to hear from him:\nIn the Theosophical view the Masters do not pay attention to personal desires. Theosophy teaches that the psychological ego is false, that the idea that we are this body, emotions, and mind is a mistake of perception and the source of sorrow. It says that real happiness comes only as an unsought by-product of reducing rather than increasing our attachment and identification with the personal. Blavatsky wrote that \"Occultism is not . . . the pursuit of happiness as man understands the word; for the first step is sacrifice, the second renunciation.\" K.H. agreed with this when he wrote: \"We—the criticized and misunderstood Brothers—we seek to bring men to sacrifice their personality—a passing flash—for the welfare of the whole humanity.\" During the early times of the Theosophical Society, some members, misunderstanding the nature of the Mahatmas, would bring HPB some personal requests to ask of them. In a letter Blavatsky explained:\nThis kind of interest is a very marked feature of the Ascended Masters. The Ascended Masters Teachings teach ways to attract material or emotional possessions to a person's life, and also how to dissolve unpleasant karma, a conception that the Theosophical Mahatmas emphatically opposed. For example, K.H. wrote: \"Bear in mind that the slightest cause produced, however unconsciously, and with whatever motive, cannot be unmade, or its effects crossed in their progress—by millions of gods, demons, and men combined.\" In fact, the Ascended Masters are portrayed as cosmic fathers who will take care of their followers' problems. In contrast, Mahatma M. said: \"We are leaders but not child-nurses.\"\n\n\"Maitri\" is Sanskrit for \"loving kindness.\" The historical Buddha was reported to have said near the time of his death in the 4th century BCE that many Buddhas (awakened ones) had come before him, and that in the future another Buddha would come who would be greater than him, and who would embody \"Maitri.\" This prophecy created the expectation of a Buddha Maitreya, which was probably fulfilled in the advent of the being now called \"Jesus,\" likely Apollonius of Tyanna, who on his travels in India and the Far East was reported in many texts to have been called, \"Issa,\" probably short for \"Rishi\" (great sage). His teachings embody that principal of loving kindness. \"Maitreya\" or \"Lord Maitreya\" is described in Theosophical literature of the late 19th-century and subsequent periods as an advanced spiritual entity and high-ranking member of a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, the so-called \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\". According to Theosophical doctrine, one of the Hierarchy's functions is to oversee the evolution of Humankind; in accord with this function Maitreya is said to hold the so-called \"Office of the World Teacher\". Theosophical texts posit that the purpose of this Office is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence. Humanity is thereby assisted on its presumed cyclical, but ever progressive, evolutionary path. Reputedly, one way the knowledge transfer is accomplished is by Maitreya occasionally manifesting or incarnating in the physical realm; the manifested entity then assumes the role of World Teacher of Humankind.\n\nThe Theosophical concept of Maitreya has many similarities to the earlier Maitreya doctrine in Buddhism. However, they differ in important aspects, and developed differently. The Theosophical Maitreya has been assimilated or appropriated by a variety of quasi-theosophical and non-theosophical New Age and Esoteric groups and movements. These have added, and advanced, their own interpretations and commentary on the subject.\n\nThe first mention of Maitreya in a Theosophical context occurs in the 1883 work \"Esoteric Buddhism\" by Alfred Percy Sinnett (1840–1921), an early Theosophical writer. The concepts described by Sinnett were amended, elaborated on, and greatly expanded in \"The Secret Doctrine\", a book originally published 1888. The work was the magnum opus of Helena Blavatsky, one of the physical founders of the Theosophical Society and of contemporary Theosophy. In it, the messianic Maitreya is linked to both Buddhist and Hindu religious traditions. In the same work Blavatsky was to assert that there have been, and will be, multiple messianic (or messianic-like) instances in human history. These successive appearances of \"emissarie of Truth\" are according to the Blavatsky writings part of the unceasing oversight of Earth and of its inhabitants by a physically hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, called \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\". The Theosophist, \"Alice Bailey,\" who broke with the Indian branch of the Theosophical Society, and who was heavily influenced by orthodox Christianity, started the expectation that the \"\"Maitreya\" would actually be reborn on the earth as a physical being, fulfilling the Christian ideal of a Second Coming, rather than the New Age ideal of the Christ being reborn in the heart of each individual.\n\nInitiation is a concept in Theosophy that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on Earth can progress upward through. Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that human beings on Earth progress through as they reincarnate, although evil acts may cause bad karma which may cause one to temporarily regress. It is believed that when souls have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached enlightenment and have no further need to reincarnate. At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls have the opportunity to become members of the Spiritual Hierarchy. This concept was developed by both C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey beginning in the 1920s.\nAccording to C.W. Leadbeater, Initiation is a process by which \"we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect.\" According to Alice A. Bailey, \"Initiation\" is the \"process of undergoing an expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness\" It is believed by Theosophists that all souls that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to reincarnate. Those who do not elect to become pratyeka buddhas and go directly into Spiritual Hierarchy governing nirvana, gradually evolving upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, with other higher levels beyond.\n\nThe concept of Initiation is also recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Sixth Initiation is referred to as \"Ascension\". The first six initiations were named by Charles W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of Jesus\n\nThe Great White Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophical and New Age, are said to be supernatural beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended masters. Various people have said they have received messages from these beings, including most notably [Helena Blavatsky (Theosophy), Aleister Crowley (Thelema), Alice A. Bailey (New Group of World Servers), Guy Ballard (\"I AM\" Activity), Geraldine Innocente (The Bridge to Freedom), Mark L. Prophet & Elizabeth Clare Prophet (Church Universal and Triumphant) and Benjamin Creme (Share International).\n\nThe Masters are collectively called the \"Great White Brotherhood\" by various theosophists and esotericists. The use of the term \"white\" refers to their advanced spirituality (in other words, that they have a white colored \naura) and has nothing to do with race. Blavatsky described many of the Masters as ethnically Tibetan or Indian (Hindu), not European. She did, however, describe them as being from all cultures and races, such as the \"Greek gentleman\" known as Hilarion.\n\nBelief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the syncretistic teachings of various organizations that have taken the Theosophical philosophical concepts and added their own elements. Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters by these organizations are: Jesus, Sanat Kumara, Gautama Buddha, Maitreya, Confucius, Lord Lanto (Confucius' historical mentor), Mary (mother of Jesus), Lady Master Nada, Enoch, Kwan Yin, Saint Germain, and Kuthumi, to name but a few. It is believed that all of these put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.\n\nWithin \"The I AM Activity\" (founded by Guy Warren Ballard in the early 1930s), contact and cooperation with the Ascended Masters became a central part of each member's life. Through the Ballards as \"Messengers\", the Ascended Masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of \"The I AM Activity.\" Those Addresses (known as \"Dictations\") were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, and published in the monthly periodical \"The Voice of The \"I AM\"\", and some were collected and reprinted in the \"green books\" of \"The Saint Germain Series\". In all, 3,834 Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other \"Ascended Master Activities\" believed that the Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world. They believe that further instruction from the Ascended Masters and the rest of the Spiritual Hierarchy continued through new Dispensations with new Messengers, such as The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence.\n\nThe Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on \"The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ\" transcribed from the Akashic Records by Levi H. Dowling. The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups. The book \"Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel\" by ACCU founder Jacob L. Watson, expounds on the church's teachings which draw heavily from the writings of A.D.K. Luk (pen-name of Alice Beulah Schutz) (April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994), the Saint Germain Series published by the Saint Germain Press (The Saint Germain Foundation), and especially from \"The Lost Years of Jesus\" compiled by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and published by The Summit Lighthouse.\n\nRené Guénon wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy titled \"Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion\" (1921). In the book Guenon speculated that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge naturally from other books not from any supernatural masters. Guenon points out that Blavatsky spent a long time visiting a library at New York where she had easy access to the works of Jacob Boehme, Eliphas Levi, the Kabbala and other Hermetic treatises. Guenon also speculated that Blavatsky had borrowed passages from extracts of the \"Kanjur\" and \"Tanjur\", translated by the eccentric orientalist Sándor Kőrösi Csoma, published in 1836 in the twentieth volume of the \"Asiatic Researchers of Calcutta\".\n\nK. Paul Johnson suggests in his book \"The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood\" that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime. \n\nAlso see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig \"New York Times\" October 5, 1980, which speculates that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.\n\nRobert Todd Carroll in his book \"The skeptic's dictionary\" (2003) speculates that Blavatsky used trickery into deceiving others into thinking she had paranormal powers. Carroll further speculates that Blavatsky had faked a materialization of a tea cup and saucer as well as written the messages from her masters herself.\n\n\n"}

A charging document, which contains one or more criminal charges or counts, can take several forms, including:\n\n\nThe charging document is what generally starts a criminal case in court. But the procedure by which somebody is charged with a crime and what happens when somebody has been charged varies from country to country and even, within a country, from state to state.\n\nBefore a person is proven guilty, the charge must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThere can be multiple punishments due to certain criminal charges. Minor criminal charges such as misdemeanors, tickets, and infractions have less harsh punishments. The judge usually sentences the person accused of committing the charges right after the hearing. The punishments generally include fines, suspension, probation, a small amount of jail time, or alcohol and drug classes. If the criminal charges are considered more serious like a felony, then there is a more lengthy process for determining the punishment. Felonies include the most serious crimes such as murder and treason. In addition to the trial that decides innocence or guilt, there is a separate trial (after one is convicted) that determines the punishment(s) for the criminal charges committed.\n\nIn the United States, people facing criminal charges in any situation are given rights by the Constitution. These rights include things like the right to remain silent, habeas corpus, and the right to an attorney. It is important for someone facing criminal charges to know their rights so they can take the proper action using their rights. Among those rights are a criminal suspect's Miranda Rights which are read to a suspect prior to interrogation while in the custody of the police. If a suspect is not given a Miranda warning prior to interrogation it is possible that the suspect's statements will be excluded from evidence in a later criminal prosecution.\n\nMany people avoid criminal charges by staying out of the state where they committed the crime. A person facing state criminal charges is always prosecuted in the state where they committed the charges. A person may be able to get away with minor violations like a ticket, but they will not be able to hide from something like a misdemeanor or a felony. \nThere are about sixty criminal charges that are considered more serious that people face every day. These charges can range from less serious actions such as shoplifting or vandalism to more serious crimes such as murder.\n\nA person may not even know if he/she was charged. If he/she is really worried, he/she can contact an attorney to ascertain if he/she was charged with any crime(s).

The junk was built in 2003 as a joint project between China Camp State Park in San Rafael, California and the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, and is now jointly exhibited and operated by both institutions. It functions as a \"working sailing museum\" to educate the public about a previously forgotten chapter in the history of Chinese-American immigrants to California.\n\nItalian fishermen began catching shrimp in San Francisco Bay around 1869, followed by Chinese fishermen in 1871, using traditional bag nets imported from China. Soon, immigrant Chinese fishermen from Guangdong dominated shrimp fishing in Northern California. The Chinese also fished for shrimp in nearby Tomales Bay, but those fisheries were abandoned in the 1890s. Junks were built at several places along the West Coast of the United States by Chinese shipwrights using traditional techniques and local lumber.\nBy the end of the 19th century, dozens of traditional Chinese shrimp fishing junks built in California were operating on the bay. As many as nine to ten million pounds of shrimp were harvested from the bay annually before restrictions on the fishery were imposed.\n\nAlthough a small quantity of shrimp were sold locally, most were boiled and dried, resulting in a shelf-stable product that was exported to China and Hawaii. Drying resulted in two products: one third by weight the higher-grade product, called dried shrimp meat, which was used for human consumption, and two thirds the lower-grade product, called shrimp meal, which was used for fish food and plant fertilizer.\n\nPolitical opposition to the fishery began in 1885, based on the assumption that bycatch in the Chinese nets was killing large numbers of desirable young fish, especially salmon and striped bass. The opposition was exacerbated by the prevalent anti-Chinese sentiment in California in the late 19th century. Studies showed that the concerns were greatly exaggerated, and that the fishermen ate or gave away the edible fish. A 1932 report concluded that \"the average striped bass is too spry to be taken in any such rig.\" Restrictive regulations were implemented, beginning in 1901 with an annual four-month closure of the fishery during the height of the season, a ban on the export of dried shrimp in 1905, followed by a ban on Chinese nets in 1911, forcing a switch to beam trawl nets, which required motorized boats. Arrests of Chinese fishing crews were common in the first decade of the 20th century. The ban on exports was lifted in 1919, leading to a tripling in production in the 1920s.\n\nCalifornia state fishery records show that in 1930, the catch was 2,687,831 pounds of shrimp from the bay, 35 boats were operating, and 72 men were employed. There were 12 shrimp fishing camps at Hunter's Point in San Francisco, and two in Marin County, including China Camp. Only a handful of traditional sail powered junks remained in service, and most of the boats were converted motorized junks or Western style fishing boats.\n\nThe fishery went into a steep decline in 1936, due to a collapse in the export market due to the ongoing effects of the Great Depression and the intensification of war and revolution in China. After World War II, the fishery was limited to a much lower volume catch for local sale as fishing bait. Third generation Chinese-American shrimp fisherman Frank Quan had continued small volume shrimp fishing into the 21st century, living in China Camp until passing away 15 days prior to his 91st birthday.\n\nThe kernel of the idea that eventually became \"Grace Quan\" goes back to 1995, when John Muir, while an undergraduate student, ran across an old photo of a Chinese junk sailing along the San Francisco waterfront. Muir is a distant relative of the famous conservationist of the same name. While pursuing a master's degree, Muir excavated the wrecks of two junks at China Camp and took measurements. He later visited shipyards in Guangdong that still build wooden commercial fishing boats and studied their traditional construction methods. Muir later became small boat curator at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, and developed a proposal to build a replica of a late 19th century Chinese-style fishing junk, using the materials and techniques that were used to build similar boats in California.\n\nMuir negotiated an agreement between the two parks to build the junk using volunteer labor and redwood lumber for most of the hull, milled from logs donated by a conservation group. Construction began in March, 2003. Traditional Chinese shipbuilding techniques were used, such as flame bending of planks, and edge-nailing using hand forged nails. Joints between the planks were sealed using traditional caulk made by volunteers out of a mixture of lime and linseed oil. This substance is called \"chu'nam\", and also includes organic fibers, such as animal hair, grasses or bamboo fiber.\n\nThe keel was laid on April 24, 2003, and the junk was launched on October 25, 2003. At the launch ceremony, it was announced that the junk would be named \"Grace Quan\", in honor of Frank Quan's mother.\n\n\"Grace Quan\" is long and its beam (width) is . It is a catboat rigged with a single mast.\n\nIts draft with the daggerboard and rudder down is . Its draft with the daggerboard and rudder raised is .\n\nThe junk is built of lumber native to California. The keel, planks, frames and deck are made of redwood. The mast, stem, thwarts and oars are made of Douglas fir. The mast was made from an 80 foot tall Douglas fir tree from Napa County.\n\nThe oars include a traditional Chinese sculling oar called a \"yuloh\", used from the stern, and a pair of oars that can be used from the bow. These oars allow the crews of shrimp fishing junks to maneuver around the fixed nets when the wind is not blowing.\n\nThe boat's sail is made of cotton, and is treated with tanbark oak which helps weatherproof the sail, and gives the sail its distinctive tan colour. The sail has six wooden battens, which contribute to its distinctive appearance.\n\nIn 2005, \"Grace Quan\" sailed from San Francisco Bay to Sacramento, where schoolchildren toured the boat.\n\nThe junk is docked at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park at Hyde Street Pier in the winter and at China Camp State Park in San Rafael in the summer. It sails between these locations twice a year, a distance of about 15 nautical miles.\n\nIn 2014, the junk took a voyage around San Francisco Bay, visiting the sites of several historic Chinese immigrant shrimp fishing villages, including stops in Richmond, California, Hunters Point in San Francisco and Redwood City, California in the south bay.\n\nWhen the junk was being built, Phil Choy, a historian with the Chinese Historical Society of America, said, \"This project dispels the perception that all Chinese were laundrymen and houseboys and cooks. They had know-how. They were enterprising and resourceful.\"\n\nRene Yung, director of community cultural group Chinese Whispers said in 2014 that \"The historic Chinese immigrant experience in America was marked by oppression and erasure of their contributions from national memory. The once-thriving Chinese shrimping industry and community around San Francisco Bay is one of these forgotten stories.\" He described the voyage of \"Grace Quan\" as a tribute to \"this pioneer community and San Francisco’s maritime heritage.\"\n"}

(Is this your bicycle, Mr. O'Brien?) is a German biographical radio play about life, works and legacy of Irish modernist writer Brian O'Nolan (; 5 October 1911 – 1 April 1966).\n\nIrish novelist Brian O'Nolan uses numerous pseudonyms for his literary works. In this radio-drama, these pseudonyms meet and argue with characters from O’Nolan’s novels and narrations. The plot roughly follows O’Nolans real life as a student in Nazi-Germany, his return to inter-war Ireland, unemployment and career in the civil service, his declining health, dislike of James Joyce and constant financial troubles. \n\nIn the German original the drama was subtitled ‘’Eine Hörspielcollage aus der Welt der Wissenschaft und des Suffs’’ (A radio play patchwork from a world of science and booze), a claim that was brought to life by creative use of sound footage, music, audio-gags, and music by The Dubliners and other celtic folksingers.\n\nThe radio play draws from a number of novels, articles, and letters by O’Brien using German translations by Harry Rowohlt and original English texts alike. Rowohlt, an expert on O’Nolan and popular voice artist himself, was not included in the project by the producers.\n\nAccordingly, the play’s many settings include some of O’Nolans favorite places, namely Trinity College, Dublin; editorial offices of the Irish Times; a pub in pre-war Cologne; the Irish country-side; rural police stations, roads, barns, and stables.\n\n\nIn the play, a number of writers, historic, literary or public figures, and scientists are mentioned to illustrate O’Nolan’s colorful and over-populated universe, such as Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Graham Greene, James Joyce, Fionn mac Cumhaill, Harry Rowohlt, Homer, Jonathan Swift, George Bernhard Shaw, the Marx Brothers, Brendan Behan, Éamon de Valera, Karl Kraus, Sherlock Holmes, and Erwin Schrödinger.\n\nSoon after the play was first aired, the first nominations for German radio awards were announced. Later that year it won the prestigious ‘Radio Play of the Month Award’ by the German National Academy of Performing Arts.\n\n\nSince most radio shows and plays aired by German national broadcasting companies are not accessible online, current owner and sole distributor is the Saarländischer Rundfunk. The play has been regularly re-broadcast by federal Deutschlandfunk, and regional stations like Bayerischer Rundfunk, Norddeutscher Rundfunk and Suedwestrundfunk.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "276076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276076", "title": "Iznogoud", "text": "Iznogoud\n\nIznogoud (pronounced \"he's/is no good\" with a French accent) is a French comics series featuring an eponymous character, created by the comics writer René Goscinny and comics artist Jean Tabary. The comic series chronicles the life of Iznogoud, the Grand Vizier and second in command of Baghdad, at an undefined period in the past. His greatest desire is to replace the Caliph or Sultan of Baghdad Haroun El Plassid, leading him to repeatedly utter the phrase \"I want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph\", a phrase that has been adopted in the French language to indicate overly ambitious people. Iznogoud is supported by his faithful servant, Wa'at Alahf.\n\nAfter the death of Goscinny in 1977 Tabary continued with writing the character. The stories have been translated into several languages, including English, and the title has been adapted to animated and live-action film.\n\nSo far 29 graphic novels featuring Iznogoud have been published in French, with at least 26 of those published in English and a number of other languages. Iznogoud was also adapted into a cartoon series produced by Saban Entertainment, with 52 episodes to its name, again with most of them having been translated to other languages as well.\n\nThe series made its debut in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"Record\" on 15 January 1962 under the title, \"Les aventures du Calife Haroun el Poussah\". It was eventually recognised that the wicked supporting character ought to be the focus of the strip, and it was renamed \"Iznogoud\". In 1968, it resumed serial publication in Goscinny's \"Pilote\" magazine.\n\nGoscinny's taste for sharp satirical writing keeps the repetitive format of the stories constantly fresh, making Iznogoud one of the most popular anti-heroes in the French comic strip world. Goscinny's skills with puns, made famous in \"Astérix\", is also evident in \"Iznogoud\". Most of the puns in the original French make little sense if translated directly into English, requiring of translators (Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge in the case of the English translations) to find creative solutions for equivalent puns while still keeping within the spirit of the original text.\n\nWhen Goscinny died in 1977, Tabary eventually decided to carry on the work himself, just as Albert Uderzo did with \"Asterix\". While the Goscinny period was characterized by \"albums\" comprising several short-length tales each, Tabary turned the series in a new direction, by dedicating every new album entirely to a single story, larger and much more detailed, usually revolving around a new unique concept.\n\nIn 1987 a game was produced by Infogrames entitled \"Iznogoud\". The series was adapted to animated film in 1995 with a cartoon TV series, where the caliph is referred to as a sultan. A live-action \"Iznogoud\" film starring Michaël Youn and Jacques Villeret, \"Iznogoud: Calife A La Place Du Calife\", was released in France in February 2005.\n\nThe publisher Cinebook Ltd is currently publishing English language translations of the books in the Iznogoud series. The first book in the series, \"The Wicked Wiles of Iznogoud\", was published in March 2008. Further volumes continue to appear at approximately six month intervals. In India, Euro Books published the English versions of 12 Iznogoud titles in 2009.\n\nIznogoud is the second in command (Grand Vizier) to the Caliph of Baghdad Haroun El Poussah (Haroun El Plassid in English, a pun on the historical Caliph, Harun al-Rashid; \"poussah\" is roughly translated as \"oaf\") but his sole aim in life is to overthrow the Caliph and take his place. This is frequently expressed in his famous catchphrase, \"I want to be Caliph instead of the Caliph\" (\"je veux être calife à la place du calife\"), which has passed into everyday French for qualifying over-ambitious people who want to become chief. Iznogoud is always assisted in his plans by his faithful henchman, Dilat Larath (Wa'at Alahf in English, se dilater la rate = have a good laugh, in French).\n\nGoscinny and Tabary occasionally make appearances themselves. In one episode, Tabary uses a magical time-travelling closet to help Iznogoud seize the Caliph title. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical calendar that lets him travel in time when he rips off its pages. He rips too many and he is transported to the 20th century, inside the studio of Tabary. In another episode, Iznogoud gets a magical drawing paper set that makes anybody or anything drawn on it disappear once the paper is torn apart. Unfortunately, the drawing needs to be realistic, and Iznogoud is a poor artist. In search of an art teacher, he meets Tabary, renamed \"Tabary El-Retard\".\n\nThere are occasionally \"behind-the-scenes\" moments, as when Iznogoud travels in a country in a mirror, and all is reversed, including text in balloons. Tabary is shown complaining to Goscinny about going through this frustrating \"reversal\" work, and even threatens him with a gun, to convince him into making a non-reversed \"translated\" version. They also appear debating after a contemporary crowd demands that they make Iznogoud caliph.\n\nOther recurring characters include Sultan Pullmankar (\"Sultan Streetcar\" in English), the Caliph's neighbour who is described as a touchy man with a powerful army. Iznogoud often tries to provoke Pullmankar to become angry at the Caliph, in order to instigate a war. However, Pullmankar never gets angry with the caliph, only with Iznogoud.\n\nThe crew of Redbeard, another comics series published in Pilote, appears in \"A Carrot for Iznogoud\", as it did in many stories of René Goscinny's most famous creation Asterix.\n\n\nNotably, the character has also made his mark on French popular culture and public life. Wanting to become \"Caliph in the Caliph's place\" has become a popular expression in French, describing people perceived as over-ambitious. The \"Prix Iznogoud\" (Iznogoud Award) was created in 1992 and is given each year to \"a personality who failed to take the Caliph's place\", chosen among prominent French figures who have recently known spectacular failures. The award has been given to various personalities, amongst them Édouard Balladur (1995), Nicolas Sarkozy (1999) and Jean-Marie Messier (2002). The jury is headed by politician André Santini, who gave the award to himself after failing to become president of the Île-de-France in the 2004 regional elections.\n\nThe Iznogoud comics were translated into English in the 1970s. Unlike the French version Haroun El-Plassid's title was changed from Caliph to Sultan in order to avoid upsetting the British Muslim community.\n\nIn Bengali the name of Iznogoud is \" prodhan ujir ijnogood\".\n\nIn Finnish the name of Iznogoud is \"Ahmed Ahne\" (literally translated Ahmed the Greedy).\n\nIn Icelandic the name of Iznogoud is \"Fláráður\".\n\nIn Italian the name of Iznogoud is \"Gran Bailam\".\n\nIn Polish the name of Iznogoud is \"Wezyr Nic-po-nim\".\n\nIn Dutch the name of Iznogoud in the comics is \"Iznogoedh\", but in the animated TV series it's \"Iznogoud\".\n\n\n"}

His list includes several books that have not survived to the present day; it also omits a few works of his which he either omitted or which he wrote after he finished the \"Historia\". His list follows, with an English translation given; the title used to describe the work in this article is also given, for easier reference.\n\nIn addition, the following works are listed below but are not mentioned by Bede:\n\n\"Commentary on Acts\"\n\n\n\"Retractation\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on the Apocalypse\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on the Catholic Epistles\"\n\n\n\"Collectaneum on the Pauline Epistles\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on Ezra and Nehemiah\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on Genesis\"\n\nThis exists in two forms; an early version in two books, and a later, revised version in four books. The work comments on the first twenty chapters of Genesis and the first ten verses of the twenty-first chapter.\n\n\"Commentary on the Prayer of Habakkuk\"\n\nIt is not known when Bede composed this commentary. Bede dedicated the work to \"his dearly beloved sister and virgin of Christ\", but gives no further clues to the dedicatee's identity. Bede's commentary draws on the work of Jerome and on Augustine's \"City of God\".\n\n\"Commentary on Luke\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on Mark\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on Proverbs\"\n\n\n\"Quaestiones XXX\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on Samuel\"\n\n\n\"Commentary on the Song of Songs\"\n\n\n\"De tabernaculo\"\n\n\n\"De templo Salomonis\"\n\nComposed not long before 731. This work discusses the passage in 1 Kings 3:1 to 7:51 in which Solomon builds a temple. Bede was here extending a long tradition of commentary on the temple in patristic literature.\n\n\"Commentary on Tobit\"\n\nLaistner suggests that this may have been written at about the same time as \"De templo Salmonis\", since in both Bede stresses allegorical interpretation; however, he comments that there is no textual evidence to support this. There is no other indication of the date of composition. As with the commentary on Habakkuk, Bede draws on the work of Jerome and on Augustine's \"City of God\".\n\n\"De Locis Sanctis\"\n\n\n\"Life of St. Anastasius\"\n\nThere are no surviving manuscripts of this work, though one did survive as late as the 15th century.\n\n\"Life of St. Felix\"\n\nAn adaptation into prose of four poems on St Felix by Paulinus of Nola.\n\n\"Life of St. Cuthbert (verse)\"\n\nBede wrote two lives of St Cuthbert; this one is in verse and was probably composed between 705 and 716. The first printed edition was by Canisius, in his \"Antiquae Lectiones\", which appeared between 1601 and 1604. Laistner lists twenty manuscripts, including one fragment; a 20th-century edition that includes a discussion of nineteen of the manuscripts is Werner Jaager, \"Bedas metrische Vita Sancti Cuthberti\" (1935).\n\n\"Life of St. Cuthbert (prose)\"\n\nBede wrote two lives of St Cuthbert; this one is in prose and was composed in about 721. It is in part based on an earlier life of St Cuthbert, anonymous but probably written by a monk of Lindisfarne.\n\n\"Martyrology\"\n\n\n\"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\"\n\n\n\"Ecclesiastical History of the English People (Old English version)\"\n\n\n\"History of the Abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow\"\n\n\n\"Homilies\"\n\nBede's list of his works refers to two books of homilies, and these are preserved. In addition, innumerable homilies exist that have been attributed to him; in most cases the attribution is spurious but there may be additional homilies of Bede beyond those in the main two books that survive. It is unclear whether the homilies were ever actually preached, or were instead intended for devotional reading. They are organized around particular dates in the church calendar, with forty of them dealing with either Christmas or Easter. The remaining ten are concerned with the feast days of saints. The homilies are thought to be among Bede's later works, dating perhaps to the late 720s. Thirty-four of them were included in a widely disseminated anthology of readings put together in Charlemagne's reign by Paul the Deacon. It is possible that Bede composed these homilies to complement the work of Gregory the Great, who had assembled his own collection of homilies: the two sets of homilies only have one reading in common, and that reading is one which Gregory had indicated needed further attention.\n\nBede lists five letters in the list he gives of his works in the \"Historia Ecclesiastica\", as follows: \"Item librum epistolarum ad diversos: quarum de sex aetatibus saeculi una est; de mansionibus filiorum Israhel una; una de eo quod ait Isaias; 'et claudentur ibi in carcerem et post dies multos visitabantur'; de ratione bisexti una; de aequnioctio iuxta Anatolium una\". Two additional letters are known: the letter to Albinus he wrote to accompany a copy of the \"Historia Ecclesiastica\", and the \"Epistle to Egbert\". The first five letters below are the ones Bede mentioned; they are given in the same order that Bede describes them.\n\n\"Letter to Plegwin\"\n\nOne of Bede's works on chronology, \"De temporibus\", led to him being accused of heresy in front of Wilfred, the bishop of York; Bede was not present but heard of the charge from a monk named Plegwin. This letter is Bede's response to Plegwin; he justifies his work and asks Plegwin to deliver the letter to a monk named David so that it could be read to Wilfred. The letter was first published in Dublin in 1664 by Sir James Ware. Five manuscripts survive.\n\n\"Letter to Acca: \"de eo quod ait Isaias\"\"\n\nThis letter was first published in 1843 by J. A. Giles, in his edition of the complete works of Bede. Giles used the only known manuscript, Paris B.N. 2840.\n\n\"Letter to Acca: \"de mansionibus filiorum Israhel\"\"\n\nAs with the previous letter to Acca, the first publication was in J.A. Giles' 1843 edition of Bede's works. There are two manuscripts of this letter; it appears in Paris B.N. 2840, and also in a manuscript now in Zurich.\n\n\"Letter to Helmwald\"\n\nBede's letter to Helwmald was published in 1980 in the CCSL series, edited by C.W. Jones. An English translation by Faith Wallis appeared in 1999.\n\n\"Letter to Wicthede\"\n\nBede's letter to Wicthede was first printed in Hervagius's 1563 folio editions of Bede's works, but the manuscript Hervagius used included a reference to the year 776. It was argued on this basis that the letter was not by Bede, but subsequently a comparison with other manuscripts determined that the passage was a spurious interpolation, and the letter is now accepted as genuine. Many manuscripts are now known; Laistner lists over thirty.\n\n\"Letter to Albinus\"\n\nBede wrote this short letter to Albinus, the abbot of the monastery of St Peter and St Paul in Canterbury, to thank him for providing documents to Bede to assist him in writing the \"Ecclesiastical History\". With the letter Bede sent a copy of his \"De templo Salomonis\", and also a copy of the \"History\"; the date of the letter is therefore after 731, when the \"History\" was completed. The letter was sent to Albinus in the hands of Nothhelm, a London priest who subsequently became Archbishop of Canterbury. The text was first published by Jean Mabillon in his \"Vetera Analecta\", which began publication in 1675. Mabillon used a manuscript from the monastery of St Vincent in Metz which has since been lost. The text survives in two twelfth-century manuscripts from Austria: London, British Library, Add. 18329 (from St. Georgenberg-Fiecht), and Göttweig, Stiftsbibliothek, 37 (rot).\n\n\"Letter to Egbert\"\n\nThis letter is not included in Bede's list of his own writings. Bede completed the letter on 5 November 734, not long before his death on 26 May 735; in it he explains that he is unable to visit Egbert, as he had the previous year, and so is writing to him instead.\n\nIn Bede's list of his works, he describes a book of hymns: \"Librum hymnorum diverso metro sive rhythmo\" and a book of poems: \"Librum epigrammatum heroico metro sive elegiaco\". Although manuscripts by these names survived to the 15th century, none are extant today. However, some of Bede's verse was transmitted through other manuscripts. In addition, Bede included poems in several of his prose works, and these have occasionally been copied separately and thus transmitted independently of their parent work.\n\n\"Hymns\"\n\nOnly one hymn is definitely by Bede; his \"Hymn on Queen Etheldryd\", which is part of his \"Historia Ecclesiastica\" but which appears independently in some manuscripts. An additional fifteen hymns are thought to be of Bede's composition. Thirteen of these now survive only in a 16th-century printed edition; two further hymns, on psalms XLI and CXXII, have survived in manuscript form.\n\n\"De die iudicii\"\n\nThe poem \"De die iudicii\" is assigned to Bede by most scholars.\n\n\"Liber epigrammatum\"\n\nBede refers to a book of epigrams; the work is not entirely lost but has survived only in fragments. In the early 16th century, the antiquary John Leland transcribed a selection of epigrams from a now-lost manuscript; his selection includes several epigrams attributed to Bede which are likely to have come from the book Bede refers to. Leland's source was originally owned by Milred, bishop of Worcester from 745 to 775. Historian Michael Lapidge suggests that Milred's collection of epigrams was assembled early in Milred's tenure as bishop, perhaps in about 750.\n\n\"Bede's Death Song\"\n\nCuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the \"Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae\", is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as Bede's Death Song\n\n\"Other poems\"\n\nThe only other surviving poem of Bede's that is not part of one of Bede's prose works is a prayer in thirteen elegiac couplets which survives in a tenth-century manuscript in garbled form; it was first printed correctly in 1912.\n\nBede describes two of his school treatises in his list of works as \"Item librum de metrica arte et huic adiectum alium de schematibus sive tropis libellum, hoc est de figuris modisque locutionum, quibus scriptura sancta contexta est\". The first is \"a book on the art of poetry\", and the second is a \"little book of tropes and figures; that is, of the figures and manners of speaking in which the Holy Scriptures are written\". The majority of extant manuscripts of these treatises contain both of them.\n\n\"De arte metrica\"\n\n\n\"De schematibus et tropis\"\n\n\n\"De orthographia\"\n\n\n\"De natura rerum\"\n\nBede completed \"De natura rerum\" shortly after \"De temporibus\", which was written in 703. The work is modelled on the \"De natura rerum\" of Isidore of Seville.\n\n\"De temporibus\"\n\nThis work was completed in 703. It contains a short chronicle which was sometimes copied separately, known as the \"Chronica minora\". There are also manuscripts of \"De temporibus\" which omit the chronicle. It is a treatise covering the basics of the \"computus\", the medieval study of calculating the correct dates for the Christian calendar. Bede used much material from Isidore of Seville's \"Etymologies\" for this work.\n\n\"De temporum ratione\"\n\nThis work was completed in 725. It contains a chronicle which was often copied separately, known as the \"Chronica maiora\". There are also manuscripts of \"De temporum ratione\" which omit the chronicle. The work was known to medieval readers as \"De temporibus\", but since that was also the title of an earlier work by Bede it was also referred to as \"De temporibus liiber secundus\". Like \"De temporibus\" it deals with \"computus\", but at much greater length. Bede's treatment of the topic was widely and rapidly disseminated during the Middle Ages; over one hundred manuscripts have survived to the present day, almost half of which were copied within a century of the work's composition. This may be because Charlemagne instituted educational reforms that included making \"computus\" part of the curriculum.\n\n\"De octo quaestionibus\"\n\nAccording to Eric Knibbs, the treatise entitled the \"De octo quaestionibus\" is a 12th-century creation that cannot be ascribed to Bede, though the eight individual texts gathered under this title are much older. A subset of four (called, in some manuscripts, the \"Solutiones\") are almost certainly Bede's; the authorship of the other four is uncertain.\n\nPatrologia Latina vol. 94 includes a number of \"homiliae subdititiae\" \"spurious homilies\" attributed to Bede.\nThe so-called \"Paenitentiale Bedae\", a disciplinary work composed between ca 700 and 800, may have been authored by Bede. The idea that Bede wrote a penitential has been accepted as uncontroversial by both medieval and modern scholars, including Hermann Wasserschleben, Bruno Albers and J.T. McNeill. Others, however, including Charles Plummer and M.L.W. Laistner, have challenged the attribution of this work to Bede on the grounds that Bede (they say) was too high-minded and too talented a Latinist to have composed a work of such stylistic simplicity treating such vulgar subjects as drinking, physical violence and sexual deviance. A.J. Frantzen has adopted an agnostic attitude, acknowledging several arguments for and against Bedan authorship that taken together seem to leave the matter presently unanswerable. The most recent and detailed study of the text was carried out by Reinhold Haggenmüller, who pronounced definitively against Bedan authorship; however, Haggenmüller's argument against Bedan authorship is hardly persuasive (it amounts merely to noticing that the oldest manuscript dates to about 60 years after Bede's death). In fact no scholar has yet been able to adduce concrete evidence that either confirms or denies Bedan authorship of the \"Paenitentiale Bedae\". McNeill and Gamer's summary of the problem is still perhaps the most fair and concise:\nThe fact that no penitential is included by Bede among the works he lists at the end of his \"Ecclesiastical History\" ... as of the years 702–31 can hardly be admitted as a conclusive argument against his having written one, in view of the omission from this list of a number of his other known works. The strongest objection to his authorship of this book is the lack of distinction and originality in the work itself. But the author may have intended a revision, which he did not live to make. Probably too, we should not expect to find the marks of genius in a penitential. The nature of these handbooks excludes sublimity.\nThe following table gives the first publication of each of Bede's works listed above, and also lists a modern edition of the text and a modern translation where available. The table states \"None\" only where it is definitely known that no printed edition or translation exists.\nOpera Bedae Venerabilis Presbyteri Anglosaxonis (Hervagius, Basel 1563).\n\nThe first attempt to print a complete set of Bede's works was made in 1563 by Johannes Hervagius (Johann Herwagen the younger, died 1564), a printer of Basle, completing a project begun by his father (died 1557). This, which is taken as the \"Editio princeps\", followed upon the first extended edition of Bede's Commentaries, edited by Franciscus Jametius, printed at Paris in three volumes in 1544, other works being available in separate editions.\n\nThe royal privilege of the first edition was granted by King Henry II of France to Bernard Brand, partner of Hervagius, in 1558, and re-granted to Hervagius the younger by Charles IX in 1561. (The latter was during the regency of Catherine de' Medici in the months preceding the Colloquy of Poissy.) In his Preface \"Ad Lectorem\" Hervagius credits Jacobus Pamelius with the assembly of texts and a significant role in their editing. The entire edition was dedicated to Marquard, Freiherr von Hattstein, Prince-Bishop of Speyer (1560-1581) and provost of the collegiate church of Weissenburg, Alsace. The \"Epistola Nuncupatoria\" remarks that Hervagius had met the cost of the edition more for religious reasons than from expectations of financial return: the pure and uncorrupt doctrines of Bede offered the most useful and weighty answers to the explanation of controversies flourishing in their own times. \n\nHervagius's edition, in eight folio volumes, was incomplete in some respects and included works that were later determined to be spuriously assigned to Bede. For example, the folio edition (following Jametius) includes commentary on St Paul that is not by Bede (attributed by Mabillon to Florus of Lyon), and omits the commentary that Bede wrote. A full contents listing appears in the prefatory material to Volume 1. A newly re-set edition was printed at Cologne in 1612, also in eight volumes, following the same order of texts. A further revised edition was printed at Cologne in 1688. Casimir Oudin's commentary on the authenticity of the textual attributions to Bede in these editions was published in 1722, and was reproduced by Migne.\n\nCorpus Christianorum, Series Latina. The following volumes of this series contain works by Bede:\n\nPatrologia Latina. Volumes 90–94 of this series contain works by Bede, as follows.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3173905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3173905", "title": "McCollum memo", "text": "McCollum memo\n\nThe McCollum memo, also known as the \"Eight Action Memo\" was a memorandum, dated October 7, 1940 (more than a year before the Pearl Harbor attack), sent by Lieutenant Commander Arthur H. McCollum, who \"provided the president with intelligence reports on [Japan]... [and oversaw] every intercepted and decoded Japanese military and diplomatic report destined for the White House\" in his capacity as director of the Office of Naval Intelligence's Far East Asia section. It was sent to Navy Captains Dudley Knox, who agreed with the actions described within the memo, and Walter Stratton Anderson.\n\nThe memo outlined the general situation of several nations in World War II and recommended an eight-part course of action for the United States to take in regard to the Japanese Empire in the South Pacific, suggesting the United States provoke Japan into committing an \"overt act of war\". The memo illustrates several people in the Office of Naval Intelligence promoted the idea of goading Japan into war: \"It is not believed that in the present state of political opinion the United States government is capable of declaring war against Japan without more ado [...] If by [the elucidated eight-point plan] Japan could be led to commit an overt act of war, so much the better.\"\n\nThe McCollum memo was first widely disseminated with the publication of Robert Stinnett's book \"Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor.\" Stinnett writes that McCollum's memo was a plan to \"mobilize a reluctant America into joining Britain's struggle against the German armed forces then overrunning Europe. Its eight actions called for virtually inciting a Japanese attack on American ground, air, and naval forces in Hawaii, as well as on British and Dutch colonial outposts in the Pacific region.\" Stinnett presents the memo as part of his argument the Roosevelt Administration conspired to secretly provoke the Japanese to attack the United States in order to bring the United States into the European war without generating public contempt over broken political promises. Stinnett omits to mention McCollum never had contact with Roosevelt. Stinnett attributes to McCollum a position McCollum expressly repudiated.\n\nThe McCollum memo contained an eight-part plan to counter rising Japanese power over East Asia:\n\nThe memo was read and appended by Captain Knox, who, despite being seemingly reluctant to \"precipitate anything in the Orient\", ultimately concurs. Specifically, he wrote (page 6):\n\nIt is unquestionably to our interest that Britain be not licked – just now she has a stalemate and probably can't do better. We ought to make certain that she at least gets a stalemate. For this she will probably need from us substantial further destroyers and air-reinforcements to England. We should not precipitate anything in the Orient that would hamper our ability to do this – so long as probability continues. If England remains stable, Japan will be cautious in the Orient. Hence our assistance to England in the Atlantic is also protection to her and us in the Orient. However, I concur in your courses of action. We must be ready on both sides and probably strong enough to care for both.\n\nStinnett writes that while \"no specific record has been found by the author indicating whether [Anderson] or Roosevelt actually ever saw it [...] a series of secret presidential routing logs plus collateral intelligence information in the Navy files offer conclusive evidence that they did see it\". His evidence of \"secret presidential routing logs\" is not provided. Stinnett goes on to write, \"throughout 1941, it seems, provoking Japan into an overt act of war was the principal policy that guided FDR's actions against Japan\" and \"Roosevelt's cabinet members, most notably Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, are on record favoring the policy, according to Stimson's diary\". Further evidence that suggests Roosevelt had seen the memos was his support of \"pop-up\" cruises, an elaboration upon Actions D and E of the eight recommended actions detailed in the memo: \"I just want them to keep popping up here and there and keep the Japs guessing. I don't mind losing one or two cruisers, but do not take a chance on losing five or six.\"\n\nAdmiral Husband E. Kimmel, on the other hand, opposed the \"pop-up\" cruises, saying they were \"most ill-advised and will result in war if we make this move\", but \"the decision [on the 'pop-up' cruise matter] may go against me\". In fact, at the time, Kimmel was not aware of Washington's eight-action policy.\n\nAdmiral James O. Richardson also opposed the plan and \"quoted the President as saying: 'Sooner or later the Japanese would commit an overt act against the United States and the nation would be willing to enter the war'.\"\n\nAlso, Admiral Nimitz turned down the command of the Pacific Fleet so that he would not become the scapegoat if the Japanese attacked the United States by surprise. In a History Channel interview, Admiral Chester Nimitz Jr. described his father's political maneuver: \n\nHe said, 'It is my guess that the Japanese are going to attack us in a surprise attack. There will be a revulsion in the country against all those in command at sea, and they will be replaced by people in positions of prominence ashore, and I want to be ashore, and not at sea, when that happens.'\n\nThe characterization of the McCollum memorandum as a recipe for war was not accepted by U. S. Army military historian Conrad Crane, who wrote:\n\nA close reading shows that its recommendations were supposed to deter and contain Japan, while better preparing the United States for a future conflict in the Pacific. There is an offhand remark that an overt Japanese act of war would make it easier to garner public support for actions against Japan, but the document's intent was not to ensure that event happened.\n\n"}
{"id": "5730687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5730687", "title": "National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program", "text": "National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program\n\nThe National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) of the United States is an archival program led by the Library of Congress to archive and provide access to digital resources. The U.S. Congress established the program in 2000. The Library was chosen because of its role as one of the leading providers of high-quality content on the Internet. The Library of Congress has formed a national network of partners dedicated to preserving specific types of digital content that is at risk of loss.\n\nIn July 2010, the Library launched a National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) to extend the work of NDIIPP to more institutions. The organization, which has been hosted by the Digital Library Federation since January 2016, focuses on several goals. It develops improved preservation standards and practices; works with experts to identify categories of digital information that are most worthy of preservation; and takes steps to incorporate content into a national collection. It provides national leadership for digital preservation education and training. NDSA also provides communication and outreach for all aspects of digital preservation. The NDSA membership includes universities, professional associations, commercial businesses, consortia, and government agencies.\n\nThe preservation of digital content has become a major challenge for libraries and archives whose mission is to preserve the intellectual and cultural heritage of the nation. In 1998 the Library of Congress began to develop a digital strategy with a group of senior managers who were charged with assessing the roles and responsibilities of the Library in the digital age. This oversight group was headed by the Associate Librarian for Strategic Initiatives, the Associate Librarian for Library Services, and the Register of Copyrights. This group held several planning meetings to assess the current state of digital archiving and preservation.\n\nThe Librarian of Congress James H. Billington commissioned the National Research Council Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the Library's readiness to meet the challenges of the rapidly evolving digital world. They recommended that the Library, working with other federal and non-federal institutions, take the lead in a national, cooperative effort to archive and preserve digital information.\n\nIn December 2000, Congress appropriated up to $100 million ($75 million of which was slated for dollar for dollar cost matching) for the effort. Congress rescinded $47 million in unspent funds in 2007. In 2009, NDIIPP received about $6.5 million as a line item in the Library's annual budget appropriation.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has asked the Library of Congress to lead a collaborative project, called the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. In December 2000, Congress passed special legislation (Public Law 106-554) in recognition of the importance of preserving digital content for future generations, appropriating $100 million to the Library of Congress to lead this effort. (A government-wide rescission of .22 percent in late December 2000 reduced this special appropriation to $99.8 million.)\n\nThis effort falls within the Library's mission, which is \"The Library's mission is to support the Congress in fulfilling its constitutional duties and to further the progress of knowledge and creativity for the benefit of the American people.\" This mission extends to materials in electronic formats as well. In addition, the Library is the home of the U.S. Copyright Office and is thus already engaged in issues relating to copyright in a digital environment.\n\nThe National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program is a cooperative effort.\n\nThe Library is working closely with partners to assess considerations for shared responsibilities. Federal legislation calls for the Library to work jointly with the Secretary of Commerce, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National Archives and Records Administration. The legislation also directs the Library to seek the participation of \"other federal, research and private libraries and institutions with expertise in the collection and maintenance of archives of digital materials,\" including the National Library of Medicine, the National Agricultural Library, the Research Libraries Group, the Online Computer Library Center and the Council on Library and Information Resources. \n\nThe Library is also working with the non-federal sector. The overall strategy is being executed in cooperation with the library, creative, publishing, technology and copyright communities. In early 2001 the Library established a National Digital Strategy Advisory Board to help guide it through the planning process. This board is made up of experts from the technology, publishing, Internet, library and intellectual-property communities as well as government.\n\nThe Library has also established a working group to look at ways that current copyright law can address how libraries and archives handle digital materials when preserving them and making them available to users.\n\nThe availability of electronic information is today taken for granted. With the rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web, millions of people have grown accustomed to using these tools as resources to acquire information—from a Ph.D. candidate conducting research for a dissertation to a teacher who might not be able to take a class on a field trip to see historical artifacts to a lifelong learner.\n\nDigital has become the principal medium to create, distribute and store content, from text to motion pictures to recorded sound. Digital content now embodies much of the nation's intellectual, social and cultural history. Because digital materials can be so easily altered, corrupted or even lost, these materials must be saved now if they are to remain available to today's and tomorrow's generations.\n\nNDIIPP is providing a national focus on important policy, standards and technical components necessary to preserve digital content. Investments in modeling and testing various options and technical solutions will take place over several years, resulting in recommendations to the U.S. Congress about the most viable and sustainable options for long-term preservation.\n\nIncluded in the 300 partners (as of March 2013) are eight consortial partnerships comprising 33 institutions that are selecting, collecting and preserving specific types of digital content:\n\nIn keeping with the mission of the NDIIPP, they are working with over 1,400 collections globally to preserve institution's at risk digital content. The collection's content ranges from Arts and Culture, Religion and Philosophy, Social Sciences, and World History and Cultures. The Library of Congress provides a full list of the collections as well as a interactive map of the collections' geographical location.\n\n"}

The work was traditionally dated to the reign of King Xuan of Zhou (827–782 BCE), but many modern scholars assign it to the State of Qin in the Warring States period. It is now known only through fragments.\n\nThe Zhòuwén () are 220 or so examples of ancient characters from the \"Shizhoupian\" quoted in the Han dynasty character dictionary \"Shuowen Jiezi\".\nThe \"zhòuwén\" characters have been described as generally symmetrical and balanced, and are on average (although not always) more complex than the later seal characters. They contain many swirls and circles in place of later squared or rectilinear forms.\n\nAccording to the postface of the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" and the \"Treatise on Literature\" chapter of the \"Book of Han\", the work was written during the reign of the late Western Zhou king Xuan by Shǐ Zhòu ( \"Historian Zhou\"), and consisted of 15 chapters ( \"piān\").\n\nWang Guowei disputed this account in his commentary on the \"Shizhoupian\", arguing that the structure and style of the characters did not match inscriptions from the period. Wang also questioned the traditional interpretation of \"zhòu\" () as the historian's name, pointing out that in ancient times, according to the \"Shuowen\", it had the same meaning as \"dú\" (\"to study and understand the meaning of books; to read\"). According to this view, the title of the book was likely taken from the first sentence of the text (as is often done when assigning names to untitled ancient texts like those on bronzes), which presumably contained \"the historian studies...\".\n\nTang Lan identified Shǐ Zhoù (Historian Zhòu) with Shǐ Liú ( \"Historian Liú\"), a name written with a similar character in the \"Book of Han\" chapter on \"Notable Persons Past and Present\" covering the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. A Historian Liú from the correct period is mentioned on an ancient \"dǐng\" tripodal cauldron in the collection of the Shanghai Museum.\n\n"}

The SRP was the first party to be banned by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1952.\n\nIt was established on 2 October 1949 in Hameln by Otto Ernst Remer, a former Wehrmacht major general who had played a vital role in defeating the 20 July plot, , a former editor of the CDU newsletter in Lower Saxony, and Gerhard Krüger, leader of the German Student Union under the Third Reich, after they had been excluded from the DKP-DRP. The SRP saw itself as a legitimate heir of the Nazi Party; most party adherents were former NSDAP members. Its foundation was backed by former Luftwaffe Oberst Hans-Ulrich Rudel.\n\nThe party claimed Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was a United States puppet and that Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz was the last legitimate President of the German Reich appointed by Adolf Hitler. It denied the existence of the Holocaust, claimed that the United States built the gas ovens of the Dachau concentration camp after the War and that films of concentration camps were faked. The SRP also advocated Europe, led by a reunited German Reich, as a \"third force\" against both capitalism and communism. It demanded the re-annexation of the former eastern territories of Germany and a \"solution of the Jewish question\". According to Karl Dietrich Bracher, \"SRP propaganda concentrated on a vague 'popular socialism' in which the old National Socialists rediscovered well-worn slogans, and also on a nationalism whose championship of Reich and war was but a thinly disguised continuation of the \"Lebensraum\" ideology\".\n\nAccording to Martin A. Lee, the SRP never openly criticised the Soviet Union because the Soviet Union funded the SRP as it held anti-American and pro-Soviet views. The Communist Party of Germany, on the other hand, did not receive Soviet funds because it was viewed as \"ineffectual\". Remer said that if the USSR ever did invade Germany, he would \"show the Russians the way to the Rhine\" and that SRP members would \"post themselves as traffic policemen, spreading their arms so that the Russians can find their way through Germany as quickly as possible\".\n\nDorls had been elected as a DKP-DRP deputy to the Bundestag parliament in the 1949 election. The SRP gained a second seat in parliament, when MP Fritz Rössler (alias Dr. Franz Richter) joined the party in 1950. In May 1951 it won 16 seats in the Lower Saxony state assembly (Landtag) election, receiving 11.0% of the votes with strongholds in the Stade region (21.5%; Verden district: 27.7%). In October 1951 it gained 7.7% of the votes in Bremen and won 8 seats in the city's Bürgerschaft parliament. \n\nThe SRP had about ten thousand members. Affiliated associations were the \"Reichsfront\" paramilitary organisation and the \"Reichsjugend\" youth wing, which were banned by decision of the Federal Minister of the Interior on 4 May 1951. On the same day, the West German cabinet decided to file an application to the Federal Constitutional Court to find the SRP anti-constitutional and to impose a ban. On 23 October 1952 the court according to Article 21 Paragraph 2 of the Basic Law adjudicated the party unconstitutional and dissolved, prohibited the founding of any successor organisations, withdraw all Bundestag and Landtag mandates and seized the party's assets (BVerfGE 2, 1). In view of the verdict, the SRP leaders had already declared the Party dissolved on 12 September.\n\n\n"}

The film stars pop girl group the Spice Girls who all play themselves. The film—made in a similar vein to The Beatles' \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964)—depicts a series of fictional events leading up to a major concert at London's Royal Albert Hall, liberally interspersed with dream sequences and flashbacks as well as surreal moments and humorous asides.\n\nThis is the second feature-length film directed by Spiers, following \"That Darn Cat\" (1997). The film features Richard E. Grant, Claire Rushbrook, Naoko Mori, Meat Loaf, Barry Humphries, and Alan Cumming in supporting roles. Filming took place in London for six of the eight filming weeks and also inside Twickenham Studios, as well as at over 40 famous British landmarks. Shooting featured several fourteen-hour shooting sessions and a constant, heavy media presence due to the Spice Girls' large popularity at the time.\n\nThe film premiered on 15 December 1997 and was released to British cinemas on the British holiday Boxing Day (26 December). In North America, the film was distributed by Columbia Pictures, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, and Icon Entertainment International and premiered on 23 January 1998. In the United States, \"Spice World\" became a box office success and broke the record for the highest-ever weekend debut for Super Bowl weekend with box office sales of $10,527,222. The film grossed $151 million at the box office worldwide and over $100 million including DVD sales. Despite being a box office success, the film received primarily negative reviews.\n\nTo celebrate its 20th Anniversary in 2017, \"Spice World\" was given a limited release across the United Kingdom showing at Odeon Cinemas. The film grossed just shy of £1 million bringing the total gross income $151 million worldwide.\n\nThe film begins with the Spice Girls performing \"Too Much\" on \"Top of the Pops\", but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of fame and fortune. Meanwhile, sinister newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphries) is attempting to ruin the girls' reputation for his newspaper's ratings. McMaxford dispatches photographer Damien (Richard O'Brien) to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Less threatening but more annoying is Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming), who stalks the girls along with his camera crew, hoping to use them as subjects for his next project. At the same time, the girls' uptight manager, Clifford (Richard E. Grant) and his sympathetic assistant Deborah (Claire Rushbrook), are fending off two over-eager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon (George Wendt and Mark McKinney), who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for a feature film for the Spice Girls.\n\nAmid this, the girls must prepare for their live concert at the Royal Albert Hall in three days, the biggest performance of their career. At the heart of it, the constant practices, traveling, publicity appearances, and other burdens of celebrity affect the girls on a personal level, preventing them from spending much time with their pregnant best friend, Nicola (Naoko Mori), who is due to give birth soon. Throughout the busy schedule, the girls attempt to ask Clifford for time off to spend with Nicola and relax, but Clifford refuses after talking with the head of the girls' record label, the cryptic and eccentric \"Chief\" (Roger Moore). The stress and overwork compound, which culminate in a huge argument between Clifford and the girls. The girls suddenly storm out on the evening before their gig at the Albert Hall.\n\nThe girls separately think back on their humble beginnings and their struggle to the top. They reunite by chance outside the now-abandoned café where they practiced during their childhood years, they reconcile, and decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, Nicola goes into labor at the nightclub and is rushed to the hospital in the girls' bus, giving birth to a healthy baby girl. When Emma notices that the delivery \"doctor\" has a camera, the girls realize that he is Damien, who runs off with the girls in hot pursuit, only to hit his head after accidentally colliding with an empty stretcher. When Damien sees the girls standing over him, he tells them that they have made him see the error of his ways, and he goes after McMaxford, who is subsequently fired in a \"Jacuzzi scandal\".\n\nAfter noticing the girls' bus driver, Dennis (Meat Loaf) is missing, Victoria decides to take the wheel. It becomes a race against time as Victoria drives like a maniac through London. While approaching Tower Bridge, the bridge begins to raise to let a boat through the River Thames. Victoria drives up the bridge and over the gap. The bus finally lands safely on the other side, but when Emma opens a trapdoor in the floor, she discovers a bomb, and the girls scream before Emma slams the trapdoor shut again.\n\nThe girls finally arrive at the Royal Albert Hall for their performance and run up the steps. However, the girls have one more obstacle to overcome: a London policeman (Kevin McNally) charges the girls with \"dangerous driving, criminal damage, flying a bus without a license, and frightening the pigeons\". Emma pushes forward and tells the policeman that she and the other girls were late for their performance at the Albert Hall. Emma smiles at the policeman, and he lets the girls off for their performance. The film ends when the girls perform their song \"Spice Up Your Life\" at the start of their Royal Albert Hall concert broadcast live on television around the world.\n\nThe supporting cast later talk about the girls' film during the closing credits. Mel C breaks the fourth wall and tells the other girls that the outgoing audience is watching them. The girls talk to the audience, commenting on \"those two in the back row snogging\" and on one's dress, and discuss their film, just minutes before the bomb in their bus explodes.\n\n\n\nAn official motion picture soundtrack has not been released, since their second studio album, \"Spiceworld\", was released at the time, heavily promoted and served as the film's soundtrack. The only song from \"Spiceworld\" not to appear in the film is \"Move Over\". The songs appearing in the film are in order of appearance.\n\nSpiers had been working in America on the Disney film \"That Darn Cat\" at the peak of the Spice Girls' popularity. He was unaware of the group when first offered the job until his friend Jennifer Saunders advised that he take it. He arrived at a meeting with them in a New York hotel unaware of what they looked like.\n\nFrank Bruno was originally cast as the tour bus driver, but withdrew after a security guard prevented his son Franklin having an on-set photo taken with the girls.\n\nMentions of Princess Diana and scenes including the designer Gianni Versace had to be edited out in post-production following their deaths before the release of the film.\n\nThe film reunited Meat Loaf and Richard O'Brien, who co-starred in the 1975 classic film \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". The film also reunited O'Brien and Barry Humphries, who costarred in the \"Rocky Horror\" follow-up, \"Shock Treatment\" (1981).\n\n\"Their company rang me up and asked if I would be in it\", remarked Elvis Costello of his cameo. \"I wouldn't have thought I was the kind of face you would get to do a cornflakes advert. Maybe twenty years ago. I was surprised.\"\n\nGary Glitter filmed a four-minute cameo appearance as himself, but shortly before the film was to be released he was arrested on child pornography offences. The Spice Girls and the production team agreed that his cameo should be deleted from the final print. The performance of Glitter's \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\" was retained.\n\nOfficial toy versions of the Spice Bus were produced upon the release of the movie. On 18 July 2014, the actual Spice Bus used in the film was put on permanent display at Island Harbour Marina, on the Isle of Wight, England.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Spice World\" was granted a PG certificate by the British Board of Film Classification for \"mild bad language, mild sex references\". In the United States, it received a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association of America for \"some vulgarity, brief nudity and language\".\n\nSpiceworld was a number-one box office success in the United Kingdom, grossing more than £6.8 million during its opening weekend on Boxing Day, 1997. The film was also successful at the box office in the United States, breaking the record at that time for the highest-ever weekend debut for Super Bowl weekend (25 January 1998), with box office sales of $10,527,222. The film took in total $151 million at the box office worldwide.\n\nThe film was released on VHS in May 1998 in many regions including the UK, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Japan and Australia. In June 1998, it came out on VHS in the US and Canada. Despite concerns that the high-profile departure of Halliwell from the Spice Girls would affect sales, global demand for the VHS was high. In the UK, the film was number one on the video charts for six consecutive weeks, was certified 11x Platinum, and became the ninth best-selling video of 1998. In the US, the film peaked at number one on the video charts for five consecutive weeks and was the fifth best-selling video of 1998.\n\nIn 2017, the film was screened at various cinemas in the UK and Australia to mark its 20th anniversary. Plans to re-release the movie in other worldwide territories are currently underway.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics. Film review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave \"Spice World\" a rating of 35% based on reviews from 63 critics, with an average rating of 4.5 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film has a 32 out of 100 rating, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". AllMovie gave it two out of five stars.\n\nNoted American film critic Roger Ebert gave the film one-half of a star and listed \"Spice World\" as one of his most hated films, saying: \"The Spice Girls are easier to tell apart than the Mutant Ninja Turtles, but that is small consolation: What can you say about five women whose principal distinguishing characteristic is that they have different names? They occupy \"Spice World\" as if they were watching it: They're so detached they can't even successfully lip-synch their own songs.\" And when he reviewed the film on his and Gene Siskel's film critique programme \"Siskel & Ebert\", only three weeks into 1998, he declared that he had already seen the worst film of that year, and called it \"an entertainment-free dead zone\". Ebert would include this film on the \"Worst of 1998\" special; but he chose \"Armageddon\" as the worst film of 1998.\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" stated that the film \"is pleasant and painless enough to amuse ardent fans, who figure in the film quite often.\" She also noted that while it got a PG rating in the United States, \"nothing about it should disturb its target audience of media-wise, fun-loving 8-year-old girls.\" Writing for \"Sight and Sound\", in a positive review, Mark Sinker placed it alongside The Monkees' 1968 cult film \"Head\". He went on to say that it \"sends up the amiable idiocy of pop packaging - and the slow witted mass-media response to it\" and it was \"tirelessly generous in its energy\".\n\nDerek Elley, resident film critic for \"Variety\", gave the film mixed reviews, calling the film \"bright and breezy\" and \"as timely but evanescent as the Cool Britannia culture it celebrates\". He stated that the film would \"delight the Fab Five's pre-pubescent fans\" but that it would \"be forgotten within six months\".\n\nThe film has been listed in Golden Raspberry Awards founder John Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of \"The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made\".\nThe film, while being negatively reviewed, is remembered fondly by many who were part of its target audience of younger pop fans at the time of its release. It has arguably achieved cult status as a commentary on pop culture, and is ultimately a more cohesive film by a pop group than predecessors like The Beatles' \"A Hard Day's Night\" or \"Magical Mystery Tour\".\n\n\n\"Spice World: The 10th Anniversary Edition\" was released on DVD on 19 November 2007 in the United Kingdom and Australia and on 27 November 2007 in the United States.\n\n\"Spice World: The 20th Anniversary Edition\" will be released on Blu Ray in the UK and Australia in December 2018 to mark the 20th anniversary of the VHS release. It will feature a new documentary about the film with all five Spice Girls and many apecial guests who featured in the film including Jennifer Saunders , Richard E. Grant, and Meat Loaf.\n\n"}

Published by Justus Perthes of Gotha (established 1785 and still existing there) it went through ten editions from 1816 to 1945. As with many 19th century publications, an edition was issued in parts; for example, the eighth edition was issued in 32 monthly parts.\n\nThe earliest edition, by Stieler and Christian Gottlieb Reichard, was published as separate plates from 1817 to 1823. There were 47 maps, though the intention had been to publish 50. After Stieler's death Friedrich von Stülpnagel (1786–1865) edited the first (1834-1845) edition, and the second (1845–47) with 107 maps.. Petermann contributed to the third (1854–62) edition containing 83 maps, the fourth (1864-67) and the fifth (1868-74), each with 84 maps.\n\nHowever, it was not until the sixth edition (1871–75, 90 maps), edited by August Petermann (1822–78), Hermann Berghaus (1828–1890) and Carl Vogel (1828–1897), that the work reached the high scientific level and the unsurpassed relief \"Stieler's Atlas\" is famous for. A seventh edition was issued 1879-82; an eighth 1888-91 (both 95 maps) under the direction of Hermann Berghaus, Vogel and Hermann Habenicht (1844–1917). Although the printing industry had already changed to lithography for some time, some maps in \"Stieler's Atlas\" were still reproduced by copper-plate printing on hand presses with hand colouring into the 1890s.\n\nThe ninth edition (1901–05), edited by Habenicht, with one hundred maps, over double the number of the initial edition, was the first one printed on cylinder machines by means of lithography, which halved the price and made the \"Stieler\" accessible to a broad public. 16 maps hereof were exclusively translated to English, transferred to Imperial units and became part the 11th edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" (1910–1911). Hermann Haack (1872–1966) edited the tenth (centenary) edition (1920–25, 108 maps), with an index to 320,000 entries being the most comprehensive world atlas of modern times.\n\nEnglish versions of the ninth and tenth editions appeared as \"Stieler's Atlas of Modern Geography\", and editions with similar titles were also issued in French, Italian and Spanish. An international edition (1934–1940) remained with 84 of the 114 maps planned incomplete due to wartime circumstances. The work was engraved on 432 copper plates which have been preserved.\n\n"}

Kennedy in 1957. The couple moved to New York City by the end of 1965, with Paul dying in 1967 of cancer\n\nTo make a living, Kennedy began teaching Mexican cooking classes in her Upper West Side apartment, with the cuisine quite novel at the time. Although \"New York Times\" food writer Craig Claiborne once mentioned to her that she should write a Mexican cookbook and encouraged her cooking classes. The book began to come together after then-poetry editor at Harper and Row Fran McCullough took one of her classes and offered to be her editor. The two would eventually work on Kennedy’s first five cookbooks. Although Kennedy had been collecting recipes since her time in Mexico City, she decided to go to Mexico to do further research. This research, she believes, is what separates her from other cookbook writers is that she has taken the time and effort to explore Mexico and do field research on how the cuisine varies.\n\nKennedy did not have any prior writing experience before the book, but after several rewrites, she published \"The Cuisines of Mexico\" in 1972. This book became a best-seller and is still one of the most authoritative single volumes on Mexican cooking.\n\nIt began to change Americans' understanding of Mexican food, expanding it beyond Tex-Mex into the various regional cuisines and dishes, and is the basis of establishing authentic Mexican food in this country. The contents of this book along with two that followed, \"The Tortilla Book\" and \"Mexican Regional Cooking\", were compiled in 2000 into \"The Essential Cuisines of Mexico\".

It was a precursor to modern guides such as \"The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music\".\n\nThe guide was conceived and written by Edward Sackville-West and the music critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor. Their aim, as set out in the preface to the first edition in 1951, was \"to try to supply a guide-book to the vast available repertory of the gramophone\". The book ran to 763 pages, but nevertheless confined its coverage to records available in Britain in the domestic catalogues up to and including December, 1950. A reviewer wrote of the first edition: \"It is not an encyclopaedia … for the principle of it is selective rather than comprehensive. We cannot, therefore, fairly charge the authors with omissions other than those which are inadvertent. The point is made with subtlety in the introduction. 'Inadvertent omissions there are bound to be, in spite of every effort to avoid them but it should not be assumed by the reader that an unquoted record has been simply overlooked. It is much more likely to have been excluded deliberately.'\"\n\nThe book considers recordings in alphabetical order of composer. Each composer section begins with an introduction assessing and describing the composer's works, after which the recordings are described and evaluated, using a star system, with two stars as the top rating. Of the introductions, the reviewer of \"The Gramophone\" wrote, \"these paragraphs vary from a few lines to a couple of pages (the length being unrelated to the importance of the composer) and anyone unfamiliar with the authors would not have to read far before realising that two exceptionally intelligent musical minds had been at work.\"\n\nTo the keep the guide current, Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor produced interim updates, \"The Record Year\" in 1952 and 1953. At this time the long playing record was being introduced, but records were also being issued in the old 78 r.p.m. format. By 1955 the number of new releases threatened to overwhelm the authors, who recruited two younger colleagues to help them, Andrew Porter and William Mann. Between them they produced a full new edition of \"The Record Guide\" in 1955, running to 957 pages, and a final supplement in 1956.\n\nFour years after the last in the series of \"The Record Guide\" was published, three young musical writers emulated its layout and \"modus operandi\" in \"The Stereo Record Guide\", which has evolved into \"The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music\"\n"}

The sculpture is coated with a flat-black industrial fluoropolymer exterior paint applied to achieve a matte finish. Currently sited on a patch of turf in the Sculpture Garden of the Hirshhorn, the sculpture is supported by three subterranean plates with brackets at three points.\n\nIn the early to mid-sixties, Smith experimented with tetrahedral and octahedral forms in sculptures such as \"Willy\" and \"Amaryllis\". Over a decade later, Smith returned to these earlier geometries with \"Throwback\". Thus the title of the work alludes to this act of looking back. Smith elaborated on this point, \"In a certain sense the piece is unique. I did not have the prospect or opportunity of making a large architectural sculpture so I decided to do something more conventional. I made an object that recalls an earlier period.\"\n\nThe International Paper Company was the first to purchase the first sculpture of the edition and originally displayed it at the company's New York headquarters. It is now owned by the City of New York and on display at 1166 Avenue of the Americas.\n\nThe second version was purchased by San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and is currently on display. The artists proof has not been fabricated.\n\nSeveral other versions of the work exist. In 1976, a smaller (62 × 150 inches), unique version of the work was installed at Grove Isle, Coconut Grove, Florida. A full-scale plywood model, painted black, was created for exhibition at the Pace Gallery in 1979. A cardboard maquette (measuring 13 1/2 × 32 1/2 × 16 inches) was intended to serve as the model of an edition of 9 bronzes. However, the maquette was ultimately produced in a numbered edition of 6.\n\nWhile the work is dated from 1976–1977, the Hirshhorn's edition of the work was acquired from the Pace Gallery in 1980. Lippincott, Inc fabricated the sculpture in North Haven, Connecticut, in the same year.\n\n\n"}

Pace, 955 F.2d 270 (5th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, is a United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit court decision relating to the open fields doctrine limiting the scope of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nActing on a tip, Texas investigators, entered onto the defendant’s property in Travis County and peeked through a hole in a barn where they discovered marijuana being cultivated. With this information the officers gained a search warrant, which they used to search the property. The defendant was eventually arrested, tried and convicted for \"possession with intent to distribute\". The defendant challenged on Fourth Amendment grounds, claiming that the barn was inside the \"curtilage\" of his home. The court found that it was not and that the search was legal pursuant to the \"open fields\" doctrine. The court held that the search was constitutional and that the barn was not within the curtilage of the appellant's home because the barn was located a significant distance from the house, was separated from the house by an interior fence, was not being used for activities associated with the intimacies of home life, and was readily visible from the surrounding area.\n"}

Extending down the slopes from the palace, this walled park was reserved only for palace dwellers during the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II.\n\nThe area of Yıldız used to be a forest in Byzantine times. Starting during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultans made it their hunting grounds. In the next centuries, it remained as a grove behind the seaside palaces. The neighbourhood began to flourish in the wake of construction of the palace in the 19th century. It took its name from the first pavilion, namely \"Yıldız Kasrı\", commissioned by Selim III in early 19th century.\n\nThe of the palace's external garden were surrounded by high walls and detached from a grove during the reign of Abdulhamid II in the 19th century.
