{"id": "48984989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48984989", "title": "Albert Einstein Archives", "text": "Albert Einstein Archives\n\nAlbert Einstein Archives refers to an archive on the Givat Ram (Edmond J. Safra) campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Jerusalem, Israel housing the personal papers of 20th century physicist Albert Einstein.\n\nIn his will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the copyright to them. The Albert Einstein Archives contain some 55,000 items. In March 2012, the University announced that it had digitized the archive and was planning to make it more accessible online. The archive initially released 2,000 documents. Within the collection are his personal notes, love letters to various women, including the woman who would become his second wife, Elsa. Also to be included in the online collection is a letter to the Arabic newspaper \"Falastin\", proposing a \"Secret Council\" composed of Arabs and Jews to resolve the Arab–Israeli conflict.\n\nAlbert Einstein visited Palestine in 1923 for 12 days, giving the first lecture at the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem—two years before the University opened in 1925. Menachem Ussishkin, the president of the Zionist Executive, invited Einstein to settle in Jerusalem, but this was the only visit that Einstein actually made to Jerusalem. However, Einstein was a member of the university's first board of governors. In 1925, the original 46-page manuscript of the general theory of relativity ended up at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nEinstein did not save all of his written material, but from 1919, as his fame increased, he employed his stepdaughter Ilse as a secretarial assistant. Helen Dukas (1896–1982) began working for Einstein with increased systematization from April 1928, although not all outgoing correspondence was saved. After the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Einstein's son-in-law Rudolf Kayser, aided by the French Embassy, rescued Einstein's papers in Berlin. Some of the material at Einstein's summer house in Caputh, Brandenburg was destroyed to avoid seizure, although most of his works between 1930 and 1932 were saved. That material was transported via Haberlandstrasse where Einstein lived in Berlin, then to Paris, and ended up stored in Princeton, New Jersey, United States until after Einstein's death.\n\nEinstein's 1950 will appointed Helen Dukas and Otto Nathan as trustees of the estate and stated, \"[A]ll literary rights and assets shall be vested in the Hebrew University.\" After Einstein's death in 1955, the trustees spent many years organizing Einstein's papers. In the 1960s, Helen Dukas and the physicist Gerald Holton of Harvard University in the USA reorganized the archive, with the aim of publishing the material, in a joint project between the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Princeton University Press. The material increased from 14,000 documents at the time of Einstein's death in 1955 to around 42,000 documents in 1982. To aid in this work, Einstein's papers were transferred from his Princeton home to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University.\n\nIn 1982, the Einstein Estate transferred Einstein's personal papers to the Jewish National & University Library in Jerusalem. President Avraham Harman of The Hebrew University and Milton Handler of the American Friends of The Hebrew University worked on the transfer of the material to Jerusalem. In subsequent years, additional material was sent from Einstein's Princeton home. The Bern Dibner Curatorship, which manages the Albert Einstein Archives, was established in 1988 by the Dibner Fund of Connecticut, USA.\n\nThe first curator of the Einstein Archives was Ze'ev Rosenkranz whose term extended from 1989 to 2003. The catalogue was made available online in 2003. Since 2004, Roni Grosz has been the head of the Archives. The Einstein Archives became part of the Hebrew University's Library Authority in January 2008. In July of that year, the Archives moved to the Levy Building on the Givat Ram campus. Since March 19, 2012, the Archives have digitized and made available increasingly more of Einstein's works online. Princeton University Press has also been active in this effort.\n\n\n"}

It was founded as the National Film Library in 1935; its first curator was Ernest Lindgren. In 1955, its name became the National Film Archive, and, in 1992, the National Film and Television Archive. It was renamed BFI National Archive in 2006.\n\nIt collects, preserves, restores, and shares the films and television programmes which have helped to shape and record British life and times since the development of cine film in the late 19th century. The majority of the collection is British originated material, but it also features internationally significant holdings from around the world. The Archive also collects films which feature key British actors and the work of British directors.\n\nThe collections themselves are accommodated on several sites. The J. Paul Getty, Jr. Conservation Centre in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, named after its benefactor, is the base for much of the restoration work, while approximately 140 million feet of unstable nitrate film and all the master film collection held on acetate or other media is kept separately at a BFI storage site at Gaydon in Warwickshire.\n\nFilm preservation is an ongoing project among filmmakers, historians, archivists, museums, and nonprofit organisations to rescue deteriorating film stock and preserve the recorded image. In recent years the Conservation Centre has completed a number of much anticipated restorations of a diverse range of film titles. This has included the Mitchell and Kenyon collection, which consists almost entirely of actuality films commissioned by travelling fairground operators for showing at local fairgrounds or other venues across the UK in the early part of the twentieth century.\n\nOther notable recent restorations include:\n\nThe collection now known as the BFI National Archive was founded as the National Film Library in 1935 by Ernest Lindgren, who was the first curator. The BFI National Archive now comprises over 275,000 titles in total consisting of feature, non-fiction and short films (dating from 1894) and 210,000 television programmes. It is one of the largest and most prestigious film collections in the world. Notable collections include:\n\nThe archive holds 20,000 silent films including, Cecil Hepworth's \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1903), and actively collects artists' moving images. In addition to moving image materials the Special Collections hold the records of filmmakers and institutions. Significant collections include:\n\nFilms and television programmes are acquired mainly by donation or, in the case of independent television, via funding direct from the TV companies. Emphasis is placed on British productions but whenever possible important and popular movies from overseas are also acquired.\n\n\n"}

The report discusses ecclesiological principles and suggests practical rules for both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches to implement about improving relations by reciprocally avoiding interfering in each other's Churches and not using history in a polemical manner. According to Cardinal Edward Cassidy, the report contains three principles: that individuals have the freedom to follow their conscience, that Eastern Catholic Churches have the right to exist, that uniatism is not the current method of full communion; and two conclusions: that the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches are \"sister churches\" and that rebaptism should be avoided. The Eastern Catholics rejected the report \"because it seemed to imply they should never have existed in the first place\" while the Eastern Orthodox rejected it because it did not call for the abolition of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\n\nThe suggested ecclesiological principles include that the Eastern Catholic Churches of the Catholic Church should be included the theological dialogue. Monks from Mount Athos monasteries protested against this principle.\n\nThe central issue is exclusivity of the doctrine that there is no salvation outside the Church. Missionaries converted other Christians \"so as 'to bring them back' to one's own Church. In order to legitimize this tendency, a source of proselytism, the Catholic Church developed the theological vision according to which she presented herself as the only one to whom salvation was entrusted. As a reaction, the Orthodox Church, in turn, came to accept the same vision according to which only in her could salvation be found. To assure the salvation of 'the separated brethren' it even happened that Christians were rebaptized and that certain requirements of the religious freedom of persons and of their act of faith were forgotten.\"\nThe principle that \"the inviolable freedom of persons and their obligation to follow the requirements of their conscience,\" is foundational, according to Cassidy, \"and justifies both the personal choice to adhere to the Catholic Church or to the Orthodox Church, and offers the possibility of returning to the Catholic Church for those communities which in 1945–49 had been forced to convert by Communist regimes to become part of the Orthodox Church,\" as happened in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.\n\nThe report notes that a solution to the problems depends upon \"a will to pardon\" and to \"overcome reciprocal lack of understanding\" with a goal of restoring \"the full communion which existed for more than a thousand years between our Churches.\" \nWhile the Catholic Church \"no longer aims at proselytizing among the Orthodox.\"\nThe report acknowledges that historically relations between the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches were \"marked by persecutions and sufferings\" and that no one should \"accuse or disparage the other Church.\"\nChurches need to respect all \"who suffered, confessed their faith, witnessed their fidelity to the Church, and, in general, towards all Christians, without discrimination, who underwent persecutions.\"\nThe report suggests that by relinquishing \"everything that can foment division, contempt and hatred between the Churches\" a resolution to \"the extremely complex situation that has been created in Eastern Europe\" can be implemented.\nAccording to the report, both Churches need to \"scrupulously respect the religious liberty of the faithful\" which \"requires that, particularly in situations of conflict, the faithful are able to express their opinion and to decide without pressure from outside if they wish to be in communion either with the Orthodox Church or with the Catholic Church.\"\nA \"necessary respect for christian freedom\" requires the exclusion of \"every form of pressure\" and a \"respect for consciences\" should guide pastoral concerns in both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church.\nOpen dialogue is necessary. \"If agreement cannot be reached on the local level, the question should be brought to mixed commissions established by higher authorities.\"\n\nCondemning group violence against communities of a sister church lessens suspicion, the report paraphrased Pope John Paul II, that violence and pressure needs to \"be absolutely avoided in order that freedom of conscience be respected. It is the task of those in charge of communities to assist their faithful to deepen their loyalty towards their own Church and towards its traditions and to teach them to avoid not only violence, be that physical or verbal, but also all that could lead to contempt for other Christians and to a counter-witness, completely ignoring the work of salvation which is reconciliation in Christ.\"\n\n\"The use of violence to occupy a place of worship contradicts\" faith in sacramental reality and \"the evangelical ethos requires that statements or manifestations which are likely to perpetuate a state of conflict and hinder the dialogue be avoided.\"\nClergy \"have the duty before God to respect the authority which the Holy Spirit has given to the bishops and priests of the other Church and for that reason to avoid interfering in the spiritual life of the faithful of that Church. When cooperation becomes necessary for the good of the faithful, it is then required that those responsible to an agreement among themselves, establish for this mutual assistance clear principles which are known to all, and act subsequently with frankness, clarity, and with respect for the sacramental discipline of the other Church.\"\nNew Catholic pastoral projects, \"which imply the creation of new structures in regions which traditionally form part of the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church,\" should not be established without consulting the Orthodox bishops in the same geographical area to avoid the risk of rivalry and conflict.\nInstead of intervention by civil authorities, dialogue about \"the complexity of present realities and local circumstances\" between Churches or local communities should be used to resolve problems such as \"the possession or return of ecclesiastical property.\"\n\nAvoiding \"the use of history in a polemical manner will lead to an awareness that faults leading to separation belong to both sides, leaving deep wounds on each side.\" Clergy should be educated about \"the apostolic succession of the other Church and the authenticity of its sacramental life\" as should \"a correct and comprehensive knowledge of history aiming at a historiography of the two Churches which is in agreement and even may be common.\"\nProviding \"objective news to the mass-media especially to the religious press in order to avoid tendentious and misleading information\" should be a common task to evangelize a secularized world.\n\n\"By excluding all proselytism and all desire for expansion by Catholics at the expense of the Orthodox Church, the commission hopes that it has overcome the obstacles which impelled certain autocephalous Churches to suspend their participation in the theological dialogue and that the Orthodox Church will\" continue the theological work of the commission.\n\nRepresentatives of the Catholic Church and nine autocephalous and autonomous Eastern Orthodox Churches participated: Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, Russian Orthodox Church, Romanian Orthodox Church, Cypriot Orthodox Church, Polish Orthodox Church, Albanian Orthodox Church, Finnish Orthodox Church under the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nRepresentatives of the Church of Greece, the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the Georgian Orthodox Church, the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church and Orthodox Church of America did not participate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12101775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12101775", "title": "Comparison of MD and DO in the United States", "text": "Comparison of MD and DO in the United States\n\nIn the United States, physicians may hold either the Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) or the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (DO). MD and DO physicians complete similar residency programs in hospitals, can be licensed in all 50 states, and have rights and responsibilities common to physicians.\n\nHistorically, MDs and DOs significantly differed in their approach to medical treatment. Allopathic medicine, practiced by MDs, was primarily based on scientific practices. In contrast, osteopathic medicine was founded in the mid-nineteenth century on the premise of healing the body through osteopathic musculoskeletal manipulation. MD and DO schools can also be distinguished by a relative lack of scientific and clinical research at DO schools. The coursework at MD and DO schools is similar, with the most notable exception being that DO students are taught osteopathic manipulative medicine.\n\nWhile allopathic medicine has followed the development of society, osteopathic medicine is a more recent development. The first MD school in the United States opened in 1807 in New York. In 1845, the American Medical Association was formed, and standards were put into place, with a three-year program including lectures, dissection, and hospital experience. In 1892, frontier physician Andrew Taylor Still founded the American School of Osteopathy in Kirksville, MO as a protest against the present medical system. A. T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. Throughout the 1900s, DOs fought to gain practice rights and government recognition. The first state to pass such regulations allowing DOs medical practice rights was California in 1901, the last was Nebraska in 1989. Up through the 1960s, osteopathic medicine was labeled a cult by the American Medical Association, and collaboration by physicians with osteopathic practitioners was considered to be unethical.\n\nThe American Medical Association's current definition of a physician is \"an individual who has received a 'Doctor of Medicine' or a 'Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine' degree or an equivalent degree following successful completion of a prescribed course of study from a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine.\"\n\nIn a 2005 editorial about mitigating the impending shortage of physicians in the United States, Jordan Cohen, MD, then-president of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) stated:\nAfter more than a century of often bitterly contentious relationships between the osteopathic and allopathic medical professions, we now find ourselves living at a time when osteopathic and allopathic graduates are both sought after by many of the same residency programs; are in most instances both licensed by the same licensing boards; are both privileged by many of the same hospitals; and are found in appreciable numbers on the faculties of each other's medical schools.\n\nIn the United States, MDs and DOs are fully licensed medical doctors and have full medical practice rights throughout the United States. An MD is accepted worldwide, while the DO degree is accepted in 44 countries abroad. Currently, less than 10% of US physicians have a DO degree. A Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) is different than an osteopath: a DO is a physician, while an osteopath is not.\n\nOf the 860,917 physicians actively practicing in the United States in 2015, 67.1% hold an MD degree granted in the U.S., 24.3% are international medical graduates, and 7.6% hold a DO degree. The percentage of physicians that hold a DO degree varies by specialty, with the greatest representation in Family Medicine/General Practice (16.5% of general practitioners), Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (13.8%), and Emergency Medicine (11.2%).\n\nAs of 2015, 9.0% of residents and fellows in medical training programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), which accredits all MD residency programs, hold a DO degree. 65.1% of the 19,302 DO graduates enrolled in post-doctoral training are in ACGME-accredited programs, with the remainder in AOA programs. In 2020, the ACGME will take over the accreditation of all residency programs in the United States for both MDs and DOs.\n\nThere are significantly more MDs than DOs, though the number of DOs is increasing, due to the relative ease of obtaining admission to a DO school relative to an MD school, and a number of new DO schools opening at a rate faster than MD schools, and an increase in applicants for medical schools as a whole. A 2012 survey of students applying to both U.S. MD and DO schools found that 9% of applicants were admitted only to an MD school, 46% were admitted only to a DO school, 26% were admitted to both, and 19% were not admitted to any medical schools. Geographic location was the top reason given by both DO and MD students for choosing the school in which they enrolled.\nOf first-year medical students matriculating in 2016, 25.9% (7,369 students) entered DO medical programs and 74.1% (21,030 students) entered MD programs. The Association of American Medical Colleges projects that from 2016 to 2021, first-year DO student enrollment will increase by 19.4% versus a 5.7% increase in MD students. Between 1980 and 2005, the annual number of new MDs remained stable at around 16,000. During the same period, the number of new DOs increased by more than 200% (from about 1,150 to about 2,800). The number of new MDs per 100,000 people fell from 7.5 to 5.6, while the number of new DOs per 100,000 rose from 0.4 to 0.8.\n\nThe geographic distribution of MD and DO physicians is not uniform. As of 2012, the states with the greatest ratio of active physicians holding a DO degree versus active physicians holding an MD degree were Oklahoma (20.7% of physicians), Iowa, Michigan, Maine, and West Virginia. During that same year, the states with the greatest ratio of active physicians holding an MD degree versus a DO degree were Louisiana, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, Maryland, and Connecticut. The states with the greatest \"per capita number\" of DO physicians are Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Iowa. The states with the greatest \"per capita number\" of MD physicians are Washington, D.C., Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, and Connecticut. Doctors holding a DO degree are more likely to practice in rural areas. \n\nThe sex and racial distribution of DOs and MDs are similar.\n\nIn comparison to allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine has been criticized for the relative lack of research and lesser emphasis on scientific inquiry at D.O. schools in comparison with M.D. schools. According to the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association, the \"inability to institutionalize research, particularly clinical research, at osteopathic institutions has, over the years, weakened the acculturation, socialization, and distinctive beliefs and practices of osteopathic students and graduates.\"\n\nAllopathic medical schools have applied for and received 800 times more funding for scientific and clinical research from the National Institutes of Health than osteopathic schools have. Osteopathic schools ranked last out of 17 types of educational institutions, including veterinary medicine, optometry, social work, and dentistry. In 2014, the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association stated that research from osteopathic schools amounted to \"fewer than 15 publications per year per school, and more than a quarter of these publications had never been cited. Clearly, scholarly contributions from osteopathic medical schools are unacceptably low in both quantity and quality.\"\n\nSeveral studies have investigated whether there is a difference in the approach to patients by MDs and DOs. A study of patient visits to general and family medicine physicians in the U.S., including 277 million visits to MDs and 65 million visits to DOs, found that there was no significant difference between DOs and MDs with regard to time spent with patients and preventive medicine services. \n\nThe study of approximately 341 million healthcare visits founds that there was no difference on the rate that doctors provided to patients diet or nutrition counseling, weight reduction counseling, exercise counseling, tobacco use or exposure counseling, and mental health or stress reduction counseling. Some authors describe subjective distinctions in patient interactions, but Avery Hurt writes, \"In actual practice, the variations between the two types of physicians are often so slight as to be unnoticeable to patients, and a day in the life of each can appear indistinguishable. But the differences are there, subtle but deep.\"\n\nA study conducted during 1993-94 found significant differences in the attitudes of DOs and MDs. The study found that 40.1% of MD students and physicians described themselves as \"socioemotionally\" oriented over \"technoscientific\" orientation. 63.8% of their DO counterparts self-identified as socioemotional.\n\nOne study of DOs attempted to investigate their perceptions of differences in philosophy and practice between themselves and their MD counterparts. 88% of the respondents had a self-identification as osteopathic medical physicians, while less than half felt their patients identified them as such.\n\nAs the training of DOs and MDs becomes less distinct, some have expressed concern that the unique characteristics of osteopathic medicine will be lost. Others welcome the rapprochement and already consider modern medicine to be the type of medicine practiced by both \"MD and DO type doctors.\" One persistent difference is the respective acceptance of the terms \"allopathic\" and \"osteopathic.\" DO medical schools and organizations all include the word \"osteopathic\" in their names, and such groups actively promote an \"osteopathic approach\" to medicine. While \"osteopathy\" was a term used by its founder AT Still in the 19th century to describe his new philosophy of medicine, \"allopathic medicine\" was originally a derogatory term coined by Samuel Hahnemann to contrast the conventional medicine of his day with his alternative system of homeopathic medicine. Today, the term \"allopathic physician\" is used infrequently, usually in discussions relating to comparisons with osteopathic medicine or alternative medicine. Some authors argue that the terms \"osteopathic\" and \"allopathic\" should be dropped altogether, since their original meanings bear little relevance to the current practice of modern medicine.\n\nThe Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredits the 144 U.S. medical schools that award the MD degree, while the American Osteopathic Association (AOA)'s Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) accredits the 34 osteopathic medical schools that award the DO degree. Osteopathic schools tend to be affiliated with smaller universities.\n\nMichigan State University, Rowan University, and Nova Southeastern University offer both MD and DO accredited programs. In 2009, Kansas City University proposed starting a dual MD/DO program in addition to the existing DO program, and the University of North Texas explored the possibility of starting an MD program that would be offered alongside the DO program. Both proposals were met with controversy. Proponents argued that adding an MD program would lead to the creation of more local residency programs and improve the university’s ability to acquire research funding and state funding, while opponents wanted to protect the discipline of osteopathy.\n\n61% of graduating seniors at osteopathic medical schools evaluated that over half of their required in-hospital training was delivered by MD physicians. Overall, osteopathic medical schools have more modest research programs compared to MD schools, and fewer DO schools are part of universities that own a hospital. Osteopathic medical schools tend to have a stronger focus on primary care medicine than MD schools. DO schools have developed various strategies to encourage their graduates to pursue primary care, such as offering accelerated 3-year programs for primary care, focusing clinical education in community health centers, and selecting rural or under-served urban areas for the location of new campuses.\n\nMany authors note the most obvious difference between the curricula of DO and MD schools is osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM), a form of hands-on care used to diagnose, treat and prevent illness or injury and is taught only at DO schools. As of 2006, the average osteopathic medical student spent almost 8 weeks on clerkships for OMM during their third and fourth years. The National Institute of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health states that overall, studies have shown that spinal manipulation can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain and appears to be as effective as conventional medical treatments. In 2007 guidelines, the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society include spinal manipulation as one of several treatment options for practitioners to consider using when pain does not improve with self-care. Spinal manipulation is generally a safe treatment for low-back pain. Serious complications are very rare. A 2001 survey of DOs found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT (osteopathic manipulative treatment) on less than 5% of their patients. The survey was the latest indication that DOs have become more like MD physicians in all respects: fewer perform OMT, more prescribe drugs, and many perform surgery as a first option. One area which has been implicated, but not been formally studied regarding the decline in OMT usage among DOs in practice, is the role of reimbursement changes. Only in the last several years could a DO charge for both an office visit (Evaluation & Management services) and use a procedure (CPT) code when performing OMT; previously, it was bundled.\n\nThere is a statistical difference in average GPA and MCAT scores of those who matriculate at DO schools versus those who matriculate at MD schools. In 2016, the average MCAT and GPA for students entering U.S.-based MD programs were 508.7 and 3.70, respectively, and 502.2 and 3.54 for DO matriculants. DO medical schools are more likely to accept non-traditional students, who are older, coming to medicine as a second career, etc.\n\nMD students take United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)'s series of three licensing exams during and after medical school. \n\nDO students are required to take the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination (COMLEX-USA) that is administered by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). This exam is a prerequisite for DO-associated residency programs, which are available in almost every specialty of medicine and surgery. DO medical students may also choose to sit for the USMLE if they wish to take an MD residency and about 48% take USMLE Step 1. However, if they have taken COMLEX, it may or may not be needed, depending on the individual institution’s program requirements.\n\nCurrently, the ACGME accredits all MD residency programs, while the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) accredits all DO residency programs. DO students may choose to apply to ACGME-accredited residency programs through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) rather than completing a DO residency. As of 2014, 54% of DOs in post-doctoral training are enrolled in an ACGME-accredited residency program and 46% are enrolled in an AOA-accredited residency program.\n\nSince 1985, a single residency training program can be dual-accredited by both the ACGME and the AOA. \nThe number of dually accredited programs increased from 11% of all AOA approved residencies in 2006 to 14% in 2008, and then to 22% in 2010. In 2001, the AOA adopted a provision making it possible for a DO resident in any MD program to apply for osteopathic approval of their training. The topic of dual-accreditation is controversial. Opponents claim that by merging DO students into the \"MD world,\" the unique quality of osteopathic philosophy will be lost. Supporters claim the programs are popular because of the higher prestige and higher resident reimbursement salaries associated with MD programs.\n\nOver 5 years starting in July 2015, the AOA, AACOM, and the ACGME will create a single, unified accreditation system for graduate medical education programs in the United States. This will ensure that all physicians trained in the U.S. will have the same graduate medical education accreditation, and as of June 30, 2020, the AOA will cease its accreditation functions.\n\nThere are notable differences in the specialty choices of DOs and MDs. 60% of DOs work in primary care specialties, compared to 35% of MDs.\n\nTo maintain a professional license to practice medicine, U.S. physicians are required to complete ongoing additional training, known as continuing medical education (CME). CME requirements differ from state to state and between the American Osteopathic Medical Association (DO) and the American Medical Association (MD) governing bodies.\n\nAn MD is accepted worldwide, while the DO degree is accepted in 44 countries abroad. Accredited DO and MD medical schools are both included in the World Health Organization’s World Directory of Medical Schools.

{"id": "86378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86378", "title": "Cú Chulainn", "text": "Cú Chulainn\n\nCú Chulainn, also spelled Cú Chulaind or Cúchulainn (; Irish for \"Culann's Hound\") and sometimes known in English as Cuhullin , is an Irish mythological hero who appears in the stories of the Ulster Cycle, as well as in Scottish and Manx folklore. He is believed to be an incarnation of the god Lugh, who is also his father. His mother is the mortal Deichtine, sister of Conchobar mac Nessa.\n\nBorn Sétanta, he gained his better-known name as a child, after killing Culann's fierce guard-dog in self-defence and offered to take its place until a replacement could be reared. At the age of seventeen he defended Ulster single-handedly against the armies of queen Medb of Connacht in the famous \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\" (\"Cattle Raid of Cooley\"). It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but his life would be a short one. He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy, or \"ríastrad\" (translated by Thomas Kinsella as \"warp spasm\" and by Ciarán Carson as \"torque\"), in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer Láeg and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend. In more modern times, Cú Chulainn is often referred to as the \"Hound of Ulster\".\n\nCú Chulainn shows striking similarities to the legendary Persian hero Rostam, as well as to the Germanic Lay of Hildebrand and the labours of the Greek epic hero Heracles, suggesting a common Indo-European origin, but lacking in linguistic, anthropological and archaeological material.\n\nThere are a number of versions of the story of Cú Chulainn's miraculous birth. In the earliest version of \"Compert C(h)on Culainn\" (\"The Conception of Cú Chulainn\"), his mother Deichtine is the daughter and charioteer of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and accompanies him as he and the nobles of Ulster hunt a flock of magical birds. As snow begins to fall, Ulstermen seek shelter in a nearby house. As the host's wife goes into labour, Deichtine assists in the birth of a baby boy, while a mare gives birth to twin colts. The next morning, the Ulstermen find themselves at the \"Brug na Bóinde\" (the Neolithic mound at Newgrange)—the house and its occupants have disappeared, but the child and the colts remain. Deichtine takes the boy home and begins raising him as her own, but the boy falls ill and dies. The god Lug appears to her and tells her he was their host that night, and that he has put his child in her womb, who is to be called Sétanta. Her pregnancy turns into a scandal as she is betrothed to Sualtam mac Róich, and the Ulstermen suspect Conchobar of being the father, so she aborts the child and goes to her husband's bed \"virgin-whole\". She then conceives a son whom she names Sétanta.\n\nIn the later and better-known version of \"Compert Con Culainn\", Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. As in the previous version, the Ulstermen go hunting a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.\n\nThe nobles of Ulster argue over which of them is to be his foster-father, until the wise Morann decides he should be fostered by several of them: Conchobar himself; Sencha mac Ailella, who will teach him judgement and eloquent speech; the wealthy Blaí Briugu, who will protect and provide for him; the noble warrior Fergus mac Róich, who will care for him and teach him to protect the weak; the poet Amergin, who will educate him, and his wife Findchóem, who will nurse him. He is brought up in the house of Amergin and Findchóem on Muirthemne Plain in modern County Louth (at the time part of Ulster), alongside their son Conall Cernach.\n\nThe County Louth town of Dundalk has the motto \"Mé do rug Cú Chulainn cróga\" \"I gave birth to brave Cú Chulainn\".\n\nThe stories of Cú Chulainn's childhood are told in a flashback sequence in \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\". As a small child, living in his parents' house on Muirthemne Plain, he begs to be allowed to join the boy-troop at Emain Macha. However, he sets off on his own, and when he arrives at Emain he runs onto the playing field without first asking for the boys' protection, being unaware of the custom. The boys take this as a challenge and attack him, but he has a \"ríastrad\" and beats them single-handed. Conchobar puts a stop to the fight and clears up the misunderstanding, but no sooner has Sétanta put himself under the boys' protection than he chases after them, demanding they put themselves under his protection.\n\nCulann the smith invites Conchobar to a feast at his house. Before going, Conchobar goes to the playing field to watch the boys play hurling. He is so impressed by Sétanta's performance that he asks him to join him at the feast. Sétanta has a game to finish, but promises to follow the king later. But Conchobar forgets, and Culann lets loose his ferocious hound to protect his house. When Sétanta arrives, the enormous hound attacks him, but he kills it in self-defence, in one version by smashing it against a standing stone, and in another by driving a sliotar (hurling ball) down its throat with his hurley. Culann is devastated by the loss of his hound, so Sétanta promises he will rear him a replacement, and until it is old enough to do the job, he himself will guard Culann's house. The druid Cathbad announces that his name henceforth will be \"Cú Chulainn\"—\"Culann's Hound\".\n\nOne day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad teaching his pupils. One asks him what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar and asks for arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, in response to a similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.\n\nIn Cú Chulainn's youth he is so beautiful the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach in the land of Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be too much for him and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence \"Dún Scáith\" (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.\n\nScáthach teaches Cú Chulainn all the arts of war, including the use of the Gáe Bulg, a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother as well as possible lover. During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against Aífe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts him to sleep for an hour, and he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.\n\nLeaving Aífe pregnant, Cú Chulainn returns from Scotland fully trained, but Forgall still refuses to let him marry Emer. Cú Chulainn storms Forgall's fortress, killing twenty-four of Forgall's men, abducts Emer and steals Forgall's treasure. Forgall himself falls from the ramparts to his death. Conchobar has the \"right of the first night\" over all marriages of his subjects. He is afraid of Cú Chulainn's reaction if he exercises it in this case, but is equally afraid of losing his authority if he does not. Cathbad suggests a solution: Conchobar sleeps with Emer on the night of the wedding, but Cathbad sleeps between them.\n\nEight years later, Connla, Cú Chulainn's son by Aífe, comes to Ireland in search of his father, but Cú Chulainn takes him as an intruder and kills him when he refuses to identify himself. Connla's last words to his father as he dies are that they would have \"carried the flag of Ulster to the gates of Rome and beyond\", leaving Cú Chulainn grief-stricken. The story of Cú Chulainn and Connla shows a striking similarity to the legend of Persian hero Rostam who also kills his son Sohrab. Rostam and Cú Chulainn share several other characteristics, including killing a ferocious beast at a very young age, their near invincibility in battle, and the manner of their deaths. Another similar myth is found in the Hildebrandslied, in which Hildebrand kills his son, Hadubrand.\n\nDuring his time abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She falls in love with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him in the form of a pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not realising who she is, shoots her down with his sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the \"Lia Fáil\" (stone of destiny), fails to cry out when he stands on it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women are inside, killing 150 of them.\n\nAt the age of seventeen, Cú Chulainn single-handedly defends Ulster from the army of Connacht in the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\". Medb, queen of Connacht, has mounted the invasion to steal the stud bull Donn Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when he should have been watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labour pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.\n\nBefore one combat a beautiful young woman comes to him, claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, but he refuses her. The woman reveals herself as the Morrígan, and in revenge for this slight, she attacks him in various animal forms while he is engaged in combat against Lóch mac Mofemis. As an eel, she trips him in the ford, but he breaks her ribs. As a wolf, she stampedes cattle across the ford, but he blinds her eye with a sling-stone. Finally, she appears as a heifer at the head of the stampede, but he breaks her leg with another sling stone. After Cú Chulainn finally defeats Lóch, the Morrígan appears to him as an old woman milking a cow, with the same injuries he had given her in her animal forms. She gives him three drinks of milk, and with each drink he blesses her, healing her wounds.\n\nAfter one particularly arduous combat, Cú Chulainn lies severely wounded but is visited by Lug, who tells him he is his father and heals his wounds. When Cú Chulainn wakes up and sees that the boy-troop of Emain Macha have attacked the Connacht army and been slaughtered, he has his most spectacular \"ríastrad\" yet:\n\nHe attacks the army and kills hundreds, building walls of corpses.\nWhen his foster-father Fergus mac Róich, now in exile in Medb's court, is sent to face him Cú Chulainn agrees to yield, so long as Fergus agrees to return the favour the next time they meet. Finally, he fights a gruelling three-day duel with his best friend and foster-brother, Ferdiad, at a ford that was named \"Áth Fhir Diadh\" (Ardee, County Louth) after him.\n\nThe Ulstermen eventually rouse, one by one at first, and finally \"en masse\". The final battle begins. Cú Chulainn stays on the sidelines, recuperating from his wounds, until he sees Fergus advancing. He enters the fray and confronts Fergus, who keeps his side of the bargain and yields to him, pulling his forces off the field. Connacht's other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. At this inopportune moment she gets her period, and although Fergus forms a guard around her, Cú Chulainn breaks through as she is dealing with it and has her at his mercy. However, he spares her because he does not think it right to kill women, and guards her retreat back to Connacht as far as Athlone.\n\nThe troublemaker Bricriu once incites three heroes, Cú Chulainn, Conall Cernach and Lóegaire Búadach, to compete for the champion's portion at his feast. In every test that is set Cú Chulainn comes out on top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire will accept the result. Cú Roí mac Dáire of Munster settles it by visiting each in the guise of a hideous churl and challenging them to behead him, then allow him to return and behead them in return. Conall and Lóegaire both behead Cú Roí, who picks up his head and leaves, but when the time comes for him to return they flee. Only Cú Chulainn is brave and honourable enough to submit himself to Cú Roí's axe; Cú Roí spares him and he is declared champion. This beheading challenge appears in later literature, most notably in the Middle English poem \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". Other examples include the 13th century French \"Life of Caradoc\" and the English romances \"The Turke and Gowin\", and \"Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle\".\n\nCú Roí, again in disguise, joins the Ulstermen on a raid on Inis Fer Falga (probably the Isle of Man), in return for his choice of the spoils. They steal treasure, and abduct Blathnát, daughter of the island's king, who loves Cú Chulainn. But when Cú Roí is asked to choose his share, he chooses Blathnát. Cú Chulainn tries to stop him taking her, but Cú Roí cuts his hair and drives him into the ground up to his armpits before escaping, taking Blathnát with him. Like other heroes such as the Biblical Samson, Duryodhana in the Mahabharata and the Welsh Llew Llaw Gyffes, Cú Roí can only be killed in certain contrived circumstances, which vary in different versions of the story. Blathnat discovers how to kill him and betrays him to Cú Chulainn, who does the deed. However, Ferchertne, Cú Roí's poet, enraged at the betrayal of his lord, grabs Blathnát and leaps off a cliff, killing her and himself.\n\nCú Chulainn has many lovers, but Emer's only jealousy comes when he falls in love with Fand, wife of Manannán mac Lir. Manannán has left her and she has been attacked by three Fomorians who want to control the Irish Sea. Cú Chulainn agrees to help defend her as long as she marries him. She agrees reluctantly, but they fall in love when they meet. Manannán knows their relationship is doomed because Cú Chulainn is mortal and Fand is a fairy; Cú Chulainn's presence would destroy the fairies. Emer, meanwhile, tries to kill her rival, but when she sees the strength of Fand's love for Cú Chulainn she decides to give him up to her. Fand, touched by Emer's magnanimity, decides to return to her own husband. Manannan shakes his cloak between Cú Chulainn and Fand, ensuring the two will never meet again, and Cú Chulainn and Emer drink a potion to wipe the whole affair from their memories.\n\n(Irish: \"Aided Con Culainn\", also known as \"Brislech Mór Maige Muirthemne\"). Medb conspires with Lugaid, son of Cú Roí, Erc, son of Cairbre Nia Fer, and the sons of others Cú Chulainn had killed, to draw him out to his death. His fate is sealed by his breaking of the \"geasa\" (taboos) upon him. Cú Chulainn's \"geasa\" included a ban against eating dog meat, but in early Ireland there was a powerful general taboo against refusing hospitality, so when an old crone offers him a meal of dog meat, he has no choice but to break his \"geis\". In this way he is spiritually weakened for the fight ahead of him.\nLugaid has three magical spears made, and it is prophesied that a king will fall by each of them. With the first he kills Cú Chulainn's charioteer Láeg, king of chariot drivers. With the second he kills Cú Chulainn's horse, Liath Macha, king of horses. With the third he hits Cú Chulainn, mortally wounding him. Cú Chulainn ties himself to a standing stone to die on his feet, facing his enemies. This stone is traditionally identified as Clochafarmore, located near Dundalk. Due to his ferocity even when so near death, it is only when a raven lands on his shoulder that his enemies believe he is dead. Lugaid approaches and cuts off his head, but as he does so the \"hero-light\" burns around Cú Chulainn and his sword falls from his hand and cuts Lugaid's hand off. The light disappears only after his right hand, his sword arm, is cut from his body.\n\nConall Cernach had sworn that if Cú Chulainn died before him he would avenge him before sunset, and when he hears Cú Chulainn is dead he pursues Lugaid. As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand tucked into his belt, but he only beats him after his horse takes a bite out of Lugaid's side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.\n\nCú Chulainn's appearance is occasionally remarked on in the texts. He is usually described as small, youthful and beardless. He is often described as dark: in \"The Wooing of Emer\" and \"Bricriu's Feast\" he is \"a dark, sad man, comeliest of the men of Erin\", in \"The Intoxication of the Ulstermen\" he is a \"little, black-browed man\", and in \"The Phantom Chariot of Cú Chulainn\" \"[h]is hair was thick and black, and smooth as though a cow had licked it... in his head his eyes gleamed swift and grey\"; yet the prophetess Fedelm in the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\" describes him as blond. The most elaborate description of his appearance comes later in the \"Táin\":\n\nThe \"Siabur-Charpat Con Culaind\" (or \"Demonic Chariot of Cu Chulaind\") tells the story of when Saint Patrick was trying to convert King Lóegaire to Christianity.\n\nIn the tale St. Patrick visited King Loegaire, attempting to convert him to the Christian faith. The king agreed but on a condition - that the saint call up Cu Chulainn from the dead, bringing him to the king's presence. St. Patrick agreed, and then the hero appeared, complete with chariot, and his two horse \"Liath Macha\" and \"Dub-Sainglend\", together with his charioteer \"Loeg\". The saint asks if the king is convinced - he replies that the appearance was so short he was not yet sure. The saint responds that God is so powerful that the king would see the hero again.\n\nThe ghostly hero returns, and this time salutes and addresses the saint, he then turns to the king, confirms it is Cu Chulainn he sees and not some demon, and implores him to believe in the saint and his god. A dialogue between king and ghostly hero takes place, in which the old hero recounts his life, including a poetic telling of his heroic deeds, ending with a request to Patrick to allow him too into heaven - the king is convinced. At the end of this the saint declares that Cu Chulainn is welcome in heaven.\n\nThe date of the tale is not certain.\n\nCú Chulainn was later reimagined as an evil giant at odds with Fionn mac Cumhaill (or Finn McCool). \n\nUnrecorded before the 19th century, the earliest known version was \"A Legend of Knockmany\" in the 1845 \"Tales and Sketches .. of the Irish Peasantry\" by William Carleton. Variants were published in Patrick Kennedy's \"Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts\" (1866), and republished and brought to a larger audience by W.B. Yeats in \"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry\" (1888), followed by numerous adaptions and variant, many uncredited. The work was included in later collections of 'folk tales' by other editors such as Joseph Jacobs in his \"Celtic Fairy Tales\" (1891).\n\nIn this tale, Cú Chullain's power was contained in his middle finger. Wishing to defeat Finn, he came to Finn's house, but Finn disguised himself as a baby while his wife Oona baked cakes, some with griddle irons inside, some without. When Cú Chulainn could not bite through his cake (which had an iron in it) but the baby could (Finn's cake had no iron), in amazement Cú Chulainn felt to see how sharp the baby's teeth were, allowing Finn to bite his middle finger off and deprive Cú Chulainn of both his strength and size.\n\nThe image of Cú Chulainn is invoked by both Irish nationalists and Ulster unionists. The Gaelic revival fed into the Irish revolutionary period, with elements of Irish mythology adopted in nationalist symbolism. In St. Enda's School, run by Patrick Pearse, there was a stained-glass panel of Cú Chulainn. A bronze sculpture of the dead Cú Chulainn by Oliver Sheppard stands in the Dublin General Post Office (GPO) in commemoration of the Easter Rising of 1916. The statue's image is reproduced on the obverse of 1916 Medal awarded to republican veterans of the rising, the Military Star of the Irish Defence Forces, and the commemorative ten shilling coin issued in 1966 for the rising's 50th anniversary.\n\nBy contrast, unionists see him as an Ulsterman defending the province from enemies to the south: in Belfast, for example, he is depicted in a mural on Highfield Drive, and was formerly depicted in a mural on the Newtownards Road, as a \"defender of Ulster from Irish attacks\", both murals ironically based on the Sheppard sculpture. He is also depicted in murals in nationalist parts of the city and many nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. An example is the mural erected in 1996 on Lenadoon Avenue, West Belfast commemorating dead Provisional IRA men in the area which has a picture of Cú Chulainn in the centre.\n\nA statue of Cú Chulainn carrying the body of Fer Diad stands in Ardee, County Louth, traditionally the site of their combat in the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\". A sculpture by Martin Heron, entitled \"For the Love of Emer\", depicting Cú Chulainn balancing on a tilting 20-foot pole, representing the feat of balancing on the butt of a spear he learned from Scáthach, was installed in Armagh in 2010.\n\nAugusta, Lady Gregory retold many of the legends of Cú Chulainn in her 1902 book \"Cuchulain of Muirthemne\", which paraphrased the originals but also romanticized some of the tales and omitted most of the more violent content. This first translation was very popular, supported by the Celtic Revival movement. It featured an introduction by her friend William Butler Yeats, who wrote several pieces based on the legend, including the plays \"On Baile's Strand\" (1904), \"The Green Helmet\" (1910), \"At the Hawk's Well\" (1917), \"The Only Jealousy of Emer\" (1919) and \"The Death of Cuchulain\" (1939), and a poem, \"Cuchulain's Fight with the Sea\" (1892).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

When he was one year old his parents entrusted him to the care of a Christian family. His parents perished in the Holocaust, and following the war he grew up with his uncle and aunt as one of their children. He studied at a “gymnasium”, where he learned classical and modern European languages, and at the same time learned Hebrew at Talmud Torah. From age 14, he was active in the Zionistic youth movement “Ichud Habonim” and served as one of its leaders. At age 18, the movement sent him to Israel for training as a leader and in 1960 he became the general secretary of that movement in the Netherlands. In 1961, he immigrated to Israel. He studied at the Hebrew University (B.A. Bible; M.A. Bible and Greek literature), while serving also as an assistant in the Bible Dept. and at the Hebrew University Bible Project. In 1967-1969, he continued his studies at the Dept. for Near Eastern Studies and Languages at Harvard University. His dissertation, written under the guidance of Professors Shemaryahu Talmon of the Hebrew University and Frank Moore Cross of Harvard University, was submitted to the Hebrew University in 1973 as “The Septuagint Translation of Jeremiah and Baruch.” Upon his return to Israel, he served as an “assistant” at the University of Haifa and at the Hebrew University.\n\nIn 1986, he was appointed Professor at the Hebrew University and in 1990 he became the J. L. Magnes Professor of Bible Studies. Served as visiting Professor at the Universities of Oxford, Uppsala, Doshisha (Kyoto), Macquarie and Sydney (Australia), Stellenbosch (South Africa), Vrije Universiteit (Amsterdam), University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), the Pontifical Gregorian University (Rome), and Halle (Germany). He stayed at Institutes for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, NIAS (the Netherlands), Annenberg (Philadelphia), Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies and the Lichtenberg Kolleg (Göttingen, Germany).\n\nHe was one of the editors of the Hebrew University Bible Project. He is a member of the editorial board of the journals \"Dead Sea Discoveries\" and the \"Journal of Jewish Studies\", and served on the Academic committee of the Magnes Press. He is the co-founder and chairman (1991–2000) of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, a Member of the Academic Committee of the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and Senior Associate Fellow of the and an Honorary Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies.\nFrom 1990-2009 he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the international Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project, which during those years produced 33 volumes of the series \"Discoveries in the Judean Desert\" as well as two concordances\n\nHe also published an electronic edition of all the extra-biblical Qumran scrolls and a six-volume printed edition of the scrolls meant for the general public. \neditions of the Hebrew and Greek Bible.\n\nEmanuel Tov is married to Lika (née Aa). They have three children and four granddaughters.\n\n\nEmanuel Tov's studies on the Septuagint focused first on inner-translational developments and gradually moved to the importance of this translation for the study of the Bible: the early revisions of the Septuagint, translation technique, the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Greek translation, the value of the Septuagint for the textual study of the Hebrew Bible, the importance of certain Septuagint books for the exegesis of the Hebrew books and the understanding of their literary development, the place of the Hebrew source of the Septuagint in the development of the text of the Bible.\nTov's initial publications on the Septuagint deal with that translation's early revisions that were intended to approximate the Greek text to the Hebrew text current in Israel from the 1st century BCE until the 2nd century CE. For that research, he established sound principles by determining the criteria for defining and characterizing the revisions. His preoccupation with matters of translation technique and the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint was influenced by his practical work in the HUBP (Hebrew University Bible Project). In that research, he combined the field work in that project with the formulation of abstract rules for the evaluation of details in the Septuagint, constantly cross-fertilizing both areas. These rules were formulated in his theoretical book on the Septuagint that grew out of his courses at the Hebrew University, each year on a different Bible book\nSubsequently, the focus of Tov's interest moved to the importance of the Septuagint for biblical scholarship, both for textual and literary criticism. In several books, the Septuagint reflects a Hebrew basis that needs to be taken into consideration in the exegesis of those books beyond small details, both when, according to Tov, the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint preceded the Masoretic Text (Joshua, 1 Samuel 16–18, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.) and when it serves as an exegetical layer reacting to the forerunner of the Masoretic Text (1 Kings, Esther, and Daniel). According to Tov, in all these books the exegete of the Hebrew books must take the Greek translation into consideration. A precondition for this procedure is that the analysis of the translation technique as described in the previous paragraph will have established that the Septuagint is a good source for analyzing the text that lay in front of him. From among all the early witnesses of the biblical text, the best ones for analyzing the stages of its literary development are the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, a few Qumran texts and the Samaritan Pentateuch. Tov believes that the analysis of early witnesses such as the Septuagint enriches our exegesis and helps us in understanding the last stages of the development of the biblical literature in specific books.\n\nEmanuel Tov does not describe the development of the biblical text based on abstract theories, but tries to take the evidence of the ancient manuscripts and versions as his point of departure. It is clear that in antiquity many versions of the Bible were circulating, as is evident from the textual plurality at Qumran. All the manuscripts differed from one another, but within that plurality one may recognize some groups (families). Tov qualified this plurality by providing the internal statistics of the different types of the Qumran scrolls. He also described the socio-religious background of some groups of the Judean Desert scrolls.\n\nAn important link in this argumentation is the group of the so-called 4QReworked Pentateuch texts. Ten years after Tov published this group of documents\n, he realized that these texts do not reflect a single non-biblical rewritten Pentateuch composition, but a cluster of biblical texts that included many exegetical elements. These texts reflect a link in the series of developing biblical texts. \nTov's studies on the Septuagint and 4QReworked Pentateuch led him to new thoughts regarding the development of the last stages of the biblical books and the original text of these books. In his view, the early stages of the biblical books such as reflected in the Septuagint of 1 Samuel, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, show that the formulations of these books developed stage by stage. This reconstructed development makes it difficult to posit an original text of the biblical books. In Tov's view, there was not one original text, but a series of “original texts.” This view developed after the appearance of the second edition of his Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible (2001) and was emphasized more in\nthe third edition (2012).\nIn studies primarily carried out in the 2010s, Tov focused on the\nspecial textual status of the Torah.\n\nIn his view, the textual development of the Torah differed from that\nof all other Scripture books, probably because of its popularity.\nThe Masoretic Text reflects the presumed original text better than\nall other preserved texts, all of which reflect more secondary\nelements than MT, especially the one-time joined tradition of the\nSamaritan Pentateuch and the LXX. Further, the number of the \nnon-Masoretic textual branches in the Torah is much larger than in\nall other Scripture books.\n\nEmanuel Tov dealt with various aspects of the Qumran scrolls, but his most central publications pertain to the Qumran scribes. In 2004, he published a detailed monograph on the scribal practices reflected in the Qumran scrolls, suggesting that the information about these scribal practices allows us to obtain a better understanding of the Qumran scrolls. \n\nThis monograph describes the technical aspects of all the Judean Desert texts, such as the measurements of the columns and sheets, the beginnings and ends of scrolls, systems of correcting mistakes, orthography systems, and a classification of the scrolls according to these parameters.\n\nAn important part of this description is Tov's theory on the Qumran scribes. Since 1986, Tov has suggested the division of the Qumran scrolls into two groups distinguished by external features. Group 1 is written in a special spelling (forms like ki’), specials linguistic forms (like malkehemah, me’odah), and special scribal habits (writing the divine name in the old Hebrew script, erasing elements with lines and writing cancellation dots above and below words and letters, writing dots in the margins guiding the drawing of the lines, etc.). The great majority of the Qumran sectarian scrolls belong to this group; hence Tov's suggestion that these scrolls were written by sectarian scribes, possibly at Qumran. These scribes copied biblical as well as extra-biblical scrolls, altogether one-third of the Qumran scrolls, while the other scrolls (group 2) were brought to Qumran from outside, from one or more localities.\n\nEmanuel Tov believes that the examination of the Bible and Dead Sea Scrolls needs to be aided by computer-assisted research and that therefore databases and computer programs need to be developed. He supervised the electronic encoding of the Leningrad Codex in the 1980s.\n\nAt that time, he also embarked upon a research project together with Prof. Robert A. Kraft of the University of Pennsylvania (CATSS = Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies). That project, based in Philadelphia and Jerusalem, created a comparative database of all the words in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. It was published as a module within the Accordance program (subsequently also within Bible Works and Logos). With the aid of that program, which allows for advanced searches and statistical research, several such investigations have been carried out by Tov and others.\n\nAnother database edited by Tov contains all the texts and images of the para-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls, in the original languages and in translation, with morphological analysis and search programs. All these programs serve the international community. \n\n\n1.

Goodman and Alfred Gilman. First published in 1941, the book is in its twelfth edition (as of 2011), and has the reputation of being the \"bible of pharmacology\". The readership of this book include physicians of all therapeutic and surgical specialties, clinical pharmacologists, clinical research professionals and pharmacists.\n\nWhile teaching jointly in the Yale School of Medicine's Department of Pharmacology, Goodman and Gilman began developing a course textbook that emphasized relationships between pharmacodynamics and pharmacotherapy, introduced recent pharmacological advances like sulfa drugs, and discussed the history of drug development. Yale physiologist John Farquhar Fulton encouraged them to publish the work for a broader audience and introduced them to a publisher at the Macmillan Publishing Company. Their new text was first published in 1941 under the title \"The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics: A Textbook of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics for Physicians and Medical Student\". Because the volume was twice as long as a typical textbook, Macmillan printed few copies, but demand for a readable, up-to-date pharmacological text proved high, and several printings followed.\n\nAlthough rapid pharmacological innovations were made in the years immediately following—including the introduction of chemotherapy, steroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines—a second edition could not be completed until 1955 because of the authors' service in World War II. Thereafter, the text was revised every five years in collaboration with a large number of specialist coauthors. \n\nGilman and Goodman remained the book's lead editors for the first five editions; Gilman remained an editor through the sixth edition, and Goodman through the seventh, which was published shortly after Gilman's death in 1984. Alfred Goodman Gilman, the son of Alfred Gilman and winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology, joined as senior editor for the book's sixth, seventh, and eighth editions, and a contributing editor to the ninth and tenth. Goodman died in 2000, and Goodman Gilman in December 2015.\n\n\n"}

The Humboldt Forum will incorporate two of the art chamber's successor institutions, the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art (originally the Indian Department of the former). The project, named after the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, aims to be a world centre for culture. The Humboldt Forum has been described as the \"German equivalent\" of the British Museum. Neil MacGregor, formerly the Director of the British Museum, was appointed as the founding Director of the Humboldt Forum in 2015.\n\nThe Humboldt Forum will incorporate two existing museums, the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art. Both have their roots in the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber. The Ancient Prussian Art Chamber was originally established by Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg in the mid 16th century, but was nearly destroyed during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). The art chamber was rebuilt as a magnificent collection by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, and was moved to the newly extended Berlin Palace by Frederick I of Prussia in the early 18th century. The Ethnological Museum opened in 1886 as a successor of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber; the Museum of Asian Art originated as the Indian Department of the Ethnological Museum in 1904. Wilhelm von Bode, the Director-General of the Royal Museums in Berlin, established the Museum of East Asian Art as a separate collection in 1906. In 2006 the Museum of Indian Art and the Museum of East Asian Art were merged to form the Museum of Asian Art.

{"id": "42947963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42947963", "title": "Ordinary of arms", "text": "Ordinary of arms\n\nAn ordinary of arms (or simply an ordinary) is a roll or register of coats of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical ordinaries and charges) grouped together. The purpose of an ordinary is to facilitate the identification of the bearer of a coat of arms from visual evidence alone. \n\nOrdinaries may take a form which is either graphic (consisting of a series of painted or drawn images of shields) or written (consisting of blazons – verbal descriptions – of the coats). Most medieval and early modern manuscript ordinaries were graphic, whereas all the principal modern published ordinaries have been written. A knowledge of the technicalities of blazon is essential for the student hoping to make best use of a written ordinary.\n\nBy extension, ordinaries may also be compiled of other elements of heraldic display, such as crests, supporters or badges.\n\nAlthough ordinaries of arms have been compiled since the 14th century, the actual term seems to have come into use only in the 18th century. The earliest clear attestation is found in Edmondson's \"Complete Body of Heraldry\" of 1780.\n\nThe ordinary appears to have been an English development of the 14th century. No medieval ordinaries are known from continental Europe.\n\nMedieval English ordinaries include \"Cooke's Ordinary\", compiled in c.1340 (644 coats), \"Cotgrave's Ordinary\", also of c.1340 but in blazon (556 coats), and the larger \"Thomas Jenyns' Book\", compiled in c.1398 (1,595 coats). These three are all related, and perhaps derive from a lost progenitor. An independent work is \"William Jenyns' Ordinary\", compiled in c.1360 (1,612 coats). \n\nIn the early 16th century, Thomas Wriothesley, Garter King of Arms, planned a comprehensive painted roll and ordinary of all English arms: this was not completed, but parts of the ordinary survive in what is now known as \"Prince Arthur's Book\" of c.1520. In the second half of the century, Robert Glover, Somerset Herald, drew on a wide range of medieval sources to compile \"Glover's Ordinary\", the fullest and most authoritative ordinary to date. This was assembled in its first form in 1584, and contained some 15,000 coats. At the beginning of the 17th century, Augustine Vincent, Rouge Croix Pursuivant and later Windsor Herald, compiled \"Vincent's Ordinary\", also of about 15,000 shields, drawn in trick.\n\nVersions of Glover's Ordinary, much augmented, were published in Joseph Edmondson's \"Complete Body of Heraldry\" (1780) and in William Berry's \"Encyclopedia Heraldica\" (1828). Cotgrave's Ordinary was published in 1829, edited by Sir Harris Nicolas.\n\nThe principal modern ordinary of British and Irish heraldry, still not entirely superseded, is \"Papworth's \"Ordinary\"\" (1874), or in full \"An Alphabetical Dictionary of Coats of Arms belonging to Families in Great Britain and Ireland, forming an extensive Ordinary of British Armorials upon an entirely new plan\", compiled by John Woody Papworth. Papworth began work in 1847, making extensive use of Burke's \"General Armory\" (first published 1842; third edition with supplement 1847), copying its entries – which were arranged alphabetically by surname – onto slips of paper and rearranging them. He published a prospectus in 1857, and began to issue his work in instalments shortly afterwards: nine parts had appeared by 1863, and fourteen by the time of his early death (apparently hastened by his insistent commitment to work on the project) in 1870. By this point the work had proceeded as far as page 696: the remaining 429 pages were edited and brought to completion from Papworth's materials by Alfred William Morant (1828–1881). The \"Ordinary\", containing about 50,000 entries, was published as a complete volume in 1874. It rapidly established itself as a standard work of reference, and was reprinted in 1961, 1977 and 1985.\n\nThe great strength of Papworth's \"Ordinary\" was the rigorousness of its system of classification by blazon, which (with minor modifications) has remained the basis for all ordinaries published since: there was only one possible place for any particular coat of arms to be entered within it. Its weakness was its dependence for its contents on Burke's \"General Armory\" and other secondary sources, which meant that it inherited many of their errors and omissions. One of the oddities of the book (and therefore of some of its successors), which resulted in part from Papworth's decision to classify animal charges of all kinds under the primary heading \"Beast\", and birds of all kinds under \"Bird\", is that the alphabetical distribution of entries is highly unbalanced: the headings A–F account for roughly 80% of the whole, a point on which the editor had to reassure subscribers while the work was still in progress.\n\nIn 1926 Lt Col George Babington Croft Lyons left a substantial bequest to the Society of Antiquaries to prepare a revised and improved edition of Papworth. Anthony Wagner became co-general editor in 1940 and sole general editor in 1944, remaining in that position until 1995. A number of volunteers were recruited (some of them, during the war years, working in inactive periods of firewatching duties) to assemble material on index cards. However, the task was a large one and progress slow, in part because of Wagner's insistence on high scholarly standards and use of primary sources, and in part because of over-ambitious plans to include in the final work a series of essays on medieval armorial families. It was eventually decided to limit the project to England, to the medieval period (pre-1530), and to publish a simple ordinary, including a name-index but without the additional essays. With the aid of computer technology, the first volume of what was now entitled the \"Dictionary of British Arms\" appeared in 1992. Volume 2 was published in 1996, volume 3 in 2009, and volume 4 (the final volume) in 2014.\n\n\"An Ordinary of Arms\" for Scotland, edited by Sir James Balfour Paul, Lord Lyon King of Arms, was published in 1893, with a second updated edition appearing in 1903: this includes all arms recorded in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland from its inception in 1672 down to the end of 1901 (5,532 entries, with a name index). A second volume, covering arms entered in the Register from 1902 to 1973 (a further 6,040 entries), was published in 1977: this was edited by David Reid of Robertland, Carrick Pursuivant, and Vivien Wilson.\n\n\"An Ordinary of Scottish Arms from Original pre-1672 Manuscripts\", edited by Eilean Malden, John Malden (sometime Unicorn Pursuivant) and William G. Scott, was published in 2016. This contains both an armory (arranged alphabetically by surname) and an ordinary of some 25,000 coats of arms, drawing on the evidence of medieval rolls of arms and other pre-1672 manuscript sources, but excluding that of seals.\n\n\"An Ordinary of Welsh Arms\", covering Welsh arms, crests, badges and supporters down to c.1630 (about 2,800 entries and a name index) forms the greater part of volume 3 of \"The Development of Welsh Heraldry\" by Michael Powell Siddons, published in 1993. A supplementary ordinary down to c.1700 (a further 1,200 entries) is included in volume 4, published in 2006.\n\n\"A Dictionary of Suffolk Arms\" edited by Joan Corder (an ordinary of arms, containing about 6,700 entries and a name-index) was published by the Suffolk Records Society in 1965. A companion volume by the same editor, \"A Dictionary of Suffolk Crests\" (containing some 25,000 entries for crests, arranged in \"ordinary\" form, together with a name-index), was published by the same society in 1998.\n\nAn important modern unpublished ordinary is the collection known as \"Garter's Ordinaries\", now held at the College of Arms. This was originally compiled by and under the direction of Sir Albert Woods, Garter King of Arms, between 1842 and his death in 1904, and was then donated to the College by his grandson, Gerald Woods Wollaston. At that time it comprised two series, one of five and the other of six volumes, plus indexes. Subsequent Garters have added to the series and kept the ordinary up to date by including within it new grants of arms. The ordinary remains in use by the members of the College, both for identifying old coats of arms, and for ensuring that new grants are sufficiently differenced from existing coats.\n\n"}

Sergei's collection was smaller than his brother's, but also very valuable. The first work to be added to his collection was Alexey Bogolyubov's \"Ipatievsky Monastery near Kostroma\". He later began collecting primarily works from Western European artists, especially French romantics and realists.\n\nOn Sergei's death in 1892, both brothers' collections were donated to the Moscow city administrators. The brothers' combined collections consisted of 1,287 paintings, 518 drawings and 9 sculptures by Russian artists, along with 75 paintings and eight drawings by European artists, mainly French and German masters of the late 19th century. The value of the donated collections was estimated at 1,429,000 roubles. The city converted the brothers' private showroom into a gallery accessible to the public, free of charge. The official opening of the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov, as it was then named, took place on 15 August 1893, with over 700 visitors on the first day.\n\nHe was also the chief of the Moscow municipal administration, from 1876 to 1882.\n"}

Built in 1835, the building was originally known as the Weed House, but was renamed Variety Unit to reflect the wide range of decorative arts exhibited there.\n\nThe original brick structure, with its front-gable orientation and fully articulated pediment, reflects the style of Greek Revival architecture popular in the mid-19th century. However, the complex rambling interior composed of a series of one and two-room additions, constructed over time as the occupants required more space, embodies the New England tradition of \"continuous architecture.\"\n\nShelburne Museum's glass collection numbers nearly two thousand pieces dating from 1750 to 1900 and includes free-blown flasks, window glass, and mold-blown bottles and flasks; pattern glass plates, serving dishes and decorative piecesl colorful canes, rolling pins, marbles, \"witch balls\" and other whimseys; and miniature glass doll dishes. The Garrison collection of American pattern glass goblets includes eleven hundred patterns. In addition the collection includes a wide range of patent medicine and apothecary bottles.\n\nThe finest ceramics in the Museum's collection include over 200 pieces of 19th-century English mochaware, several of which are recent acquisitions. While the strength of the Shelburne Museum's collection is in utilitarian and fine tablewares, the figural ceramics are also of interest. Staffordshire animal figures, whimsical toby jugs, and a magnificent pair of Chelsea swans can also be seen in the Variety Unit.\n\nShelburne Museum's European and American dolls include bisque, papier-mâché, Parian, china, wax, wood and cloth pieces, most of them made between 1760 and 1930. About 400 dolls are on exhibition in Variety Unit in galleries re-designed in 2004 with new lighting and exhibition labels.\n\nExhibited with the dolls are 19th and 20th-century dollhouses; they include an English Gothic Revival house and the idiosyncratic \"Ramshackle Inn\", a rambling American house with an artist's studio in the attic.\n\nMany American dolls of the 18th and 19th centuries were made at home of readily available materials, including wood, rags, clay, dried apples, corn husks, bottles and clay pipes. Until World War I, the majority of dolls sold in America were imported from England, France, and Germany. Joel Ellis of Springfield, Vermont made some of the first commercial American dolls with wooden bodies, patented jointed limbs, and pewter hands and feet. Izannah Walker of Rhode Island made cloth dolls with hand-painted faces and hair. Examples by both Ellis and Walker can be seen in the Variety Unit.\n\nNot all dolls were playthings. In the late 19th century French dollmakers such as Bru, Jumeau, and Steiner, and German dollmakers such as Kestner and Simon & Halbig – all represented in Shelburne Museum's collection – created elegant bisque-head dolls with large wide glass eyes, thick eyebrows, long lashes, cupid's bow lips, beautifully coiffed real hair and elaborate dresses of silk and other fine fabrics.\n\nSouvenir and keepsake dolls were popular products in many areas frequented by tourists. Dolls created entirely of different sizes and shapes of shells, for example, come from a number of French and English resort towns; a number of these fragile dolls may be seen in the Hat and Fragrance. English peddler dolls, which depict street vendors and their diverse wares, and American Indian dolls, complete with bead-decorated costumes are also represented in Shelburne's vast collection.\n\nShelburne Museum's pewter collection offers an overview of French, German, Dutch, English, and American styles. Settlers brought pieces of pewter with them from abroad and many American merchants sold foreign pewter in their shops. It cost less than other metals, and in Europe its styles frequently copied popular silver designs. American artisans often relied on imported English and German pewter for stylistic inspiration. In fact, long after pewter had fallen out of fashion in Europe it was still being widely produced in America.\n\nThe American whaling industry dominated the world market in the nineteenth century. It peaked in 1850 when seven hundred American ships with over twenty thousand men sailed from the South Pacific to the Arctic in search of whales. Voyages could last up to five years because ships only returned when their holds were filled with barrels of whale oil. To pass the time, some sailors used the leftover whalebone to make homecoming gifts for their friends and loved ones. With saws and files they would first shape the whalebone. Then with needles or knives they would sketch designs into the surface. When the design was complete the sailors would ink them with lampblack or squid ink.\n\nWhile the best-known form of scrimshaw is the whale tooth decorated with engraved scenes, scrimshanders also fashioned shipboard tools, kitchen implements, domestic and needlework tools, and fashion accessories from whalebone and ivory. Tortoise shell, seashells, animal horn, pewter, silver, and exotic tropical woods gathered during the whaling journeys sometimes provided decorative accents.\n\nShelburne Museum's scrimshaw collection offers a broad range of forms. A variety of teeth are decorated with whaling scenes, portraits, and patriotic motifs. A \"Susan's tooth,\" one of a handful engraved in the 1830s by Frederick Myrick aboard the ship Susan, is among the earliest documented scrimshaw in existence.\n\nPieces intended as gifts to wives and sweethearts included corset busks (inserted in a slit at the front of a woman's corset to firm the bodice), small picks (used to pierce holes in cloth or as hair decorations), pie crimpers, knitting needles, a butter print, a sewing box, and a yarn-winding swift.\n\nAutomata are large (sometimes three feet tall), often comical wind-up toys with accompanying music that were displayed in parlors, especially in France, in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum exhibits about 30 automata, including several particularly fine pieces by Gustave Vichy of Paris, France. The collection includes a drunken chef, a magician, a monkey drummer, a magician, an opium smoker, a woman at her toilette, and a clown walking on his hands.\n\nNorth America's abundant forests supplied the raw materials that settlers used to create buildings and objects that ranged from baskets, barrels, and bowls, to carriages and boats.\n\nHousehold utensils, known as treen, comprised some of the most basic and common wooden objects. One of the most popular materials used to create treen were burls, which are dense, hard growths that form on tree trunks. The semi-circular burls typically required little shaping to form bowls and in addition to their strength, they often possessed highly patterned and attractive grains. Craftsmen would scoop out the interior of a burl by hand or, in later years with a lathe, to create a hollowed bowl.\n\nDuring the 19th century food molds became popular as a vehicle for both identification and decoration. Confectioners would use intricately carved wooden molds to form and decorate pastries and marzipan candies while bakers would pour their cake batters into carved molds such as the Museum's George Washington cake mold made by John Conger, a renowned New York carver. Dairy farmers would likewise use ornamental, circular stamps to mark their butter with their brand.\n\nThe Variety Unit is also home to the glass canes, globlets, toby jugs, and trivets.\n\n\n"}

He was the first president of the American Philological Association and editor-in-chief of \"The Century Dictionary\".\n\nWilliam Dwight Whitney was born in Northampton, Massachusetts on February 9, 1827. His father was Josiah Dwight Whitney (1786–1869) of the New England Dwight family. His mother was Sarah Williston (1800–1833).\n\nHe entered Williams College at fifteen, graduating in 1845. He continued studying and worked at a bank in Northampton for several years, then assisted his older brother Josiah Whitney on a geological survey of the Lake Superior region in 1849. On this expedition, he began the study of Sanskrit in his leisure hours. Around this time Whitney was living at Yale University in Connecticut. In 1850 he then left the United States to study philology, and especially Sanskrit, in Germany. There, he spent his winters at Berlin studying under Franz Bopp and Albrecht Weber, and his summers were devoted to research under Rudolph von Roth at Tübingen. It was during his time in Germany that Whitney began a major life project, 'preparation of an edition and translation of the Atharva-veda'.\n\nHe gained wide reputation for his scholarship in the field. In 1853, Yale University offered Whitney a position as 'Professor of Sanskrit' ‒ a position made just for him and the first of its kind in the United States. (It was not until 1861, however, that he received his doctoral degree from the University of Breslau.) He also taught modern languages at the Sheffield Scientific School, and served as secretary to the \"American Oriental Society\" from 1857 until he became its president in 1884.\n\nOn August 28, 1856 he married Elizabeth Wooster Baldwin. She was the daughter of Roger Sherman Baldwin, US Senator and Governor of the State of Connecticut.\nThey had six children:\n\nHe died at his home, on Whitney Avenue, on June 7, 1894.\n\nWhitney revised definitions for the 1864 edition of Webster's \"American Dictionary\", and in 1869 became a founder and first president of the \"American Philological Association\". He wrote metrical translations of the \"Vedas\", and numerous papers on the Vedas and linguistics, many of which were collected in the \"Oriental and Linguistic Studies\" series (1872–74). He wrote several books on language, and grammar textbooks of English, French, German, and Sanskrit.\n\nHis \"Sanskrit Grammar\" (1879) is notable in part for the criticism it contains of the Ashtadhyayi, the Sanskrit grammar attributed to Panini. Whitney describes the Ashtadhyayi as \"containing the facts of the language cast into the highly artful and difficult form of about four thousand algebraic-like rules (in the statement and arrangement of which brevity alone is had in view at the cost of distinctness and unambiguousness).\"\n\nIn his \"Course in General Linguistics\" in the chapter on the 'Immutability and Mutability of the Sign', Ferdinand de Saussure credits Whitney with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the linguistic signs.\n\nThe linguist Roman Jakobson (Jakobson 1965, 23-4) remarks that Whitney exerted a deep influence on European linguistic thought by promoting the thesis of language as a social institution. In his fundamental books of the 1860s and 70's, language was defined as a system of arbitrary and conventional signs. This doctrine was borrowed and expanded by Ferdinand de Saussure, and it entered into the posthumous edition of his 'Course', adjusted by his disciples C. Bally and Albert Sechehaye (1916). The teacher declares: \"On the essential point it seems to us that the American linguist is right: language is a convention, and the nature of the sign that is agreed upon remains indifferent.\" Jakobson writes, Arbitrariness is posited as the first of two basic principles for defining the nature of the verbal sign: \"The bond uniting the signifier with the signified is arbitrary.\" The commentary points out that no one has controverted this principle \"but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it the appropriate place.\" \n\nAlthough he suffered from a heart ailment in his later years, he was editor-in-chief of the first edition of the respected \"Century Dictionary\", which appeared from 1889 to 1891.\n\n\n\nNB: Dates marked * may not be first publication.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

It is the best-selling Chinese dictionary and the world's most popular reference work (Xinhua 2004). In 2016, Guinness World Records officially confirmed that the dictionary, published by The Commercial Press, is the “Most popular dictionary” and the “Best-selling book (regularly updated)”. It is considered a symbol of Chinese culture.\n\nThis pocket-sized dictionary of Chinese characters uses simplified Chinese characters and pinyin romanization. The most recent \"Xinhua Zidian\" edition (the 11th) contains 3,300 compounds and includes over 13,000 logograms, including traditional Chinese characters and variant Chinese characters. Bopomofo is used as a supplement alongside Pinyin. \"Xinhua Zidian\" is divided into 189 \"radicals\" or \"section headers\" (DeFrancis 1984:291).\n\nBesides their popular concise version \"Xinhua Zidian\", Commercial Press also publishes a large-print edition and a \"Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation\" (Yao 2000, reviewed by Clark 2001). In addition, the Shanxi Education Press publishes a pinyin-edition \"Xinhua Zidian\" with both characters and orthographically precise transcriptions (Yi et al. 1999).\n\nUnder the aegis of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the People's Education Press published the original \"Xinhua Zidian\" in 1953. The linguist and lexicographer Wei Jiangong (魏建功, 1901–1980) was chief editor. In 1957, Commercial Press published the \"Xinhua Zidian\" (1st edition), which was alphabetically collated in pinyin order. They have subsequently revised this dictionary ten times, with over 200 printing runs, and it is a longtime bestseller among students in China. In early 2004, the total number of published copies exceeded 400 million.\n\nWhen San Marino, a tiny country surrounded by Italy, was building a relationship with China in the 1970s, the Sammarinese gave a three-volume encyclopedia they had published, as a present to Chinese officials. However, due to the chaos caused by the Cultural Revolution in the area of publishing, China only could give a copy of the little \"Xinhua Zidian\" in return, which really embarrassed the Chinese government. As a result, the Chinese government decided to publish a series of new dictionaries in 1975, including Hanyu Da Cidian and some Chinese-foreign languages dictionaries.\n\nThe dictionary was strongly affected by the political environment under Mao. In its 1971 edition, the dictionary contained 46 Quotations of Chairman Mao, and slogans such as \"Long live Chairman Mao!\"\n\nThe Commercial Press presented its official app on Apple Store in June 2017. It supports identifying hànzì characters by handwriting, voice, or camera. It also provides a pronunciation of the characters read by Li Ruiying, the former news presenter of \"Xinwen Lianbo\".\n\nThe use of the term \"Xinhua Zidian\" has been disputed in China since the publishing of the dictionary is no longer arranged by the government. The Commercial Press insisted that the name is a specific term while other publishing houses believed that it is a generic term, as many of them published their own Chinese dictionary under the name.\nIn 2016, The Commercial Press (Beijing) filed a lawsuit at Beijing intellectual property court, claiming Sinolingua Co., Ltd. had violated The Commercial Press's trademark for Xinhua Zidian by publishing \"Xinhua Zidian\" without permission from The Commercial Press, even though the trademark name was not registered. The original case started when 3.2 million copies of student edition of Xinhua Zidian (学生新华字典) published by a company in Hubei were recalled for poor quality. \n\n\n\n"}
