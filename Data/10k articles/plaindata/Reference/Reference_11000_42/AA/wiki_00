It was a huge collection of short, largely factual pieces which today would generally be bracketed as \"trivia\" but very interesting trivia. The formula has been much repeated. It is supposed that his excessive labour in connection with this book hastened his death. It was published in two large volumes, each over 840 pages long, and, for its day, was well-illustrated with engraved drawings linked to the articles. Its full title is \"The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar: Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities and Literature, and Oddities of Human Life and Character\". It is well-indexed adding much to its value as a reference tool.\n\nEach day, listed in chronological order gives a short list of saints connected to the day and famous persons being born on that day and dying on that day. Individuals are then selected from these lists for more detailed articles. With six or seven articles per day the total number of articles, which are in the form of erudite essays, runs to around 2000, a staggering undertaking in terms of research. It is a much quoted reference in many hundreds of other reference books.\n\nIn 2004 Chambers Harrap published a new \"Book of Days\".

At the same time, the style of \"Chambers Book of Days\" (1864) has been preserved by the inclusion of numerous passage from the original volumes, and the selection of these was one of the current author's more pleasurable tasks.

From the start it also covered Wales, together with more limited information relating to Scotland, Ireland, and other churches within the Anglican Communion.\n\nAn opportunity to compile and issue a new directory had been created by the effective disappearance of the earlier Clerical Guide or Ecclesiastical Directory, edited by Richard Gilbert, and also by the introduction of the much improved system of the Penny Post.\n\nThe basic contents of the Clergy List's earlier editions was summarised on their title pages:\n\nThe directory was always a bit less expensive than its later rival, Crockford's Clerical Directory, but not surprisingly it consequently offered considerably less in the way of biographical detail. This was especially true in the earlier editions which offered little or no information as to previous appointments, universities attended, or lists of publications by the clergy.\n\nThe directory was initially published by Charles Cox at the Ecclesiastical Directory Office, Southampton Street, Strand. Cox – who in 1839 had taken over a periodical called the Ecclesiastical Gazette, originating during the previous year – was able to produce two separate editions during the Clergy List's inaugural year of 1841. Thereafter it managed to maintain annual publication right up until adverse trading conditions forced its closure as a separate volume in 1917.\n\nCox remained as the Clergy List's publisher for many years, but by 1881 the title had been taken over by John Hall of Parliament Street, In 1888 it was further taken over by Hamilton, Adams & Company, of London's Paternoster Row. They had earlier acquired Thomas Bosworth's Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory, merging the two titles in 1889. During the following year the combined directory was still further transferred to Kelly & Company, the publishers of Kelly's Directories.\n\nThe later volumes were considerably expanded to include much greater biographical detail – broadly comparable with Crockford – but this was not sufficient to sustain the publication in the longer term. Over the years the number of pages also increased – ranging from around 300 in 1841 to around 700 by the 1890s.\n\nAfter 1917 the Clergy List finally merged with its long-time rival, Crockford's Clerical Directory. At least as late as 1932 the latter continued to advertise on its preliminary pages that it \"incorporated the Clergy List, the Clerical Guide and the Ecclesiastical Directory'\".\n\nIn recent years certain of the earlier editions of the Clergy List (including the first edition ) have been reissued by various publishers – either on CD-ROM or in scanned format on the World Wide Web.\n"}

It lives on the sandy or muddy seabed of the northern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea where it often semi-immerses itself in the substrate. The upper side is greyish-brown while the underside is white. It grows to a maximum length of about . The species is prized as a food fish, being caught mostly by trawling on the seabed.\n\nThe small eyes are close to each other on the right side of the body. This gives the fish the possibility of lurking half-buried in the sand for passing prey. The common sole, just like all other flatfishes, hatches as an \"ordinary\" fish with one eye on each side of the body. The young metamorphose to flatfish when they are about one centimeter long. The upper side is greyish-brown and the underside is white. The common sole approaches a maximum length of .\n\nIt has a preference for relatively shallow water with sand or mud covering the bottom.\nIt is found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, from the south of Norway to Senegal, and in almost all of the Mediterranean Sea. In the winter, it withdraws to the somewhat warmer waters of the southern North Sea. In the UK, a small sole is commercially called a \"slip\".\n\nAn ectoparasite of the common sole is the leech \"Hemibdella soleae\". The larvae settle on the upper surface of the fish, the only part not buried in the sediment, and after further development migrate to the underside, where they attach themselves with their suckers, feeding on the fish's blood.\n\nChefs prize Dover sole for its mild, buttery, sweet flavour and versatility, and for its ease of filleting. The fish yields fillets that hold together well in a variety of recipes.\n\nThe name \"Dover\" comes from Dover, the English fishing port landing the most sole in the 19th century.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the common sole to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n\nBecause of its prestige, the name \"Dover sole\" was borrowed to name the eastern Pacific species \"Microstomus pacificus\", a quite distinct species with different culinary properties: the Pacific sole has thinner, less firm fillets and sells for a lower price.\n"}

{"id": "7016721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7016721", "title": "Conflict resolution research", "text": "Conflict resolution research\n\nConflict resolution is any reduction in the severity of a conflict. It may involve conflict management, in which the parties continue the conflict but adopt less extreme tactics; settlement, in which they reach agreement on enough issues that the conflict stops; or removal of the underlying causes of the conflict. The latter is sometimes called \"resolution\", in a narrower sense of the term that will not be used in this article. Settlements sometimes end a conflict for good, but when there are deeper issues – such as value clashes among people who must work together, distressed relationships, or mistreated members of one's ethnic group across a border – settlements are often temporary.\n\nUnproductive conflict; this can be done by analyzing the three stages executed during this type of communication: the early stage, the middle stage, and the later stage. Generally speaking, an argument's potential is determined within the first 3 minutes of exchange, setting the tone for the early stage. It is in this stage where cross-complaining becomes present – countering one's complaint with another complaint – a negative environment is immediately set and hostility is likely to be mirrored. Exiting the early stage and entering the middle stage, we can see the kitchen-sinking concept come into, \"Once a negative climate has been set, it is stoked by other unconstructive communication. People often engage in kitchen-sinking, in which everything except the kitchen sink is thrown into the argument\" (Wood 234). Constant interruptions, underdeveloped thoughts and the continuation of cross-complaining is apparent, leaving no time, breath or desire to form resolutions. Eventually, the conflict floats into the later stage. By this stage participants are exhausted from arguing and individual prosperity is emphasized over mutual solution; counterproposals are exchanged. As you can see, unproductive conflict communication truly is ineffective and puts relationships in jeopardy.\n\nSimilar to the unproductive conflict communication cycle, the constructive conflict communication cycle can be divided into the same 3 parts – early stage, middle stage and later stage. To establish a positive early stage, it is crucial to acknowledge and confirm one another's concerns. Critical listening, open-mindedness and respect create a supportive climate. Once the solid groundwork is set, participants can shift into the middle stage and begin agenda building, that is, clarifying the concerns while staying on topic; interruptions are kept at a minimum and recognition is reinforced. Last but not least, solutions will be proposed as the conflict enters the later stage, where respect shall be maintained, ideas are exchanged, and resolutions are formed. Contrary to a negative climate, this form of communication seeks to create a positive, more tolerable environment.\n\nNegotiation, the most heavily researched approach to conflict resolution, has mainly been studied in laboratory experiments, in which undergraduate participants are randomly assigned to conditions. These studies have mostly looked at antecedents of the strategies adopted by negotiators and the outcomes attained, including whether agreement is reached, the joint benefit to both parties, and the individual benefit to each party.\n\nHere are some of the more prominent findings from these studies (see Pruitt & Carnevale, 1993):\n\n\nRecent experiments have found cultural differences in negotiation behavior (Gelfand & Brett, 2004):\n\n\nThird parties often become involved in conflict resolution, either being called in by the disputants or acting on their own because the conflict annoys them or the community they serve. Two common forms of third-party intervention are arbitration and mediation. In arbitration, the third party listens to both sides and then renders a decision, which can be either binding or advisory. Most mediation consists of third-party assistance with negotiation. When conflict is severe and the disputants have difficulty talking calmly with each other, mediators can put them into contact and help them develop a cease-fire or settlement. If the disputants cannot or will not meet each other, mediators commonly become intermediaries and shuttle between them. Sometimes a chain of two intermediaries is necessary because there is no single individual who can communicate effectively with both sides.\n\nMediation has been studied in both the laboratory and the field. Research (see Kressel & Pruitt, 1989) suggests that:\n\n\nMore than 100 distinct mediator tactics have been identified. Among the tactics that have been shown to work well, in the sense of producing long-lasting agreements beneficial to both sides are:\n\n\nInvestigators have looked at the impact of several kinds of third-party interventions in international and ethno-political conflict, including peacekeeping, mediation, and problem solving workshops. Peacekeeping is the use of lightly armed troops to manage conflict in a war zone. Most peacekeeping has been done by the United Nations, drawing on the military forces of its members. Traditional peacekeeping involved enforcing ceasefires, but in the last few years, the peacekeeper's duties have grown to include such services as the delivery of humanitarian aid, the supervision of elections, and maintenance of law and order. Research shows that as they go about these new responsibilities, peacekeepers – officers more so than enlisted men – often become heavily involved in negotiation and mediation. One study found that as conflict becomes more severe, peacekeeper mediators are more likely to meet separately with the disputants, to urge the disputants to relax, and to rely on force (Wall, Druckman, & Diehl, 2002).\n\nPeacekeeper mediation is done at the local level. Mediation at the intergovernmental level is a much older practice that has recently come under study with statistical analyses of large samples of historical mediations (Bercovitch & Houston, 2000). Among the findings in this research are:\n\n\nSeveral types of negotiation strategies have been developed for repairing faulty international and inter-group relations. Negotiations are usually held over a period of several days, and attended by mid-level opinion leaders and decision makers from both sides of a conflict, under the leadership of scholar and/or practitioners. The aims of these workshops are to teach the parties about conflict in general and their conflict in particular, to forge understanding between the parties and, if possible, to develop joint projects that will contribute to reconciliation. One evaluation study conducted showed that these workshops improved attitudes toward the other side, increase complexity of thinking about the conflict, and facilitate further communication with people on the other side (Fisher, 1997). There is also evidence that some alumni of these workshops have later contributed to high level negotiations between the conflicting parties.\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally published in the newspaper \"De Morgen\", but later taken over by the magazine \"HUMO\" in which it is still published today and for whom Henk is now their mascot. The series was in continuous syndication from 1981 until 2011. After the brief interruption it was continued again in the spring of 2013.\n\nIn 1981 Kamagurka published a one-album-only long comic story named : \"Mijnheerke Plagiaat\" (\"Mister Plagiarism\"), in the Belgian newspaper \"Vooruit\" (later \"De Morgen\"). At the end of the story the comics character Mr. Plagiaat decided to think up a comic character of his own, whom he named \"Cowboy Henk, contrary to Zorro\". On September 24, 1981 the first \"Cowboy Henk\" gag appeared in print. Kamagurka wrote the jokes and dialogues while his friend, Herr Seele, drew the stories.\n\nOriginally \"Cowboy Henk\" appeared in black-and-white as a gag-a-day comic of only four to six panels per episode. Sometimes he had adventures spread over more pages too. \"De Morgen\" received many angry letters from readers who complained about the style of comedy. In Flanders \"Cowboy Henk\" was published exclusively in the magazine \"HUMO\" from 1982 until 2011, usually as a single page gag-a-day page. He also appeared on many magazine covers, thus becoming one of \"HUMO\" 's official mascots. In October 2011, after nearly 20 years of continuous publication, the series was no longer published in HUMO and disappeared without fanfare. According to the redaction the series hardly got any reactions from readers anymore, even when publication was ceased. From that moment on until 2012 Seele drew the short-lived black-and-white comic strip \"Dikke Billie Walter\" (\"Fat Billie Walter\"), with Kamagurka as script writer. On April 10, 2013, the Flemish radio station \"Studio Brussel\" interviewed Seele and he announced Henk's comeback in HUMO. The character indeed reappeared. First as a gag cartoon, spread over an entire page and making topical comedy, later as a parody comic strip series of Belgian history until finally back in its old form as a comic strip.\n\nThe series has been translated in French (as \"Cowboy Maurice\"), Spanish and English in magazines such as \"L'Echo des Savanes\" and \"RAW\". In The Netherlands the comics are published in \"Vrij Nederland\".\n\nCowboy Henk is a muscular adult male with a characteristically brawny chin and a long yellow quiff which, according to the jubilee story \"De Bananenkuif\" (2001) is made from bananas. Usually Henk wears a white T-shirt with short sleeves, blue pants and black shoes with round noses. In his first gags Henk was a real cowboy, which explains his name.\n\nHenk is a flat character and completely unpredictable. He often behaves very bizarre, but the world around him is also very surreal. He often reacts calmly to all the madness around him, but can get aggressive and even violent at times. Sometimes Henk behaves like a naïve child still living at his mother's place and going to school. In other gags he behaves more like an adult by going to work or experiencing with sex and drugs. Since Henk has had sex with both men and women in his cartoons we can conclude he is bisexual. He has no stable profession, despite the fact that some successive gags depict him as a journalist, hairdresser or a painter.\n\nHenk is also the only recurring character. Other side characters only appear in a few gags, then disappear again.\n\nMuch like Kamagurka's other comics and cartoons Cowboy Henk is an absurd humor comic strip series, aimed at adults. Herr Seele told in interviews that \"Zippy the Pinhead\" by Bill Griffith was a major inspiration. Some \"Cowboy Henk\" gags have an almost child friendly atmosphere while others are full of shocking dirty jokes, toilet humour and/or black comedy. Because of the simple, naïve drawing style the series have been read by many children in \"HUMO\" over the years. This led to several angry letters by parents who complained about the child unfriendly vulgarities in the comic strip.\n\nIn Kamagurka and Seele's comedy TV series \"Lava\" and \"Johnnywood\" sometimes short animated cartoons featuring Henk were seen, with Seele voicing his character. He also performed Cowboy Henk (with a yellow quiff tied to his bald head) while Kamagurka told Henk's surreal adventures to the audience. In their radio show \"Studio Kafka\" they also made audio plays about Henk.\n\nThe series won the 2014 \"Prix du Patrimoine\" at the Angouleme International Comics Festival\".\n\n\n\n"}

The first top 10 airplay chart under the EMA was issued for May 21, 2013, with its first number one single being \"Blurred Lines\" by Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams. In 2014, the \"City Press\" wrote that the EMA charts were \"regarded as the industry standard when it comes to tracking what songs are being played on radio\". EMA currently monitors 48 radio stations and 8 television stations.\n\nA local content quota for radio was legislated by Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) for public stations in South Africa to play a minimum of 40% local music, while commercial stations had a quota of 25%. EMA released a report at the end of 2013 that South African radio stations collectively played only 28% local music that year. Their analysis was based on an annual airplay chart posted for that year, where only 28 out of the year's top 100 songs were by local artists; the highest-placed song by a local artist was Mafikizolo's \"Khona\" which ranked at number five—it received more than 5500 spins in 2013. In contrast, the most played song that year was American singer Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" with over 7200 spins.\n\nLinda Maseko, manager of South African record label Mentalwave, commented: \"A shift needs to happen. We are still doing a full analysis with a view to naming the radio stations that are not complying. We need that money at home to improve the music industry. The same thing is happening with commercials. In other countries, you have to get special permission to use a foreign track on a commercial – and prove that you can't find the right local one.\" Conversely, Charl Blignaut of the \"City Press\" noted that \"the most powerful hit factory in the country is not a major international record company, but a pioneering independent\". Blignaut's observation was based on EMA's 2013 annual chart where local label Kalawa Jazmee secured over 7% of all airplay on the top 100 and 30% of all local airplay. He went on to conclude, \"Independent artists are dominating the home-grown music playlists despite radio not meeting its local quotas\". It was further noted that the local genres of gospel music, traditional and kwaito were in decline in 2013; while house music, Afro-pop and hip hop music were increasing in popularity.\n\nIn 2015, a local chart was launched online for public viewing without registration; similar to the main airplay chart, the local chart also provides a weekly top 10 based on airplay.\n\n\n\n"}

The site was launched in February 2001 by Peter Hamza, and allows users to contribute, share and download high-resolution photographs and illustrations free of charge. Contributors are encouraged to submit material to enhance their photography career through wider public exposure. In 2009, the site had over 2,500,000 registered users (1,000,000 in the USA alone) and more than 400,000 photos. Until 2009 it operated parallel to its sister site, Stockxpert.com, until the site's parent company, Jupiterimages, was purchased by Getty Images, and the site is now tied in with the iStock library of paid images.\n\nSince its acquisition by Getty Images in 2014, the site was renamed FreeImages in 2014 and the web address now redirects to a freeimages.com URL. It has retained the older SXC images and the link to the iStock website.\n\nThe stock.xchng site operated as a hybrid of a picture library site and a social networking site; registered users could set up a personal profile, upload their photographic works to share with other users, write a blog and participate in online forums to discuss and critique each other's work.\n\nAs a design resource, the site provided a library of high-resolution, royalty-free photographs which may be downloaded free of charge for use in design projects.

It is housed in the Scuola della Carità on the south bank of the Grand Canal, within the sestiere of Dorsoduro. It was originally the gallery of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, the art academy of Venice, from which it became independent in 1879, and for which the Ponte dell'Accademia and the Accademia boat landing station for the \"vaporetto\" water bus are named. The two institutions remained in the same building until 2004, when the art school moved to the Ospedale degli Incurabili.\n\nThe Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia was founded on 24 September 1750; the statute dates from 1756. The first director was Giovanni Battista Piazzetta; Gianbattista Tiepolo became the first president after his return from Würzburg.\n\nIt was one of the first institutions to study art restoration starting in 1777 with Pietro Edwards, and formalised by 1819 as a course.\n\nIn 1807 the academy was re-founded by Napoleonic decree. The name was changed from Veneta Academia di Pittura, Scultura e Architettura to Accademia Reale di Belle Arti, \"royal academy of fine arts\", and the academy was moved to the Palladian complex of the Scuola della Carità, where the Gallerie dell'Accademia are still housed. The collections of the Accademia were first opened to the public on 10 August 1817.\n\nThe Gallerie dell'Accademia became independent from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in 1879. Like other state museums in Italy, it falls under the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, the Italian ministry of culture and heritage.\n\nThe Napoleonic administration had disbanded many institutions in Venice including some churches, convents and Scuole. The Scuola della Carità, the Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi and the church of Santa Maria della Carità thus became the home of the Accademia. The Scuola della Carità was the oldest of the six Scuole Grandi and the building dates back to 1343, though the scuola was formed in 1260. The Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi was started in 1561 by Andrea Palladio, though it was never fully completed. The facade of Santa Maria della Carità was completed in 1441 by Bartolomeo Bon.\n\nThe Gallerie dell’Accademia contains masterpieces of Venetian painting up to the 18th century, generally arranged chronologically though some thematic displays are evident.\n\nArtists represented include:\nAntonello da Messina, \nLazzaro Bastiani,\nGentile and Giovanni Bellini, \nBernardo Bellotto, \nPacino di Bonaguida, \nCanaletto, \nCarpaccio, \nGiulio Carpioni, \nRosalba Carriera, \nCima da Conegliano, \nFetti, \nPietro Gaspari, \nMichele Giambono, \nLuca Giordano, \nFrancesco Guardi, \nGiorgione, \nJohann Liss, \nCharles Le Brun, \nPietro Longhi, \nLorenzo Lotto, \nMantegna,\nRocco Marconi, \nMichele Marieschi, \nPiazzetta,\nGiambattista Pittoni, \nPreti, \nTiepolo, \nTintoretto, \nTitian, \nVeronese (Paolo Caliari),\nVasari, \nLeonardo da Vinci (Drawing of Vitruvian Man),\nAlvise Vivarini, and\nGiuseppe Zais.\n"}
{"id": "425002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425002", "title": "Gloss (annotation)", "text": "Gloss (annotation)\n\nA gloss (; ) is a brief notation, especially a marginal one or an interlinear one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text, or in the reader's language if that is different. \n\nA collection of glosses is a \"glossary.\" A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by glossators, is called an \"apparatus\". The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of lexicography, and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first dictionaries. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The German Romantic movement used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish Décima style. \n\nGlosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a classical language; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear translations of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today parenthetical explanations in scientific writing and technical writing are also often called glosses. Hyperlinks to a glossary sometimes supersede them.\n\nThe word \"gloss\" was first used in the 1570s to refer to the insertion of a word as an explanation. It began to be used to mean to \"explain away\" in the 1630s, and originated from the concept of a note being inserted in the margin of a text to explain a difficult word.\n\nGlosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical theology, and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the \"three heavenly witnesses\" or the \"Comma Johanneum\", which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek Textus Receptus collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, and Nestle-Aland.\n\nIn the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on Roman law and Canon law created standards of reference, so-called \"sedes materiae\" (literally: seat of the matter). In common law countries, the term \"judicial gloss\" refers to what is considered an authoritative or \"official\" interpretation of a statute or regulation by a judge. Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the constitutionality of various provisions of law.\n\nA gloss, or \"glosa\", is a verse in traditional Iberian literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the \"mote\"). See also villancico.\n\nGlosses are of some importance in philology, especially if one language—usually, the language of the author of the gloss—has left few texts of its own. The Reichenau Glosses, for example, gloss the Latin Vulgate Bible in an early form of one of the Romance languages, and as such give insight into late Vulgar Latin at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the Old English language to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see \"Old English Bible translations\". Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of Old Irish. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for syntax, because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its idioms literally.\n\nIn linguistics, a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word. Single quotes are a widely used convention. For example: \n\n\nA longer or more complex transcription may rely upon an \"interlinear gloss\". Such a gloss may be placed between a text and its translation when it is important to understand the structure of the language being glossed, and not just the overall meaning of the passage.\n\nSign languages are typically transcribed word-for-word by means of a gloss written in the predominant oral language in all capitals; American Sign Language and Auslan would be written in English. Prosody is often glossed as superscript words, with its scope indicated by brackets. \n\nPure fingerspelling is usually indicated by hyphenation. Fingerspelled words that have been lexicalized (that is, fingerspelling sequences that have entered the sign language as linguistic units and that often have slight modifications) are indicated with a hash. For example, \"W-I-K-I\" indicates a simple fingerspelled word, but \"#JOB\" indicates a lexicalized unit, produced like \"J-O-B\", but faster, with a barely perceptible \"O\" and turning the \"B\" hand palm side in, unlike a regularly fingerspelled \"B\".\n\n"}

He is a poor village farmhand, but possesses remarkable slyness, wit and wile. He is often presented as the \"typical Bulgarian\" in Bulgaria and the \"typical Macedonian\" in Macedonia. He is the perpetual antagonist of either the rich nobles, clerics and money lenders or the \"typical Ottoman\" — Nasreddin, whom he always manages to outwit. He is therefore regarded as a strictly positive figure and a hero of the common folk. \n\nAs a character, Hitar Petar first appeared in the 16th–17th century, when Bulgaria was still under Ottoman rule. Tales on his deeds are present in the folklore of many regions, including Dobrudja and Thrace. It is generally thought that the original Hitar Petar lived somewhere in present-day North-Western Bulgaria. He was introduced to literature, with Iliya Blaskov publishing several anecdotes involving him. His feats were adapted to an opera in 1967 and two comedy films, \"Nastradin Hodzha i Hitar Petar\" of 1939 and \"Hitar Petar\" of 1960.\n\nHitar Petar is similar to other characters of European and Oriental folklore, most notably Nasreddin of Islamic folklore, the German Till Eulenspiegel, the Hungarian Csalóka Péter and the Jewish Hershele Ostropoler.\n\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, it is thought that Itar Pejo is a native of the region of Mariovo, and a monument to the character was built in Prilep.\n\nHitar Petar Nunatak on Trinity Peninsula in Antarctica is named after the folklore character.\n\n"}

{"id": "458290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=458290", "title": "Lonely Planet", "text": "Lonely Planet\n\nLonely Planet is a large travel guide book publisher. The Lonely Planet books were the third series of travel books aimed at backpackers and other low-cost travellers, after the \"Let's Go\" travel guide series that was founded in 1960, and the BIT Guides from 1970. , the company had sold 120 million books since inception and by early 2014, it had sold around 11 million units of its travel apps.\n\nLonely Planet was founded by married couple Maureen and Tony Wheeler. Tony Wheeler graduated from the University of Warwick and London Business School, and was a former engineer at the Chrysler corporation. The pair met in London in 1970 and, in July 1972, they embarked on an overland trip through Europe and Asia, eventually arriving in Australia in December 1972. The route that they followed was first undertaken by vehicle on the 1955 Oxford-Cambridge Overland Expedition.\n\nThe company name originated from Tony Wheeler's appreciation of a misheard line in \"Space Captain\", a song written by Matthew Moore, and first popularized by Joe Cocker and Leon Russell on the \"Mad Dogs & Englishmen\" tour of 1970—the actual lyrics are \"lovely planet\". Lonely Planet's first book, \"Across Asia on the Cheap\", consisting of 94 pages, was written by the couple in their home. The original print run consisted of stapled booklets and sold out.\n\nFollowing the success of the original booklet, Tony Wheeler returned to Asia with the deliberate intention of writing a travel guide and \"Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip\" was published in 1975. In October 2007 \"Observer\" writer Carol Cadwalladr—who also coauthored \"Travellers' Survival Kit Lebanon\"—described the book as \"canonical\".\n\n\"Across Asia on the Cheap\" offered the advice of amateur travelers who had completed the overland trip from London to Sydney in just under six months. The Wheelers offer practical advice, such as the importance of not mentioning \"arch enemies, Iran or Israel\" in Iraq, as it is a \"very hard-line socialist Arab country\"; casual observations, such as their description of Singapore as a \"groovy place\"; tips of an illegal nature, such as where to obtain fake identification or an explanation of why one should have their \"last drag\" of the drug cannabis before they arrive at the Iranian border; and emergency options for people in need of money, whereby places that \"have a good price for blood\" are identified.\n\nDuring the 1970s, traveling was considered an aspect of the counterculture and Tony Wheeler said in 2013: \"The boomers were setting off to places their parents hadn't gone.\" What became known as the \"hippie trail\" was a popular route for such travelers, as the price of travel dropped and numerous Asian travel companies were launched. Cadwalladr explained in 2007 that the introduction of the \"Across Asia on the Cheap\" booklet was \"a generational call to arms\", as it contained Tony Wheeler's motivational cry: \"All you've got to do is decide to go and the hardest part is over. So go.\" Cadwalladr further states that Wheeler's peers throughout the world subsequently made the decision to travel, regardless of whether they possessed a Lonely Planet guide. Other travel guide brand names also emerged in the early 1970s, such as Rough Guides and Bradt.\n\nThe popularity of the hippy trail, combined with the success of the original Lonely Planet publications, led the Wheelers to further develop the brand they had founded. The couple discovered writers in bars and also told people that if they could return to Australia with a completed book, then Lonely Planet would publish it. Tony Wheeler explained: \"You couldn’t just look for travel book writers because they weren’t out there. There wasn’t such an animal. We just told people that if you turn up in a year and a half with a book, we’ll publish it, and we did. It was very rough and ready.\" The popularity of the overland route taken by the Wheelers in 1972 declined when Iran's borders closed in 1979.\n\nThe Lonely Planet guide book series initially expanded in Asia, with the India guide book that was first published in 1981, but progressively became a dominant brand in the rest of the world, as consumers appreciated the way that the manner in which the guides were written—as former CEO Judy Slatyer explained: \"telling it like it is, without fear or favor.\" Wheeler explained in 2013, as part of the brand's 40-year anniversary, that working with the company's early writers, who were primarily travelers, was often challenging:\nOne writer came back with a 600-page guide to Jamaica—every pirate who stopped in got his biography—and we had to cut it by two-thirds ... For a long time we had a problem that every writer wanted to rewrite the history. We’d say, “Why are we rewriting the history of India for the 10th time? Surely, it’s not changing every two years.\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Tony Wheeler discussed one of the original Lonely Planet writers, Geoff Crowther, who wrote guides for India, South America, Africa and Korea. Crowther was renowned for frequently inserting his opinions into the text of the guides he wrote, giving the guide books real, gritty and un-politically-correct passion and sometimes covering topics such as where to purchase the best hashish. His writing was instrumental to the rise of Lonely Planet. The journalist used the term \"Geoffness\", in tribute to Crowther, to describe a quality that has been lost in travel guides. \n\nBy 1999, Lonely Planet had sold 30 million copies of its travel guides and, by this stage, the company was recognized beyond hippie trail adventurers, and wealthier readers were an established part of the readership. The company's authors consequently benefited from profit-sharing and expensive events were held at the Melbourne office, at which limousines would arrive, filled with Lonely Planet employees. By 2007, Lonely Planet had officially been classified as a \"Superbrand\", having published over 500 titles and had sold 80 million titles, translated into more than eight languages. \n\nIn October 2007, the Wheelers and Australian businessman John Singleton, who became a shareholder in 1999, sold a 75% stake in the company to BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the BBC. The stake was worth an estimated £63 million at the time. At the same time, a put option was negotiated on the remaining 25%. The owners of a put option (eg the Wheelers and Singleton) have the right to sell a specified amount of an underlying security (eg the remaining 25%) at a specified price within a specified time. The deal was led by David King, chief financial officer, and Ian Watson, International Director, and advice was provided by Deloitte Corporate Finance and Blake, Dawson Waldron in Australia. Managing director of BBC Worldwide's global brands division, Marcus Arthur, who became the chairman of Lonely Planet after the finalization of the agreement, explained in 2011 that implementing a put option arrangement allowed the BBC \"to benefit from the Wheelers' experience over the last three and a half years,\" further explaining that the founding couple \"supported Lonely Planet's ongoing migration from a traditional book publisher to a multi-platform brand.\"\n\nIn the BBC press release, published on 1 October 2007, the BBC Worldwide CEO at the time, John Smith, explained:\nLonely Planet is a highly respected international brand and a global leader in the provision of travel information. This deal fits well with our strategy to create one of the world's leading content businesses, to grow our portfolio of content brands online and to increase our operations in Australia and America.\n\nThe Wheelers also shared their motivation in the press release, stating: \"we felt that BBC Worldwide would provide a platform true to our vision and values, while allowing us to take the business to the next level.\" The founders have since written an autobiographical book titled \"Once While Travelling: The Lonely Planet Story\" (known as \"Unlikely Destinations: The Lonely Planet story\" in North America), describing their relationship, their initial overland journey and the founding of Lonely Planet.\n\nSlatyer was the CEO of Lonely Planet at the time and, in addition to the Melbourne headquarters, offices existed in the U.S. and the U.K. The company was publishing 500 titles and the \"next level\" that the Wheelers referred to involved ventures such as the production of the third season of its flagship television series, \"Lonely Planet Six Degrees\"—in partnership with Discovery Networks and screened in over 100 countries—the company's website, which was attracting 4.3 million unique visitors each month, and the further development of \"lonelyplanet.tv\", Lonely Planet's travel video website that was used by an online community of travelers, who could upload and watch their own videos, as well as those created by Lonely Planet.\n\nAlso in 2007, companies in the same category were making significant changes to their business operations. In early 2007, Bradt guides founder Hilary Bradt announced her retirement, alongside veteran independent publisher Charles James of Vacation Work—both founded their companies in the early 1970s like the Wheelers. Then, shortly before the Lonely Planet deal, the owners of Rough Guides sold their 25-year-old company to Penguin Books. Slatyer later reflected in 2014, in relation to the BBC acquisition: \"We should have moved much more aggressively into creating a digital space where travelers could engage, interact, write their own guides\".\n\nThe BBC deal also received a significant degree of criticism from rival media companies, such as Time Out and the Guardian Media Group, who argued that it represented an inappropriate expansion beyond the core programming and content of the media corporation. Such a sentiment was also evident within the BBC and the BBC Trust consequently ruled that similar acquisitions must not be sought out by the corporation's commercial arm in the future, unless \"exceptional circumstances\" are present. BBC Worldwide then struggled in the initial period following the acquisition, registering a £3.2 million loss in the year to the end of March 2009; however, the dire financial situation was eventually reversed with the implementation of a strategy that exploited new channels, such as Lonely Planet's non-print products.\n\nBy the end of March 2010, profits of £1.9 million had been generated, as digital revenues had risen 37% year-on-year over the preceding 12 months, spinoff products such as a \"Lonely Planet\" magazine had grown and non-print revenues increased from 9% in 2007 to 22%. Lonely Planet's digital presence at this time included 140 apps and 8.5 million unique users for lonelyplanet.com, which hosted the well-known Thorn Tree travel forum.\n\nThe eventual success achieved by BBC Worldwide led to the acquisition of the remaining 25% of the company, purchased for £42.1 million (A$67.2 million) from the Wheelers. The \"Lonely Planet\" magazine, launched in 2008, was described by the managing director of BBC magazines as the \"star of the show\" and, at the time of the 25% acquisition, eight editions were printed globally and the existing circulation of 60,106 continued to significantly grow.\n\nBBC Worldwide had been unable to sustain the success that it had achieved in 2010 by early 2012 and was interested in divesting itself of the company. Factors such as a global recession and the appreciation of the Australian dollar were cited as influential. Kelley noticed the opportunity and approached BBC Worldwide in April 2012 without an explanation for why he was interested in Lonely Planet. The BBC did not make an offer immediately, but in March 2013, the details of the sale were announced to the public.\n\nOn 19 March 2013, the BBC confirmed the sale of Lonely Planet to Kelley's NC2 Media for US$77.8 million (£51.5 million)—significantly less than the £130.2 million the BBC had paid for the company, at nearly an £80 million (US$118.89 million) loss. The BBC received £41.2 million (US$62.24 million) after the completion of the deal, followed by the remaining £10.3 million (U$15.56 million) twelve months later.\n\nThe BBC reassured the public that public money was not lost in the sale, as BBC Worldwide used its own money, rather than the BBC's main budget, which is primarily derived from a license fee on British television-owning households, to purchase Lonely Planet; however, as the \"New York Times\" reported, any financial losses impact upon the BBC's overall funding because all BBC Worldwide profits become part of the BBC's monetary assets. The Trust consequently initiated a review of the investment, while the Trust vice chairperson said to the media that \"at the time of purchase there was a credible rationale for this deal.\" Tony Wheeler stated in 2014 that, upon reflection, the decline in the company's television production was a key aspect of the BBC's eventual inability to maintain profitability, explaining that innovation is \"tough\".\n\nIn mid-2011, before the Lonely Planet consideration, Kelley met with Daniel Houghton, a young photojournalism graduate—from Western Kentucky University, the same institution that Kelley attended. Based solely on a handshake agreement, Kelley hired Houghton to help establish media company NC2 Media—the name \"NC2\" is short for \"in situ\", meaning \"in position\" in Latin—which then launched its first venture OutwildTV, a website featuring sponsored expeditions, followed by a gear blog. Kelley eventually explained in 2014 that his hiring decision was based upon \"a fortunate event\" and Houghton's intense focus \"on becoming something\".\n\nIn March 2012, the month before they first approached the BBC, Kelley bought a US$24-million, 12,000-square-foot studio facility to house NC2 Media. The Lonely Planet deal was closed in April 2013 and Houghton, appointed by Kelly as the head of the newly acquired operation, visited the company's international offices to acquaint himself with the global nature of the enterprise. Worldwide, staff members were bewildered by Houghton's appointment and one longtime Lonely Planet author wrote in 2014: \"I figured there had to be more to the story than 'reclusive billionaire hires 24-year-old with no known experience to run the joint' . But I think it's as silly and fucked-up as it sounds.\". At the London office, a visual taunt was projected onto a wall prior to Houghton's speech to the team.\n\nHoughton then met with employees at the Footscray, Australia headquarters on 18 July 2013 to announce a restructuring process that would result in staff layoffs. He revealed to the media at the time that between 70 and 80 positions would be made redundant from the overall business. Houghton confirmed the ongoing existence of a Melbourne-based office, while the restructure occurred over a 6- to 12-month period following the July meeting. Ultimately, 75 of Lonely Planet's 383 full-time employees were made redundant. On 18 July, at the Footscray headquarters, Houghton \"walked up in front of a microphone in Melbourne, where most of the redundancies occurred ... and told them, 'Today is going to be a really tough day.' \"\n\nTony Wheeler has publicly stated: \"Certainly you don't want someone old and set in his ways—like me—at the controls\". However, asking the rhetorical question\" Is he [Houghton] the right 25-year-old? The jury is out on that one.\" Wheeler said that Houghton \"seems a nice guy.\"\n\nIn November 2013, the company purchased the TouristEye app that is used for planning trips and offers guidance while people are traveling. Lonely Planet's new head of mobile products, Matthew McCroskey, explained, also in 2014:\n... we have tons of information—all of Lonely Planet's historic content. And we're building really great technology to analyze that content and understand all the ways you can put it together ... You're in Rome, standing by the Colosseum. It's 3 P.M. on a Thursday in summer. You open your phone, and it says, \"Hey, glad you enjoyed the Colosseum, which was on the itinerary we helped you make. We know you love coffee. Time for a cappuccino! The best cappuccino place in Rome is two blocks away. Here are walking instructions. And while you're walking, you should know: Don't order a cappuccino in the afternoon in Italy; they only drink them for breakfast, and they're going to think you're a stupid American. So you should get a macchiato. And this is how you ask for it.\" ... we've got most of the people who can deliver that kind of experience. And Daniel [Houghton] is finding more.\"\n\nIn 2013 Lonely Planet acquired Budget Travel to expand its international magazine presence for the US market and launch a US edition. In 2015 Lonely Planet Magazine launched in the United States, expanding the number of global edition to 12.\n\nIn January 2016, a mobile app called Guides launched and reached number 6 in the travel category of Apple's app store. In February 2016, the company launched its released a new version of destinations on lonelyplanet.com.\n\nLonely Planet's online community, the Thorn Tree, was created in 1996. It is named for a Naivasha thorn tree (\"Acacia xanthophloea\") that has been used as a message board for the city of Nairobi, Kenya since 1902. The tree still exists in the Stanley Hotel. It is used by over 600,000 travelers to share their experiences and look for advice. Thorn Tree has many different forum categories including different countries, places to visit depending on one's interests, travel buddies, and Lonely Planet support. The Lonely Planet website includes travel articles, destination and point of interest guides, hotel, hostel and accommodations listings, and the ability to rate and review sites and restaurants.\n\nLonely Planet temporarily closed the Thorn Tree community on 22 December 2012, with a notification stating: \"We're sorry to let you know we've found it necessary to temporarily close the Thorn Tree section of Lonelyplanet.com as it has come to our attention that a number of posts do not conform to the standards of the Lonely Planet website. As soon as we have completed the necessary editorial and technical updates we will let you know but in the meantime we are very grateful for your understanding and patience.\" Later, Lonely Planet clarified the alert to say that it had found numerous posts containing \"inappropriate language and themes,\" and the site would be reopened once these posts were found and deleted. Thorn Tree returned on 5 January 2013, having shut forums they felt were non-travel related. Now, the forum is regulated regularly and allows users to flag responses they deem inappropriate or not relevant.\n\nThe \"Sydney Morning Herald\" reported that a disgruntled former user alerted the BBC to numerous posts related to paedophilia. A source close to Lonely Planet management told the \"Herald\" that BBC executives still smarting from the Jimmy Savile scandal went into \"full freak out, panic attack mode\" over posts about the age of consent in Mexico and child prostitution in Thailand. However, a BBC Worldwide spokesman denied there was any evidence of paedophilia discussions on the site. The BBC subsequently stated that the cause of the shutdown wasn't paedophilia, but general concern with language and themes that the BBC was \"uncomfortable\" with.\n\nIn 2009, Lonely Planet began publishing a monthly travel magazine called \"Lonely Planet Traveller\" in the UK, and in 2010, it launched the Indian and the Argentine editions. Its Korean edition, with a digital edition for iPad, was launched in March 2011. Its Chinese version was launched in Mainland China in Aug 2012. In October 2014, Lonely Planet announced a U.S. version of the travel magazine.\n\nLonely Planet also has its own television production company, which has produced numerous series, such as \"The Sport Traveller\", \"Going Bush\", \"Vintage New Zealand\", and \"Bluelist Australia\", along with the following:\n\nA mention in a Lonely Planet guidebook can draw large numbers of travellers, which changes places mentioned. For example, Lonely Planet has been blamed for the rise of what is sometimes referred to as 'the Banana Pancake Trail' in South East Asia. \n\nIn 1996, in response to a \"Visit Myanmar\" campaign by the Burmese military government, the Burmese opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and its leader Aung San Suu Kyi called for a tourism boycott. As the publication of Lonely Planet's guidebook to Myanmar (Burma) is seen by some as an encouragement to visit that country, this led to calls for a boycott of Lonely Planet. Lonely Planet's view is that it highlights the issues surrounding a visit to the country, and that it wants to make sure that readers make an informed decision. In 2009, the NLD formally dropped its previous stance and now welcomes visitors \"who are keen to promote the welfare of the common people\".\n\nIn April 2008, American writer Thomas Kohnstamm published the memoir \"Do Travel Writers Go to Hell?\", which touched on his experience writing a guide book for Lonely Planet in Brazil. After a review of Kohnstamm's guidebooks, publisher Piers Pickard agreed that no inaccuracies had been found.\n\nIn 2009, Australian author and former Lonely Planet guidebook writer Mic Looby published a fictional account of the guidebook-writing business, entitled \"Paradise Updated\", in which the travel guide industry is satirised.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42983419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42983419", "title": "Millerand letter", "text": "Millerand letter\n\nThe Alexandre Millerand Letter was written by French Prime Minister Alexandre Millerand and was an annex to the Trianon Treaty. It stated that the border amendments made by the Trianon Treaty were not final, and could be reviewed in the future. This give the Hungarian government the false impression that the treaty itself was only temporary, and so the delegation signed the treaty on June 4, 1920.\n\nOn March 8, 1920, the Council of Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors discussed for the last time the new borders of Hungary in London, and Millerand was the chairman. Lloyd George questioned the viability of such border modifications, but Philippe Berthelot refused to do any adjustment at the last moment, so as a compromise, the council produced the Millerand Letter, as an annex to the Treaty. The letter stated: \"in order to preempt any further discussion regarding territory, that the eventual modification of the designated boundaries would be referred to the boundary committees in accordance with the same conditions\".\n\nThe letter stated: \"Examinations are to be done locally, and in some cases it might be necessary to move the borders stated in the treaty... if the border committees ... come to the conclusion ... that the declarations of the treaty are unfair, then they will have the possibility to report it to the Council of the League of Nations. In this case the Entente Powers agree to that, on request to one party involved, the \"League of Nations will offer its services to retain the original border, with the same conditions, in a peaceful way\", in locations where the Council decides so.\"\n\nThe consequences of this annex were adverse for Hungary. It fed Hungarian revisionism and speeded up the signing and ratification of the Treaty both in the Hungarian Parliament and in England and France.\n\nLéon Blum, politician of the French Socialist Party, published in the French newspaper \"Populaire\" that the cost of the help of Millerand would be to put the Hungarian State Railways rented to a French investment fund. According to the publication, if the railway was controlled by this fund, then Millerand would modify the borders in favour of Hungary. Millerand did not respond to this allegation, and it cannot be verified. It is fact that Millerand has receded to do any favour for Hungary afterward.\n\nThe Trianon borders were later revised during the Munich Agreement (1938), during both Vienna Awards (1938 and 1940), and reconquering areas from Yugoslavia in 1941. All border modifications were resettled in 1947 according to the original treaty.\n\n"}
{"id": "38267543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38267543", "title": "Muppets Most Wanted", "text": "Muppets Most Wanted\n\nMuppets Most Wanted is a 2014 American musical comedy film and the eighth theatrical film featuring the Muppets. Directed by James Bobin and written by Bobin and Nicholas Stoller, the film is a sequel to 2011's \"The Muppets\" and stars Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell, and Tina Fey, as well as Muppet performers Steve Whitmire, Eric Jacobson, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta, David Rudman, Matt Vogel, and Peter Linz. In the film, the Muppets find themselves unwittingly involved in an international crime caper while on tour in Europe.\n\nAside from co-writer Jason Segel, the majority of the production team behind \"The Muppets\" returned for \"Muppets Most Wanted\" including Bobin, Stoller, and producers David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman. Bret McKenzie and Christophe Beck returned to compose the film's songs and musical score, respectively. Principal photography commenced in January 2013 at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.\n\n\"Muppets Most Wanted\" had its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on March 11, 2014, and was released theatrically in North America on March 21, 2014. The film grossed $80.4 million worldwide.\n\nFollowing the events of [[The Muppets (film)|the previous film]], The [[The Muppets|Muppets]] find themselves at a loss as to what to do until Dominic Badguy suggests the Muppets go on a European tour with him as their tour manager. As the Muppets begin their tour, a criminal mastermind named [[Constantine (Muppet)|Constantine]], a near-exact double for [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] in appearance, escapes from a [[Gulag|Siberian Gulag]] and joins his subordinate Dominic to begin a plot to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]].\n\nOnce the Muppets arrive in [[Berlin]], Germany, Dominic secures them a show at a prestigious venue. Frustrated with the group's incessant requests and [[Miss Piggy]]'s insistence they marry, Kermit goes for a walk at Dominic's suggestion. Constantine ambushes him and glues a fake mole onto his cheek then slips away. Mistaken for Constantine, Kermit is sent to the Gulag. Taking Kermit's place, Constantine's blunders in imitating him are covered by Dominic; however, [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] knows the truth. After the Berlin performance opens with Constantine freezing at the audience, [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] has to introduce the show. Constantine and Dominic steal paintings from a museum while the Muppets perform. The next morning, [[Interpol]] agent Jean Pierre Napoleon and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]] grudgingly team up to apprehend the culprit whom Napoleon believes to be his nemesis \"The Lemur\" - the number-two criminal in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Kermit has attempted several times to escape the Gulag but is thwarted each time by [[Prison officer|prison guard]] Nadya, who is not only aware of his true identity but is as infatuated with him as Miss Piggy is. Nadya orders Kermit to help organize the prisoners' annual talent show.\n\nFollowing hidden instructions on the stolen painting, Constantine and Dominic divert the tour to [[Madrid]], Spain. Constantine allows the Muppets to perform whatever they wish, much to [[Walter (Muppet)|Walter]]'s confusion. During this show, Constantine and Dominic break into a museum and destroy a roomful of busts to find a key needed for their plan. Even though the performance is a disaster, the Muppets receive critical acclaim. Sam and Napoleon deduce that the connection between the crimes is the Muppet tour, and the pair interrogates the Muppets, only to find that they are too ill-equipped to be guilty. The instructions on the stolen key lead Constantine and Dominic to schedule the next show in [[Dublin]], Ireland.\n\nIn Dublin, Walter discovers that Dominic has been giving away show tickets and [[Bribery|bribing]] critics to ensure a packed house and rave reviews, while [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] notices Kermit's resemblance to Constantine. They both realize that Constantine has taken Kermit's place and brought in Dominic as his accomplice. Constantine attacks Walter and Fozzie, but Animal fends him off and the three escape from the train to rescue Kermit. During the Dublin performance, Dominic steals a locket from a museum and Constantine proposes to Miss Piggy onstage; Piggy accepts, and the pair plan a ceremony to be held at the [[Tower of London]] in [[London]], England, where the Crown Jewels are kept.\n\nFozzie, Walter, and Animal reach the Siberian Gulag on the night of the performance, and Kermit uses it as a front to allow them, himself, and all the prisoners to escape the Gulag. Kermit, Fozzie, Walter, and Animal infiltrate the Tower as the wedding begins, and Dominic (with the help of Bobby Benson's Baby Band) manages to steal the jewels.\n\nKermit interrupts the ceremony, revealing Constantine's ruse, but the crook takes Miss Piggy hostage and flees to a helicopter, where he is intercepted by Dominic, who is actually the Lemur and intends to double-cross him. Constantine ejects him from the helicopter and tries to take off with Piggy, but Kermit jumps aboard and the rest of the Muppets climb atop each other to stop the escape. Kermit and Piggy knock out Constantine and both criminals are arrested by Sam and Napoleon. Nadya arrives in London to arrest Kermit for escaping. The other Muppets tell her that if she arrests him, then she will have to take all of them as well; she relents, allowing Kermit to go free. The Muppets perform at the Gulag with Constantine and the prisoners participating, ending the film.\n\n\n\nArchival footage of Kermit performed by [[Jim Henson]] is featured in the film through scenes from \"[[The Muppet Movie]]\", \"[[Sesame Street]]\" and \"[[The Muppet Show]]\".\n\n[[Dexter Fletcher]], [[Bridgit Mendler]], [[Debby Ryan]], [[Peter Serafinowicz]], [[Jake Short]], and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] filmed [[Deleted scene|scenes that were cut from the film]]. These scenes were later reinstated in the Blu-ray release's extended version.\n\nIn March 2012, after the critical and commercial success of \"[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]\", [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] negotiated a deal with [[James Bobin]] and [[Nicholas Stoller]] to direct and write, respectively, an eighth installment. Disney [[Green-light|green-lit]] the film on April 24, 2012. Along with [[Brian Henson]], Bobin is the only other person to have directed two Muppet films.\n\nWriting began in April 2012 after a couple of weeks of outlining. [[Jason Segel]], co-writer and star of the previous film, declined any involvement with the eighth entry, citing that he had accomplished his ambition of bringing the characters to the forefront with the 2011 film. Despite this, Bobin and Stoller quickly began work on the film based on Disney's demand. Taking on the form of a caper, the film was inspired by both \"[[The Great Muppet Caper]]\" and \"[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]\" as well as \"[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]\" and \"[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]\". Bobin said that the film was \"a tip of the hat to the old-school crime capers of the '60s, but featuring a frog, a pig, a bear, and a dog—no panthers, even pink ones—along with the usual Muppet-y mix of mayhem, music and laughs\".\n\nThe first actor to be attached to the film was [[Christoph Waltz]] in the role of an Interpol inspector. Waltz dropped out due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by [[Ty Burrell]]. In December 2012, [[Ricky Gervais]] confirmed his casting. [[Tina Fey]] was later confirmed in January of the following year.\n\nOriginally commissioned under the title \"The Muppets... Again!\", [[principal photography]] began in January 2013, at London's [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Iver]], Buckinghamshire. Filming also took place at the [[Tower of London]], a site where the [[Crown Estate]] rarely grants permission to do so. Additional filming locations in London included [[Leicester Square]], [[Tower Hill]], the [[Richmond Theatre]], [[Wilton's Music Hall]], [[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons' Hall]] and [[Chatham Dockyard|The Historic Dockyard, Chatham]]. In addition to the United Kingdom, scenes were also shot at [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]], the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] lot, and on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] (to recreate the previous film's ending) in [[Los Angeles]]. On June 13, 2013, the title of the film was changed from \"The Muppets... Again!\" to \"Muppets Most Wanted\".\n\nThe production design was done by [[Eve Stewart]], who took a [[tongue-in-cheek]] approach to each country setting while also being influenced by the [[retro style]] of \"crime capers of the '60s and '70s\". Rahel Afiley returned as the costume designer, compiling the wardrobe for both Muppet and human characters. In addition to Afiley's own creations, English fashion designer [[Vivienne Westwood]] also contributed four outfits for Miss Piggy while United States retailer [[Brooks Brothers]] created more than 200 items for the male cast. Discussing Miss Piggy's wedding gown, Westwood said, \"It's called the Court dress and is inspired by 17th-century English royalty and the court of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. It has been designed [...] in a white pearl [[sequin]] fabric made from recycled water bottles.\"\n\n[[Visual effects]] were done primarily by The Senate Visual Effects. The effects studio worked on 425 shots that included CG builds and [[Matte (filmmaking)|set extensions]], [[matte painting]]s, [[Particle system|particle]] and laser effects, animation, and rod removals. Additional visual effects work was done by [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], Factory VFX, and Nvizible. As with the previous installment, the film required [[Chroma key|blue screen]] for scenes that required [[digital compositing]]. While green screen is more traditional for color keying, the screen's shade of green would clash with [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] and therefore be unusable; [[Sam Eagle]]'s shade of blue is suitable on blue screen.\n\nAudio mixing and editorial services were done by [[Todd Soundelux]] and 424 Post. Based out of [[Todd-AO]]'s Santa Monica facility, [[Kevin O'Connell (sound re-recording mixer)|Kevin O'Connell]] and [[Beau Borders]] worked on the film as re-recording mixers alongside 424 Post's supervising sound editors [[Kami Asgar]] and [[Sean McCormack (sound editor)|Sean McCormack]].\n\nThe first assembly cut of the film ran around two and a half hours.\n\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] for \"Muppets Most Wanted\" was composed by [[Christophe Beck]], with additional songs by [[Bret McKenzie]]. A soundtrack album was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on March 18, 2014. It features six original songs by McKenzie as well as re-recordings of contemporary music and past Muppet songs, including \"Together Again (Again)\" from \"[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]\". A separate album entirely containing Beck's score (paired with the score for \"[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]\", also composed by Beck) was released by Walt Disney Records and [[Intrada Records]] on April 15, 2014.\n\n\"Muppets Most Wanted\" held its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] on March 11, 2014, at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California]]. The film was released in the United States on March 21 and in the United Kingdom on March 28, 2014. Theatrically, the film was accompanied by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studio]]'s \"[[Monsters University]]\" short \"[[Party Central]]\".\n\nA [[Trailer (promotion)|teaser trailer]] was released on August 6, 2013, and was attached theatrically to screenings of \"[[Planes (film)|Planes]]\". On November 20, 2013, two different trailers were released, one for the United States and one for the United Kingdom.\n\nIn February 2014, the Muppets starred alongside [[Terry Crews]] in a commercial for [[Toyota]] that aired during the [[Super Bowl XLVIII|Super Bowl]]. Later that month, Disney partnered with [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] to promote healthy eating through an advertisement featuring the Muppets. In early March, the restaurant chain started giving away free Muppet-themed bags with kids meals. Spoof posters were released for the film, parodying \"[[Skyfall]]\" (called \"Frogfall\"), \"[[The World Is Not Enough]]\" (called \"The Pig Is Not Enough\"), \"[[Face/Off]]\" (called \"Fraud/Frog\"), and \"[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]\" (called \"Animal Piggy Frog Spy\").\n\nIn February, the Android and iOS game \"My Muppets Show\" added content from the film, including a Big House stage, various props from the movie, and Constantine as a discoverable/purchasable character. From March 20 to April 1, Disney's online game \"[[Club Penguin]]\" hosted a special Muppets World Tour event. Players were able to visit nine country-themed rooms and perform alongside several Muppets.\n\n\"Muppets Most Wanted\" was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on [[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[DVD]] on August 12, 2014. Blu-ray bonus features include three cuts of the film: the original theatrical cut (107 minutes), the truncated Statler and Waldorf cut (2 minutes), and an extended cut featuring 12 minutes of scenes not shown in theaters (124 minutes). Also included are a blooper reel, a featurette called \"[[Rizzo the Rat|Rizzo]]'s Biggest Fan,\" and a music video of \"I'll Get You What You Want\" featuring [[Bret McKenzie]].\n\n\"Muppets Most Wanted\" grossed $51.2 million in North America, and $29.2 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $80.4 million. The film earned $4.7 million on its opening day, and opened to number two in its first weekend, with $17 million, behind \"[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]\". Considering that pre-release tracking had forecast \"Muppets Most Wanted\" at opening with takings of more than $20 million, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] distribution chief Dave Hollis said the film's opening was \"definitely disappointing\". Hollis said there was never a comparison between the [[The Muppets (film)|previous film]] and the sequel, since Thanksgiving is a concentrated time for family moviegoing. In its second weekend, the film dropped to number three, grossing $11.3 million, leading to a better second weekend than its predecessor. In its third weekend, the film dropped to number five, grossing $5.1 million. In its fourth weekend, the film dropped to number nine, grossing $2.3 million.\n\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a score of 80% based on reviews from 183 critics, with a rating average of 6.8 out of 10. The site's consensus stated: \"While it may not reach the delirious heights of \"[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]\", \"Muppets Most Wanted\" still packs in enough clever gags, catchy songs, and celebrity cameos to satisfy fans of all ages.\" [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 61/100 based on 37 indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". [[CinemaScore]] audiences gave \"Muppets Most Wanted\" a \"B+\" grade rating on an A+ to F scale.\n\n[[Alonso Duralde]] of \"[[The Wrap]]\" compared the film favorably to the 2011 predecessor, elaborating, \"\"Muppets Most Wanted\" remains sensational and celebrational, proving beyond a doubt that these beloved characters will continue to lead a plush life on the big screen for years to come.\" Despite reservations over the previous installment, [[Brian Henson]] called \"Most Wanted\" a great Muppets film, saying, \"I think [[Jim Henson|my dad]] would be thrilled the Muppets are continuing. That's a big deal.\" Peter Hartlaub of the \"[[San Francisco Chronicle]]\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"It just feels like something the original Muppet creators might have done.\" John Hartl of \"[[The Seattle Times]]\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Most of the laughs come courtesy of Tina Fey, in the role of a Siberian prison guard who can't/won't stop dancing.\" [[Todd McCarthy]] of \"[[The Hollywood Reporter]]\" had a mixed reaction; praising [[Bret McKenzie]]'s songs and the film's humor, but labeling the film overall as \"an oddly off-key follow-up\". Justin Chang of \"[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\" gave a negative review, stating that the film \"looks and sounds eager to please but immediately feels like a more slapdash, aimless affair, trying—and mostly failing—to turn its stalled creativity into some sort of self-referential joke.\" Anna Smith of \"[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]\" gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"'Everybody knows that the sequel's never quite as good,' sing our fluffy friends during the opening number of a film with much to live up to after 2011's terrific reboot, \"The Muppets\". The joke proves self-fulfilling.\" Bill Goodykoontz of \"[[The Arizona Republic]]\" gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Although this movie has lots of laughs and a willingness to poke fun at itself, it doesn't quite recapture the magic of the last movie. Close, but not quite.\"\n\nJake Coyle of the [[Associated Press]] gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"\"Muppets Most Wanted\" fails to whip up the kind of furry frenzy that makes the Muppets special.\" Kyle Smith of the \"[[New York Post]]\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"The movie seems longer than it is, plus it's just plain too long. Ah, but those jokes are frequently brilliant.\" [[Peter Travers]] of \"[[Rolling Stone]]\" gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"The breaking point of stretching this one joke is reached early.

{"id": "316392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316392", "title": "Okakura Kakuzō", "text": "Okakura Kakuzō\n\nBorn in Yokohama to parents originally from Fukui, Okakura learned English while attending a school operated by Christian missionary, Dr. Curtis Hepburn. At 15, he entered Tokyo Imperial University, where he first met and studied under Harvard-educated professor Ernest Fenollosa. In 1889, Okakura co-founded the periodical \"Kokka\". In 1887 he was one of the principal founders of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (東京美術学校 \"Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō\"), and a year later became its head, although he was later ousted from the school in an administrative struggle. Later, he also founded the Japan Art Institute with Hashimoto Gahō and Yokoyama Taikan. He was invited by William Sturgis Bigelow to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1904 and became the first head of the Asian art division in 1910.\n\nOkakura was a high-profile urbanite who had an international sense of self. In the Meiji period he was the first dean of the Tokyo Fine Arts School (later merged with the Tokyo Music School to form the current Tokyo University of the Arts). He wrote all of his main works in English. Okakura researched Japan's traditional art and traveled to Europe, the United States, China and India. He emphasised the importance to the modern world of Asian culture, attempting to bring its influence to realms of art and literature that, in his day, were largely dominated by Western culture.\nHis 1903 book on Asian artistic and cultural history, \"The Ideals of the East with Special Reference to the Art of Japan\", published on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, is famous for its opening paragraph in which he sees a spiritual unity throughout Asia, which distinguishes it from the West:\n\nAsia is one. The Himalayas divide, only to accentuate, two mighty civilisations, the Chinese with its communism of Confucius, and the Indian with its individualism of the Vedas. But not even the snowy barriers can interrupt for one moment that broad expanse of love for the Ultimate and Universal, which is the common thought-inheritance of every Asiatic race, enabling them to produce all the great religions of the world, and distinguishing them from those maritime peoples of the Mediterranean and the Baltic, who love to dwell on the Particular, and to search out the means, not the end, of life.\n\nIn his subsequent book, \"The Awakening of Japan\", published in 1904, he argued that \"the glory of the West is the humiliation of Asia.\" This was an early expression of Pan-Asianism. In this book Okakura also noted that Japan's rapid modernization was not universally applauded in Asia: ″We have become so eager to identify ourselves with European civilization instead of Asiatic that our continental neighbors regard us as renegades—nay, even as an embodiment of the White Disaster itself.\"\n\nIn his \"The Book of Tea\", which was written in English in 1906, he states: It (Teaism) insulates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.\n\nIn Japan, Okakura, along with Fenollosa, is credited with \"saving\" Nihonga, or painting done with traditional Japanese technique, as it was threatened with replacement by Western-style painting, or \"Yōga\", whose chief advocate was artist Kuroda Seiki. In fact this role, most assiduously pressed after Okakura's death by his followers, is not taken seriously by art scholars today, nor is the idea that oil painting posed any serious \"threat\" to traditional Japanese painting. Yet Okakura was certainly instrumental in modernizing Japanese aesthetics, having recognized the need to preserve Japan's cultural heritage, and thus was one of the major reformers during Japan's period of modernization beginning with the Meiji Restoration.\n\nOutside Japan, Okakura influenced a number of important figures, directly or indirectly, who include Swami Vivekananda, philosopher Martin Heidegger, poet Ezra Pound, and especially poet Rabindranath Tagore and heiress Isabella Stewart Gardner, who were close personal friends of his.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The goal of the project was to provide accurate, detailed, current, and unbiased technical information on security vulnerabilities. The project promoted greater and more open collaboration between companies and individuals.\n\nIts goal was to provide accurate, unbiased information about security vulnerabilities in computerized equipment. The core of OSVDB was a relational database which tied various information about security vulnerabilities into a common, cross-referenced open security data source. As of November, 2013, the database cataloged over 100,000 vulnerabilities.\n\nThe project was started in August 2002 at the Blackhat and DEF CON Conferences by several industry notables (including H. D. Moore, rain.forest.puppy, and others). Under mostly-new management, the database officially launched to the public on March 31, 2004.\n\nThe Open Security Foundation (OSF) was created to ensure the project's continuing support. Brian Martin (AKA Jericho) and Jake Kouns are project leaders for the OSVDB project, and currently hold leadership roles in the OSF. It is a client/server implementation that consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many different client programs/libraries. It has a pluggable data store architecture\n\nOn the 5th April 2016, the database was shut down, although the blog will continue.\n\nOriginally, vulnerability reports, advisories, and exploits posted in various security lists enter the database as a new entry. The new entry contains only a title and links to entries of the same vulnerability in other security lists. However, at this stage the page for the new entry doesn't contain any detailed description of the vulnerability. After the new entries are thoroughly scrutinized, analyzed and refined, descriptions of the vulnerability, its solutions and test notes are added. Then these details are reviewed by other members of OSVDB, further refined if necessary and then made stable. Once it is stable, the detailed information appears on the page for the entry.\n\nAs of January, 2012, vulnerability entry was performed by full-time employees of the OSF. Every new entry included a title, description, solution (if known), classification data, references, products, and creditee.\n\nSome enthusiastic hackers are volunteering to maintain OSVDB. Some of the active members are as follows:\n\n\nOther volunteers who have helped in the past include:\n\n\nThe Open Security Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization established in early 2005 to function as a support organization for open source security projects. It was originally conceived and founded as a support for the OSVDB project, but its scope is evolving to provide support for numerous other projects.\n\nThe foundation allows organizations and individuals to provide charitable contributions to support open source security projects that provide value to the global community. The foundation also provides guidance, legal, administrative, policy guidelines, and other support to numerous projects.\n\nThe Open Security Foundation was conceived by Chris Sullo, Brian Martin, and Jake Kouns in early 2004, and obtained official US 501(c)3 non-profit status in April, 2005.\n"}

{"id": "31154821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31154821", "title": "Polish–Mongolian literary relations", "text": "Polish–Mongolian literary relations\n\nPolish–Mongolian literary relations are the interrelationships between Polish and Mongolian literature that date to the late Middle Ages. There are also links between Polish and Mongolian philology and literary studies. Their first manifestations were reports about Mongols in the Polish chronicles and in the relations of medieval Polish travelers to Asia. Knowledge about Mongolia in Poland became more vivid in the 19th century, when many Polish adventurers, prisoners in Siberia (see sybirak), learned people and businessmen of the part of Poland under Russian rule engaged heavily in Siberian, Mongolian, and Chinese affairs. Interest in Polish matters in Mongolia is smaller and dates mainly to the 20th century. There are also literary works (mainly adventure novels) about Mongolia in the Polish literature and a few translations of Polish literature into Mongolian, or Mongolian literature into Polish.\n\nThere are numerous mentions of the Mongols in the writings of virtually all Polish chroniclers, notably Jan Długosz. From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Mongolian affairs were connected or identified in Poland directly with the severe devastation wrought on the country by the Mongol invasions from late 1240 to 1241, then again in 1259–1260 and in 1287–1288. Mongol tumen under Orda Khan devastated most of central Poland, besieged and sacked Lublin, Sandomierz, Wolbórz, Łęczyca, then turned south towards Sieradz and Wrocław. All the while, the armies of Baidar and Kadan ravaged the southern part of Poland including Chmielnik, the royal city of Kraków, Bytom, Opole, Legnica and others. Panic spread through the Polish lands. In 1259, mere 18 years after the first attack, two tumens of 40,000 men from the Golden Horde under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland again. Most towns in Galicia and Volhyinia were burned to the ground. The Rus soldiers under Daniel's son, Lev, and brother, Vasily, joined the Mongol expedition. Here's where the Mongolian affairs became connected and identified in Poland with the Tatar issues. More death and destruction was unleashed on the cities of Lublin, Sieradz, Sandomierz, Zawichost, Kraków and Bytom. The Golden Horde remained very important in the literary tradition of Poland dating back to the Middle Ages. It inspired such works as a treatise on the origin of the Tatars by Mikołaj Rozembarski (1499).\n\nUntil the 19th century Polish–Mongolian relations were sporadic. Some of the earliest European mentions about the life, history and culture of the Mongols come from the travel reports from the journey to the Great Khan in the years 1245–47, written by Franciscan monks, members of the expedition prepared by the pope Innocent IV and headed by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine. One of the members of this expedition was Benedict of Poland. He wrote a short account of his journey, \"De Itinere Fratrum Minorum ad Tartaros\". An author of the more extensive account of this journey, based on Benedict's oral narrative, \"Historia Tartarorum\", was C. de Bridia, probably also a Pole. \"Historia Tartarorum\" contains an important description of the Battle of Legnica, one of the most important events during the Mongol invasion of Poland.\n\nThe first nineteenth-century Polish traveler to Mongolia was Jan Potocki (1761–1815), who visited Mongolia during his journey to China and wrote a travel report in French (Polish translation \"Podróże\", 1959). The father of the Polish Mongolian philology was Józef Kowalewski, who visited Mongolia several times (1829, 1831–33). Kowalewski was a former filomata, a friend of Adam Mickiewicz, a professor of Mongolian philology at the University of Kazan, an author of several works devoted to very diverse aspects of Mongolian culture and language, often pioneering. His most important work is a Mongolian–Russian–French dictionary in three volumes (1844–49). Polish research on the geography and culture of Mongolia intensified after the January Uprising, when many Poles became political prisoners in neighboring Siberia – one of the most famous among Poles participating in the research expeditions to Mongolia was Aleksander Czekanowski.\n\nWorld-famous among turkologists and mongolists was a Polish scholar Władysław Kotwicz, author of many works devoted to Mongolia and Mongolian literature, the discoverer (1912) of the old-Mongolian stone inscriptions in the Erdene Zuu Monastery. Other well-known Polish mongolists were Marian Lewicki, Stanisław Kałużynski and Stanisław Godziński. Lewicki prepared editions of many monuments of the classical Mongolian literature.\n\nIn 20th-century Mongolia there was interest in Polish literature, strengthened by the fact that both communist Mongolia and communist Poland belonged to the same political bloc. Many translations of Polish literary works into Mongolian were published, although they were usually translated indirectly, through the Russian language. Especially a large number of Polish children's literature was translated into Mongolian. However, most of these texts were published in magazines and not as books. Some Mongolian citizens studied Polish philology at Polish universities. Some translators translated literary works directly from Polish into Mongolian. Among the most important were D. Biambaa (poems of Władysław Broniewski and Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński), B. Bandi (Polish folk literature), P. Biambasan and D. Kim (novels by Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina). The most important translator was Byambyn Rinchen (1905–77): writer, historian, ethnographer and linguist, who translated into Mongolian many main literary works of many world literatures, including (directly from Polish) works of Adam Mickiewicz, Wanda Wasilewska, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz and Jerzy Andrzejewski. There are translations of his ethnographical books into Polish.\n\nThe number of translations of contemporary Mongolian literature into Polish is not very big. As in the case of translations from Polish to Mongolian, many texts were translated through the Russian language. To the most important belong \"Opowiadania mongolskie\" [Mongolian Stories] by Tsendiin Damdinsüren (1953), \"Wiersze\" [Poems] by Begzin Yavuuhulan (1962) and the novel \"Przejrzysty Tamir\" [The Crystal Clear Tamir River] by Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba (1980). Translations directly from Mongolian were published mainly in the orientalist journal \"Przegląd Orientalistyczny\", for example poetry and prose of Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj translated by Stanisław Godziński and Adam Latusek. Godziński translated also a selection of Mongolian epic poetry and chronicles (\"W kręgu lamajskich legend i mitów\" [Among lamaist legends and myths], 1981). To the most important translators of the classic Mongolian literature belongs Stanisław Kałużynski. He prepared \"Głosy z Jurty\" [Voices of the yurts] (1960) – a selection of Mongolian riddles, parables, proverbs, etc.; \"Tajna historia Mongołów\" (1970), a translation of the anonymous thirteenth-century Mongolian chronicle \"The Secret History of the Mongols\"; \"Tradycje i legendy ludów Mongolii\" [Traditions and legends of the peoples of Mongolia] (1978), which include excerpts from the seventeenth-century chronicle \"Erdeniin Tobchi\" and Mongolian folk epic poetry. Among Polish writers, whose works were affected by the culture of Mongolia, were Wacław Sieroszewski – especially his novel \"Dalaj Lama\" [The Dalai Lama] (1927) and its versions for children \"W niepodległej Mongolii\" [In the independent Mongolia] (1937); Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski – especially his travel novel \"Przez kraj ludzi, zwierząt i bogów\" [In the country of people, animals and gods] (1923); Kamil Giżycki (\"Przez Urianchaj i Mongolię\", 1929); Przecław Smolik, an author of the story on the life of Buryats \"Wśród wyznawców Burchan-Buddhy\" [Among the believers of Burchan-Buddha] (1925).\n\n"}

Reay. It is a compilation of scarce, non-canonical revelations of leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\n\nThe book contains 185 revelations, visions, temple dedications, etc..., some of which are very short or intended for a specific individual rather than general readers. The library of the church-owned Brigham Young University (BYU) identifies the book as containing \"Private revelations\".\n\nEach revelation is presented in its own enumerated \"selection\" which is further divided into numbered verses. Although these revelations are excluded from the accepted canon of the LDS Church, they are presented in a very similar format to the church's canonical Doctrine and Covenants (D&C), which also contains revelations of LDS Church leaders divided into \"sections\" and verses. The book billed itself as belonging \"alongside the four Standard Works\" because it contained nearly all the revelations and declarations of the church's Apostles and Prophets that weren't already included in the D&C.\n\nThe various revelations in the book include:\nAlso included are revelations to David O. McKay and others, and famous speeches from such figures as Boyd K. Packer and Bruce R. McConkie. In addition, the book contained dedication prayers for all the church's Temples at that time, as well as for uncompleted sites, such as Independence, Far West, and Adam-Ondi-Ahman. Among the twelve appendices is a bibliography on the D&C and a list of the Priesthood Courses of Study.\n\nShortly after publication in 1985, \"Selected Manifestations\" was recalled from retailer bookshelves, reportedly over copyright concerns with the LDS Church, and due to the fact that they were arranged like scriptures, i.e. the Doctrine and Covenants, but in \"Selections\" rather than \"Sections.\" Another controversial feature was that the book was dedicated to our \"Mother in Heaven.\" Some allege the church tried to stop its publication and ordered the authors, who were members of the church in Oakland, California, to stop selling it. Copies of the book are rare (it is believed that only about 200 copies exist) and it is listed in Bret Eborn's \"Guide to Mormon Books\" and sells for $400 to $800 on the rare book market. The book is usually on rare book dealer want lists. It is available online in a pdf format.\n"}

{"id": "3202620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3202620", "title": "Studiolo of Francesco I", "text": "Studiolo of Francesco I\n\nThe Studiolo is a small painting-encrusted barrel-vaulted room in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. It was commissioned by Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. It was completed for the duke from 1570-1572, by teams of artists under the supervision of Giorgio Vasari and the scholars Giovanni Batista Adriani and Vincenzo Borghini. \n\nThis small room was part-office, part-laboratory, part-hiding place, and part-cabinet of curiosities. Here the prince tinkered with alchemy and kept his collection of small, precious, unusual or rare objects. The walls and ceiling were decorated with paintings showing a similar variety of subjects, some showing exotic forms of industry and others mythology. The inset paintings are now all that remains in the room of the original contents. They are rather larger than what is normally meant by the term cabinet painting.\n\nThe late-Mannerist decorative program of paintings and sculpture was based on items encompassed by the collection. The object collection itself was stored in ~ 20 cabinets. In the center is a fresco of Prometheus receiving jewels from nature, commenting on the interplay of divine, nature, and humanity, that is the goal of both artistic and scientific interests.\n\nThe walls were also covered with 34 paintings representing mythologic or religious subjects, or representing trades. The arrangement was such that paintings were somehow related to their neighbors, and emblematic of the objects in the cabinets below. The arrangement we see today is somewhat speculative; and the relationships are not always clear. For example, Tommaso d'Antonio Manzuoli's \"Diamond Mines\" hangs above the Maso de Sanfriano's \"Fall of Icarus\". The painting by Giovanni Battista Naldini of the \"House of the Dreams\" emphasized the relationship with the adjacent bedroom of the Prince. The Studiolo is arrayed and visible through an arched opening and lacks cabinets, which fails to accurately recreate the claustrophobic feel of the original. In addition, originally a portrait of Francesco's mother, Eleonora of Toledo by Bronzino, kept vigil.\n\nWhile the Studiolo employed many of the best of contemporary Florentine painters, their work in this room, for most, does not represent their best efforts. The room itself is now more interesting as an example of an introverted and eccentric monarch; from an artistic viewpoint, the style of these paintings is the high point of Florentine Mannerism, as reflected in the affected and contorted crowds in the canvases. The pseudo-allegiance to the sciences couple with the sense that they illuminated the educated monarch, suggest a prescient hint of the encyclopedic philosophy of Enlightenment.

Not long after the death of the Grand Duke, it was neglected and dismantled by 1590, only to be partially reconstructed in the twentieth century as an Renaissance oddity within the medieval palace.\n\n"}

Situated within the Roman Forum, it was on the front slope of the Capitoline Hill, below the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, to the southeast of the Arx and Tarpeian Rock.\n\nWithin the building were the remains of the temple of Veiovis. In front of it were the Temples of Vespasian & Concord, as well as the Rostra and the rest of the forum. Presently the Tabularium is only accessible from within the Capitoline Museum, although it still provides a panoramic view over the Forum.\n\nThe Construction of the Tabularium was ordered around 78 BC by the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. The building was completed by Quintus Lutatius Catulus, consul in 78 BC. This was part of a public works\nprogramme for the redevelopment of the Capitoline Hill, which had been damaged by a fire in in 83 BC. The construction by Catulus is not motioned in the ancient literature. It is known through an inscription (CIL 1). \n\nThe building itself had a facade of peperino and travertine blocks. The interior vaults are of concrete.\n\nIts great corridor, long, raised above the forum on a massive substructure, is still partly preserved. This corridor was lighted through a series of arches divided by semi-detached columns of the Doric order, the earliest example of this class of decoration, which is in the Theatre of Marcellus, the Colosseum, and all the great amphitheatres throughout the Roman empire constituted the decorative treatment of the wall surface and gave scale to the structure.\n\nThe facade faced the back of the Temple of Concord in the Forum and consisted of three levels. The first story was a large and tall fortified wall with a single door and only small windows near the top to light the interior, forum level rooms. The second story featured a Doric arcade (partially preserved) and the third, no longer extant story, had a high Corinthian order colonnade. The upper floors of this structure was much changed in the 13th century, when the \"Palazzo dei Senatori\" was built.\n\nSome scholars, such as Filippo Coarelli, in the past, have suggested that the ‘Tabularium’ itself is unattested to in any literary sources. Furthermore, its function and purpose has been the subject of debate. The unity of the main structure does however suggest that the building was at least initially conceived to serve a singular purpose. To illustrate the complexity of the building, Filippo Coarelli has stated that a particular annex of the Aerarium Saturni was constructed specifically to house metal ingots and minted Republican coins.\nRecent evidence, in the form of six military diplomas dated from AD 85 to 88, confirms the existence of the ‘Tabularium’ in its renowned form.\nCoarelli has suggested that the ‘Tabularium’ can be dated precisely to 78 BC, although construction began many years prior and almost certainly prior to the death of Sulla. The building itself is in many ways intrinsically tied to the politics of Sulla, especially in regard to the temple substructure. \nThe structure was considered such an enduring masterpiece of late Republican architecture that a funerary inscription for the architect commissioned by Lutatius Catalus was created and preserved in a courtyard of the hospital of the Fatebenefatelli, on Tiber island. The inscription reads as follows: ‘Lucius Cornelius, son of Lucius, of the Voturia tribe, chief engineer to Q. Lucius Catulus when he was consul, architect (to him) when he was censor’.\n\nNicholas Purcell's article \"Atrium Libertatis\" is aligned with the view of contemporary historians regarding the epigraphic evidence once present within the Tabularium. In his detailed analysis of the now-lost inscriptions Purcell makes clear that these inscriptions have compounded our misunderstanding of one of the largest, oldest and best-preserved buildings of the Roman Republic.\n\nThe generic terms 'probatio' of a 'substructio' and a 'tabularium' were recorded by an early Renaissance antiquarian in that order. It is arguable that the identification of the so-called 'Tabularium' is incorrect. Purcell draws our attention to the lack of archaeological and epigraphic knowledge on ‘tabularia' suggesting that these inscriptions were not intended to be grandiose in scope, nor did they name the building which further reflects the prevailing credulity of the structure in question. Purcell’s reference to the archaeological research conducted by Theodor Mommsen aligns with his argument and likely indicates that historians must set aside such misunderstandings reflected in the literary sources. As Mommsen stated quite rightly that 'tabularium' may refer to any structure associated with administration. Therefore, it is likely that the 'Tabularium' in question, despite the sheer size fronting the Capitoline Hill, was one of many structures built for the purpose of holding records. \n\nPurcell’s assessment of the epigraphic evidence once found within the structure in question reaffirms the following view long held by academics that the 'Tabularium' is insufficiently documented and the product of scholarly inertia. This unfortunately has further compounded our understanding of the Capitoline substructure, and as a result, we are no closer to identifying the extent of its function, let alone its name.\n\nTucci’s article radically changed the way historians and archaeologists alike would view the ‘Tabularium’, questioning the very identification of the structure and its function. Exploring the history of archaeology at the site, Tucci makes clear that the identification of the so-called ‘Tabularium’ is hinged solely upon an inscription long lost (CIL VI 1314, 31597), with no ancient evidence from the period directly correlating to the site. As such, it is arguable that the word tabularium itself has been incorrectly in modern scholarship with reference to the building. Instead, Tucci argues that the substructure, which provides the foundations for the entire building, was itself likely a tabularium, being one of many offices housed within Roman buildings and temples for the purpose of holding records. As such, Tucci disputes the idea that a sole Tabularium or mass-archive of Rome ever existed. In alignment with this argument, Tucci subsequently seeks to identify the structure in occupation of the space above the Tabularium substructure. In examining the architectural link between the rooms of the substructure and that of a south-western building, Tucci, in accordance with historians before him, could identify the remnants of an extension of the Aerarium, or treasury, which was housed in the Temple of Saturn. Subsequently, in correlation with the accounts of Livy (7.28.4-6), Ovid (Fasti 6.183-85) and Cicero (De domo 38.101) Tucci draws attention to a clear association between the location of this mint, and that of the Temple of Juno Moneta. With reference to the archaeological research of Giannelli and his identification of concrete remains in the Aracoeli Garden in the Forum, Tucci argues for the foundations of Giannelli’s supposed Temple of Juno Moneta to date back to the 4th century B.C, thus indicating a relocation. Tucci’s argument thus is fulfilled as he concludes that in circa 78 B.C., the Temple of Juno Moneta was rededicated atop the substructure of the Tabularium, in a complex which included the extended Aerarium, and that this relocation likely occurred after the fire of 83 B.C. As a result, Tucci called into question both the identification and function of the so-called ‘Tabularium’, in his attempt to overturn a theory that had been taken for historical fact since the 15th century A.D.\n\nFillipo Coarelli (2010) uses the arguments and findings of Nicholas Purcell (1993), Henner von Heserb (1995) and Pier Luigi Tucci (2005) to propose an alternative understanding of the function of the Tabularium. These works are characterised by their ability to provide alternative understandings when questioning the function of the “Tabularium.” It is important to note that prior these studies, research and scholarship of the “Tabularium” was primarily saturated by the Richard Delbruck’s Hellenistiche Bauten in Latium, published in 1875. It was Delbruck’s findings that rendered the conclusion that the Tabularium served as a house of public records. However, writing in 2010, Coarelli has had access to a wider range of both archaeological and written sources that probe a deeper inquest in to traditional discourses that cloud our conception of the function and meaning of the “Tabularium.”\n\nWithin Substructio et tabularium, Coarelli fundamentally purports that “the so-called tabularium is not the archive of the Roman state, known by this name’ and the rejection of this long held but incorrect hypothesis permits us to study the monument afresh.” He goes on to state that “[the tabularium] represents in fact the foundations (substructio) of a large temple of the Sullan period, restored by Domitian after the fire of 80AD.” Throughout his work, Coarelli uses the findings of Purcell, von Hesberg and Tucci as a roadmap that forms the basis of his argument. He begins with Purcell’s epigraphic discoveries that connotes the classification of the Tabularium as a records building: “Populi tabularia ubi publici continentur” (Tabularia of the [Roman] People where the public [documents] are housed). Moving to von Hesberg, Coarelli highlights the study of the dimensions of architectural pieces from the Tabularium that suggest “the second floor of the building must have been significantly wider than the arched lower floor”, proposing that there was a temple structure within the Tabularium (Fig. X.). Finally, Coarelli’s inclusion of Tucci’s findings builds upon von Hesberg’s assertion, serving as a sounding board for Coarelli’s initial thesis; that the “Tabularium” served as the basement of a proposed temple. \n\nCoarelli tracks the structural changes that took place within the Tabularium, and ultimately concludes that it is challenging for historians to ascertain the absolute meaning of this structure due to the “complexity of [it].” He points out that only until recently have we been able to understand that the Tabularium actually existed due to the emergence of from six military diplomas, with dates ranging from AD85-88. Further, these diplomas refer the location of the Tabularium publicum to the Capitolium. Here, the location is extremely significant. Coarelli states that the tabularium “must have been situated in the immediate environs of the area Capitolina, where the military diplomas were displayed until AD90.” Thus, it is clear that the tabularium was a multifaceted building that pertained to the political and religious culture of the Roman empire. \nThus, by expanding upon the arguments of Purcell, von Hesberg and Tucci, Coarelli positions himself to further execute his overarching thesis with increased clarity. Fundamentally, by galvanising the “deep-rooted biases” that obfuscate the understanding of the Tabularium, Coarelli is able to suggest that the Tabularium is rather a multifaceted structure that pertained to the political and religious centre of the Roman world.\n\n\n\n"}

Widukind, proud of his people and history, begins his chronicon, not with Rome, but with a brief synopsis derived from the orally-transmitted history of the Saxons, with a terseness that makes his work difficult to interpret. Widukind omits Italian events in tracing the career of Henry the Fowler and he never mentioned a pope.\n\nWidukind's \"Gesta\" is known from five manuscripts, one of which came to light at the beginning of the twentieth century. The contexts and dates of the various versions which these represent have occasioned much discussion. The work was first completed in 967 or 968, when it was dedicated to Mathilda, the young daughter of Otto I and newly appointed abbess of Quedlinburg. However, in four of five manuscripts, the history was continued down to 973 (adding chapters 70-6 of Book III), whether by Widukind himself or another author. Since its composition must have been a long process, it is likely that the dedication was not originally part of Widukind's design and that he consequently had to make a number of adjustments to suit other needs. Three main recensions called A, B and C have been distinguished:\n\n\n\"Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres\" consists of three volumes:\n\nWidukind of Corvey starts book one with the fall of the Germanic Thuringian dynasty. In his version, Amalaberga is the daughter of the Frankish king Huga. After Huga's death Thiadrich, his son by a concubine is crowned as king, but Amalaberga convinces her husband, Irminfrid, with the help of the warrior Iring, that it is really she who should inherit the kingdom. A war starts, and after the Franks under Thiadrich have won a battle at Runibergun, the Thuringii retreat into the fortress of Scithingi (modern Burgscheidungen).\n\nThe Franks get the help of the newly immigrated Saxons who are looking for land, and a bloody battle is fought at Scithingi. After many warriors have been slain, Irminfrid sends Iring as a messenger to Thiadrich to ask for peace. The kings reach an agreement and plan to slay the Saxons on the morrow, but the Saxons get word of this, storm Scithingi during the night and kill all adults. Only Irminfrid and his family escape. The Saxons celebrate their victory for three days, afterwards they return to Thiadrich, who gives the country over to them.\n\nBy the order of Thiadrich, Iring convinces Irminfrid to return to the Frankish court. When Irminfrid kneels in submission before Thiadrich, Iring slays him. Thiadrich banishes him, as he has become despicable to all men by this deed, and he wants to have no part of this crime. Iring announces that he will atone for his crime and get revenge for his former master and slays Thiadrich as well. He places the body of Irminfrid over that of Thiadrich, so he will be victor in death at least, and leaves.\n\nWidukind ends by doubting the truth of this story, but recounts that the Milky Way is called \"Iring's Street\" to his day. An allusion to the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity under Charlemagne brings him to the early Saxon dukes and details of the reign of Henry the Fowler.\n\nThe second book opens with the election of Otto the Great as German king, treats of the risings against his authority, omitting events in Italy, and concludes with the death of his wife Edith in 946. He dedicates his writings to Matilda, daughter of Otto and abbess of Quedlinburg, a descendant of the Saxon leader Widukind, his own namesake.\n\nBook three tells the story of Liudolf, Duke of Swabia and Otto's Franconian campaign.\n\n\n\n"}

The hrimthurs, who are made of frost and ice, are descendants of the world's giant Ymir.\nIn the legend of the giant Haymon, however, Thyrsus is a proper name.\n\nThe cause of the dispute between the two giants Haymon and Thyrsus is reported differently:\nOne tradition tells that Thyrsus felt provoked by the immigrating Haymon (\"Rheinländer\" which means man from the river Rhine), because Thyrsus had already lived for ages in the Upper Inn Valley.\n\nAnother tradition reports of a sudden destruction of Haymon's castle during one night.\nWhilst one reported variant provides no reason for the sudden destruction, another variant says that it was Haymon's human neighbors who destroyed his castle. Then, they knowingly accused Thyrsus to be the perpetrator.\n\nThe fight between the two giants was reported to have taken place close to the hamlet Thyrschenbach - today: Dirschenbach.\nDuring the fight, Haymon stabbed a deep wound into Thyrsus' heel with his sword, so that a fountain of bright blood poured out. Thyrsus took a turf, stuffed it into the wound, and fled into Karwendel. The many blood, which he had lost, leaked into the rocks. Haymon followed him and reached him close to the hill Leitner Kogel. There Haymon slew Thyrsus. The last words of the giant Thyrsus should have been: \"Blood spray! Be good for man and beast! (Spritz Bluet!

The Club issued a press release claiming that the “object of this organization shall be to gain the co-operation of all loyal and progressive citizens in making the Magic City a city beautiful, to promote health and cleanliness, to advance present conditions, and to point to higher ideals.” The WCBC is significant in southwestern Virginia because it was an early woman's organization to push for political change and political power at a time when women had little or no power except by persuading men to change their minds.\n\nAt a time when women could not vote, the WCBC was established to improve the Roanoke city infrastructure. Started in 1906 and established in 1907, by 1913 it had 180 members, and was part of the Women's Clubs of America.\n\nThese women formed the Women's Civic Betterment Club in 1906, a civic club to have lasting effects on Roanoke's future. It was a move of \"responsible and responsive women of the city which would ultimately lead to the formation of a library, a juvenile court, a nursery school for the children of working mothers, and a local unit of the American Cancer Society. The maiden effort, however, was a plan for the city, only the fifth such ever done for any city. The club, led by Mrs. Lucian H. Cocke and Mrs. M.M. Caldwell, engaged John Nolen of Boston to develop a comprehensive plan for the development of Roanoke\".\n\nThe club is noted for its influence in city planning, public sanitation and engineering, cultural activities, and publications. \"While the city fathers had been successful in attracting investors and industry, they had done little to address the city’s cultural needs and improve its public spaces. The city mothers, however, knew that sanitation, safety, good schools, playgrounds and cultural opportunities were equally important to the city’s future. In 1906, they formed the Woman’s Civic Betterment Club to tackle these issues. (Sarah Butler’s mother, Willie Walker Caldwell, was one of the organizers of the WCBC.) They commissioned studies and lobbied city council for improvements – with mixed results.\"\n\nConcerned with the open sewers, abundant saloons and traffic problems, and rapid growth. In less than twenty years, from 1882 to 1900, Roanoke had grown from 669 citizens to 21,000. In 1907 the WCBC held a \"Great Fall Festival\" in order to raise money to hire a city planner. They were able to raise enough money to hire John Nolen. At the festival, they were able to raise the equivalent of $125,000 (they raised $5,000.00, or about $125,000.00 in 2017 dollars). This was enough to hire Nolen and two bacteriologists who were able to report on Roanoke's sanitation problems.\n\"On December 7, 1906, more than 100 women turned out for an urgently-called meeting in Roanoke Virginia, to discuss matters of the utmost importance. Two days later, the group met again and chartered the Roanoke Civic Betterment Club. Its mission: to ensure sanitary conditions in the city's market district, to provide a healthier community for their families, and to ensure quality education for their children.\"\n\nSome of the recommendations of John Nolen included planting trees along the streets; renaming the streets \"avenues\" for those going east-west, and \"Streets\" for those running north-south; creating parkways and playgrounds; dividing the city into four districts. In preparing the Melrose-Rugby Historic District in Roanoke, the effects of the Woman's Civic Betterment Club were appreciated. The Woman's Civic Betterment Club also worked with Nolen on the Riverland/Walnut Hills, Roanoke, Virginia neighborhood in promoting sanitation and overcrowding. At the turn of the century, Riverland housed railway workers and their families, and contributed to overcrowding and unhealthy tenement conditions.\n\nUnder contract, Nolen focused on the development of a civic center, which led to the construction of the Beaux-Arts style Municipal Building in 1915. He also made provisions for paved streets with gutters, sewage systems and other sanitation improvements in the residential neighborhoods.\n\nIn addition to producing the reports on civic improvement, the WCBC also hired speakers to promote and discuss the benefits of city improvement. Mr. J. Horace McFarland of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to come and speak to the public. During his talk, J. Horace McFarland, president of the American Civic Improvement Association, criticized several areas of Roanoke. Indeed, below his window at the hotel was an open \"pit of slime and filth\". The WCBC paid other speakers to come, including bacteriologists who criticized Roanoke's potential for typhoid, tuberculosis and polluted milk.\n\nWhen the Woman's Civic Betterment Club turned in Nolen's work, it was filed away by the city fathers. The city finally adopted Nolen's plans in the 1930s, and the extensive greenway system, riverside drive and Mill Mountain Park are part of that legacy of John Nolen and the Woman's Civic Betterment Club. \"While Nolen’s work deserves public recognition in Roanoke, the women of the WCBC had a greater role in shaping Roanoke into the city it is today. Roanoke did little to recognize the work of these women over one hundred years ago; perhaps now is the time to honor their contributions.\"\n\nWhile the Woman's Civic Betterment Club was not able to get all their goals accomplished, one goal for a public library was completed. Sarah Poage Caldwell Butler, married to William Wilson Samuel Butler and mother to Dr. M. Caldwell Butler, was trained in Library Science and had worked at the New York Public Library before her marriage. She worked with the WCBC to petition the Roanoke City Council to establish a library. \"Possibly believing they were presenting an insurmountable hurdle, council members told Butler that if she could raise $30,000, the city would contribute the rest. In one week’s time (appropriately, Library Week April 19–24), Butler raised $27,000!\" Sarah Butler also worked with Miss Lucy Addison to open a public library for the black neighborhoods in segregated Roanoke, and the Gainsboro Branch Public Library opened seven months later, on December 13, 1921. \"Sarah Butler died on December 2, 1983, at age 91. In a 1971 interview, she stated that getting a public library in Roanoke was her proudest civic achievement.\"\n\nWhile much of the cost of producing the first city plan came from the Great Fall Festival, additional money was needed. It was provided from the sales of the WCBC \"The Roanoke Cook Book, Favorite Recipes by Some of Roanoke's Good Housekeepers.\" Compiled by Mrs. Albert A. Stone from the WCBC members and published quickly in 1907, the 164 page book was a financial success. In addition to the recipes, the book also included advertising of local businesses and services to offset the costs of publication. \"Cook book sales helped pay for one of the first city plans ever drawn up; and a woman's civic club was the first organized body to arrange for the preparation of a city plan by a competent professional man.\"\n\nOver a hundred years later, the WCBC cook book is still referred to as an example of period cooking in Southwestern Virginia.\" The book says on page one: \"Purchasers may congratulate themselves on acquiring so much kitchen lore in clear and condensed form.\" The recipes are so unique, not necessarily in the ingredients, but in the descriptions and the \"flavor\" of the times that is given. I don't know about the taste of the food if you choose to follow the recipes, but I'm sure you will enjoy reading them.\" In addition to the cooking recipes, advice is also given on using some of the recommended dishes for treating medical conditions.\" The chicken broth, for example, is intended for sick children: \"If patient has a fever or is very ill, set the broth aside until cold, and then remove the grease, after which heat and serve.\"\n\nThe Woman's Civic Betterment Club was formed at a time when women could not vote, hold elected office, or influence civic government directly. Yet, within only a few years the citizens of Roanoke as seen marked improvement in the acquisition of land for public parks; school facilities; better city sanitation; abatement of dust and dirt nuisances on the streets. While they were unable to directly influence the city council, they were able to press for the first public library in Roanoke, and the purchase of parks, playgrounds, and pressed for a juvenile court. As a writer in 1912 said, \"Their cooperation in work for Roanoke's uplift and welfare has been of signal service to the community, and the part they have taken in the general scheme of development work is worthy of the highest praise.\"\nBetterment Club / Roanoke, Virginia 1910 (Roanoke: Hammond Printing Works, 1910), 5, in\nWCBC file, Virginia Room, Roanoke County Public Library.\n"}
