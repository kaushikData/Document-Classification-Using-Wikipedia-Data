It was organized by the \"Council of Industrial Design\", later to become the \"Design Council\".\n\nEven before the end of World War II, it was recognised that post-war reconstruction of manufacturing and international trade of exported goods would require the widespread acceptance of industrial design as part of future British manufacturing. Accordingly, the \"Council of Industrial Design\" was founded in 1944 by the Board of Trade, as one of the first quangos.\n\nIn September 1945, only a month after the end of the war, the Council announced a national exhibition of design \"in all the main range of consumer goods\" to be held the following year. This was the 1946 \"Britain Can Make It\" exhibition, organized largely at the instigation of the Council's director, S.C. Leslie. The design of the exhibition itself was co-ordinated by Chief Display Designer, James Gardner. The exhibition was held from September to November at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Part of the reason for choosing this venue was that many of the museum's main exhibits were still in their wartime evacuation storage, outside London. The venue was undamaged by bombing, empty and available, and itself in need of an attraction to restore its pre-war visitors.\n\nA major theme of the exhibition was didactic, in particular the display \"What Industrial Design Means\" which had been the first major commission for Misha Black and the Design Research Unit. Through Black's display, \"The Birth of an Egg Cup\" the role of the designer was presented as the crucial interchange between all the various aspects of design and production. Rather than merely show-casing goods on offer, the exhibition, and this display in particular, were a propagandist attempt to highlight the need to update British approaches to product design if manufacturing was to be successful in post-war competition. The audience was two-fold: the general public who were as yet unused to the notion of design as a distinct process, and also the existing manufacturers who clung to pre-war, if not Victorian, notions of how to run manufacturing industry.\n\nBlack's design for the display was deliberately eye-catching, from a 13 feet high plaster egg at its entrance, to the continually-operating plastics moulding press making three thousand egg cups per day during the exhibition. This use of a working model in particular was commented on in surveys of exhibition visitors carried out by Mass Observation.\n\nAnother Design Research Unit exhibit was their design and scale model for a railway coach, a double-decked third class sleeper. This represented two innovations for Britain, indicative of this egalitarian age: the first sleeper for third class rather than first, and also the technical development of fitting two levels into the restricted British loading gauge by the use of a well car.\n\nA popular reaction in the press was to term it, \"Britain Can't Have It\" as the country was still in the grip of wartime Austerity measures and the goods on display were intended for export. Reactions of those attending the exhibition were varied between the general public, the design intelligentsia and the manufacturers. Critics', such as John Gloag's, reactions were highly positive, congratulating the exhibition organisers both on the intellectual quality of their exhibition and also for the achievement of producing it during such a time of austerity. The public's reaction was less sophisticated, but still positive. Their view was generally that of simply wanting products in the shops that they could actually buy. The only real criticisms came from established manufacturers who largely failed to appreciate the exhibition's attempt to emphasise design and who still judged it as a simple shop-window display, of their same pre-war products.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1075003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1075003", "title": "Camden Society", "text": "Camden Society\n\nThe Camden Society was a text publication society founded in London in 1838 to publish early historical and literary materials, both unpublished manuscripts and new editions of rare printed books. It was named after the 16th-century antiquary and historian William Camden. In 1897 it merged with the Royal Historical Society, which continues to publish texts in what are now known as the Camden Series.\n\nThe formation of the Camden Society in 1838 was the initiative of Thomas Wright, John Gough Nichols, and John Bruce. It was modelled on the Surtees Society (founded in 1834 to publish materials relating to the history of northern England), of which Nichols had been the first treasurer. Other founder members included Thomas Amyot, Thomas Crofton Croker, Sir Frederic Madden, John Payne Collier, and Rev. Joseph Hunter. Lord Francis Egerton served as the first President.\n\nFor an annual subscription (originally £1 per year), members received the Society's publications, roughly two volumes per year. The original membership was 500. In 1838, 20% of members were clergymen, 9% held legal qualifications, and 36% were Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Membership reached a peak of 1250 in 1845, and began to decline thereafter. By the 1880s, the Camden Society was experiencing financial problems, brought about in part by a project to create a general index to its first 100 volumes. On 2 May 1897 it was amalgamated with (or effectively absorbed into) the Royal Historical Society. \n\nThe Society published some works jointly with the Early English Text Society.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1872 the Society published 105 volumes in its first series (now sometimes known as the Old Series); followed by a further 56 volumes in its second series (known as the New Series), which appeared between 1871 and 1896. Following the merger with the Royal Historical Society, the joint society issued another 6 volumes in the New Series, of which the last, volume 62, appeared in 1901. A fresh series was then begun, published under the Royal Historical Society imprint, but named the Camden Third Series, in which 94 volumes appeared between 1900 and 1963. A further 44 volumes were published between 1969 and 1993 in the Camden Fourth Series; and the Camden Fifth Series, which began publication in 1993, had reached volume 53 by 2017, and remains in progress. The majority of volumes have contained book-length texts (occasionally running into multiple volumes), or thematic groups of shorter texts; but they have also from time to time – both in the two original Camden Society series and in the three RHS Camden Series – been made up of two or more disparate shorter texts, under the series title \"Camden Miscellany\". A total of 36 Miscellany volumes had appeared by 2015. \n\nVolumes are now published for the RHS by Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40097", "title": "Collecting", "text": "Collecting\n\nThe hobby of collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining items that are of interest to an individual \"collector\". Collections differ in a wide variety of respects, most obviously in the nature and scope of the objects contained, but also in purpose, presentation, and so forth. The range of possible subjects for a collection is practically unlimited, and collectors have realised a vast number of these possibilities in practice, although some are much more popular than others.\n\nIn collections of manufactured items, the objects may be antique or simply collectable. Antiques are collectable items at least 100 years old, while other collectables are arbitrarily recent. The word \"vintage\" describes relatively old collectables that are not yet antiques. Previously commonplace items that are now rare are called ephemera.\n\nCollecting is a childhood hobby for some people, but for others a lifelong pursuit or something started in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older. Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning how to build a collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.\n\nThe most obvious way to categorise collections is by the type of objects collected. Most collections are of manufactured commercial items, but natural objects such as birds' eggs, butterflies, rocks, and seashells can also be the subject of a collection. For some collectors, the criterion for inclusion might not be the type of object but some incidental property such as the identity of its original owner.\n\nSome collectors are generalists with very broad criteria for inclusion, while others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest. Some collectors accumulate arbitrarily many objects that meet the thematic and quality requirements of their collection, others—called \"completists\" or \"completionists\"—aim to acquire all items in a well-defined set that can in principle be completed, and others seek a limited number of items per category (e.g. one representative item per year of manufacture or place of purchase). The monetary value of objects is important to some collectors but irrelevant to others. Some collectors maintain objects in pristine condition, while others use the items they collect.\n\nAfter a collectable has been purchased, its retail price no longer applies and its value is linked to what is called the secondary market. There is no secondary market for an item unless someone is willing to buy it, and an object's value is whatever the buyer is willing to pay. Depending on age, condition, supply, demand, and other factors, individuals, auctioneers, and secondary retailers may sell a collectable for either more or less than what they originally paid for it. A \"price guide\" is a resource such as a book or website that lists typical selling prices.\n\nProducts often become more valuable with age. The term \"antique\" generally refers to manufactured items made over 100 years ago, although in some fields, such as antique cars, the time frame is less stringent. For antique furniture, the limit has traditionally been set in the 1830s. Collectors and dealers may use the word \"vintage\" to describe older collectables that are too young to be called antiques, including Art Deco and Art Nouveau items, Carnival and Depression glass, etc. Items which were once everyday objects but may now be collectable, as almost all examples produced have been destroyed or discarded, are called \"ephemera\".\n\nPsychological factors can play a role in both the motivation for keeping a collection and the impact it has on the collector's life. These factors can be positive or negative.\n\nThe hobby of collecting often goes hand-in-hand with an interest in the objects collected and what they represent, for example collecting postcards may reflect an interest in different places and cultures. For this reason, collecting can have educational benefits, and some collectors even become experts in their field.\n\nMaintaining a collection can be a relaxing activity that counteracts the stress of life, while providing a purposeful pursuit which prevents boredom. The hobby can lead to social connections between people with similar interests and the development of new friendships, it has also been shown to be particularly common among academics. \n\nCollecting for most people is a choice, but for some it can be a compulsion, sharing characteristics with obsessive hoarding. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.\n\nIt has been speculated that the widespread appeal of collecting is connected to the hunting and gathering that was once necessary for human survival. Collecting is also associated with memory by association and the need for the human brain to catalogue and organise information and give meaning to ones actions.\n\nCollecting is a practice with a very old cultural history. In Mesopotamia, collecting practices have been noted among royalty and elites as far back as the third millennium, B.C.E. The Egyptian Ptolemaic dynasty collected books from all over the known world at the Library of Alexandria. The Medici family, in Renaissance Florence, made the first effort to collect art by private patronage, this way artists could be free for the first time from the money given by the Church and Kings; this citizenship tradition continues today with the work of private art collectors. Many of the world's popular museums—from the Metropolitan in New York City to the Thyssen in Madrid or the Franz Mayer in Mexico City—have collections formed by the generous collectors that donated them to be seen by the general public.\n\nThe collecting hobby is a modern descendant of the \"cabinet of curiosities\" which was common among scholars with the means and opportunities to acquire unusual items from the 16th century onwards. Planned collecting of ephemeral publications goes back at least to George Thomason in the reign of Charles I and Samuel Pepys in that of Charles II. Collecting engravings and other prints by those whose means did not allow them to buy original works of art also goes back many centuries. The progress in 18th-century Paris of collecting both works of art and of \"curiosité\", dimly echoed in the English \"curios\", and the origins in Paris, Amsterdam and London of the modern art market have been increasingly well documented and studied since the mid-19th century.\n\nThe involvement of larger numbers of people in collecting activities comes with the prosperity and increased leisure for some in the later 19th century in industrial countries. That is when collecting such items as antique china, furniture and decorative items from oriental countries becomes established. The first price guide was the Stanley Gibbons catalogue issued in November 1865.\n\nThe Internet offers many resources to any collector: personal sites presenting one's collection, online collectable catalogs, dealer/shops websites displaying their merchandise, Internet trading platforms, collector clubs, autograph club, collector forums and collector mailing lists.\n\n\n\n"}

In this picture-dense format, the authors must squeeze their words in edgewise. Each book of this encyclopaedic collection is composed of a monograph and focuses on a particular topic, the whole series covers all areas of human knowledge and experience, such as archaeology, art, culture, civilisation, history, music, religion, science, et cetera. There are 502 expert authors who have written for the collection. They usually use timelines and historical perspective to describe a subject, for example, the 26 title (UK ed. \"The Sky: Order and Chaos\"), which narrated in chronological order to present the varied subjects relating to the sky above and peoples' perception of it, through historical vision of cultural, social and religious aspects. Almost all the titles follow the same method, therefore, history is the essential element of perspective for this work.\n\nThe captions for illustrations must be informative, they should not duplicate information in the body text, nor do they interrupt the narrative thread. Researchers and academics must adhere to the constraints of a mainstream collection. Apart from obvious analytical abilities, authors are asked to write quality text and a sensitivity to illustration. A \"Découvertes Gallimard\" is not a book of authorship, the author is only one of the many speakers. Bruno Blasselle, director of the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal, author of two volumes of (\"History of the Book\", № 321 and № 363), and co-author of the 88 title , explains his experience of working for the collection: \"For an author, to write a \"Découvertes\" title is to be trapped, to put oneself in a situation of being obliged to go beyond his/her own formulation.\"\nThe cover design is one of the specificities. The old covers are glossy with black background illustrated in colour, the newer covers are matt-laminated rather than glossy, but more colourful, with different colour codes according to the areas. It differs from other documentary books by its visual: a full-size image, with its framing and the power of figurative elements, also an image that is well-matched to inside page layout. And there is always a tiny image that suits the theme to illustrate the spine. The visual identity is strong, one can even easily recognise different language editions of \"Découvertes\" books. However, there are some exceptions, for instance, the Russian publisher AST adopted a completely different cover design for their (\"Discovery\") collection.\nEach title in the collection has around 200 pages with approximately 120–200 illustrations printed in four, five, six, or seven colours, both matte and glitter, and sometimes even gold, as in the 39 title , the metallic gold heightens Carl Otto Czeschka's illustrations from . Each book opens with 8–10 full-page illustrations or photographs, prefaced by a pull-quote on the inside front cove, which Thames & Hudson director Jamie Camplin calls it a \"cinema-influenced trailer\" (called in French). For the 96 title , this book opens with a succession of reproductions of Champollion's manuscript ; in (№ 158), the reader is greeted by a series of bronze masks and hoary faces carved in stone; the \"trailer\" for (№ 3) evokes the tragic launch of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" in 1986; while that of (№ 62) presents the Eiffel Tower at every stage of its construction.\nThe novelty lies in the subtle orchestration of the text and the illustration, where successive sequences, inserts and foldouts overlapping in double pages. According to the subjects, the body (mentioned as in French) is structured into three to eight chapters. Each chapter is built using journalistic methods, with a lead paragraph and intertitle. The is punctuated by double-page spreads of images, known as inserts, sort of a halt for pictures. For the 124 title (\"Fear of Wolves\"), 2 double-page spreads of reproductions of Gustave Doré's engravings to illustrate \"Little Red Riding Hood\". These books benefit a lot from journalistic and cinematographic techniques, some titles include panoramic foldouts, kind of projection on big screen. Two foldouts in the 16 title , one showing Léon Jaussely's reconstruction of the forum of Pompeii, the other representing the actual condition of the theatre quarter in 1859 by using Paul-Émile Bonnet's drawings, both in a panoramic view. In the 369 title (\"The Paper: A Daily Adventure\"), through a partnership with paper companies, there are even three luxurious foldouts that all made on different papers from Arjo Wiggins, presenting one of the 17 century watercolours on the traditional manufacture of Chinese paper; the other of the engravings and drawings by Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci; the third depicts today's paper production line with its different machines.\n\nAt the back of each book is the \"Documents\" section ( in French), unlike the , this part is always printed in black and white. It works as an anthology, provides more detailed documentary information and historical records. This includes dossiers made jointly by the author and the publisher, with lead paragraph to link texts and short captions for each dossier. According to the works, the annexes conclude \"Documents\" section with a chronology, an index, a filmography, a discography, or a bibliography. The sources of all images are always provided in the \"List of Illustrations\" ( in French) as well as photo credits, dedicated to those who want to do further research. \"Découvertes\" also stands out for its attention to detail. On the choice of typeface, for example, Trump Mediaeval is used for common text, Barnattan for intertitles, Zapf Dingbats for guillemets, italic for captions with an initial and the last line is underlined, et cetera. The French editions are printed by Kapp Lahure Jombart in Évreux, while the Italian printer Gianni Stavro, who has largely contributed to the elaboration of new techniques used in the collection, retains his position as collaborator for international reissues and coeditions. The bindings are solid, sewn and not glued. Gallimard promised readers \"the most beautiful pocket collection in the world\" ().\n\nThe collection formerly consisted of 18 series—, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and —which have been abandoned, it is now organised around 7 major areas: , , , , , and .\n\nIn the 4 century AD, the Christian emperor Theodosius I decreed the closure of all the pagan temples in the Empire. Unexpected consequence: the hieroglyphic writing, still alive until then, abruptly stopped being understood. The Pharaonic Egypt fell into oblivion. The expedition of Bonaparte in 1798 and the magnificent aroused in Europe a craze for the monuments and the art of this ancient civilisation. The deciphering of hieroglyphs by young Champollion in 1822 marks the birth of Egyptology.\n\nFrom the transport of the Luxor Obelisk on the Place de la Concorde to the fabulous discovery of Tutankhamun's treasures, Jean Vercoutter recounts the history of rediscovery of ancient Egypt in this small volume— (lit. \"In Search of Forgotten Egypt\"; English edition: \"The Search for Ancient Egypt\")—which inaugurated the collection \"Découvertes Gallimard\" in 1986. It is part of the series; in other words, the book explaining the whole history of Egyptology—its birth and growth, with all the important figures in this history—of the \"search for forgotten Egypt\", the study of archaeological sites, artefacts and documents discovered in Egypt in the 18 and 19 centuries. It's almost like a \"graphic novel\", replete with colour plates. There are seven chapters:\n\nThe following \"Documents\" section containing a compilation of excerpts which is divided into 19 parts, taken from texts by Jean Tulard on Napoléon's expedition in Egypt, Chateaubriand (\"\"), Flaubert (), Maxime Du Camp (), Fromentin (), Mark Twain (\"The Innocents Abroad\"), Pierre Loti (), Mariette (); and, besides these big names, there are texts by modern Egyptologists such as Claude Traunecker, Vercoutter himself on the rescue of Abu Simbel temples and Jean-Claude Golvin (about the restoration works at Karnak), among others. The other documents recount the transport of Egyptian obelisks to Europe, the inauguration of the Suez Canal, the mummy of Ramesses II under attack by fungi, the renewed attempts to discover the secret of the Great Pyramid, the main works of art of the Egyptian collection at Louvre Museum, etc. The final document also includes references to comic books where Egypt is the theme (\"Asterix\", \"Tintin\" …). The book closes with a list of Ancient Egyptian deities (with images and explanations), complete chronology of Ancient Egyptian history (from 6000 BC to 639 AD), further reading, list of illustrations and an index.\n\nIn his book review, the Portuguese Egyptologist praised the selection of illustrations for this work: \"[…] this beautiful volume is valued by the excellent selection of images that lavishly accompanies the text\", some of the illustrations belong to classic works from the early days of Egyptology, such as the , Lepsius's , David Roberts's \"Egypt and Nubia\", among others. De Araújo also notes the erroneous spelling for the divine name by using \"Khourou\" instead of (in English: Khonsu) when mentioning the temple of this lunar deity at Karnak (); the name of the pharaoh of the 12th dynasty—Amenemhat I—is wrongly written \"Amenhemat\" (), due to failure of revision; and the inexplicable absence of the famous English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, who introduced new methods of prospecting and registering the findings in archaeological research; and his contemporaries Adolf Erman and George Andrew Reisner are also being omitted.\n\nThis work was one of the bestsellers in France, has sold more than 500,000 copies worldwide as of 2001, and received a literary prize from the Fondation de France in 1987. It has been translated into American and British English, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, and reprinted several times. The first edition has 223 pages, a new edition was released in 2007, has only 160 pages. The electronic form for iPad of this book came out in 2012, including a .\n\nThe \"Découvertes Gallimard\" collection was born in the Gallimard Jeunesse, based on an idea by Pierre Marchand after the publications of two pocket collections: \"Découvertes Cadet\" in 1983 and \"Découvertes Benjamin\" in 1984. These three Découvertes collections cater to three levels: grades 4 to 6 (\"Découvertes Benjamin\"), grades 7 to 9 (\"Découvertes Cadet\"), and grades 10 and up (\"Découvertes Gallimard\"). This pocket encyclopaedia initially named (\"The Paths of Knowledge\"), Pierre Marchand already had the idea when he entered Gallimard in 1972, as he explains: \"I have invested fourteen years of my professional life in this collection. Thanks to the success of that we were able to embark on this adventure […] For the first time, genuine encyclopaedias in pocket format […] Our bet is that once you open the book, no matter what subject you read or which page you are on, you can no longer close it.\" Françoise Balibar, Jean-Pierre Maury, Jean-Pierre Verdet, Marc Meunier-Thouret and some others were the first to experience this pharaonic project that would await the arrival of Élisabeth de Farcy and Paule du Bouchet, in 1981, for truly to take shape. To produce encyclopaedias in pocket format and fully illustrated in colours, in that time, many judged such an editorial project insane. However, the collection was still created in 1986 and directed by Élisabeth de Farcy. She chose the authors and organised iconographic campaigns, several editors and iconographers were then gathered, copious illustrations were extracted from heritage resources. Élisabeth explained in an interview with : \"The image should occupy a central place, as in a work of art.\" The authors were skeptical about this project at first, even contemptuous, but they are eventually fascinated by the collection. Some have even authored several works, such as Françoise Cachin, curator of the Musée d'Orsay, author of three books – (№ 49), (№ 108), (№ 203); or Jean-Pierre Maury, who wrote four titles – (№ 10), (№ 52), (№ 91) and (№ 195).\n\nA preview edition, or \"zero edition\" ( in French) was sent to 500 booksellers during the summer of 1986, and officially released in November. The first twelve titles, twenty-five thousand copies of each volume were printed. \"We've never seen so many things between the first and last pages of a book\" is the slogan proposed by Pascal Manry's advertising agency for the launch of the collection. Without market research at the start, Pierre Marchand, a self-taught man, explained on the TV programme \"\": \"This project was as old as my thirst for knowledge. No doubt it is necessary to be precisely self-taught to sense the importance of an encyclopaedia. We must have been forced to build our own culture, to seek reliable references, to make clear statements. To conceive \"Découvertes\", I didn't need market research, surveys or tests. Right from the start, I wanted to give the public the books I needed.\" Although the \"Découvertes\" was constituted for youth at the beginning, it was launched for the general adult public in 1986. The collection then had a rapid-growth, 105 titles (volumes) appeared in five years. It acrossed the borders first time with the Spanish co-publisher in 1989, and 19 countries will finally be associated with it. In 1992, after 151 titles have been published, Gallimard showed interest in the work on mermaid and Siren () by , a Belgian Dutch-language writer. Nevertheless, the Parisian publishing house hesitated: \"Interesting subject, but how can you illustrate that?\" Then De Donder showed a list of about one thousand images that he gathered over years, Gallimard was convinced and made him the first non-French-language author in this collection.\n\nThe heydays of the collection were at the turn of the 1990s, the authors are mainly recruited from academics and curators. Numerous monographs of artists were often published on the occasions of major exhibitions, with a predilection for painters and musicians. Such as the 165 title was released for the exhibition \"Henri Matisse 1904–1917\" at the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1993; and Geneviève Haroche-Bouzinac's \"Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun\" (from \"Hors série\") was on sale at the exhibit of Vigée Le Brun's paintings in New York City at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Or reactivity in relation to current events, for instance, the 161 title was published in 1992 for the release of Francis Coppola's \"Dracula\" in the same year; and (№ 184) for the release of the French film \"Germinal\"; (№ 222) for the bicentennial of the CNAM; (№ 511) was on sale on the occasion of \"Yves Saint Laurent retrospective\" at the Petit Palais in 2010. Some works were launched within an extremely limited time frame, such as (№ 60), for the inauguration of the Louvre Pyramid in 1989; and (№ 77) for the Opéra Bastille, in 1990, both completed in six to eight weeks instead of the usual two or three months. Alongside many works dictated by current events, there are also a number of favourites, sometimes strange, such as a book devoted to red hair (№ 338 – ), which is unusual in this type of collection. Some subjects can be more difficult to sell but considered necessary, such as the perspective (№ 138 – ), images of human body (№ 185 – ) and mannerism (№ 457 – ). But in recent years, there were more monographs on the memory of places and large institutions instead of artists, as well as various sociological and religious aspects, for instance, a book on the history of New York City by Jerome Charyn, which is translated and adapted from his English work \"Metropolis: New York as Myth, Marketplace, and Magical Land\" (№ 204 – ); volumes on homosexuality (№ 417 – ) and drugs (№ 423 – ); titles about Marian devotions and apparition (№ 401 – & № 524 – ). And also numerous volumes devoted to writers, for example, the 381 title . Difficult subjects were frequently in demand, possibly because there was less competition. Thus a book on the Cistercian monks (№ 95 – ) was one of the bestsellers in 1990. While the others like (№ 34, about gold rush) or (№ 45, about pirates) are presumably subjects more common and popular, were relative failures. Generally, the most popular titles are those from and series, the first title and the 24 title (both in series) remain two of the bestsellers. As of 2001, the former would have sold more than five hundred thousand copies worldwide. As for the series, there are only 4 most favoured titles: (№ 81), (№ 83), (№ 133) and (№ 164). Competition has emerged as early as in the middle of the 1990s, circulation and novelties have been decreased gradually, but partially offset by another original collection , which is like a spin-off.\n\nToday, there are about fifteen old titles from the collection that are updated every year according to the current cultural and scientific research. History is the main point of \"Découvertes\". It is completed by archaeology, art history and science, richly accompanied by unpublished illustrations from ancient times to our days. Thus it forms a solid editorial base. On 25 March 1994, \"Découvertes Gallimard\" celebrated its publication of 200 title at the Musée national des Monuments Français. The collection underwent two successive redesigns, one in September 1998 (№ 359 – ) for exterior model (colour of book's back-cover, more explicit signage), and the other in March 2000 (№ 390 – ) for interior page layout. The \"Documents\" section of those re-editions is shortened, the average pagination of each volume decreases. The collection, which was too soon associated with a zapping visual culture, reaffirmed its first purpose: the image does not take precedence over the text, but combined with text to animate and enrich the reading. These books benefit from the latest technologies, with their mockups are all made using DTP now. Since the X Press software was only released in 1987, the first 30 titles were made in a traditional way, with phototypesetting. The current price of a \"Découvertes\" book is between 8.40 and 15.90 euros (£7.95 in UK, $12.95–$14.95 in US and $19.95 in Canada) according to its category and number of pages, this is considered an extremely low price for a book of this quality.\n\"Découvertes Gallimard\" has been translated into 19 languages (in fact currently more than 20 languages, see Appendix), including Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, et cetera. \"This inexpensive pocket encyclopaedia embodies its humanistic dream: to make the most advanced state of knowledge available to everyone. Diderot and D'Alembert would not have denied it…\", notes Hedwige Pasquet, current director of Gallimard Jeunesse. According to \"\", these \"French-style documentaries\" () have sold over twenty million copies worldwide as of 1999, with recently emerging markets in the Eastern Europe and Asia, especially in Russia, about 100 titles have been published within four years. In order to remedy the problems of international proprietaries and reproduction rights of works of art, the co-publishers firstly define a number of titles, then they choose according to their own editorial line, and share the high cost of worldwide photographic rights. Therefore, Harry N. Abrams in the United States chose more titles about traditional cultural subjects, while in Japan, the publisher prefers original titles, such as (lit. \"The Witches: Fiancées of Satan\") by . from Madrid would be the first one among 's international co-publishers since 1989, the first 12 titles for the Spanish collection were released in the same year. In Italy, the publisher Electa/Gallimard produced 128 titles within seven years; in Japan, the 166 title of their collection (\"Rediscovery of Knowledge\") has been published in early 2017. In addition, foreign editions are usually co-printed to amortise fees and support countries with small circulation.\n\nIn addition to these foreign co-editions, \"Découvertes Gallimard\" has also been involved in institutional partnerships for several years, notably the one held since 1989 with the Réunion des Musées Nationaux (RMN): thirty-two titles have been released (as of 2001), plus a title in English dedicated to Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot (№ 277 – \"Corot: Extraordinary landscapes\"), Impressionism box set and four books in the \"Hors série\". The principle of these co-editions is based on a sharing of costs and revenues, the RMN brings its knowledge of museums and distribution network, while the publisher brings its editorial competence. When a title is linked to an exhibition, it generates a lot of additional sales through the RMN. Other partnerships with public or private companies, such as the CEA (№ 282 – ), Crédit Mutuel (№ 379 – ), L'Oréal (№ 405 – ), paper industries (№ 369 – ), et cetera. The partner is sometimes explicitly indicated in the \"acknowledgments\" (№ 379), but it is most often mentioned equivocally (№ 405), even modestly kept in silence (№ 389 – ).\n\nDocumentary-style book publishing has been in decline in France for several years, market saturation is one of the causes, competition from other medias is another, especially from the internet. Despite its excellent image to the public, \"Découvertes Gallimard\" is also concerned by this disaffection. It remains an indisputable success internationally, but in France, the sales are eroding. The number of new productions decreases and also the prints. On 1 March 1999, the director of Gallimard Jeunesse and creator of \"Découvertes\", Pierre Marchand, after working for 27 years at Gallimard, left to become a creative director at Hachette. This was no doubt a big loss to the collection, but with more than 10 years of experience and a rich fund created over years, \"Découvertes\" finally surpassed the difficulties. The end of 2006 is marked by the celebration of 's 20 anniversary and the publication of its 500 title . On this occasion, a website was specially created for the collection, which is now the official website \"<nowiki>http://www.decouvertes-gallimard.fr</nowiki>\". On the occasion of Éditions Gallimard's centennial in 2011, \"Découvertes Gallimard\" launched its first digital book for iPad: the 569 title (\"Gallimard: A Publisher at Work\") by .\n\nImage is the essential part to \"Découvertes Gallimard\", the collection drew much inspiration from magazine layout designs. Full colour pictures, documentary illustrations, archival photographs, historical maps occupy a central place in this work, as said Pierre Marchand himself: \"the language of images is a universal language\". But in the 1980s, DTP and photo digitisation did not exist, the sophisticated mockups were entirely handmade and the iconographers ran around museums, libraries, painting galleries and other agencies to look for documents. Today, the technology has simplified all these procedures but the difficulties are elsewhere, the status of the image is increasingly complex.\n\nContemporary subjects often generate much higher costs since the publisher is obliged to work with photographic agencies. In the choice of documents, priority is given to those original, unpublished images. Besides, the iconographers of \"Découvertes\" have some exceptional documents, such as English explorer Frederick Catherwood's original drawings of Maya ruins decorate the 20 title .\n\nIt's not difficult to illustrate subjects like arts, civilisations, archaeology... But when it comes to a theme like \"pain\" (№ 370 – ) or \"sustainable development\" (№ 495 – ), it becomes more delicate. The question is how to avoid repetitiveness or the flatly illustrative image, then the solution lies in a broadening field, through the use of historical documents, works of art and film stills.\n\nThe aestheticisation of postmodern everyday life, according to sociologists Michel Maffesoli and Mike Featherstone, it seems to spring from two parallel movements rooted in modernity, the so-called \"dual postmodern aestheticisation movement\": first an aesthetic hedonism (Maffesoli) and second the trivialisation of art (Featherstone). The second movement is the result of the de-academisation and de-institutionalisation of art, thus \"art is part of everyday life\". \"Découvertes Gallimard\" is considered an example of 'art as part of everyday life' within this study.\n\nPierre Marchand, Head of Gallimard Jeunesse who created the new kind of artistic encyclopaedia with a dynamic layout, that would be as much a magazine as an encyclopaedia. It has been described by a Gallimard employee that Découvertes \"seduces like a magazine but has the duration of a book\", kind of an objectified and specialised luxury magazine. A lot of work and research is done on the reproduction of images and the choice of illustrations, often unpublished documents like antique engravings, old photos, on all types of themes. In this collection, all books share the same concept as to layout and looks, each book itself could become a work of art rather than only its substitute. It is coupled with up-to-date editing equipment, organisational innovations and a constant pursuit of higher printing quality at lower cost. And a more friendship than business relation between Marchand and the Italian printer Gianni Stavro has advanced the state of the art in printing. The suppliers of Découvertes are supposed to cooperate between themselves, \"for instance, the French printer had a problem concerning the pigments, so the Italian printer invited him over to explain how he could solve the problem\", explained by a Gallimard employee.\n\nPierre Marchand might not be an \"Artistic Master\", but he is almost considered as such by his employees. ' staff work like a team, where everybody is concerned with everything at the same time. They share the same culture and values, their office is intentionally built like a vessel, with Marchand as 'captain' on the bridge, and anyone, at any time, is free to contribute with his/her own ideas about authors, pictures, front covers, …, and becomes leader of a project.\n\n\nThe \"Hors série\" books are often coupled with exhibitions and it works well. While the other attempts to diversify the collection have often resulted in resounding commercial failures: the \"Albums\" and \"Texto\". Despite an interesting concept: the use of still images from Gaumont archives for \"\", this series has had mixed success.\n\nFrench weekly magazine \"Télérama\" praised \"Découvertes Gallimard\", describing the work as \"they borrow suspense from the cinema, have efficiency of the journalism, literary temperament is their charm, and art is their beauty\". \"New York\" magazine described it \"a lively interweaving of simple text and clever pictures\". German literary scholar and historian wrote an article for \"Die Zeit\", reviewed the collection is an \"adventure stands for surprise, excitement and amusement. Boredom is already prevented by the curiosity of vivid illustrations which are accompanied by detailed explanations\". Rick Poynor wrote in \"Eye\" magazine that the collection \"is one of the great projects of contemporary popular publishing\". Raleigh Trevelyan's article in \"The New York Times\" mentioned \"D-Day and the Invasion of Normandy\" from \"Abrams Discoveries\" series, said \"all volumes in the \"Discoveries\" series are ingeniously designed\". Art critic John Russell considered these books contain unique information, such as Aelian's authority on the musicality of the elephant or the precise look of Halley's Comet as it was depicted in 1835. In an article from the Argentine newspaper \"La Nación\", Eduardo Gudiño Kieffer said, \"The books are excellent assistants for intellectuals, writers, journalists and students of different aspects of the culture […] they contain accurate and pithy information […] They obtain a cognitive 'duration' difficult to achieve in the mediatic fugacity.\" The Spanish newspaper \"El País\": \"Those books combine an important 'Documents' section with an original thematic concept. It's obviously a popularised, educational work, but popularisation of very good level.\" The Brazilian newspapers – \"Folha de S.Paulo\": \"What is most striking in the collection, however, is not the eclecticism or the unusual themes—usually developed by French experts—but the format and the iconographic content thereof.\"; \"\": \"almost like a luxury comic magazine and of exquisite taste\".\n\nAccording to French magazine \"L'Expansion\", some other positive reviews including \"The Mail on Sunday\": \"Revolutionary… Literally spectacular…\"; \"The Times\": \"A brand-new and daring collection\"; \"Die Zeit\": \"As soon as you open these handy books, you can not get away from them anymore\"; \"The New York Times Book Review\": \"A collection that recalls nineteenth-century encyclopaedias, where intelligence went hand in hand with curiosity\". The French news magazine \"L'Express\": \"Real monographs, published as art books, offered in pocket format and sold at a pocket price […] \"Découvertes\" changed the face of encyclopaedism and art book, adapting the book to the era of 'zapping'.\" '—a French bimonthly journal—calls the collection a \"classic\". It is also regarded by '—a French weekly magazine—as one of six collections that have marked the history of French publishing.\n\nDespite all the favours to its quality and attractive visual design, the collection suffers from a problem of identity in bookshops: where to put these books? With books for youth or books for adults? As pocket books or human science documentary books? And opt for a thematic scattering on the shelves. Many booksellers renounce the displays that were exclusively reserved for \"Découvertes\" due to high competition. All the more so because a rather tight inventory management at Gallimard, the complete titles are never available at the same time, which does not appreciate the customers. The problem of identification is also latent in print media, the journalists, even if they are personally delighted to receive the new titles from a press agent, would not be too enthusiastic about presenting a simple pocket book in their articles, even if it's a brand new title and not a reprint.\n\n\"Découvertes\" books have been selectively translated into English, published by Thames & Hudson in United Kingdom under the title New Horizons series, which launched its first titles in 1992 with the slogan, \"the expanding universe between two covers\". According to Thames & Hudson director Jamie Camplin, the remit is to \"educate in an entertaining way\".\n\nPaul Gottlieb, former director and editor in chief of the New York-based publisher Abrams Books (then called Harry N. Abrams), discovered Pierre Marchand's \"Découvertes\" collection at the Gallimard stand during the Bologna Book Fair in 1991, which he called \"a dazzling array of books\" and an \"imaginative combination of text and pictures in a magnificently produced series of paperback books\". He began to negotiate for English language translation. The collection was eventually titled Abrams Discoveries series by the U.S. publisher. They began to publish in the spring of 1992, and more than 100 titles were produced.\n\nThese two publishers share the translation costs, the American edition is then re-edited to take into account English spelling, or vice versa. Unlike the original French edition which each volume has a number on the book's spine, the American and British editions are not put into numerical order. UK edition's book spines have titles in white with black background, while the more Gallimard-style US edition has titles in colour and sometimes with decorative features, like an for \"Cleopatra: The Life and Death of a Pharaoh\" and a for \"Heraldry: An Introductin to a Noble Tradition\". As for the \"Documents\" section, though some co-publishers print the entire French version, Thames & Hudson reformulates this part, tailoring the material to suit the nuances of the UK market.\n\nIn 1997, \"Découvertes Gallimard\" started its documentary film adaptations. The project is a co-production of Arte France and Trans Europe Film, in collaboration with Éditions Gallimard. These 52-minute films are produced as episodes for Arte TV documentary series \"The Human Adventure\", most of them are directed by Jean-Claude Lubtchansky.\n\nList of documentary films:\nList of different language editions of \"Découvertes Gallimard\".\n\n"}

It is freely accessible and users are able to search, access, and archive full-text documents\n\nE-LIS is based on the philosophy and principles of open source software whereby people from all over the world co-operate in building freely-licensed software. Its aim is to further the open access philosophy by making full text Library and Information Science documents visible, accessible, harvestable, searchable, and usable by any potential user with access to the Internet.\n\nThe objectives of the E-LIS are:\n\n\nE-LIS is established, managed and maintained by an international team of 73 librarians and information scientists from 47 countries and support for 22 languages. The development of an international Library and Information Science network has been stimulated by the extension of the open access concept to LIS works and facilitated by the dissemination of material within the LIS community. \n\nThe editorial work is performed under the management of an executive board that drives the policies, alliances, new actions, collaborations and any topic that is of interest to E-LIS. The executive board is made up of two chief executives, two representatives of the editorial team, two representatives of CIEPI - International Centre for Research in Information Strategy and Development -which is the association created by E-LIS members for representing institutionally the E-LIS interest as a legal entity - and two technical representatives that have deep technical experience on document repositories. In addition to this structure, the advisory board appointed to advise the executive board is formed by institutions and people that support E-LIS.\n\nThere are currently 8,000 authors represented in E-LIS. It is possible to deposit works in any language, although abstracts and keywords must be included in English, in addition to abstracts and keywords in the original language of the document. In a broad sense, any document related to LIS that is electronically available, can be submitted to the archive in PDF or HTML. The types of user are: librarians, academics, archivists, information management specialists from: academic libraries, archives, government libraries, health libraries, information centres, museums, national libraries, private libraries, public libraries, school libraries or universities.\n\nE-LIS provides features for editors and users including automatic alerts for editors, full metadata display of metadata records, full-text search, browsing by user, a counter in the homepage as well as statistics.\n\nA strength of the repository is the national editors from 47 countries, carrying out the quality control of the metadata. Each editor approves documents of their own country and coordinates the actions on the promotion of E-LIS in their country. All the editors share this common vision and mission, while contributing to E-LIS with their own experience and competence. \n\nE-LIS deals with each country's specific issues to decide the best solution for technical and non-technical barriers so that international visibility can be promoted whilst national interests are served. International co-operation can facilitate debate on current issues.\n\nCopyright is one of the key issues for E-LIS. The submission of documents and their accessibility is not an infringement of copyright. All work in E-LIS remains property of the author. If the document is a preprint, the process is quite straightforward because there are no limits concerning copyright: the author holds the exclusive copyright for the pre-refereed preprints. For the refereed postprint, the issue becomes more complex. The author might have given the rights to, for instance, a publisher. The right to self-archive the refereed postprint is a legal matter because the copyright transfer agreement applies to the text. Most journals permit self-archiving, but it depends on the publisher's copyright policy. Authors can also deposit the postprint inside the archive with restricted access. Some publishers have stated that they grant these rights as a standard procedure. Copyright law gives the creator of copyrighted work exclusive rights, which may be both segmented and transferred to others.\n\nBeing a nonprofit and voluntary initiative, in the past E-LIS has received small funds from the Spanish Ministry of Education, but there is no regular funding of any kind from any institution or state.\n\nThe current short-term plan of activities is described in the \"Acropolis Strategy\". The \"Acropolis Strategy\" roadmaps the actions of the E-LIS community in 2011. It was drafted by the E-LIS Executive Board and E-LIS staff and sets critical goals, which are expected to improve the current situation of E-LIS services. The \"Acropolis Strategy\" is continuously referred to in order to assess the progress of the E-LIS community activities. One of E-LIS Team prime priorities is to publish the bibliographic data in E-LIS as Linked Open Data.\n\n\n"}

The work is in Latin and was published in imperial folio format in Leipzig (\"Lipsiae\") by T.O. Weigel, volume one in 1823 and the final volume in 1850. It includes more than 550 pages of text and 240 chromolithographs, including views of habitats and botanical dissections. \n\n\"Historia naturalis palmarum\" was based on Martius' travels in Brazil and Peru with zoologist Johann Baptist von Spix from 9 December 1817 to 1820. Their expedition was sponsored by the King of Bavaria, Maximilian I, with instructions to investigate natural history and tribal Indians. The pair travelled over 2,250 km (1,400 mi) throughout the Amazon Basin, the most species-rich palm region in the world, collecting and sketching specimens. They began in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo before making their way north and inland. They became the first non-Portuguese Europeans to obtain permission to visit the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nOn their return to Bavaria, the King awarded both men knighthoods and lifetime pensions.\n\nIn the first volume, Martius outlined the modern classification of palms and prepared the first maps of palm biogeography. The second volume described the palms of Brazil, and in the third, known as \"Expositio Systematica\", he systematically described all known genera of the palm family, based on his own work and that of others.\n\nThe majority of drawings of palms for the second volume, dedicated to Brazilian palms, were credited to Martius, with just a few landscapes, representing areas not travelled by Martius, taken from works by Frans Post and Johann Moritz Rugendas.\n\nThe book was reprinted in two volumes in 1971.\n\nOther works by Martius based on the expedition were \"Reise in Brasilien\" (\"Journey in Brazil\"), published in three volumes in 1823, 1828 and 1831, and the massive 40-volume monograph \"Flora Brasiliensis\" which was completed by others in 1906.\n\nE. J. H. Corner (1966) described the book as \"the most magnificent treatment of palms that has been produced\" Alexander von Humboldt said of the work and author: \"For as long as palms are named and known, the name of Martius will be famous.\"\n\n"}

For example, describing someone who has broken a law as a criminal. Labelling theory is a theory in sociology which ascribes labelling of people to control and identification of deviant behaviour.\nIt has been argued that labelling is necessary for communication. However, the use of the term is often intended to highlight the fact that the \"label\" is a description applied from the outside, rather than something intrinsic to the labelled thing. This can be done for several reasons:\nThis last usage can be seen as an accusation that such a short description is overly-reductive.\n\nGiving something a label can be seen as positive, but the term \"label\" is not usually used in this case. For example, giving a name to a common identity is seen as essential in identity politics.\n\nLabelling is often equivalent to pigeonholing or the use of stereotypes and can suffer from the same problems as these activities.\n\nThe labelling of people can be related to a reference group. For example, the labels \"black\" and \"white\" are related to black people and white people; the labels \"young\" and \"old\" are related to young people and old people.\n\nThe labelling of works of art can be related to genre. For example, a piece of music may be described as progressive rock or indie or ragga jungle drum and bass. However, there are other labels that can be applied to a work, such as derivative, low or high. The use of the word labelling is less common in the context of works of art than people. However, it also often represents the rejection of a label. For example, an artist may feel that the labeller is attempting to restrict the scope of the artist's work to that which is covered by the label.\n\nLabelling on the Web represent the chunks of information in our information environments. In an information environment, labels occur in 2 formats: textual and iconic.\n\nWhen creating labels, the goal is to communicate efficiently, and without taking up too much space. Labels should be written in a language that’s familiar to the users, and in a way that they will detect new and recognize similar concepts. \n\nContextual links are hyperlinks to chunks of information on other pages or another location on the same page, and need to draw meaning from their surrounding text.\n\nHeadings: Labels are often used as headings to present subsequent information and create a hierarchy within contents. A hierarchical relationship between headings is established visually through a consistent use of numbering, font size, colour and styles, white spaces, indentation, or a combination of these items.\n\nNavigation system choices: There is no standard for a navigation system but common categories might be:\n\nIndex terms are often referred to as keywords, tags, descriptive metadata, taxonomies, controlled vocabularies and thesauri. Such labelling systems can describe any type of content such as sites, subsites, pages, or content chunks.\n\nIcons can serve as a substitute for text to represent information. Iconic labels are used as navigation systems, especially in mobile apps, where screen space is constrained.\n\nIn context of argumentation and debate, labelling a debator or position is often (whether consciously or unconsciously) used as a \"red herring\" to divert or dismiss the argument, instead of valid argumentation. Often in the form of ad hominem association fallacy aiming at accrediting or discrediting the argument or the debator by associating them with an emotionally charged label. Typically negatively; labelling it as ridiculous or despicable, though it can also go the other way round; attempting to gain sympathy for example by promoting the debator or position as authoritative, or by appealing to pity. - Using labelling in argumentation this way constitute an informal fallacy. - For example:\nThe guy believed that it can be done with the right technology.\nThe witness claim to have seen something that indicates foul play.\nMarkings indicate that it was done with a crowbar. - And secondly, Mr X is a suspect..\nIt has been suggested that something it said in the book could be wrong.\n\n"}
{"id": "190871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190871", "title": "Library catalog", "text": "Library catalog\n\nA library catalog or library catalogue is a register of all bibliographic items found in a library or group of libraries, such as a network of libraries at several locations. A bibliographic item can be any information entity (e.g., books, computer files, graphics, realia, cartographic materials, etc.) that is considered library material (e.g., a single novel in an anthology), or a group of library materials (e.g., a trilogy), or linked from the catalog (e.g., a webpage) as far as it is relevant to the catalog and to the users (patrons) of the library.\n\nThe card catalog was a familiar sight to library users for generations, but it has been effectively replaced by the online public access catalog (OPAC). Some still refer to the online catalog as a \"card catalog\". Some libraries with OPAC access still have card catalogs on site, but these are now strictly a secondary resource and are seldom updated. Many libraries that retain their physical card catalog will post a sign advising the last year that the card catalog was updated. Some libraries have eliminated their card catalog in favour of the OPAC for the purpose of saving space for other use, such as additional shelving.\n\nThe largest library catalog in the world is the WorldCat.org union catalog managed by the non-profit library cooperative OCLC, based in Dublin, Ohio. In January 2016, WorldCat.org had over 360,000,000 catalog records and over 2 billion library holdings.\n\nCharles Ammi Cutter made the first explicit statement regarding the \nobjectives of a bibliographic system in his \"Rules for a Printed Dictionary Catalog\" in 1876. According to \nCutter, those objectives were\n\n1. to enable a person to find a book of which either (Identifying objective)\n\n2. to show what the library has (Collocating objective)\n\n3. to assist in the choice of a book (Evaluating objective)\n\nThese objectives can still be recognized in more modern definitions formulated throughout the 20th century. 1960/61 Cutter's objectives were revised by Lubetzky and the Conference on Cataloging Principles (CCP) in Paris. The latest attempt to describe a library catalog's goals and functions was made in 1998 with Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) which defines four user tasks: find, identify, select, and obtain.\n\nA catalog helps to serve as an inventory or bookkeeping of the library's contents. If an item (e.g. a book, a CD, a DVD, etc.) is not found in the catalog, the user may continue her/his search at another library. Library thieves, who may be staff or regular visitors of the library, risk discovery if an item listed in the catalog is missing from the shelves. To reduce this risk, a thief may also steal the catalog card describing the item.\n\nA catalog card is an individual entry in a library catalog containing bibliographic information, including author’s name, book title, and even approximate location (on bookshelf). Eventually the mechanization of the modern era brought the efficiencies of card catalogs. It was around 1780 that the first card catalog appeared in Vienna. It solved the problems of the structural catalogs in marble and clay from ancient times and the later codex (handwritten and bound) catalogs that were manifestly inflexible and presented high costs in editing to reflect a changing collection. The first cards used may have been French playing cards, which, in the 1700s, were blank on one side. In November 1789, the Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution began collecting all books from religious houses (churches). Using these books in a new system of public libraries included an inventory of all books. The backs of the playing cards contained the bibliographic information for each book and this inventory became known as the \"French Cataloging Code of 1791\".\n\nEnglish inventor Francis Ronalds began using a catalog of cards to manage his growing book collection around 1815, which has been denoted as the first practical use of the system. In the mid-1800s, Natale Battezzati, an Italian publisher, developed a card system for booksellers in which cards represented authors, titles and subjects. Very shortly afterward, Melvil Dewey and other American librarians began to champion the card catalog because of its great expandability. In some libraries books were catalogued based on the size of the book while other libraries organized based only on the author’s name. This made finding a book difficult.\n\nThe first issue of the official publication of the American Library Association, the Library Journal, made clear that the most pressing issues facing libraries were the lack of a standardized catalog and an agency to administer a centralized catalog. Responding to the standardization matter, the ALA formed a committee that quickly recommended the 2-by-5-in (5-by-12-cm) \"Harvard College size\" cards as used at Harvard and the Boston Athenaeum. However, in the same report, the committee also suggested that a larger card, approximately 3 by 5 in (7.5 by 12 cm) would be preferable. By the end of the nineteenth century, the bigger card won out, mainly to the fact that the 3-by-5-in (7.5-by-12-cm) card was already the “postal size” used for postcards.\n\nMelvil Dewey saw well beyond the importance of standardized cards and sought to outfit virtually all facets of library operations. To the end he established a Supplies Department as part of the ALA, later to become a stand-alone company renamed the Library Bureau. In one of its early distribution catalogs, the bureau pointed out that “no other business had been organized with the definite purpose of supplying libraries”. With a focus on machine-cut index cards and the trays and cabinets to contain them, the Library Bureau became a veritable furniture store, selling tables, chairs, shelves and display cases, as well as date stamps, newspaper holders, hole punchers, paper weights, and virtually anything else a library could possibly need. With this one-stop shopping service, Dewey left an enduring mark on libraries across the country. Uniformity spread from library to library. \n\nDewey and others devised a new system. Books were organized by subject then those would be alphabetized based on the author’s name. Each book was assigned a “call number” which identified the subject and location. The decimal points divided different sections of the call number. The call number on the card matched a number written on the spine of each book. During this time, in 1860 the American Assistant Librarian Ezra Abbot began designing a card catalog that was easily accessible and secure for keeping the cards in order; he managed this by placing the cards on edge between two wooden blocks. He published his findings in the Annual Report of the Library for 1863 and they were adopted by many American libraries. Work on the catalog began in 1862 and within the first year 35,762 catalog cards had been created. The catalog cards were 2 x 5 inches; the Harvard College size. One of the first acts of the newly formed American Library Association in 1876 was to set standards for the size of the cards used in American libraries, thus making their manufacture and the manufacture of cabinets, uniform. OCLC, long the major supplier of catalog cards to the world's libraries, printed the last one on October 1, 2015.\n\nIn a physical catalog, the information about each item is on a separate card, which is placed in order in the catalog drawer depending on the type of record. If it was a non-fiction record, Charles A. Cutter's classification system would help the patron find the book they wanted in a quick fashion. Cutter's classification system is as follows: \n\nHere's an example of a catalog card, which would be filed alphabetically in the Author section:\n\nTraditionally, there are the following types of catalog:\n\nThe earliest librarians created rules for how to record the details of the catalog. By 700 BCE the Assyrians followed the rules set down by the Babylonians. The seventh century BCE Babylonian Library of Ashurbanipal was led by the librarian Ibnissaru who prescribed a catalog of clay tablets by subject. Subject catalogs were the rule of the day, and author catalogs were unknown at that time. The frequent use of subject-only catalogs hints that there was a code of practice among early catalog librarians and that they followed some set of rules for subject assignment and the recording of the details of each item. These rules created efficiency through consistency—the catalog librarian knew how to record each item without reinventing the rules each time, and the reader knew what to expect with each visit. The task of recording the contents of libraries is more than an instinct or a compulsive tic exercised by librarians; it began as a way to broadcast to readers what is available among the stacks of materials. The tradition of open stacks of printed books is paradigmatic to modern American library users, but ancient libraries featured stacks of clay or prepaper scrolls that resisted browsing.\n\nDuring the early modern period, libraries were organized through the direction of the librarian in charge. There was no universal method, so some books were organized by language or book material, for example, but most scholarly libraries had recognizable categories (like philosophy, saints, mathematics). The first library to list titles alphabetically under each subject was the Sorbonne library in Paris. Library catalogs originated as manuscript lists, arranged by format (folio, quarto, etc.) or in a rough alphabetical \narrangement by author. Before printing, librarians had to enter new acquisitions into the margins of the catalog list until a new one was created. Because of the nature of creating texts at this time, most catalogs were not able to keep up with new acquisitions. It was not until the printing press was well-established that strict cataloging became necessary because of the influx of printed materials. Printed catalogs, sometimes called \"dictionary catalogs\", began to be published in the early modern period and enabled\nscholars outside a library to gain an idea of its contents. Copies of these in the library \nitself would sometimes be interleaved with blank leaves on which additions could be recorded, or bound as \"guardbooks\" in which slips \nof paper were bound in for new entries. Slips could also be kept loose in cardboard or tin boxes, stored on shelves. The first card catalogs appeared in the late 19th century after the standardization of the 5 in. x 3 in. card for personal filing systems, enabling much more flexibility, and towards the end of the 20th century the Online public access catalog was developed (see below). These gradually became more common as some libraries progressively abandoned such other catalog formats as paper slips (either loose or in sheaf catalog form), and guardbooks. The beginning of the Library of Congress's catalog card service in 1911 led to the use of these cards in the majority of American libraries. An equivalent scheme in the United Kingdom was operated by the British National Bibliography from 1956 and was subscribed to by many public and other libraries.\n\n\nMore about the early history of library catalogs has been collected in \n1956 by Strout.\n\nIn a title catalog, one can distinguish two sort orders:\n\nThe grammatical sort order has the advantage that often, the most important word of the title is also a good keyword (question 3), and it is the word most users remember first when their memory is incomplete. However, it has the disadvantage that many elaborate grammatical rules \nare needed, so that only expert users may be able to search the catalog without help from a librarian.\n\nIn some catalogs, persons' names are standardized (i. e., the name of the person is always cataloged and sorted in a standard form) even if it appears differently in the library material. This standardization is achieved by a process called authority control. Simply put, authority control is defined as the establishment and maintenance of consistent forms of terms – such as names, subjects, and titles – to be used as headings in bibliographic records. An advantage of the authority control is that it is easier to answer question 2 (Which works of some author does the library have?). On the other hand, it may be more difficult to answer question 1 (Does the library have some specific material?) if the material spells the author in a peculiar variant. For the cataloguer, it may incur too much work to check whether \"Smith, J.\" is \"Smith, John\" or \"Smith, Jack\".\n\nFor some works, even the title can be standardized. The technical term for this is \"uniform title\". For example, translations and re-editions are sometimes sorted under their original title. In many catalogs, parts of the Bible are sorted under the standard name of \nthe book(s) they contain. The plays of William Shakespeare are another frequently cited example of the role played by a \"uniform title\" in the library catalog.\n\nMany complications about alphabetic sorting of entries arise. Some examples:\n\nFor a fuller discussion, see collation.\n\nIn a subject catalog, one has to decide on which classification system to use. The cataloguer will select appropriate subject headings for the bibliographic item and a unique classification number (sometimes known as a \"call number\") which \nis used not only for identification but also for the purposes of shelving, placing items with similar subjects near one another, which aids in browsing by library users, who are thus often able to take advantage of serendipity in their search process.\n\nOnline cataloging, through such systems as the Dynix software developed in 1983 and used widely through the late 1990s, has greatly enhanced the usability of catalogs, thanks to the rise of MARC standards (an acronym for MAchine Readable Cataloging) in the 1960s.\n\nRules governing the creation of MARC catalog records include not only formal cataloging rules such as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, second edition (AACR2), Resource Description and Access (RDA) but also rules specific to MARC, available from both the U.S. Library of Congress and the OCLC, the Online Computer Library Center global cooperative which builds and maintains WorldCat.\n\nMARC was originally used to automate the creation of physical catalog cards, but its use evolved into direct access to the MARC computer files during the search process.\n\nOPACs have enhanced usability over traditional card formats because:\n\n\n\n"}

It possesses several important biological specimen, manuscript and literature collections and publishes academic journals and books on plant and animal biology. The society also awards a number of prestigious medals and prizes for achievement.\n\nA product of the 18th-century enlightenment, the society is historically important as the venue for the first public presentation of the Theory of Evolution.\n\nThe patron of the society is Queen Elizabeth II. Honorary members include the present monarchs of Japan, Emperor Akihito, and Sweden, King Carl XVI Gustaf, both of whom have active interests in natural history, and the eminent broadcaster, Sir David Attenborough.\n\nThe Linnean Society was founded in 1788 by botanist Sir James Edward Smith. The society derives its name from the Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus, the 'father of taxonomy', who systematised biological classification through his binomial nomenclature. He was known as Carl von Linné after his ennoblement, hence the spelling 'Linnean', rather than 'Linnaean'. The society had a number of minor name variations before it gained its Royal Charter on 26 March 1802, when the name became fixed as \"The Linnean Society of London\". In 1802, as a newly incorporated society, it comprised 228 fellows. It is the oldest extant natural history society in the world. Throughout its history the society has been a non-political and non-sectarian institution, existing solely for the furtherance of natural history.\n\nThe inception of the society was the direct result of the purchase by Sir James Smith of the specimen, book and correspondence collections of Linnaeus. When the collection was offered for sale by the heirs of Linnaeus, Smith was urged to acquire it by Sir Joseph Banks, the eminent botanist and president of the Royal Society. Five years after this purchase Banks gave Smith his full support in founding the Linnean Society, and he became one of the first Honorary Members of the new society.\nThe society has numbered many prominent scientists amongst its fellows. One such was the botanist Robert Brown, who was president (1849-1853); he named the cell nucleus and discovered Brownian motion. In 1854 Charles Darwin was elected a fellow; he is undoubtedly the most illustrious scientist ever to appear on the membership rolls of the society. Another famous fellow was biologist Thomas Huxley, who gained the nickname \"Darwin's bulldog\" for his outspoken defence of evolution. Men notable in other walks of life have also been fellows of the society, including the physician Edward Jenner, pioneer of vaccination, the Arctic explorers Sir John Franklin and Sir James Clark Ross, colonial administrator and founder of Singapore, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and Prime Minister of Britain, Lord Aberdeen.\n\nSince 1857 the Society has been based at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London; an address it shares with a number of other learned societies: the Geological Society of London, the Royal Astronomical Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nThe first public exposition of the 'Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection', arguably the greatest single leap of progress made in biology, was presented to a meeting of the Linnean Society on 1 July 1858. At this meeting a joint presentation of papers by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace was made, sponsored by Joseph Hooker and Charles Lyell as neither author could be present.\n\nIn 1904 the society experienced the novelty of electing women fellows; this followed a number of years of campaigning by the botanist Marian Farquharson. Whilst the society's council was reluctant to admit women, the fellows were much less so, with only 17% voting against the proposal. Among the first to benefit from this were: ornithologist and photographer Emma Louisa Turner, Lilian J. Veley, a microbiologist and Annie Lorrain Smith, a lichenologist and mycologist, all formally admitted on 19 January 1905. Also amongst the first women to be elected in 1904 was the paleobotanist, and later pioneer of family planning, Marie Stopes.\n\nThe society's connection with evolution remained strong into the 20th century. Sir Edward Poulton, who was president 1912-1916, was a great defender of natural selection and was the first biologist to recognise the importance of frequency-dependent selection.\n\nThe first female president of the society was Irene Manton (1973 to 1976), who pioneered the biological use of electron microscopy. Her work revealed the structure of the flagellum and cilia, which are central to many systems of cellular motility.\n\nRecent years have seen an increased interest within the society in issues of biodiversity conservation. This was highlighted by the inception in 2015 of an annual award, the John Spedan Lewis Medal, specifically honouring persons making significant and innovative contributions to conservation.\n\nFellowship requires nomination by at least one fellow, and election by a minimum of two thirds of those electors voting. Fellows may employ the post-nominal letters 'FLS'. Fellowship is open to both professional scientists and to amateur naturalists who have shown active interest in natural history and allied disciplines. Having authored relevant publications is an advantage, but not a necessity, for election. Following election, new fellows must be formally admitted, in person at a meeting of the society, before they are able to vote in society elections. Admission takes the form of signing the membership book, and thereby agreeing to an obligation to abide by the statutes of the society. Following this the new fellow is taken by the hand by the president, who recites a formula of admission to the fellowship. Other forms of membership exist: 'Associate', for supporters of the society who do not wish to submit to the formal election process for fellowship, and 'Student Associate', for those registered as students at a place of tertiary education. Associate members may apply for election to the fellowship at any time. Finally, there are three types of membership that are prestigious and strictly limited in number: 'Fellow \"honoris causa\"', 'Foreign', and lastly, 'Honorary'. These forms of membership are bestowed following election by the fellowship at the annual Anniversary Meeting in May.\n\nMeetings have historically been, and continue to be, the main justification of the society's existence. Meetings are venues for people of like interests to exchange information, talk about scientific and literary concerns, exhibit specimens and listen to lectures. Today, meetings are held in the evening and also at lunchtime, most are open to the public as well as to members. The majority are held in Burlington House, but other venues are also occasionally used. On the 24th of May, traditionally regarded as the birthday of Carolus Linnaeus, the Anniversary Meeting is held. This is for fellows and guests only, and includes ballots for membership of the council of the society and the awarding of medals.\n\nThe Linnean Society of London aims to promote the study of all aspects of the biological sciences, with particular emphasis on evolution, taxonomy, biodiversity, and sustainability. Through awarding medals and grants, the Society acknowledges and encourages excellence in all of these fields.\n\nThe following medals and prizes are awarded by the Linnean Society:\n\nLinnaeus' botanical and zoological collections were purchased in 1783 by Sir James Edward Smith, the first President of the society, and are now held in London by the society. The collections include 14,000 plants, 158 fish, 1,564 shells, 3,198 insects, 1,600 books and 3,000 letters and documents. They may be viewed by appointment and there is a monthly tour of the collections.\n\nSmith's own plant collection of 27,185 dried specimens, together with his correspondence and book collection, is also held by the Society.\nOther notable holdings of the society include the notebooks and journals of Alfred Russel Wallace and the paintings of plants and animals made by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton (1762–1829) in Nepal.\n\nIn December 2014, the society's collection was added to the list of nationally significant collections in England by the Arts Council England.\n\nThe Linnean Society began its extensive series of publications on 13 August 1791, when Volume I of \"Transactions\" was produced. Over the following centuries the society published a number of different journals, some of which specialised in more specific subject areas, whilst earlier publications were discontinued. Those still in publication include: the \"Biological Journal of the Linnean Society\", which covers the evolutionary biology of all organisms, \"Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society\", which focuses on plant sciences, and \"Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society\" focusing on animal systematics and evolution. \"The Linnean\" is a biannual newsletter. It contains commentary on recent activities and events, articles on history and science, and occasional biographies/obituaries of people connected to the Linnean Society; it also includes book reviews, reference material and correspondence. The society also publishes books and \"Synopses of the British Fauna\", a series of field-guides.\n\n\n"}

See also: disputed territories.\n\nMany countries have some remote (or fantastically remote) symbolic foundation date as part of their national mythology, sometimes artificially inflating a country's \"age\" for reasons of nationalism, sometimes merely gesturing at a long and gradual process of the formation of an ethnic identity. Such dates reflect not the formation of a state (an independent political entity), but of a nation (an ethnic or cultural grouping), terms that are often conflated in the context of nation states.\n\nThe following list contains the formation dates of countries with a short description of those events. For a more detailed description of a country's formation and history please see the main article for each country.\n\n\nIn this list, \"date of last subordination\" refers to the last date of control by an external government. The list shows large groupings associated with the dates of independence from decolonization (e.g. 41 current states gained control of sovereignty from United Kingdom and France between 1956 and 1966) or dissolution of a political union (e.g. 18 current states gained control of sovereignty from Soviet Union and Yugoslavia between 1990 and 1992). In other cases, a sovereign state submitted to foreign military occupation or political subjugation for a period of time and later regained its independence (e.g. 6 current states gained control of sovereignty from Nazi Germany between 1944 and 1945).\n\nDates refer to \"de facto\" rule or occupation of the major territory, whether or not legitimized by international recognition.\n\nIn a union such as Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, or the Kalmar Union, one of the constituents can be considered the dominant power – generally where the seat of government was located. The United Kingdom is a particularly complicated case. If England is viewed as the dominant member, then history can be traced from Roman conquest, Saxon invasions, 10th century unification, and the 1066 Norman Conquest before the union of England and Scotland in 1707. However, if viewed from a Scottish perspective, an unbroken history of sovereignty can be traced from unification in 843 through the 1707 union with England (with a brief annexation by England from 1657 to 1660). Some Scots view the 1707 union as a ceding of sovereignty to England.\n"}

{"id": "37835769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37835769", "title": "Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area", "text": "Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area\n\nThe Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) linguistic area is a linguistic area that stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the Sino-Tibetan, Hmong–Mien (or Miao–Yao), Kra–Dai, Austronesian (represented by Chamic) and Austroasiatic families. Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar typological features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion. James Matisoff referred to this area as the Sinosphere, contrasted with the \"Indosphere\", but viewed it as a zone of mutual influence in the ancient period. \"Sinosphere\" is more commonly used to refer to the East Asian cultural sphere.\n\nDavid Gil (2015) considers the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area to be part of the larger Mekong-Mamberamo linguistic area, which also includes languages in Indonesia west of the Mamberamo River.\n\nThe Austroasiatic languages include Vietnamese and Khmer, as well as many other languages spoken in scattered pockets as far afield as Malaya and eastern India. Most linguists believe that Austroasiatic languages once ranged continuously across southeast Asia and that their scattered distribution today is the result of the subsequent migration of speakers of other language groups from southern China.\n\nChinese civilization and the Chinese language spread from their home in the North China Plain into the Yangtze valley and then into southern China during the first millennium BC and first millennium AD.\nIndigenous groups in these areas either became Chinese, retreated to the hill country, or migrated to the south.\nThus the Kra–Dai languages, today including Thai, Lao and Shan, were originally spoken in what is now southern China, where the greatest diversity within the family is still found, and possibly as far north as the Yangtze valley.\nWith the exception of Zhuang, most of the Kra–Dai languages still remaining in China are spoken in isolated upland areas.\nSimilarly the Hmong–Mien languages may originally have been spoken in the middle Yangtze.\nToday they are scattered across isolated hill regions of southern China.\nMany of them migrated to southeast Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, after the suppression of a series of revolts in Guizhou.\n\nThe upland regions of the interior of the area, as well as the plains of Burma, are home to speakers of other Sino-Tibetan languages, the Tibeto-Burman languages.\nThe Austronesian languages, spoken across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, are represented in MSEA by the divergent Chamic group.\n\nThe far southern Sinitic languages Cantonese and Pinghua are also part of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, as demonstrated by Hilário de Sousa (2015).\n\nMark Post (2015) observes that the Tani languages of Arunachal Pradesh, Northeast India typologically fit into the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, which typically has creoloid morphosyntactic patterns, rather than with the languages of the Tibetosphere. Post (2015) also notes that Tani culture is similar to those of Mainland Southeast Asian hill tribe cultures, and is not particularly adapted to cold montane environments.\n\nA characteristic of MSEA languages is a particular syllable structure involving monosyllabic morphemes, lexical tone, a fairly large inventory of consonants, including phonemic aspiration, limited clusters at the beginning of a syllable, and plentiful vowel contrasts.\nFinal consonants are typically highly restricted, often limited to glides and nasals or unreleased stops at the same points of articulation, with no clusters and no voice distinction.\nLanguages in the northern part of the area generally have fewer vowel and final contrasts but more initial contrasts.\n\nMost MSEA languages tend to have monosyllabic morphemes, but there are exceptions.\nSome polysyllabic morphemes exist even in Old Chinese and Vietnamese, often loanwords from other languages.\nA related syllable structure found in some languages, such as the Mon–Khmer languages, is the sesquisyllable, consisting of a stressed syllable with approximately the above structure, preceded by an unstressed \"minor\" syllable consisting only of a consonant and a neutral vowel .\nThat structure is present in many conservative Mon–Khmer languages such as Khmer (Cambodian), as well as in Burmese, and it is reconstructed for the older stages of a number of Sino-Tibetan languages.\n\nPhonemic tone is one of the most well-known of southeast Asian language characteristics.\nMany of the languages in the area have strikingly similar tone systems, which appear to have developed in the same way.\n\nThe tone systems of Middle Chinese, proto-Hmong–Mien, proto-Tai and early Vietnamese all display a three-way tonal contrast in syllables lacking stop endings.\nIn traditional analyses, syllables ending in stops have been treated as a fourth or \"checked tone\", because their distribution parallels that of syllables with nasal codas.\nMoreover, the earliest strata of loans display a regular correspondence between tonal categories in the different languages:\n\nThe incidence of these tones in Chinese, Tai and Hmong–Mien words follows a similar ratio 2:1:1.\nThus rhyme dictionaries such as the \"Qieyun\" divide the level tone between two volumes while covering each of the other tones in a single volume.\nVietnamese has a different distribution, with tone B four times more common than tone C.\n\nIt was long believed that tone was an invariant feature of languages, suggesting that these groups must be related.\nHowever this category cut across groups of languages with shared basic vocabulary.\nIn 1954 André-Georges Haudricourt solved this paradox by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other (atonal) Austroasiatic languages.\nHe thus argued that the Austroasiatic proto-language had been atonal, and that its development in Vietnamese had been conditioned by these consonants, which had subsequently disappeared, a process now known as tonogenesis.\nHaudricourt further proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin.\nOther scholars have since uncovered transcriptional and other evidence for these consonants in early forms of Chinese, and many linguists now believe that Old Chinese was atonal.\nA smaller amount of similar evidence has been found for proto-Tai.\nMoreover, since the realization of tone categories as pitch contours varies so widely between languages, the correspondence observed in early loans suggests that the conditioning consonants were still present at the time of borrowing.\n\nA characteristic sound change (a phonemic split) occurred in most southeast Asian languages around 1000 AD.\nFirst, syllables with voiced initial consonants came to be pronounced with a lower pitch than those with unvoiced initials.\nIn most of these languages, with a few exceptions such as Wu Chinese, the voicing distinction subsequently disappeared, and the pitch contour became distinctive.\nIn tonal languages, each of the tones split into two \"registers\", yielding a typical pattern of six tones in unchecked syllables and two in checked ones.\nPinghua and Yue Chinese, as well as neighbouring Tai languages, have further tone splits in checked syllables, while many other Chinese varieties, including Mandarin Chinese, have merged some tonal categories.\n\nMany non-tonal languages instead developed a register split, with voiced consonants producing breathy-voiced vowels and unvoiced consonants producing normally voiced vowels. Often, the breathy-voiced vowels subsequently went through additional, complex changes (e.g. diphthongization). Examples of languages affected this way are Mon and Khmer (Cambodian). Breathy voicing has since been lost in standard Khmer, although the vowel changes triggered by it still remain.\n\nMany of these languages have subsequently developed some voiced obstruents. The most common such sounds are and (often pronounced with some implosion), which result from former preglottalized and , which were common phonemes in many Asian languages and which behaved like voiceless obstruents. In addition, Vietnamese developed voiced fricatives through a different process (specifically, in words consisting of two syllables, with an initial, unstressed minor syllable, the medial stop at the beginning of the stressed major syllable turned into a voiced fricative, and then the minor syllable was lost).\n\nMost MSEA languages are of the isolating type, with mostly mono-morphemic words, no inflection and little affixation.\nNouns are derived by compounding; for example, Mandarin Chinese is rich in polysyllabic words.\nGrammatical relations are typically signalled by word order, particles and coverbs or prepositions.\nModality is expressed using sentence-final particles.\nThe usual word order in MSEA languages is subject–verb–object.\nChinese, Bai and Karen are thought to have changed to this order from the subject–object–verb order retained by most other Sino-Tibetan languages.\nThe order of constituents within a noun phrase varies: noun–modifier order is usual in Tai and Hmongic languages, while in Chinese varieties and Mienic languages most modifiers are placed before the noun.\nTopic-comment organization is also common.\n\nMSEA languages typically have well-developed systems of numeral classifiers.\nThe Bengali language just to the west of Southeast Asia also has numerical classifiers, even though it is an Indo-European language that does not share the other MSEA features. Bengali also lacks gender, unlike most Indo-European languages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "79317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79317", "title": "Moirai", "text": "Moirai\n\nIn ancient Greek religion and mythology, the Moirai or Moerae (; , \"apportioners\"), often known in English as the Fates (), were the white-robed incarnations of destiny; their Roman equivalent was the Parcae (euphemistically the \"sparing ones\"), there are other equivalents in cultures that descend from the proto-Indo-European culture. Their number became fixed at three: Clotho (spinner), Lachesis (allotter) and Atropos (literally 'unturnable' but metaphorically 'inflexible' or 'inevitable' – i.e. death).\n\nThey controlled the mother thread of life of every mortal from birth to death. They were independent, at the helm of necessity, directed fate, and watched that the fate assigned to every being by eternal laws might take its course without obstruction. The gods and men had to submit to them, although Zeus's relationship with them is a matter of debate: some sources say he can command them (the \"Zeus Moiragetes\"), yet others suggest he was also bound to the Moirai's dictates. \n\nIn the Homeric poems Moira or Aisa, is related with the limit and end of life, and Zeus appears as the guider of destiny. In the \"Theogony\" of Hesiod, the three Moirai are personified, daughters of Nyx and are acting over the gods. Later they are daughters of Zeus and Themis, who was the embodiment of divine order and law. In Plato's \"Republic\" the Three Fates are daughters of Ananke (necessity).\n\nIt seems that Moira is related with Tekmor (proof, ordinance) and with Ananke (destiny, necessity), who were primeval goddesses in mythical cosmogonies. The ancient Greek writers might call this power Moira or Ananke, and even the gods could not alter what was ordained :\n\n\"To the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) the might of Zeus must bow; and by the Immortals' purpose all these things had come to pass, or by the Moirai's ordinance.\"\n\nThe concept of a universal principle of natural order has been compared to similar concepts in other cultures like the Vedic Rta, the Avestan Asha (Arta) and the Egyptian Maat.\n\nIn earliest Greek philosophy, the cosmogony of Anaximander is based on these mythical beliefs. The goddess Dike (justice, divine retribution), keeps the order and sets a limit to any actions.\n\nThe ancient Greek word moira (μοῖρα) means a portion or lot of the whole, and is related to \"meros\", \"part, lot\" and \"moros\", \"fate, doom\", Latin \"meritum\", \"reward\", English \"merit\", derived from the PIE root \"*(s)mer\", \"to allot, assign\".\n\nMoira may mean portion or share in the distribution of booty (ίση μοῖρα \"ísē moîra\" \"equal booty\"), portion in life, lot, destiny, (μοῖραv ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι \"moîran éthēken athánatoi\" \"the immortals fixed the destiny\") death (μοῖρα θανάτοιο \"moîra thanátoio\" \"destiny of death\"), portion of the distributed land., The word is also used for something which is meet and right (κατὰ μοῖραν, \"katà moîran\", \"according to fate, in order, rightly\")\n\nIt seems that originally the word moira did not indicate destiny but included \"ascertainment\" or \"proof\", a non-abstract certainty. The word daemon, which was an agent related to unexpected events, came to be similar to the word moira. This agent or cause against human control might be also called tyche (chance, fate): \"You mistress moira, and tyche, and my daemon \"\n\nThe word \"nomos\", \"law\", may have meant originally a portion or lot, as in the verb \"nemein\", \"to distribute\", and thus \"natural lot\" came to mean \"natural law\". The word \"dike\", \"justice\", conveyed the notion that someone should stay within his own specified boundaries, respecting the ones of his neighbour. If someone broke his boundaries, thus getting more than his ordained part, then he would be punished by law. By extension, \"moira\" was one's portion or part in destiny which consisted of good and bad moments as was predetermined by the \"Moirai\" (Fates), and it was impossible for anyone to get more than his ordained part. In modern Greek the word came to mean \"destiny\" (μοίρα or ειμαρμένη).\n\nKismet, the predetermined course of events in the Muslim traditions, seems to have a similar etymology and function: Arabic \"qismat\" \"lot\" \"qasama\", \"to divide, allot\" developed to mean Fate or destiny. As a loanword, qesmat 'fate' appears in Persian, whence in Urdu language, and eventually in English Kismet.\n\nWhen they were three, the Moirai were:\n\nIn the \"Republic\" of Plato, the three Moirai sing in unison with the music of the Seirenes. Lachesis sings the things that were, Clotho the things that are, and Atropos the things that are to be. Pindar in his Hymn to the Fates, holds them in high honour. He calls them to send their sisters Hours, Eunomia (Lawfulness), Dike (Right), and Eirene (Peace), to stop the internal civil strife:\n\nIn ancient times caves were used for burial purposes in eastern Mediterranean, along with underground shrines or temples. The priests and the priestesses had considerable influence upon the world of the living. Births are recorded in such shrines, and the Greek legend of conception and birth in the tomb – as in the story of Danae- is based on the ancient belief that the dead know the future. Such caves were the caves of Ida and Dikte mountains in Crete, where myth situates the birth of Zeus and other gods, and the cave of Eileithyia near Knossos. The relative Minoan goddesses were named Diktynna (later identified with Artemis), who was a mountain nymph of hunting, and Eileithyia who was the goddess of childbirth.\n\nIt seems that in Pre-Greek religion Aisa was a daemon. In Mycenean religion Aisa or Moira was originally a living power related with the limit and end of life. At the moment of birth she spins the destiny, because birth ordains death. Later Aisa is not alone, but she is accompanied by the \"Spinners\", who are the personifications of Fate. The act of spinning is also associated with the gods, who at birth and at marriage do not spin the thread of life, but individual events like destruction, return or good fortune. Everything which has been spun must be winded on the spindle, and this was considered a cloth, like a net or loop which captured man.\n\nInvisible bonds and knots could be controlled from a loom, and twining was a magic art used by the magicians to harm a person, and control his individual fate. Similar ideas appear in Norse mythology, and in Greek folklore. The appearance of the gods and the Moirai may be related to the fairy tale motif, which is common in many Indo-European sagas and also in Greek folklore. The fairies appear beside the cradle of the newborn child and bring gifts to him.\n\nTemple attendants may be considered representations of the Moirai, who belonged to the underworld, but secretly guided the lives of those in the upperworld. Their power could be sustained by witchcraft and oracles. In Greek mythology the Moirai at birth are accompanied by Eileithyia. At the birth of Hercules they use together a magic art, to free the newborn from any \"bonds\" and \"knots\".\n\nMuch of the Mycenean religion survived into classical Greece, but it is not known to what extent Greek religious belief is Mycenean, nor how much is a product of the Greek Dark Ages or later. M.Finley detected only few authentic Mycenean beliefs in the 8th-century Homeric world. The religion which later the Greeks considered Hellenic embodies a paradox. Though the world is dominated by a divine power bestowed in different ways on men, nothing but \"darkness\" lay ahead. Life was frail and unsubstantial, and man was like \"a shadow in a dream\".\n\nIn the Homeric poems the words \"moira\", \"aisa\", \"moros\" mean \"portion, part\". Originally they did not indicate a power which led destiny, and must be considered to include the \"ascertainment\" or \"proof\". By extension \"Moira\" is the portion in glory, happiness, mishappenings, death (μοίρα θανάτοιο: destiny of death) which are unexpected events. The unexpected events were usually attributed to daemons, who appeared in special occurrences. In that regard \"Moira\" was later considered an agent, like the daemon of Pre-Greek religion.\n\nPeople believed that their portion in destiny was something similar with their portion in booty, which was distributed according to their descent, and traditional rules. It was possible to get more than their ordained portion (moira), but they had to face severe consequences because their action was \"over moira\" (υπέρ μοίραν:over the portion). It may be considered that they \"broke the order\". The most certain order in human lives is that every human should die, and this was determined by \"Aisa\" or \"Moira\" at the moment of birth. The Myceneans believed that what comes should come (fatalism), and this was considered rightly offered (according to fate: in order). If someone died in battle, he would exist like a shadow in the gloomy space of the underworld.\n\nThe kingdom of \"Moira\" is the kingdom of the limit and the end. In a passage in \"Iliad\", Apollo tries three times to stop Patroclus in front of the walls of Troy, warning him that it is \"over his portion\" to sack the city. Aisa (moira) seems to set a limit on the most vigorous men's actions.\n\nMoira is a power acting in parallel with the gods, and even they could not change the destiny which was predetermined. In the Iliad, Zeus knows that his dearest Sarpedon will be killed by Patroclus, but he cannot save him. In the famous scene of Kerostasia, Zeus the chief-deity of the Myceneans appears as the guider of destiny. Using a pair of scales he decides that Hector must die, according to his \"aisa\" (destiny). His decision seems to be independent from his will, and is not related with any \"moral purpose\". His attitude is explained by Achilleus to Priam, in a parable of two jars at the door of Zeus, one of which contains good things, and the other evil. Zeus gives a mixture to some men, to others only evil and such are driven by hunger over the earth. This was the old \"heroic outlook\".\n\nThe personification of \"Moira\" appears in the newer parts of the epos. In \"Odyssey\", she is accompanied by the \"Spinners\", the personifications of Fate, who do not have separate names. Moira seems to spin the predetermined course of events. Agamemnon claims that \nhe is not responsible for his arrogance. He took the prize of Achilleus, because Zeus and Moira predetermined his decision. In the last section of \"Iliad\", \"Moira\" is the \"mighty fate\" (μοίρα κραταιά:moira krataia) who leads destiny and the course of events. Thetis the mother of Achilleus warns him that he will not live long because mighty fate stands hard by him, therefore he must give to Priam the corpse of Hector. At Hector’s birth mighty fate predetermined that his corpse would be devoured by dogs after his death, and Hecabe is crying desperately asking for revenge.\n\nThe three Moirai are daughters of the primeval goddess Nyx (Night), and sisters of Keres (black Fates), Thanatos (Death) and Nemesis (retribution). Later they are daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Themis (the \"Institutor\"), who was the embodiment of divine order and law. and sisters of Eunomia (lawfulness, order), Dike (Justice), and Eirene (Peace)\n\nHesiod introduces a moral purpose which is absent in the Homeric poems. The Moirai represent a power to which even the gods have to conform. They give men at birth both evil and good moments, and they punish not only men but also gods for their sins.\n\nIn the cosmogony of Alcman (7th century BC), first came Thetis (Disposer, Creation), and then simultaneously Poros (path) and Tekmor (end post, ordinance).\nPoros is related with the beginning of all things, and Tekmor is related with the end of all things.\n\nLater in the Orphic cosmogony, first came Thesis (Disposer), whose ineffable nature is unexpressed. Ananke (necessity) is the primeval goddess of inevitability who is entwined with the time-god Chronos, at the very beginning of time. They represented the cosmic forces of Fate and Time, and they were called sometimes to control the fates of the gods. The three Moirai are daughters of Ananke.\n\nThe Moirai were supposed to appear three nights after a child's birth to determine the course of its life, as in the story of Meleager and the firebrand taken from the hearth and preserved by his mother to extend his life. Bruce Karl Braswell from readings in the lexicon of Hesychius, associates the appearance of the Moirai at the family \"hearth\" on the \"seventh\" day with the ancient Greek custom of waiting seven days after birth to decide whether to accept the infant into the Gens and to give it a name, cemented with a ritual at the hearth. At Sparta the temple to the Moirai stood near the communal hearth of the \"polis\", as Pausanias observed.\n\nAs goddesses of birth who even prophesied the fate of the newly born, Eileithyia, the ancient Minoan goddess of childbirth and divine midwifery, was their companion. Pausanias mentions an ancient role of Eileythia as \"the clever spinner\", relating her with destiny too. Their appearance indicate the Greek desire for health which was connected with the Greek cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity.\n\nThe Moirai assigned to the terrible chthonic goddesses Erinyes who inflicted the punishment for evil deeds their proper functions, and with them directed fate according to necessity. As goddesses of death they appeared together with the daemons of death Keres and the infernal Erinyes.\nIn earlier times they were represented as only a few—perhaps only one—individual goddess. Homer's \"Iliad\" (xxiv.209) speaks generally of the Moira, who spins the thread of life for men at their birth; she is \"Moira Krataia\" \"powerful Moira\" (xvi.334) or there are several Moirai (xxiv.49). In the \"Odyssey\" (vii.197) there is a reference to the \"Klôthes\", or Spinners. At Delphi, only the Fates of Birth and Death were revered. In Athens, Aphrodite, who had an earlier, pre-Olympic existence, was called \"Aphrodite Urania\" the \"eldest of the Fates\" according to Pausanias (x.24.4).\n\nSome Greek mythographers went so far as to claim that the Moirai were the daughters of Zeus—paired with Themis (\"Fundament\"), as Hesiod had it in one passage. In the older myths they are daughters of primeval beings like Nyx (\"Night\") in Theogony, or Ananke (\"Necessity\") in Orphic cosmogony. Whether or not providing a father even for the Moirai was a symptom of how far Greek mythographers were willing to go, in order to modify the old myths to suit the patrilineal Olympic order, the claim of a paternity was certainly not acceptable to Aeschylus, Herodotus, or Plato.\n\nDespite their forbidding reputation, the Moirai could be placated as goddesses. Brides in Athens offered them locks of hair, and women swore by them. They may have originated as birth goddesses and only later acquired their reputation as the agents of destiny.\n\nAccording to the mythographer Apollodorus, in the Gigantomachy, the war between the Giants and Olympians, the Moirai killed the Giants Agrios and Thoon with their bronze clubs.\n\nIn the Homeric poems Moira, who is almost always one, is acting independently from the gods. Only Zeus, the chief sky-deity of the Myceneans is close to Moira, and in a passage he is the being of this power. Using a weighing scale (balance) Zeus weighs Hector's \"lot of death\" (Ker) against the one of Achilleus. Hector's lot weighs down, and he dies according to Fate. Zeus appears as the guider of destiny, who gives everyone the right portion.\n\nIn a Mycenean vase, Zeus holds a weighing scale (balance) in front of two warriors, indicating that he is measuring their destiny before the battle. The belief (fatalism) was that if they die in battle, they must die, and this was rightly offered (according to fate).\n\nIn \"Theogony\", the three \"Moirai\" are daughters of the primeval goddess, Nyx (\"Night\"), representing a power acting over the gods. Later they are daughters of Zeus who gives them the greatest honour, and Themis, the ancient goddess of law and divine order.\nEven the gods feared the Moirai or Fates, which according to Herodotus a god could not escape. The Pythian priestess at Delphi once admitted, that Zeus was also subject to their power, though no classic writing clarifies as to what exact extent the lives of immortals were affected by the whims of the Fates. It is to be expected that the relationship of Zeus and the Moirai was not immutable over the centuries. In either case in antiquity we can see a feeling towards a notion of an order to which even the gods have to conform. Simonides names this power Ananke (necessity) (the mother of the \"Moirai\" in Orphic cosmogony) and says that even the gods don't fight against it. Aeschylus combines Fate and necessity in a scheme, and claims that even Zeus cannot alter which is ordained.\n\nA supposed epithet \"Zeus Moiragetes\", meaning \"Zeus Leader of the Moirai\" was inferred by Pausanias from an inscription he saw in the 2nd century AD at Olympia: \"As you go to the starting-point for the chariot-race there is an altar with an inscription \"to the Bringer of Fate.\" This is plainly a surname of Zeus, who knows the affairs of men, all that the Fates give them, and all that is not destined for them.\" At the Temple of Zeus at Megara, Pausanias inferred from the relief sculptures he saw \"Above the head of Zeus are the Horai and Moirai, and all may see that he is the only god obeyed by Moira.\" Pausanias' inferred assertion is unsupported in cult practice, though he noted a sanctuary of the Moirai there at Olympia (v.15.4), and also at Corinth (ii.4.7) and Sparta (iii.11.8), and adjoining the sanctuary of Themis outside a city gate of Thebes.\n\nThe fates had at least three known temples, in Ancient Corinth, Sparta and Thebes. At least the temple of Corinth contained statues of them: \nThe temple in Thebes was explicitly imageless: \nThe temple in Sparta was situated next to the grave of Orestes.\n\nAside from actual temples, there was also altars to the Moirai. Among them was notably the altar in Olympia near the altar of Zeus Moiragetes, a connection to Zeus which was also repeated in the images of the Moirai in the temple of Despoine in Arkadia as well as in Delphi, where they were depicted with Zeus Moiragetes (Guide of Fate) as well as with Apollon Moiragetes (Guide of Fate).\nOn Korkyra, the shrine of Apollo which was legendary founded by Medea was also a place on which offerings where made to the Moirai and the nymphs. \nThe worship of the Moirai are described by Pausanias for their altar near Sicyon: \n\nIn Roman mythology the three Moirai are the Parcae or Fata, plural of \"fatum\" meaning prophetic declaration, oracle, or destiny. The English words fate (native wyrd) and fairy (magic, enchantment), are both derived from \"fata\", \"fatum\" .\n\nIn Norse mythology the Norns are female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men, twining the thread of life. They set up the laws and decided on the lives of the children of men. Their names were Urðr, related with Wyrd, weird (fate), Verðandi, and Skuld, and it has often been inferred that they ruled over the past, present and future respectively, based on the sequence and partly the etymology of the names, of which the first two (literally 'Fate' and 'Becoming') are derived from the past and present stems of the verb \"verða\", \"to be\", respectively, and the name of the third one means 'Debt' or 'Guilt', originally 'That which must happen'.\n\nIn younger legendary sagas, the Norns appear to have been synonymous with witches (Völvas), and they arrive at the birth of the hero to shape his destiny. It seems that originally all of them were Disir, ghosts or deities associated with destruction and destiny. The notion that they were three may be due to a late influence from Greek and Roman mythology. The same applies to their (disputed) association with the past, present and future.\n\nThe Valkyries (choosers of the slain), were originally daemons of death. They were female figures who decided who will die in battle, and brought their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain. They were also related with spinning, and one of them was named Skuld (debt, guilt). They may be related to Keres, the daemons of death in Greek mythology, who accompanied the dead to the entrance of Hades. In the scene of Kerostasie Keres are the \"lots of death\", and in some cases Ker (destruction) has the same meaning, with Moira interpreted as \"destiny of death\" (\"moira thanatoio\" :μοίρα θανάτοιο) .\n\nThe Celtic Matres and Matrones, female deities almost entirely in a group of three, have been proposed as connected to the Norns and the Valkyries.\nIn Anglo-Saxon culture Wyrd (Weird) is a concept corresponding to fate or personal destiny (literally: what befalls one). Its Norse cognate is Urðr, and both names are deriven from the PIE root \"wert\", \"to turn, wind\", related with \"spindle, distaff\". In Old English literature Wyrd goes ever as she shall, and remains wholly inevitable.\n\nIn Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", the Weird sisters (or Three Witches), are prophetesses, who are deeply entrenched in both worlds of reality and supernatural. Their creation was influenced by British folklore, witchcraft, and the legends of the Norns and the Moirai. Hecate, the chthonic Greek goddess associated with magic, witchcraft, necromancy, and three-way crossroads, appears as the master of the \"Three witches\". In Ancient Greek religion, Hecate as goddess of childbirth is identified with Artemis, who was the leader (ηγεμόνη: \"hegemone\" ) of the nymphs.\n\nIn Lithuanian mythology Laima is the personification of destiny, and her most important duty was to prophecy how the life of a newborn will take place. She may be related to the Hindu goddess Laksmi, who was the personification of wealth and prosperity, and associated with good fortune. In Latvian mythology, Laima and her sisters were a trinity of fate deities.\n\nThe Moirai were usually described as cold, remorseless and unfeeling, and depicted as old crones or hags. The independent \"spinster\" has always inspired fear rather than matrimony: \"this sinister connotation we inherit from the spinning goddess,\" write Ruck and Staples (Ruck and Staples 1994:). See weaving (mythology).\n\nThe notion of a universal principle of natural order has been compared to similar ideas in other cultures, such as aša, (Asha) in Avestan religion, Rta in Vedic religion, and Maat in Ancient Egyptian religion.\n\nIn the Avestan religion and Zoroastrianism, aša, is commonly summarized in accord with its contextual implications of \"truth\", \"right(eousness)\", \"order\". Aša and its Vedic equivalent, Rta, are both derived from a PIE root meaning \"properly joined, right, true\". The word is the proper name of the divinity Asha, the personification of \"Truth\" and \"Righteousness\". \"Aša\" corresponds to an objective, material reality which embraces all of existence. This cosmic force is imbued also with morality, as verbal Truth, and Righteousness, action conforming with the moral order. In the literature of the Mandeans, an angelic being has the responsibility of weighing the souls of the deceased to determine their worthiness, using a set of scales.\n\nIn the Vedic religion, Rta is an ontological principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe. The term is now interpreted abstractly as \"cosmic order\", or simply as \"truth\", although it was never abstract at the time. It seems that this idea originally arose in the Indo-Aryan period, from a con-sideration (so denoted to indicate the original meaning of communing with the star beings) of the qualities of nature which either remain constant or which occur on a regular basis.\n\nThe individuals fulfill their true natures when they follow the path set for them by the ordinances of \"Rta\", acting according to the Dharma, which is related to social and moral spheres. The god of the waters Varuna was probably originally conceived as the personalized aspect of the otherwise impersonal \"Ṛta\". The gods are never portrayed as having command over \"Ṛta\", but instead they remain subject to it like all created beings.\n\nIn Egyptian religion, maat was the ancient Egyptian concept of truth, balance, order, law, morality, and justice. The word is the proper name of the divinity Maat, who was the goddess of harmony, justice, and truth represented as a young woman. It was considered that she set the order of the universe from chaos at the moment of creation. Maat was the norm and basic values that formed the backdrop for the application of justice that had to be carried out in the spirit of truth and fairness.\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, Maat dealt with the weighing of souls that took place in the underworld. Her feather was the measure that determined whether the souls (considered to reside in the heart) of the departed would reach the paradise of afterlife successfully. In the famous scene of the Egyptian \"Book of the Dead\", Anubis, using a scale, weighs the sins of a man's heart against the feather of truth, which represents maat. If man's heart weighs down, then he is devoured by a monster.\n\nThe asteroids (97) Klotho, (120) Lachesis, and (273) Atropos are named for the Three Fates.\n\n\n\n"}

The charter was established on the foundation of the Helsinki Accords, and was further amended in the 1999 Charter for European Security. Together, these documents form the agreed basis for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. However, not all OSCE member countries have signed the treaty.\n\nThe Charter was one of many attempts to seize the opportunity of the fall of Communism by actively inviting the former Eastern bloc-countries into the ideological framework of the West. It has been compared to the Conference of Versailles of 1919 or the Congress of Vienna of 1815 in its grandiose ambition to reshape Europe. In effect, the Paris Summit was the peace conference of the Cold War: \"Perestroika\" had ultimately put an end to the ideological and political division of the Iron Curtain. Pluralist democracy and market economy were together with international law and multilateralism seen as the victors, and as the common values and principles of national and international conduct that now ruled from Vancouver to Vienna to Vladivostok.\n\nThe Charter established an \"Office for Free Elections\" (later renamed Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights) in Warsaw, a \"Conflict Prevention Centre\" in Vienna, and a secretariat. Later, in 1992, a Secretary General was also appointed. It was agreed that the Foreign Ministers are to convene regularly for political consultations.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher attended the summit while undergoing a challenge to her leadership of the country's ruling Conservative Party, and it was while in Paris that she learned she had not obtained sufficient votes in the first round of the party's leadership election to be declared the winner outright, necessitating a further round of voting. Thatcher later claimed that the fact she was in Paris and unable to begin immediately rallying support was one of the factors that led to her leaving the leadership election and resigning as party leader and Prime Minister.\n\n"}

Its members are drawn from the Council of Senior Scholars, of which it is a committee, and consist of the most senior Sunni scholars of fiqh in Saudi Arabia, including the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia as its head. The issuance of fataawa in Saudi Arabia is limited to members of the Council of Senior Scholars and a few other clerics.\n\nThe committee was established along with the Council of Senior Scholars by royal decree on August 29, 1971 (8th of Rajab 1391 AH) by King Faisal ibn Abd al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia. Under section four of the decree, it stated, \n\n\"“The Permanent Committee has been left the task of selecting its members from amongst the members of the Council (of Senior Scholars) in accordance with the Royal Decree. Its aim is to prepare research papers ready for discussion amongst the Council (of Senior Scholars), and issue fataawa on individual issues. This is by responding to the fatwa-seeking public in areas of 'aqeedah, 'ibaadah and social issues. It will be called: The Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and Fataawa (\"al-Lajnah ad-Daa'imah lil-Buhooth al-'Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa\".)”\"\n\nIt is possible to write to the Permanent Committee asking for a fatwa on a specific topic. Since its inception, the Permanent Committee has replied to Muslims not only in Saudi Arabia but in many other countries, seeking rulings in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) on a variety of questions, including Hadith (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad), Ibadah (worship), and Aqeedah (Islamic creed) issues. \n\nIn their fataawa, the Permanent Committee strive for thoroughness. All fataawa are derived from evidence from the three sources of Islamic knowledge: the Qur'an, authentic Sunnah, and understanding of the rightly guided companions of the Prophet Muhammad. The fataawa writers will usually explain all the potential Islamic viewpoints of an issue and will then explain, which in their view is the most authentic opinion based on the evidence. The fatwas issued by the committee have been arranged in a compendium of 32 volumes.\n\nIn 2010, Saudi King Abdullah decreed that only officially approved religious scholars would be allowed to issue fatwas in Saudi Arabia, namely the 21 member Council of Senior Scholars, the country's highest religious body, and the (four or five) member Permanent Committee, whose members are drawn from the Council of Senior Scholars. \nA new committee affiliated with the Permanent Committee and headed by one Saleh bin Mohammed al-Luhaydan was created by the Council of Senior Scholars to supervise the issuance of fatwas and prevent unauthorized scholars from issuing any. All imams and preachers were instructed by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs to abide by the edict and explain it their Friday sermons and violators were reprimanded. \nIn 2010, the Islamic fatwa website Islam-QA run by Saudi Islamic scholar Muhammad Al-Munajid was banned in Saudi Arabia due to the fact that it was issuing independent fatwas.\n\nIn 2011, a fatwa purported to have been issued by Grand Mufti stating that Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda were following the correct path in their efforts to reestablish the Islamic caliphate was denounced by the committee as a fabricated lie.\n\nA fatwa available in English on the government-run website of the committee reads, \"Whoever refuses to follow the straight path deserves to be killed or enslaved\" and \"it will be known that the origin of slavery is the capturing in Jihad against the disbelievers to correct those who were captured by isolating them from the evil environment they lived in \"\n\nAs of early 2014 the members of the committee include \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6335915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6335915", "title": "Registered agent", "text": "Registered agent\n\nIn United States business law, a registered agent, also known as a resident agent or statutory agent, is a business or individual designated to receive service of process (SOP) when a business entity is a party in a legal action such as a lawsuit or summons. The registered agent's address may also be where the state sends the paperwork for the periodic renewal of the business entity's charter (if required). The registered agent for a business entity may be an officer or employee of the company, or a third party, such as the organization's lawyer or a service company. Failure to properly maintain a registered agent can affect a company negatively.\n\nMost businesses are not individuals but instead business entities such as corporations or limited liability companies (LLCs). This is because there are substantive (and substantial) liability protections as well as tax advantages to being \"incorporated\" as opposed to being \"self-employed\".\n\nMost jurisdictions in the United States require that any business entity that is formed or doing business within their borders designate and maintain a \"registered agent\". This person may be known as the \"resident agent\" or \"statutory agent\", depending on the laws of the individual jurisdiction in which the business entity is registered. The purpose of a registered agent is to provide a legal address (not a P.O. Box) within that jurisdiction where there are persons available during normal business hours to facilitate legal service of process being served in the event of a legal action or lawsuit. Generally, the registered agent is also the person to whom the state government sends all official documents required each year for tax and legal purposes, such as franchise tax notices and annual report forms. It is the registered agent's job to forward these suit documents and notices to the entity itself. Registered agents generally will also notify business entities if their state government filing status is in \"good standing\" or not. The reason that these notifications are a desired function of a registered agent is that it is difficult for a business entity to keep track of legislative changes and report due dates for multiple jurisdictions given the disparate laws of different states.\n\nPenalties for not maintaining a registered agent generally will cause a jurisdiction to revoke a business’s corporate or LLC legal status as well as in some cases, assess additional penalty fees on the entity.\n\nIf a registered agent fails to perform their function, it can have dire consequences for the business entity. For example, if a customer fell inside a store and sued the store, and the store's registered agent failed to notify the business entity of a summons to appear in court to respond to the lawsuit, then when the case went to trial, nobody would appear to defend the store and the customer would win by a default judgment. Additionally, the store would likely not be able to get the judgment overturned on appeal because they had been properly served. This is one of the most common reasons that business entities generally will utilize a third party as their registered agent be it a commercial service company, an attorney, or in some cases, a CPA.\n\nThe person at the business entity that maintains contact with the registered agent is the corporate secretary or governance officer.\n\nDifferent states have different requirements for registered agents. Typically, the agent must be a natural person resident of the state in question or, in states that allow entities to serve as registered agents, an entity having a business office within the state and authorized to do business in the state. In some states a business entity is legally allowed to act as its own registered agent, if at least one of its officers is a resident of the state, but other jurisdictions may require that a business entity designate a third party as its registered agent.\nBecause most states permit one business entity to serve as a registered agent for others, some businesses exist to serve that exact function, charging a fee to act as the registered agent for hundreds or thousands of businesses in a given state.\n\nIn most all cases, the registered agent for a business entity is assigned in the formation documents filed in a jurisdiction when the entity is originally created. For example, a person forming a corporation in the State of Nevada or Delaware, would designate the registered agent along with the agent's address on the articles of incorporation filed with the Nevada Secretary of State or Delaware Secretary of State respectively. If the agent cannot sign the articles to be filed, some states such as Nevada provide that the registered agent may be designated using a separate \"Registered Agent Acceptance\" form with the appropriate acceptance and signature. A representative of the business or the individual accepting responsibility as registered agent must sign to accept the responsibility of acting as agent. In most states it is a crime to knowingly file a false document with the office of the Secretary of State, although the penalties vary widely. For example, in Nevada it is a Class \"D\" felony to forge this signature, but in Michigan it is only a misdemeanor.\n\nFor varying reasons a business entity might at some point wish to change their registered agent to another party after a registered agent has already been designated. This is accomplished by obtaining a form from the secretary of state where the business entity is registered, completing said form, and filing it with that state office along with any requisite fees which may vary from state to state. In some cases the required form may simply be a dedicated change of registered agent form, and in other cases, such as in Delaware, an actual amendment to the articles of the business entity must be filed.\n\nInformation about persons or entities that may be willing to act as registered agents/resident agents by state is usually maintained by the respective Secretary of State. Most states also offer free access to their databases to find a business entity's registered agent.\n\nThe \"Model Registered Agents Act\" (MoRAA) is an effort spearheaded by the American Bar Association Business Law Section and the International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA) – Business Organization Section (BOS) to standardize business entity laws as they relate to annual reports, registered agents and other laws and forms used to file business entities. The act also creates two distinct classes of registered agent: \"commercial\" and \"non-commercial.\" The National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) organized a drafting committee composed of commissions, ABA, and IACA representatives who drafted the act's language. NCCUSL adopted MoRAA at its 2006 annual meeting. It was amended in 2011. Eleven US jurisdictions (Arkansas, District of Columbia, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) have since adopted the model act, and Delaware did not adopt the act, but did adopt the \"commercial registered agent\" provision. The problem this effort seeks to alleviate is that disparate laws, filing requirements, and forms in all of the US jurisdictions where business entities are filed creates a quagmire for any company seeking to register to do business in those jurisdictions. By adopting a common set of laws, the Model Registered Agents Act seeks to create a uniform and simple process of filing and maintaining a business entity in any jurisdiction adopting it.\n\nSome state business entity laws name the Secretary of State's office or business entity filing office as the registered agent of last resort, in the event the named registered agent can't be found. By law, service may be made on the office if the entities registered agent can not be found. However, the plaintiff must demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to service the registered agent before it may serve the Secretary of State. The state laws vary in how to complete service on the Secretary of State and the amount of fees charged. Some of the states that may have this statutory provision are listed below. MoRAA eliminated this provision but some of the states that adopted MoRAA maintained this provision.\n"}

Fatwas are based on the question and answer process found in the Quran, which seeks to enlighten on theological and philosophical issues, hadith, legal theory, duties, and the Sharia law.\n\nWhile all sects of Islam recognise the Qur'an, they differ in which other authorities they acknowledge; in particular the question of the Succession to Muhammad separates the Sunni, who acknowledge the elected Rashidun Caliphs and their descendants, from the Shia, who acknowledge the Imams or descendants of Prophet Muhammad; these two branches are then subdivided by their views on the further course of the succession. Shia fiqh differs with Sunni fiqh on not only political issues, but also important theological issues. Various attitudes towards Shias can be found among the worldwide majority Sunni community.\n\nThe Sunni fatwas on Shias often involved legal opinions issued by an expert in the Sharia law. However, modern fatwas were also given by other Muslim authorities and these were recognized as long as they cite the legal sources used. Some of the notable fatwas are listed below:\n\nHowever, major Sunni scholars have declared the unbelief of Shias who hold certain beliefs. For example, Imam ibn Abidin, a source of authoritative fatwas for Hanafis writes:\n\nAccording to Imam Ahmad Raza, the founder of the Barelwi-movement, most Shiites of his day were apostates because they repudiated necessities of religion. This includes, according to him, the following:\n\nOther Sunni and Salafi scholars who have declared Shiites as deviants or apostates:\n\n\nThere are Sunni fatwas that were considered Sunni obligation to the \"insult offered to the Sunni faith by the Shia religious literature.\" This is demonstrated in the case of some Sunni fatwas issued in Pakistan, which were considered as defensive materials created for the purpose of defending the faith from the Shia. The latter's mere existence in the country within the context of these specific fatwas was considered as an insult.\n\nIn 1959, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mahmood Shaltoot issued fatwa that Shia theology is a part of Islam. In 2016, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahmed el-Tayeb reissued Shaltoot's fatwa on Shia Muslims, calling Shia the fifth school of Islam and seeing no problem with conversions from Sunni to Shia Islam.\n\nIn 2004, both Sunni and Shia scholars released the so-called 2004 Amman Message, which established some form of standards to prevent or at least discredit and counter renegade interpretations such as those made by Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This initiative outlined who are qualified to issue fatwas or legal opinions, promoting a more conservative framework over progressive interpretations. The Amman Message also asserted the common beliefs of the two Islamic sects.\n\nShaykh Faraz Rabbani has noted that it is not the way of Sunnis to make blanket takfir of Shias. He writes:\n\n"}

It is now preserved at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library in Hanover. In October 2015, the Golden Letter was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, as a common heritage of Myanmar, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\nKing Alaungpaya of Burma was one of the most influential rulers of his time in Southeast Asia. During this era, the British East India Company (EIC), founded in 1600, had established itself in India and was building up its economic and political influence. On the \"tenth day of the waxing Moon in the [Burmese] month Kason of the Sakkaraj-year 1118\" (7 May 1756 in the Gregorian calendar), Alaungpaya directed that four letters be drawn up by his chancery. One letter – the golden and thus the most important – was addressed to the British king, George II. The second was addressed to the director of the East India Company, the third to the British President of Madras, and the fourth to the headmaster of the island Negrais in the Irrawaddy River delta.\n\nTo avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretation of their contents, Alaungpaya had all the letters, which differed in both content and style depending on their respective recipients, already be translated in Rangoon, and sent these translations together with the originals. At the headquarters of the East India Company in London, the receipt of the letter was recorded.\n\nIn the Golden Letter, Alaungpaya offered to George II that the longstanding trade relationship between their countries be expanded. Among other things, this could be done by having the East India Company set up a fortified trading post at the harbor city Pathein on the southwestern coast of Burma. At the time of the letter's composition, the Company had only a minor outpost on the small island of Negrais. This was far away from trading routes, had no infrastructure to support it, and lay in an unhealthy climatic zone.\n\nThe fact that one king wrote to another to make such an offer in the form of a costly, artfully produced and decorated letter made from gold, showed on the one hand the importance and value of the offer, and on the other hand the generosity of this gesture. Both sides stood to profit: the sender could project his reputation externally, and burnish his own internal power. The recipient could further his economic strategy against the competition from the French East India Company (\"Compagnie française des Indes orientales\").\n\nThe recipient of the Golden Letter was George II, who was born in Hanover and belonged to the House of Welf. He was simultaneously the King of Great Britain and the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, joining these territories in personal union. The letter was next sent to Madras, where there were various delays causing it to arrive in London only in March 1758, almost two years after it was first sent.\n\nOne reason for the almost two-year delay could be the Seven Years' War, which broke out in 1756, the year that the letter was written. Great Britain was directly involved in the war. Alaungpaya sent the Golden Letter to George II together with another letter addressed to the directors of the East India Company. Both recipients, however, understood neither the contents nor the significance of the message, and therefore saw no reason to respond in a diplomatically measured manner. This initiative of the Burmese ruler was seen more as a curiosity, than as a serious political move by a less-powerful state. Alaungpaya not only received no reply to his offer, but had no acknowledgement that the letters had even arrived at their destinations. It is known that he saw this disregard for him as a serious insult.\n\nGeorge II sent the letter, considered to be a curiosity, to the library in his home city of Hanover, where it arrived three weeks later, albeit with an incorrect description. The error was due to Gerlach Adolph von Münchhausen, who was a Privy Counsellor to George II. Münchhausen described it, in a ministerial letter to the librarian at Hannover, Christian Ludwig Scheidt, as a diplomatic note in \"Indian\" (i.e. Sanskrit) from an Indian prince of the Coromandel Coast, whose religion forbade him from eating anything living and who worshipped fire. Thus was the letter archived. For the next 248 years, apart from an incident in 1768, the Golden Letter received no more attention. On 11 June 1768, the Danish prince (later King) Christian VII arrived in Hanover on his Grand Tour, where the Letter was shown to him. However, he accidentally damaged it. This damage is still visible today. The letter returned to obscurity. In 1867, Eduard Bodemann copied the erroneous description of the letter for his catalog of the \"Royal Library at Hanover\" under the shelf mark \"IV 571 a\".\n\nAlthough the Golden Letter was known to have existed, and transcripts could be found in various archives, until its \"rediscovery\" in 2006, it was unknown where the original was or whether it even still existed. Only after this rediscovery was the text translated, and its true significance recognized. In February 2013, the Golden Letter was registered in the German list of national cultural treasures, under the law for cultural protection (\"Kulturschutzgesetz\").\n\nThe rectangular letter measures 54.7 by 8.5 cm, and is 0.2 mm thick. Including the 24 rubies, its total weight is 100 g. Spectroscopic analysis by the Lower Saxony State Office for the Protection of Historical Monuments (\"Niedersächsichen Landesamt für Denkmalpflege\") found its fineness to be between 95.25 and 98.69%. The 24 egg-shaped rubies originate from a mine in the region of the Burmese city Mogok. Each ruby is held in a hexagonal setting of gold, measuring 6 by 6 mm.\n\nThe thin gold layer is bordered on both right and left sides of the text by two vertical rows of twelve rubies each. On the left edge is an embossed figure of the mythical bird Hamsa, the king's signet, in an octagonal, richly decorated field. The signet figure was pressed onto the letter.\n\nThe text of the letter runs from left to right. It is finely engraved in Burmese script in ten lines of equal length.\n\nThe packaging of this valuable document for delivery was chosen to be artistically lavish and expensive, as well as robust for the long journey. The Letter was originally rolled in red paper and then stored in a cylindrical ivory container. This lidded container was especially made from a hollowed-out and decorated tusk of a Burmese elephant (\"Elephas maximus indicus\"). Only some of the ornamentation can be recognized today. The container was itself placed in a kind of pouch made from brocade. This was itself inside a casket of polished wood, varnished with red resin and ornamented with gold. Attached to the casket was a piece of paper with the text in English. For protection, all these containers were further stowed in a robust red pouch while en route to London. Aside from the ivory cylinder, nothing remains of the other containers.\n\nDue to the entry in the Bodemann Catalogue under the shelf mark \"Ms IV 571a\", the existence of the Letter was always known within the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library (GWLB) and to researchers, not least because of transcripts in various archives. However, because of the erroneous description, the original received almost no attention for 250 years. In July 2005, Friedrich Hülsmann, the director of the Book- and Library-Systems department at the GWLB, invited Jacques Leider, a Luxembourg-born historian and Southeast Asia expert at the École française d'Extrême-Orient in Paris, to help with identifying the document. Until this time, it was thought to be a Sanskrit document because of the catalogue entry. At the first examination, Leider already determined that it was written in Burmese, and that its meaning had been completely misunderstood until then.\n\nJacques Leider was tasked in 2007 by the GWLB to research on the history of the Golden Letter. In addition to researching the history of the Letter and its \"fate\" in London, Leider translated the text and compared the original with other versions that exist as transcriptions in archives, e.g. in Myanmar. He published his results in 2009 in an extensive report. In 2013, the German Federal Foreign Office sponsored the 3D-digitization of the Letter through its cultural programme.\n\nThe choice of material and the quality of the handiwork are indicators of the status that the author attached to the contents of the Golden Letter and its recipient - and also to himself. The Letter could be the only example of its kind in the world today. That Great Britain, in the person of George II, was so uninterested in cooperating with Burma, could be put down to the geopolitical situation of the time. From 1756, Britain and other European states were involved in the Seven Years' War. It fought against several European states on different continents, and also in North America. Even the duchy of Hanover was involved on the British side in this conflict. Due to the years of conflicts, the East India Company withdrew from Burma and showed little interest in expanding its engagement there. Eventually, this together with many ill-advised political and military actions by Britain caused Alaungpaya to destroy the outpost on Negrais in the Irrawaddy Delta, which broke relations between the two states for decades.\n\nThe document also allowed a reassessment of the legacy of Alaungpaya, whose role was often oversimplified to that of a warrior, neglecting his actions in geopolitics and as a skilled international diplomat.\n\nAgainst this background, the Golden Letter of Alaungpaya is not only a unique artefact of art history, but also a window into the contemporary geopolitical relationship between Great Britain (and the East India Company in particular) and a resurgent Kingdom of Burma.\n\nIn 2014, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Library, the Myanmar Ministry for Culture, and the British Library sent their nomination of the Golden Letter as a documentary heritage to UNESCO for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register. This application was approved in October 2015, and the Golden Letter has been included in the Register since then.\n\nDue to a long renovation of the library building, the certificate from UNESCO was finally presented on 29 March 2017 by Verena Metze-Mangold, president of the UNESCO commission, to the library director Anne May. Present at the ceremony were Yin Yin Myint, Myanmar ambassador; Annabel Gallop, the curator of the Southeast Asian collection at the British Library; Prince Heinrich of Hanover representing the House of Welf; and Gabriele Heinen-Kljajić, State Minister for Science and Culture in Lower Saxony.\n\n\n"}

A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to citizenship and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.\n\nCulture and language differences are often encountered as obstacles, although there are exceptions. Where ethnic groups are divided between multiple sovereign states (irredentism or stateless nations) or places which once shared common citizenship are separated by borders of newly-independent nations (decolonisation), transnational marriages do not necessarily imply different cultures.\n\nIn an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.\n\nTransnational marriage may occur when someone from one country visits or lives in another country for school, work, political asylum, refuge, or due to their family relocating.\n\nIn general terms, reasons for transnational marriage include:\n\nObstacles to transnational marriage include:\n\nIn some cases, an ethnic group has no difference in culture or language but is artificially divided for geopolitical reasons. Places which once shared common nationality may have lost this status to decolonisation, but still share language or other identifiers.\n\nIn these cases, cultural or language barriers do not apply, aside from the possibility of dealing with the influence of a distinct dominant culture of the host country or countries. Depending on the countries, there may still be major issues in terms of legal status.\n\nIn more ancient times, some marriages between distinctly different tribes and nations were due to royalty trying to form alliances with or to influence other kingdoms or to dissuade marauders or slave traders. More recently, transnational marriages are due to globalization, with migration of labor, increased communication, and many more situations where foreigners come into contact with each other. It is also more common in some areas where class and tribal separations are becoming less strict. If one shares values that transcend culture, then it is easier to get married across cultures.\n\nHowever, there are many barriers and restrictions to cross-cultural, inter-tribal or racial, and particularly transnational, marriages. People tend to marry those similar to them, some even preferring to marry first cousins, whom they trust. In an interesting twist, transnational arranged marriage between cousins or relatives occur more often in some places with migration and family reunification policies, as some people still want their culture and family when marrying, even in a distant place.\n\nThe Bible and the Laws of Manu are two religious historical documents which give some insight into the views on transnational marriage in antiquity. In the Bible, Abraham's God warns the Israelites not to marry people from seven nations residing in the land of Canaan for fear that they would then proceed to worship the gods of the other nations.\n\nIntermarriage with other nations was permissible. There are several instances of transnational marriages in the Bible, such as Joseph being given Egyptian wives by Pharaoh, Rahab of Jericho marrying one of the Israelite spies she hid, Ruth the Moabite taking care of her mother-in-law Naomi, and King Solomon marrying Pharaoh's daughter, as well as many other foreign wives. King Solomon married to make alliances and keep the peace, and the others because they lived by each other. However, the difference in reaction to the transnational marriages is how the newcomers responded to the Abrahamic God. King Solomon was punished by God for facilitating his wives' worship of their own gods in Israel and then worshipping alongside them. Samson espoused a Philistine, who betrayed him to that nation. The book of Ezra tells of the response of the Jewish exiles to either separate from their foreign wives they had married in Babylon or be separated from the community of exiles when the exiles were trying to turn back to the Abrahamic God. Moses' sister, Miriam, criticizes him for marrying a Cushite woman. She is then stricken with leprosy for criticizing Moses (Numbers 12:1-10).\n\nThe Laws of Manu, a religious document for the Indo-Aryan Brahmins invading India, speaks of how to keep oneself clean but also intermarry with the indigenous peoples in order to create a caste system. A Nepali anthropologist writes on how a Brahmin man might marry four wives of different castes, and keep all the eating and living quarters of his different caste wives and children separate. His children and grandchildren, born to women of lower castes, will have even lower status and not be taught the laws. The only social mobility is downward.\nSimilarly, although no longer specifically due to transnational marriage, the interracial sexual contact in the Americas produced a system that defined social status by skin color, and is still followed by some people, but in particular those whom it subjugated. People would marry those with lighter skin color to keep their social status and were against marrying anyone of \"lower\" status, particularly around the time of belief that certain people were of a superior race than others.\n\nA slightly different perspective of interracial or transnational marriage is from those who tend to marry their cousins, sometimes even first cousins. They do so in order keep the family together socially and economically, thus disproving of marriage outside. Recently, this practice has become technically transnational due to differences in citizenship, even though the people are still family. An example of transnational marriage that kept the family together was among European royalty. Queen Victoria's grandchildren were all over Europe, keeping the royalty together. She was referred to as the \"grandmother of Europe.\" However, some of the resulting alliances brought nations into the Great War (World War I) which otherwise could have retained neutrality. More recent examples are from a mass migration from the less developed regions of the world to the more developed regions, helped by the policies of family reunification. A fairly common practice among South Asian immigrants to the UK or USA is to have arranged marriages to someone back \"home,\" in order to keep the culture and traditions within their family.\n\nToday, there is a mixed reaction to transnational marriage in some areas, especially as it continues to spread. Family reunification policies have upset some people in host countries, as people are less likely to assimilate if they continue to marry people from their home countries, thus keeping their cultures alive in the host cultures. Others are suspicious of transnational marriages, as they think the non-citizen spouse may use their marriage only to obtain legal status in the host country. Still others find their families torn apart if one spouse is detained or deported for legal reasons. There are many legal barriers and hurdles to cross in transnational marriage, as well as being allowed to remain living together in the same country.\n\nImmigrants may also take their families with them, meaning that their children grow up in different lands, learning a different culture and language often feeling more at home in the host country than their \"home\" country. These children, called third culture kids, often tend to feel affinity to those who have also lived in more than one country and culture, and tend to marry people of diverse backgrounds, regardless of nationality and citizenship.\n\nOthers decide on a transnational marriage without having lived long in their new country. Traveling has resulted in transnational relationships, marriages, and even families, although it is not known how common such results are.\n\nCurrently, it can be legally difficult to have a transnational marriage. There are many barriers, for example in Indonesia it can be very difficult for the married couple if the husband is not Indonesian. As a result of increasing transnational marriage, policy makers in various countries are starting to consider whether they should discourage or encourage transnational marriage.\n\nThe grounds given for discouraging transnational marriage are that:\n\nThe grounds given for encouraging transnational marriage are that:\n\nIn the United States federal law, International Marriage Broker Regulation Act regulates international marriage, primarily to restrict misuse of the institution of marriage to immigrate to the country.\n\nFrequent among Pashtun and Baloch tribes near the Durand Line where marriage between transborder corresponding their cultures are frequent. The straddling of people between the border has been a contentious ongoing issue between the two countries.\n\n\n19.

{"id": "17591326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17591326", "title": "Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum", "text": "Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum\n\nVilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum was a proposed art museum in the city of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. On April 8, 2008 an international jury named Zaha Hadid, a British-Iraqi architect, the winner of the international design competition for the museum. The museum was initially scheduled to open in 2011. Later, it was announced, that museum was scheduled to open in 2013. However, the project was postponed due to alleged illegal channeling of funds to the Jonas Mekas Arts Center and has been under investigation since 2010. The museum project, as of March 2012, was reported as having regained support, including that of the Vilnius mayor, Arturas Zuokas, even though the embezzlement inquiry was still ongoing.\n\nAs envisioned in 2008, Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum would have presented exhibitions of new media art, parts of the New York City anthology film archive, and Fluxus art. The Fluxus art movement flourished in New York during the 1960s, and was led by Lithuanian-born artist Jurgis Mačiūnas. Another important part of the exhibition would have been a collection of works by Lithuanian avant-garde film maker Jonas Mekas. These works are currently held by the Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center. Collections from Saint Petersburg's Hermitage Museum and New York City's Guggenheim Museum would have been displayed as well.\n\nIt is estimated that the museum would have cost up to 170 million litas (75 million USD). Completion was initially scheduled for 2011. A feasibility study was conducted to explore various aspects of the project's implementation, including market and economic impact analyses. However. due to corruption allegations, the entire project ended.\n\nThree architects submitted their designs for the final competition: Zaha Hadid, Massimiliano Fuksas, and Daniel Libeskind.\n\nDaniel Libeskind, winner of the competition to rebuild the World Trade Center, presented his work under the name \"Nexus\" (see Daniel Libeskind's visualization). According to Libeskind, his concept links the history of Vilnius to its present via a \"Connection\". He stated that \"This connection is revealed through the structure, which with its wide and slashing arcades covers history and innovation, old panoramas and new skyscrapers, the city and the Neris river\". Libeskind also asserted the need to connect nature and architecture: \"Tightness between landscape, which turns to building, and building, which converts to landscape, ravels unheard possibility to create a sculptural form, which opens to visitor\".\n\nThe dominant features of Massimiliano Fuksas' project are crossed domes, which leave an impression of movement (see Massimiliano Fuksas' visualization). According to Fuksas, huge \"eyes\" looking into the sky would point and filter daylight into the building. Fuksas asserted that such design principles would allow \"visitors to clearly distinguish the exposition halls from other spaces - restaurants and shops - and provide comfortable access to the river.\" The center of the building would be reserved for permanent Mekas and Mačiūnas collections.\n\nZaha Hadid, a Pritzker Prize winner, proposed a \"mystical object, hovering over spindled artificial landscape strip\" (see Zaha Hadid's visualization). She chose to draw a contrast between the building's forms and the vertical forms of nearby skyscrapers. The top of the building reflects surroundings of the Vilnius city. Hadid asserted that \"It is especially important today to acknowledge cultural buildings, that they have unique and special morphologies. Those buildings should make an impression on people, people should accept them.\"\n\nThe director of the Hermitage Museum Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation Thomas Krens, the director of Frankfurt's Museum of Architecture Peter Schmal, and the vice-chairman of the Lithuanian Architects Union, Gintaras Čaikauskas, were members of the jury that evaluated the designs. Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas and former Vilnius Mayor Juozas Imbrasas also participated in the decision-making process.\n\nThe Vilnius Guggenheim Initiative was ended after allegations of corruption involving the Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center, discovered after an audit by the National Audit Office of Lithuania. Finland then received the opportunity to develop the museum in Helsinki with no further chances to develop the museum in Vilnius.\n\n"}
