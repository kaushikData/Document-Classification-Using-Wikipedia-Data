It is served by the B on weekdays, the C train at all times except nights, and the A train during late nights only.\n\nThis station opened on September 10, 1932 as part of the opening of the first city-owned subway line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line. On this date, the line opened from Chambers Street north to 207th Street. Construction of the whole line cost $191,200,000. While the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line already provided parallel service, the new Eighth Avenue subway via Central Park West provided an alternative route.\n\nThe station was renovated in 1998–2000, in coordination with building the new Hayden Planetarium, within the Rose Center for Earth and Space. The floors were replaced, new lighting installed, the token booth upgraded, and the walls and staircases re-tiled. Structural improvements were also made during the renovation.\n\nThis underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. On this section of the line, the local tracks are stacked, uptown above downtown, and the express tracks are stacked in the same order to the east of them, so both platforms are on the west side, one above the other. The station is at Central Park West and 81st Street, rather than the major crosstown 79th Street, in order to accommodate the American Museum of Natural History, which largely fills the area of what was once called the Manhattan Square. The 79th Street Transverse Road, through Central Park, exits the park here.\n\nSouth of this station are storage/lay up tracks between the local and express tracks on each level. Both ends of the tracks merge with the express tracks, with switches to the local tracks.\n\nThere are two fare control areas, both on the upper platform. One is at the station's extreme south end, on Central Park West midblock between 77th and 81st Streets. From this fare control, a passageway leads to a staircase on the west side of Central Park West, just south of the American Museum of Natural History's front entrance. This fare control also has an underground entrance directly into the museum's lowest level. The other is at the station's north end, at Central Park West and West 81st Street. Two staircases lead to either western corner of the intersection (one to each corner).\n\nIn 1976, with funding from the Exxon Corporation, this station, as well as three others citywide, received new \"artfully humorous graffiti\" murals and artwork. Local designer Mayers and Schiff received $5,000 to add murals of dinosaurs such as \"Thesaurus Rex, the dinosaur that had a vocabulary of a thousand words\" and \"Elongatomus, an elongated critter that stretched from coast to coast whose pelvic remains support a highway interchange in Missouri.\"\n\nAs part of the 1998–2000 station renovation, a program of tile mosaics was undertaken, covering the stairs and platforms, extending to floor inlays. Stairwells evoke descending into the geological strata of the Earth (at 81st Street) or into the Ocean (79th Street). Many creatures are evoked in mosaic vignettes that punctuate the stretches of white tiled wall. Fossil casts seem to emerge from the tiles as though the subway platform itself were an excavation, which it actually is. Under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s Arts for Transit program, a mixed-media installation was created in 2000. Entitled \"For Want of a Nail\", named after the old proverb, it addresses the interconnections of entities that are as vast as a galaxy and as small as a single cell. Using ceramic tile, glass tile, glass mosaic, bronze relief, and granite as primary materials, the design team depicted the evolution of extinct, existing and endangered life forms, from single celled organisms to the towering \"T. rex\" dinosaur. It shows images and symbols ranging from the Earth's core, to the sea, the sky and the cosmos beyond. No artist has been identified in this group project.\n\n"}

{"id": "251188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251188", "title": "Adhan", "text": "Adhan\n\nThe adhan, athan, or azaan ( ) (also called in Turkish: \"Ezan\") is the Islamic call to worship, recited by the \"muezzin\" at prescribed times of the day. The root of the word is \"ʾadhina\" meaning \"to listen, to hear, be informed about\". Another derivative of this word is \"ʾudhun\" (), meaning \"ear\".\n\n\"Adhan\" is called out by a \"muezzin\" from the mosque five times a day, traditionally from the minaret, summoning Muslims for mandatory (\"fard\") worship (\"salat\"). A second call, known as \"iqama\", (set up) then summons Muslims to line up for the beginning of the prayers. The main purpose behind the multiple loud pronouncements of \"adhan\" in every mosque is to make available to everyone an easily intelligible summary of Islamic belief. In modern times, loudspeakers have been installed on minarets for this purpose.\n\nThe \"adhan\" recites the \"Takbir\" (God is great) followed by the \"Shahada\" (There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God). This statement of faith, called the \"Kalimah\", is the first of the Five Pillars of Islam.\n\nThe muezzin (\"mu'aḏḏin\")–is the person who recites the \"adhan\" from the mosque. Typically in modern times, this is done using a microphone: a recitation that is consequently broadcast to the speakers usually mounted on the higher part of the mosque's minarets, thus calling those nearby to prayer. The message can also be recorded, as is the case for London Central Mosque.\n\nThe muezzin is chosen for his talent and ability in reciting the \"adhan\" beautifully, melodiously and loudly for all Muslims to hear. This is one of the important duties in the mosque, as his companions and community rely on him in his call for Muslims to come to pray in congregation. The Imam leads the prayer five times a day. The first muezzin in Islam was Bilal ibn Rabah, a freed slave of Abyssinian heritage.\n\nSunnis state that the adhan was not written or said by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, but by one of his \"Sahabah\" (his companions). Umar, a prominent sahabi of Muhammad, had a vision in his dream, in which the call for prayers was revealed to him by God. He later related this to his companions. Meanwhile, this news reached Muhammad, and he liked it and confirmed it. Because of his stunning voice Muhammad chose a freed Habeshan slave by the name of Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi to make the call for prayers. Muhammad preferred the call better than the use of bells (as used by the Christians) and horns (as by the Jews).\n\nDuring the Friday prayer \"(Salat Al Jumu'ah)\", there is one adhan but some Sunni Muslims increase it to two adhans; the first is to call the people to the mosque, the second is said before the Imam begins the \"khutbah\" (sermon). Just before the prayers start, someone amongst the praying people recites the \"iqama\" as in all prayers. The basis for this is that at the time of the Caliph Uthman he ordered two adhans to be made, the first of which was to be made in the marketplace to inform the people that the Friday prayer was soon to begin, and the second adhan would be the regular one held in the mosque. Not all Sunnis prefer two adhans as the need for warning the people of the impending time for prayer is no longer essential now that the times for prayers are well known.\n\nShi'a sources state Muhammad, according to God's command, ordered the adhan as a means of calling Muslims to prayer. Shi'a Islam teaches that no one else contributed, or had any authority to contribute, towards the composition of the adhan.\n\nOther Shi'a sources state that Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi was, in fact, the first person to recite the adhan publicly out loud in front of the Muslim congregation.\n\nThe fundamental phrase \"lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh\" is the foundation stone of Islam along with the belief in it. It declares that \"there is no god but the God\". This is the confession of \"Tawhid\" or the \"doctrine of Oneness [of God]\".\n\nThe phrase \"Muḥammadun rasūlu llāh\" fulfills the requirement that there should be someone to guide in the name of God, which states Muhammad is God's Messenger,\"rasūl\", \"nabi\" (prophet). This is the acceptance of prophethood or \"Nabuwat\" of Muhammad.\nMuhammad declared Ali (Ali bin Abu Talib) as his successor, at Ghadir Khumm, which was required for the continuation of his guidance. According to the hadith of the pond of Khumm, Muhammad stated that \"Of whomsoever I am the mawla, Ali is his mawla\". Hence, it is recommended to recite the phrase \"ʿalīyun walī llāh\" means \"Ali is His (God's) \"Wali\" \"the headman.\"\n\nIn one of the Qiblah of Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah (1035–1094) of Fatemi era masjid of Qahira (Mosque of Ibn Tulun) engraved his name and \"kalimat ash-shahādah\" as \"lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh, muḥammadun rasūlu llāh, ʿalīyun walī llāh\".\n\nAdhan reminds Muslims of these three Islamic teaching \"Tawhid\", \"Nabuwat\" and \"Imamate\" before each prayer. These three emphasise devotion to God, Muhammad and Imam, which are considered to be so linked together that they can not be viewed separately; one leads to other and finally to God.\n\nThe phrase is optional to some Shia as justified above. They feel that Ali's \"Valayat\" is self-evident, a testification and need not be declared. However, the greatness of God is also taken to be self-evident, but Muslims still declare \"Allāhu ʾakbar\" to publicize their faith. This is the reason that the most Shia give for the recitation of the phrase regarding Ali.\n\nWhile listening to the adhan, Muslims repeat the same words silently, except when the muezzin says:\" حي على الصلاة or حي على الفلاح \" (\"ḥayya ʿalā ṣ-ṣalāh or ḥayya ʿala l-falāḥ\") they silently say:\" لا حولا و لا قوة إلا بالله \" (\"lā ḥawla wa lā quwata ʾillā bi-llāh\") (there is no strength or power except from God).\n\nImmediately following the Adhan, Muslims recite the following dua (supplications):\n\n1. \".\n\nWa ʾanaa ʾašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāhu waḥdahu lā šarīka lahu wa-ʾanna muḥammadan ʿabduhu wa-rasūluhu, raḍītu bi-llāhi rabban wa-bi-muḥammadin rasūlan wa-bi-lʾislāmi dīnan.\n\nEnglish: I bear witness that there is no god but God alone with no partner and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and the Lord God's chosen messenger is Muhammad and Islam is his religion.\n\n2.

Muhammad's name is invoked requested:\n\n،ﺍﻟﻠﻬﻢ ﺭﺏ ﻫﺬﻩ ﺍﻟﺪﻋﻮﺓ ﺍﻟﺘﺎﻣﺔ ﻭﺍﻟﺼﻼﺓ ﺍﻟﻘﺎﺋﻤﺔ\nﺁﺕ ﻣﺤﻤﺪﺍ ﺍﻟﻮﺳﻴﻠﺔ ﻭﺍﻟﻔﻀﻴﻠﺔ ﻭﺍﺑﻌﺜﻪ ﺍﻟﻤﻘﺎﻡ ﺍﻟﻤﺤﻤﻮﺩ ﺍﻟﺬﻱ ﻭﻋﺪﺗﻪ\n\n\"Allāhumma rabba haḍihi d-daʿawati t-tammah wa-ṣ-ṣalāti l-qaʾimah, ʾāti muḥammadan al-wasīlata wa-l-faḍīlah wa-bʿaṯhu l-maqalam al-maḥmūdan illaḍī waʿadtah\"\n\n4. Dua are then made directly to God, between the adhan and the iqamaah.\n\nAccording to Abu Dawud, Muhammad said: \"Repeat the words of the muezzin and when you finish, ask God what you want and you will get it\".\n\nEach phrase is followed by a longer pause and is repeated one or more times according to fixed rules. During the first statement each phrase is limited in tonal range, less melismatic, and shorter. Upon repetition the phrase is longer, ornamented with melismas, and may possess a tonal range of over an octave. The adhan's form is characterised by contrast and contains twelve melodic passages which move from one to another tonal center of one maqam a fourth or fifth apart. The tempo is mostly slow; it may be faster and with fewer melismas for the sunset prayer. During festivals, it may be performed antiphonally as a duet.\n\nIn 2016, opposition leader Khaleda alleged that the government were obstructing the broadcasting of adhans through loudspeakers, citing security concerns for the prime minister Sheikh Hasina\".\n\nIn 2016, Israel’s ministerial committee approved a draft bill that limits the volume of the use of public address systems for calls to prayer, particularly, outdoor loudspeakers for adhaan, citing it as a factor of noise pollution. The bill was submitted by Knesset member Motti Yogev of the far right Zionist party Jewish Home and Robert Ilatov of the right wing Yisrael Beiteinu. The ban is meant to affect three mosques in Abu Dis village of East Jerusalem, disbarring them from broadcasting the morning call (fajr) prayers. The bill was backed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said: “I cannot count the times — they are simply too numerous — that citizens have turned to me from all parts of Israeli society, from all religions, with complaints about the noise and suffering caused to them by the excessive noise coming to them from the public address systems of houses of prayer.” The Israel Democracy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, expressed concerns that it specifically stifles the rights of Muslims, and restricts their freedom of religion.\n\nAs an extension of the reforms brought about by the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turkish government at the time, encouraged by Atatürk, introduced secularism to Turkey. The program involved implementing a Turkish adhan program as part of its goals, as opposed to the conventional Arabic call to prayer. Following the conclusion of said debates, the Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı) released an official mandate on July 18, 1932, announcing the decision to all the mosques across Turkey, and the practice was continued for a period of 18 years.\n\nOn July 16, 1950, a new government was sworn in, led by Adnan Menderes, which restored Arabic as the liturgical language.\n\nThe Fittja Mosque (in Botkyrka south of Stockholm) was in 2013 the first mosque to be granted permission for a weekly public call to Friday prayer, on condition that the sound volume does not exceed 60 dB. In Karlskrona (province of Blekinge, southern Sweden) the Islamic association built a minaret in 2017 and has had weekly prayer calls since then. The temporary mosque in Växjö filed for a similar permission in February 2018, which sparked a nationwide debate about the practice.\n\nThe adhan is mentioned in the eighth verse of İstiklâl Marşı, the Turkish national anthem:\n\nThe adhan appears in \"The Armed Man: A Mass For Peace\" composed by Karl Jenkins.\n\n\n"}

According to the government and activists it was conducted by the al-Nusra Front. The U.S. State Department condemned massacres in Syria and condemned 'the latest report of a massacre of civilians in Adra.'\n\nOn 11 December, the rebel Islamic Front, Jaish al-Islam and Al-Nusra Front groups infiltrated the industrial area of the town of Adra, northeast of Damascus, attacking buildings housing workers and their families. The fighters were reported to have targeted Alawites, Druze, Christians and Shiites, killing them for sectarian motives. Some people were shot while others were beheaded. The killings lasted into the next day. 15–19 minority civilian deaths were documented by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, amidst claims that as many as 40 were killed and many families abducted. 18 pro-government militia were also killed, including five Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA) members. Several rebels died when a Shiite man detonated a hand grenade, killing himself, the rebels and members of his family, after the rebels attempted to kill them.\n\nOn 13 December, the military surrounded Adra and started an operation to push out rebel fighters from the area, making advances in the town during the day. As of the next day, the operation was still continuing.\n\nBy 15 December, the number of minority civilians confirmed killed in the rebel attack on Adra had risen to 32. Dozens of others were missing. The Syrian military claimed more than 80 people were killed by Islamic rebels, while the Syrian Foreign Ministry put out a figure of more than 100 dead.\n\nOn 30 December, reports said that the Syrian army evacuated around 5,000 people from Adra, while on 31 December, the government news agency reported that more people were evacuated, bringing the total number of evacuees to more than 6,000.\n\nBy mid-January, the Syrian government had reportedly regained control of the industrial area of Adra.

{"id": "666585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666585", "title": "Befana", "text": "Befana\n\nIn Italian folklore, Befana () is an old woman who delivers gifts to children throughout Italy on Epiphany Eve (the night of January 5) in a similar way to St Nicholas or Santa Claus.\n\nA popular belief is that her name derives from the Feast of Epiphany or in Catholic \"La Festa dell'Epifania\". \"Epifania\" is a Latin word with Greek origins meaning \"manifestation (of the divinity).\" Some suggest that Befana is descended from the Sabine/Roman goddess named Strenia.\n\nIn popular folklore Befana visits all the children of Italy on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany to fill their socks with candy and presents if they are good, or a lump of coal or dark candy if they are bad. In many poorer parts of Italy and in particular rural Sicily, a stick in a stocking was placed instead of coal. Being a good housekeeper, many say she will sweep the floor before she leaves. To some the sweeping meant the sweeping away of the problems of the year. The child's family typically leaves a small glass of wine and a plate with a few morsels of food, often regional or local, for the Befana.\n\nShe is usually portrayed as a hag riding a broomstick through the air wearing a black shawl and is covered in soot because she enters the children's houses through the chimney. She is often smiling and carries a bag or hamper filled with candy, gifts, or both.\n\nShe is also referred to as the Christmas Witch.\n\nChristian legend had it that Befana was approached by the biblical magi, also known as the Three Wise Men (or the three kings) a few days before the birth of the Infant Jesus. They asked for directions to where the Son of God was, as they had seen his star in the sky, but she did not know. She provided them with shelter for a night, as she was considered the best housekeeper in the village, with the most pleasant home. The magi invited her to join them on the journey to find the baby Jesus, but she declined, stating she was too busy with her housework. Later, La Befana had a change of heart, and tried to search out the astrologers and Jesus. That night she was not able to find them, so to this day, La Befana is searching for the little baby. She leaves all the good children toys and candy (\"caramelle\") or fruit, while the bad children get coal (\"carbone\"), onions or garlic.\n\nAnother Christian legend takes a slightly darker tone as La Befana was an ordinary woman with a child whom she greatly loved. However, her child died, and her resulting grief maddened her. Upon hearing news of Jesus being born, she set out to see him, delusional that he was her son. She eventually met Jesus and presented him with gifts to make him happy. The infant Jesus was delighted, and he gave La Befana a gift in return; she would be the mother of every child in Italy.\n\nPopular tradition tells that if one sees La Befana one will receive a thump from her broomstick, as she doesn't wish to be seen. This aspect of the tradition may be designed to keep children in their beds.\n\nAnother commonly heard Christian legend of La Befana starts at the time of the birth of baby Jesus. Befana spends her days cleaning and sweeping. One day the magi, also known as the three wise men, came to her door in search of baby Jesus. Befana turned them away because she was too busy cleaning. Befana notices a bright light in the sky; she thinks this is the way to baby Jesus. She brought some baked goods and gifts for baby Jesus in her bag and took her broom to help the new mother clean and began her search for baby Jesus. She searched and searched for Baby Jesus, but never found him. Befana still searches today, after all these centuries. On the eve of the Epiphany, Befana comes to a house where there is a child and leaves a gift. Although she has been unsuccessful in her search, she still leaves gifts for good young children because the Christ Child can be found in all children.\n\nBefana was never a widespread tradition among the whole Italian people, having originated in Rome and having only become well known and practiced by the rest of the population during the 20th century.\n\nMany people believe that the name Befana is derived from the Italians' mispronunciation of the Greek word \"epifania\" or \"epiphaneia\" (Greek, επιφάνεια = appearance, surface, English: epiphany). Others point to the name being a derivative of Bastrina, the gifts associated with the goddess Strina. In the book \"Domestic Life in Palestine\", by Mary E. Rogers (Poe & Hitchcock, 1865) the author notes:\n\nA theory connects the tradition of exchanging gifts to an ancient Roman festivity in honour of Ianus and Strenia (in Italian a Christmas gift used to be called \"strenna\"), celebrated at the beginning of the year, when Romans used to give each other presents.\n\nIn the book \"Vestiges of Ancient Manners and Customs, Discoverable in Modern Italy and Sicily\" (1823), John J. Blunt says:\n\nThe tradition of Befana appears to incorporate other pre-Christian popular elements as well, adapted to Christian culture and related to the celebration of the New Year. Historian Carlo Ginzburg relates her to Nicevenn. The old lady character should then represent the \"old year\" just passed, ready to be burned in order to give place to the new one. In many European countries the tradition still exists of burning a puppet of an old lady at the beginning of the New Year, called Giubiana in Northern Italy, with clear Celtic origins. Italian anthropologists Claudia and Luigi Manciocco, in their book \"Una casa senza porte\" (\"A House without Doors\") trace Befana's origins back to Neolithic beliefs and practices. The team of anthropologists also wrote about Befana as a figure that evolved into a goddess associated with fertility and agriculture.\n\nBefana also maintains many similarities with Perchta and her Pre-Christian Alpine traditions.\n\nThe Befana is celebrated throughout all of Italy, and has become a national icon. In the regions of the Marches, Umbria and Latium, her figure is associated with the Papal States, where the Epiphany held the most importance. Urbania is thought to be her official home. Every year there is a big festival held to celebrate the holiday. About 30,000 to 50,000 people attend the festivities. Hundreds of Befanas are present, swinging from the main tower. They juggle, dance and greet all the children.\n\nTraditionally, all Italian children may expect to find a lump of \"coal\" in their stockings (actually rock candy made black with caramel coloring), as every child has been at least occasionally bad during the year.\n\nThree places in Italy are nowadays associated with the Befana tradition:\n\n\nIn other parts of the world where a vibrant Italian community exists, traditions involving Befana may be observed and shared or celebrated with the wider community. In Toronto, Canada for example, a Befana Choir shows up on Winter Solstice each December to sing in the Kensington Market Festival of Lights parade. Women, men, and children dressed in La Befana costume and nose sing love songs to serenade the sun to beckon its return. The singing hags gather in the street to give candy to children, to cackle and screech to accordion music, and to sing in every key imaginable as delighted parade participants join in the cacophony. Sometimes, the Befanas dance with parade goers and dust down the willing as parade goers walk by.\n\nThere are poems about Befana, which are known in slightly different versions throughout Italy. Here is one of the versions:\n\"La Befana vien di notte\"<br>\n\"Con le scarpe tutte rotte\"<br>\n\"Col vestito alla romana\"<br>\n\"Viva, Viva La Befana!\"\nThe English translation is:\n\"The Befana comes by night\"<br>\n\"With her shoes all tattered and torn\"<br>\n\"She comes dressed in the Roman way\"<br>\n\"Long live the Befana!\"\n\nAnother version is given in a poem by Giovanni Pascoli:\n\"Viene, viene la Befana\"<br>\n\"Vien dai monti a notte fonda\"<br>\n\"Come è stanca! la circonda \"<br>\n\"Neve e gelo e tramontana!\"<br>\n\"Viene, viene la Befana\"<br>\nThe English translation is:\n\"Here comes, here comes the Befana\"<br>\n\"She comes from the mountains in the deep of the night\"<br>\n\"Look how tired she is! All wrapped up\"<br>\n\"In snow and frost and the north wind!\" <br>\n\"Here comes, here comes the Befana!\"<br>\n\n"}

It is written in Latin.\n\nThe original chronicle covers the timeframe of 826 to c. 1140. A later addition from King Valdemar I's time, of a few more pages, takes the chronicle to 1157 when King Valdemar I gains the throne of Denmark; these additional pages are mostly direct quotes from other sources.\n\nThe author is unknown, but it is thought he must have had some relationship to Roskilde Cathedral, as he is very confident with matters dealing with Roskilde. Churchly matters are not of special interest to him; he writes vividly about all kinds of matters happening around him. Events themselves are only briefly covered while people taking part in them or even causing them are throughout covered with great passion.\n\nUnlike Saxo's \"Gesta Danorum\" or Svend Aagesen's \"Brevis Historia Regum Dacie\", \"Chronicon Roskildense\" often covers the 'losing' side in these very same events told by Saxo and Svend Aggesen. At times the author can seem very bitter and blinded by politic; however, this fact also makes this chronicle a very interesting piece of work.\n\nThe early part of the work is in many cases based on Adam of Bremen's \"Descriptio insularum Aquilonis\", sometimes even direct quotes. The author only takes what he needs, however, and the meaning is not always the same.\n\nAs with many Danish chronicles, the exact time of writing is not known with certainty. The original chronicle ends very suddenly. Olaf \"II\" Haraldsen, son of Harald Kesja, is still alive as of the writing; he is killed in 1143. The last subject written about is and Eskil's quarrel over the Archbishop seat of Lund in 1137 and 1138. With these in mind, the book must have been finished between 1138 and 1143.\n\nThe original manuscript is lost today and the chronicle exists now only in copies made in the 13th, 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nLatin copies reside in:\n\n"}

Other less used terms are \"sandwich thesis\" and \"stapler thesis\". It is composed of already-published journal articles, conference papers and book chapters, and occasional not yet published manuscripts. A thesis by publication is a form of compilation thesis (a term used in Nordic countries). Another form of compilation thesis is an essay thesis, comprising previously unpublished independent essays.\n\nToday, article theses are the standard format in natural, medical, and engineering sciences (for example in the Nordic countries), while in social and cultural sciences, there is a strong but decreasing tradition to produce coherent monographs i.e. thesis as a series of linked chapters. Other times, doctoral students may have a choice between writing a monograph or a compilation thesis.\n\nThe thesis by published works format is chosen in cases where the student intends to first publish the thesis in parts in international journals. It often results in a higher number of publications during the doctoral studies than a monograph and may render in higher number of citations in other research publications; something that may be advantageous from research funding point of view and may facilitate readership appointment after the dissertation. A further reason for writing a compilation thesis is that some of the articles can be written together with other authors, which may be helpful especially for new doctoral students. A majority of the articles should be reviewed by referees outside the student’s own department, supplementing the audit carried out by the supervisory staff and dissertation opponent, thus assuring international standards.\n\nThe introductory or summary chapters of a thesis by published works should be written independently by the student. They should include an extensive annotated bibliography or literature review, placing the scope and results of the articles in the wider context of current state of the international research. They constitute a comprehensive summary of the appended papers, and should clarify the contribution of the doctoral student if the papers are written by several authors. They should not provide new results, but may provide synthesis of new conclusions by combining results from several of the papers. They may supplement the articles with a motivation of the chosen scope, research problems, objectives and methods, and a strengthening of the theoretical framework, analysis and conclusions, since the extent of the articles normally does not allow this kind of longer discussions.\n"}

This collection was expanded in the 20th century with new acquisitions, transfers from other museums, and new archaeological discoveries.\n\nThe Palace Museum is housed in the Forbidden City, the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is located in the middle of Beijing, China. For almost five centuries, it served as the home of the Emperor and his household, and the ceremonial and political centre of Chinese government.\n\nBuilt from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 surviving buildings with 8,707 bays of rooms and covers 720,000 square metres. The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.\n\nBuilt from 1406 to 1420, the Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the early Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. In 1912, Puyi, the last Emperor of China, abdicated. Under an agreement with the new Republic of China government, Puyi remained in the Inner Court, while the Outer Court was given over to public use, where a small museum was set up to display artifacts housed in the Outer Court. In 1924, Puyi was evicted from the Inner Court after a coup.\nThe Palace Museum was then established in the Forbidden City on Double Ten Day (October 10), 1925.\n\nThe collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17 million pieces of art were stored in the Forbidden City. In addition, the imperial libraries housed countless rare books and historical documents, including government documents of the Ming and Qing dynasties.\n\nFrom 1933, the threat of Japanese invasion forced the evacuation of the most important parts of the Museum's collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Communists' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek ordered the evacuation of the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artifacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. This relatively small but high quality collection today form the core of that museum. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum.\n\nUnder the government of the People's Republic of China, the Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public.\n\nIn recent years, the presence of commercial enterprises in the Forbidden City has become controversial. A Starbucks store, which opened in 2000, sparked objections and eventually closed on July 13, 2007. Chinese media also took notice of a pair of souvenir shops that refused to admit Chinese citizens in order to price-gouge foreign customers in 2006.\n\nToday, there are over a million rare and valuable works of art in the permanent collection of the Palace Museum, including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. According to an inventory of the Museum's collection conducted between 2004 and 2010, the Palace Museum holds a total of 1,807,558 artifacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected \"valuable cultural relics.\"\n\nThe Palace Museum holds 340,000 pieces of ceramics and porcelain. As well as other pieces, these include imperial collections from the Tang Dynasty and the Song Dynasty, as well as pieces commissioned by the Palace, and, sometimes, by the Emperor personally. This collection is notable because it derives from the imperial collection, and thus represents the best of porcelain production in China; other large collections are in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Nanjing Museum.\n\nThe ceramic collection of the Palace Museum represents a comprehensive record of Chinese ceramic production over the past 8,000 years, as well as one of the largest such collections in the world.\n\nThe Palace Museum holds close to 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date from before the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368). This is the largest such collection in China and includes some of the rarest and most valuable paintings in Chinese history.\n\nThe collection is based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that one of the most important collections of paintings in Chinese history was held at the palace. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, some of the best parts of the collection were moved to Taiwan. The collection has since been gradually replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.\n\nBronze holds an important place in Chinese culture, and was always an important part of state ceremony. The Palace Museum's bronze collection dates from the early Shang Dynasty. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1600 are inscribed items from the pre-Qin period (to 221 BC). A significant part of the collection is ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court, including complete sets of musical instruments used by the imperial orchestras.\n\nThe Palace Museum has one of the largest collections of mechanical timepieces of the 18th and 19th centuries in the world, with more than 1,000 pieces. The collection contains both Chinese- and foreign-made pieces. Chinese pieces came from the palace's own workships, Guangzhou (Canton) and Suzhou (Suchow). Foreign pieces came from countries including Britain, France, Switzerland, the United States and Japan. Of these, the largest portion come from Britain.\n\nNotable pieces in the collection include a clock with an attached automaton which is able to write, with a miniature writing brush on inserted paper, an auspicious couplet in perfect Chinese calligraphy.\n\nJade has a unique place in Chinese culture. The Museum's collection, mostly derived from the imperial collection, includes some 30,000 pieces. The pre-Yuan Dynasty part of the collection includes several pieces famed throughout history, as well as artifacts from more recent archaeological discoveries. The earliest pieces date from the Neolithic period. Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty pieces, on the other hand, include both items for palace use, as well as tribute items from around the Empire and beyond.\n\nIn addition to works of art, a large proportion of the Museum's collection consists of the artifacts of the imperial court. This includes items used by the imperial family and the palace in daily life, as well as various ceremonial and bureaucratic items important to government administration. This comprehensive collection preserves the daily life and ceremonial protocols of the imperial era.\n\n\n"}

The modern era of 35 mm cameras dates to 1972, when Arri's Arriflex 35BL and Panavision's original Panaflex models emerged as the first self-blimped, lightweight cameras. Another distinguishing characteristic of modern cameras is the adoption of stronger lens mount seatings secured with a breech lock – namely the Arri PL and PV mount, both of which were designs descended from the BNCR mount of Mitchell cameras.\n\n\n\n\n\n16 mm film occupies a rather curious position within filmmaking – with a wide range encompassing virtually every field – amateur home movies, student films, experimental films, television work, commercials, music videos, corporate films, industrial research, medical applications, and lower budget features. Its robust image quality in relation to its size allows for a much more versatile, accessible, and affordable usage in many fields where neither 35 mm nor Super 8 would be well-suited. Despite current challenges from the burgeoning digital video market, the consistent improvement of cameras, lenses, and film stocks have enabled the Super 16 format to flourish recently, with many labs reporting increased usage. The modern era of 16 mm cameras is concurrent with that of 35 mm for both the same reasons as 35 mm as well as an additional change: the creation of the Super 16 format by Rune Ericsson in 1971. The format expanded the usable film negative horizontally, which required a larger film gate and necessitated either specialized conversion of machined parts or purchase of new cameras designed with Super 16 gates. Since the format took more than a decade to slowly standardize, the competition from both high and low end video cameras has decimated the demand for 16 mm cameras for most non-professional usage. Therefore, there are relatively few Super 16 cameras, although most are considered professional-grade.\n\n\n"}

The museum was originally located in Central City, but was relocated to Keystone City after the original was destroyed by Hunter Zolomon. The museum was last destroyed in \"The Flash\" vol. 2, #196 (May 2003), and a rebuilt museum is shown in \"The Flash\" vol. 2, #208 (May 2004). After the death of the fourth Flash (Bart Allen), a statue of him was constructed with a candlelight vigil in his memory being held shortly thereafter. Bart's statue was vandalized and later destroyed by Superman-Prime, who holds a grudge against Bart for his initial defeat during the events of \"Infinite Crisis\".\n\nThe museum features various exhibits about the Flash, including his battles and his rogues gallery of foes.

{"id": "511197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511197", "title": "Group attribution error", "text": "Group attribution error\n\nThe group attribution error refers to people's tendency to believe either (1) that the characteristics of an individual group member are reflective of the group as a whole, or (2) that a group's decision outcome must reflect the preferences of individual group members, even when external information is available suggesting otherwise.\n\nThe group attribution error shares an attribution bias analogous to the fundamental attribution error. Rather than focusing individual's behavior, it relies on group outcomes and attitudes as its main for conclusions.\n\nTo demonstrate the first form of group attribution error, research participants are typically given case studies about individuals who are members of defined groups (such as members of a particular occupation, nationality, or ethnicity), and then take surveys to determine their views of the groups as a whole. Often the participants may be broken up into separate test groups, some of which are given statistics about the group that directly contradict what they were presented in the case study. Others may even be told directly that the individual in the case study was atypical for the group as a whole. Researchers use the surveys to determine to what extent the participants allowed their views of the individual in the case study to influence their views of the group as a whole and also take note of how effective the statistics were in deterring this group attribution error. Ruth Hamill, Richard E. Nisbett, and Timothy DeCamp Wilson were the first to study this form of group attribution error in detail in their 1980 paper \"Insensitivity to Sample Bias: Generalizing From Atypical Cases.\" In their study, the researchers provided participants with a case study about an individual welfare recipient. Half of the participants were given statistics showing that the individual was typical for a welfare recipient and had been on the program for the typical amount of time, while the other half of participants were given statistics showing that the welfare recipient had been on the program much longer than normal. The results of the study revealed that participants did indeed draw extremely negative opinions of all welfare recipients as a result of the case study. It was also found that the differences in statistics provided to the two groups had trivial to no effect on the level of group attribution error.\n\nThe second form of group attribution error was first reported by Scott T. Allison and David Messick in 1985. This form describes people's tendency to assume incorrectly that group decisions reflect group members' attitudes. In their study the researchers did multiple experiments presenting participants with group decisions made on the national, state, and local levels. Participants were presented with situations in which a matter of public policy was determined by a single leader with no popular vote, a popular vote of over 90% of the population, and a popular vote which included approximately 50% of the population. If no group attribution error were present, the participants would be expected to conclude that in the 90% vote the views of the individuals were reflective of the group decision, in the 50% vote they may or may not be, and in the leader decision there is no evidence that the individual views reflect the group outcome. Allison and Messick discovered instead, however, that the participants associated the individual views with the group outcome in all three cases.\n\nFollow-up research by Leila Worth and Scott T. Allison attempted to identify the limits of the effect. These studies have shown that the error becomes stronger in perceptions of groups that are viewed as (a) more dissimilar to one's own group, (b) more monolithic, and (c) adversarial to one's own group. The error tends to disappear in perceptions of one's own group. Group members are more likely to attribute the decisions of their own group to structural constraints placed on the group, such as its decision rules, whereas members tend to attribute the decisions of another group to its members' attitudes.\n\nIn 2001, Corneille et al. conducted further studies that suggest that threatening groups are viewed as being both more extreme and more homogeneous.\n\nThe group attribution error has been referred as a term since 1985 by Scott T. Allison and David M. Messick after evaluating numerous researches made between 1970-1985. These researches tie different attribution biases to an individual either 1) the individual's behavior or 2) the outcomes of the group that the individual belongs to. The first one is known as the fundamental attribution error, and the consequent one is known as the group attribution error.\n\nInfants develop the ability to categorize first by putting a gender label to other children. Then, the difference in color of the skin begins to play a role in their ability to distinguish different backgrounds. Consequently, group attribution biases towards members of different groups, either on race or gender, affect their ability to judge others. For example, the conception of children believing that \"all girls are quiet\" illustrates the influence of categorization and generalization to members of this group (girls).\n\nThe fundamental attribution error is similar to the group attribution error in that it refers to the tendency to believe that an individual's actions are representative of the individual's preferences, even when available information suggests that the actions were caused by outside forces.\n\nThe group attribution error and the ultimate attribution error share the individual's tendency to draw different prejudiced conclusions between in-groups and out-groups. The individuals involved in an in-group would attribute positive conclusions about their group outcomes, yet they would attribute negative conclusions towards the out-group members.\n\n"}

In the 1998 A&E documentary \"The Unreal Story of Professional Wrestling\", Hans Schmidt was labeled \"the classic foreign villain\" - tapping into lingering anti-German sentiment in America following World War II, Schmidt was a forerunner of many other wrestling characters that successfully used the \"anti-American foreigner\" gimmick to enrage the crowd, such as Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik.\n\nNicknamed The Teuton Terror, Schmidt wrestled a rough, aggressive rule-breaker's style. He often finished his opponents off with a backbreaker, and was also known to use the piledriver as well. Fellow wrestlers recalled that he liked to work stiff on them, particularly with his boots, a practice for which he earned the nickname of \"Footsie\".\n\nSchmidt wrestled in territories all over North America but was a particularly big name in Chicago, Milwaukee and Toronto. By 1954 he was so thoroughly hated by wrestling audiences that he turned \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers into a face simply by wrestling a match against him. He later said that at the peak of his career, between live events and TV tapings he was wrestling as many as eight matches a week.\n\nSchmidt wrestled Lou Thesz several times for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and faced many other legends of the era such as Verne Gagne, Antonino Rocca and Whipper Billy Watson. He was naturally partnered up in tag team action with other 'evil German' wrestlers around at the time, such as Karl von Hess and Ludwig von Krupp. He also frequently tag teamed with Dick 'The Bulldog' Brower. In the wake of Schmidt's success in drawing heel heat, other wrestlers took the 'German heel' gimmick and pushed it to greater extremes with goose-stepping, fascist saluting and use of Nazi iconography. Schmidt never took it to this level himself, though he was known to wear a helmet to the ring later in his career.\n\nNear the end of his career in the 1970s, Schmidt worked around the Montreal region, still a heel but billed as hailing from Chicago. Guy Larose spent his retirement years in the Laurentians north of Montreal until his death on May 26, 2012. He is survived by two children as well as his wife and stepchildren.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7542218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7542218", "title": "Heinlein juveniles", "text": "Heinlein juveniles\n\nHeinlein juveniles are the young adult novels written by Robert A. Heinlein. The twelve novels were published by Scribner's between 1947 and 1958, which together tell a single story of space exploration. A thirteenth, \"Starship Troopers\", was submitted to Scribner's but rejected and instead published by Putnam. A fourteenth novel, \"Podkayne of Mars\", is often listed as a \"Heinlein juvenile\", although Heinlein himself did not consider it to be one.\n\nIn addition to the juveniles, Heinlein wrote two short stories about Scouting for boys and three short stories with Puddin', a teenage female protagonist, for girls.\n\n\nJames Gifford wrote, \"It is not often recognized that [the juveniles] are a reasonably consistent 'Future History' of their own\". The dozen novels do not share any characters and do not form a strict chronological series; the later novels are not sequels to the earlier ones. They nonetheless tell a single story of space exploration. The first novel, \"Rocket Ship Galileo\", is about an effort to reach the Moon. The next few (through \"The Rolling Stones\") revolve around interplanetary travel within the solar system. The next few (\"Starman Jones\" through \"Time for the Stars\") revolve around various versions of the early phase of interstellar travel. In the next novel (\"Citizen of the Galaxy\"), interstellar travel is well-established and easy for humans, and the central problem is one of the maintenance of law and order in the galaxy. The protagonist of the next and last Scribner's juvenile, \"Have Space Suit—Will Travel\", travels to the Lesser Magellanic Cloud and interacts with an intergalactic civilization. The last book submitted to Scribner's, \"Starship Troopers\", portrays an interstellar war between mankind and several other species.\n\nThe intended readership was teenage boys, but the books have been enjoyed by a wide range of readers. Heinlein wanted to present challenging material to children, such as the firearms for teenagers in \"Red Planet\". This led to \"annual quarrels over what was suitable for juvenile reading\" with Scribner's editors. \n\nGroff Conklin wrote in 1955 that \"Nobody but nobody can beat Heinlein in the writing of teen-age science fiction\". Jack Williamson wrote: \"[An] inspiring theme of space conquest unifies the dozen Scribner's titles ... The books, taken together, tell an epic story of the expansion of mankind across the planets of our own Sun and the stars beyond. ... a generally consistent story of the future conquest of space. The first, \"Rocket Ship Galileo\", begins in a backyard shortly after World War II, with three boys testing a primitive rocket motor. The last, \"Have Space Suit—Will Travel\", ends with the triumphant return of its young hero from the Lesser Magellanic Cloud... Nobody has written a more convincing and inspiring future human epic.\"\n\n\"Starship Troopers\" was written as a juvenile for Scribner's but the publisher rejected it, ending Heinlein's association with Scribner's. He wrote, \"I am tired of being known as a 'leading writer of children's books', and nothing else.\" Putnam published the novel in 1960.\n\n\nWhen he returned to writing after World War II, Heinlein sought to diversify beyond pulp science fiction. The Scouting stories, originally printed in the Boy Scouts of America magazine \"Boys' Life\", were part of that effort. \"Farmer in the Sky\", which also had a strong connection to Scouting, was serialized in \"Boys' Life\" under the title \"Satellite Scout\". Heinlein considered writing another Boy Scout story called \"Polar Scout\" in conjunction with a planned trip to Antarctica in early 1964, with the goal of releasing a collection of Scouting-related stories as a juvenile book. The trip did not take place and the author never wrote \"Polar Scout\".\n\n\nUpon delivery of one of his early juveniles, his editor at Scribner's wished someone would write stories for girls. Heinlein took this as a challenge and wrote a short story for girls. The story, a first-person tale featuring Maureen \"Puddin'\", appeared under the byline \"R. A. Heinlein\" in \"Calling All Girls\" magazine. He wrote two more, and planned four additional stories with the goal of publishing a collection titled \"Men Are Exasperating\", but he never wrote any more and the Puddin' stories have never been collected in one volume.\n\nHeinlein wrote \"I grew so fond of Maureen [from the Puddin' stories] that I helped her to get rid of that excess weight, changed her name to 'Podkayne,' and moved her to Mars (along with her unbearable kid brother).\" Heinlein felt that a particular ending for \"Podkayne of Mars\", published in 1963, was dramatically necessary to the story. Early readers hated it, however, and he reluctantly changed it. In 1995 the book was rereleased with both the published and original endings.\n\nPodkayne's categorization as a \"Heinlein juvenile\" is unclear. Many reviewers list it with the juveniles, and it is narrated by a teenager, but Heinlein himself did not regard it as a \"juvenile\".\n\nHeinlein wrote a few series of linked stories and novels. Three of the juveniles are connected to his Future History. Hazel Stone of \"The Rolling Stones\" also appears in \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\", \"The Number of the Beast\", and \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\". \"Space Cadet\" is set after \"The Long Watch\", which appears on Heinlein's Future History chart. The protagonist of \"Farmer in the Sky\", Bill Lermer, plays the song \"The Green Hills of Earth\" on his accordion; the song is featured in the story of the same name from Heinlein's Future History. \"Farmer\" also refers to the \"Space Patrol,\" the interplanetary peace-keeping organization described in \"Space Cadet\".\n\nThe Mars of \"Red Planet\" seems to be the Mars of \"Stranger in a Strange Land\"; Jack Williamson writes that \"The Martians in this story have a special interest, because they are the educators of Valentine Michael Smith [and] they display the same appalling powers that Smith brings back to Earth.\" \"Have Space Suit—Will Travel\" mentions a recently established lunar base and an \"infant Luna City\", possible early references to what Heinlein developed into the lunar outpost of his Future History and the lunar colony of \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\".\n\nOther juveniles do not as a whole integrate easily into those series. For example, the timeline for interstellar travel in \"Time for the Stars\" does not fit into the Future History. Neither does the Arachnid War from \"Starship Troopers\", nor the appearance of the advanced civilization in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud from \"Have Space Suit—Will Travel\". Some of the juveniles which do not integrate with each other, nevertheless share similar elements of setting. The Mars of several of the books (\"Red Planet\", \"Between Planets\", \"The Rolling Stones\", and \"Time for the Stars\") has indigenous, intelligent (even dangerous) life, but they are not necessarily the same Martians in each book.\n\n"}

The purpose of this migration is to allow rarely used or sufficiently aged files to be stored on lower cost media, while retaining transparent access as if the file were stored locally.\n\nIn general, IBM TSM HSM for Windows is similar to many other HSM products. This section discusses the semantics of how this particular HSM implementation operates.\n\nAdministrators can set up archiving policies, and HSM for Windows automatically executes the policies at predefined times, without requiring any end-user knowledge or intervention. Running in default mode HSM f/Win replaces each archived file by a stub containing a pointer to the archive in which this object is stored. Retention can be specified within TSM to meet any legal or business requirements. \n\nThe product can keep any number of versions of a file in the repository and provides administrator functions to retrieve any of these versions. Selected files or complete file spaces can be searched using SQL-like criteria and selected files or the complete results of a search can be retrieved either to their original location in the file system or to a different location in the file system. The basic functionality of user transparency is not affected by this added value as a user-initiated recall of a file is always directed to the latest version.\n\nAn administrator may also override migration for specific archiving jobs by specifying that the original data is either kept on disk or completely deleted. This can be useful in particular in a Content Management environment, where files and other types of content are organized by business-related item groups or index classes, and users have access to this repository via a specific client or application. \n\nThe administration of HSM for Windows does not require knowledge of the backend repository. The administration tool for OpenStore for File Server provides Windows administrators with these abilities:\n\nPrior to 2004, and through 2008, IBM TSM HSM for Windows was known as OpenStore for File Servers, a.k.a.

Shungunny Menon ascribes the authorship of this work to Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan, a 17th-century scholar of the Malabar region of India. The Keralolpathi is mostly an expansion from an earlier Sanskrit work known as the \"Kerala Mahatmayam\". That work is classed among the Hindu Puranas as an \"Upa Purana\" (or sub Purana) of the \"Bhoogola Purana\".\n\nThe Keralolpathi covers the ancestry of the Namboodiri Brahmins and other castes of Kerala and is sometimes called the \"Kerala Ulpathy\". While the \"Kerala Mahatmayam\" deals with the origin of Kerala and its people alone, the Keralolpathi gives a history of Kerala down to the modern age, including reference to the British in Kerala.\n\nPerumals of Keralolpathi\n\nHistorians doubt the reliability of this collection of legends as it contains many discrepancies. For instance it states that a certain Viceroy of Kerala went to Mecca and met the Islamic prophet Mohammed there. However the corresponding date mentioned is such that the prophet was not even born till more than a century later. It also mentions that the King Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara empire appointed a Viceroy over Kerala in 428 AD. However the said king reigned between 1509 and 1529 AD.\n\nLikewise even the origins of most of the castes and clans of Kerala varies from the ancient Sanskrit Kerala Mahatmayam. Besides, by the 18th century modified versions of the work started appearing, varying from kingdom to kingdom and region to region in Kerala. Therefore, according to Shungunny Menon (a native historian of Travancore, Kerala) one cannot place, in the Keralolpathi, the value of a historical source. Shungunny Menon, stated that:\n\nWilliam Logan, who was the author of the \"Malabar Manual\" also refutes the validity of the Keralolpathi and describes it as:\n\nK.P.

{"id": "23968576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23968576", "title": "LGBT themes in Hindu mythology", "text": "LGBT themes in Hindu mythology\n\nLGBT themes in Hindu Epics involve Hindu deities or heroes whose attributes or behavior can be interpreted as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT), or as having elements of gender variance and non-heterosexual sexuality. Traditional Hindu literary sources do not speak of homosexuality directly, but changes of sex, homoerotic encounters, and intersex or third gender characters are often found both in traditional religious narratives such as the \"Vedas\", \"Mahabharata\", \"Ramayana\" and \"Puranas\" as well as in regional folklore.\n\nHindu epic has many examples of deities changing gender, manifesting as different genders at different times, or combining to form androgynous or hermaphroditic beings. Gods change sex or manifest as an Avatar of the opposite sex in order to facilitate sexual congress. Non-divine beings also undergo sex-changes through the actions of the gods, as the result of curses or blessings, or as the natural outcome of reincarnation.\n\nHindu epics contains numerous incidents where sexual interactions serve a non-sexual, sacred purpose; in some cases, these are same-sex interactions. Sometimes the gods condemn these interactions but at other times they occur with their blessing.\n\nIn addition to stories of gender and sexual variance that are generally accepted by mainstream Hinduism, modern scholars and queer activists have highlighted LGBT themes in lesser known texts, or inferred them from stories that traditionally are considered to have no homoerotic subtext. Such analyses have caused disagreements about the true meaning of the ancient stories.\n\nMany deities in Hinduism and Indian epics are represented as both male and female at different times and in different incarnations or may manifest with characteristics of both genders at once, such as Ardhanarishvara, created by the merging of the god Shiva and his consort Parvati. The name Ardhanarishvara means \"The Lord whose half is a woman\". This form of Shiva represents the \"totality that lies beyond duality\", and is associated with communication between mortals and gods and between men and women. Alain Danielou says that \"The hermaphrodite, the homosexual and the transvestite have a symbolic value and are considered privileged beings, images of the Ardhararishvara.\". A similar merger occurs between the beauty and prosperity goddess Lakshmi and her husband Vishnu, forming the hermaphroditic or androgynous Lakshmi-Narayana.\n\nIn the \"Bhagavata Purana\", Vishnu takes the form of the enchantress, Mohini, in order to trick the demons into giving up Amrita, the elixir of life. Shiva later becomes attracted to Mohini and spills his semen on the rocks which turn into gold. In the \"Brahmanda Purana\", Shiva's wife Parvati \"hangs her head in shame\" when she sees her husband's pursuit of Mohini. In some stories Shiva asks Vishnu to take on the Mohini form again so he can see the actual transformation for himself. Stories in which Shiva knows of Mohini's true nature have been interpreted to \"suggest the fluidity of gender in sexual attraction\".\n\nPattanaik writes that those focusing only on homo-eroticism miss the narrative's deeper metaphysical significance: Mohini's femininity represents the material aspect of reality, and Mohini's seduction is another attempt to induce Shiva into taking an interest in worldly matters. He cites another story to show that only Vishnu has the power to \"enchant\" Shiva: a demon tries to kill Shiva by taking the form of a woman (placing sharp teeth in \"his\" vagina). Shiva recognizes the impostor and kills the demon by the placing a \"thunderbolt\" on his \"manhood\" during their act of \"lovemaking\".\n\nIn the later, Puranic story of the origin of God Ayyappa, Vishnu as Mohini becomes pregnant from Shiva, and gives birth to Ayyappa, who she abandons in shame. Pattanaik writes that rather than Mohini becoming pregnant, Ayyappa sprang from Shiva's semen, which he ejaculated upon embracing Mohini. In another version, the Pandyan king Rajasekhara of Pantalam adopts the baby. In this version, Ayyappa is referred to as \"ayoni jata\", \"not born from a vagina\", and later \"Hariharaputra\", \"the son of Vishnu and Shiva\", and grows up to be a great hero.\n\nAccording to Tamil versions of the \"Mahabharata\", the god Krishna – an incarnation of Vishnu – also took the form of Mohini and married Aravan. This was in order to give Aravan the chance to experience love before his death, as he had volunteered to be sacrificed. Krishna remained in mourning in the Mohini form for some time after Aravan's death. This marriage and death of Aravan are commemorated annually in a rite known as \"Thali\", during which \"Hijra\" (Indian \"third gender\") take on the role of Krishna-Mohini and \"marry\" Aravan in a mass-wedding, followed by an 18-day festival. The festival ends with a ritual burial of Aravan, while the Hirjas mourn in Tamil style: by beating their chests in ritual dances, breaking their bangles and changing into white mourning clothes.\n\nChanges of sex and cross-dressing also occur in epics about non-divine figures. One such figure is Shikhandi, a character in the \"Mahabharata\". He was originally born as a girl named 'Shikhandini' to Drupada, the king of Panchala. In a previous lifetime, Shikandini was a woman named Amba, who was rendered unmarriageable by the hero Bhishma. Humiliated, Amba undertook great austerities, and the gods granted her wish to be the cause of Bhishma's death. Amba was then reborn as Shikhandini. A divine voice told Drupada to raise Shikhandini as a son; so Drupada raised her like a man, trained her in warfare and arranged for her to marry a female. On the wedding night, Shikhandini's wife discovered that her \"husband\" was female, and insulted her. Shikhandini fled, but met a yaksha who exchanged his sex with her. Shikhandini returned as a man with the name 'Shikhandi' and led a happy married life with his wife and children. During the Kurukshetra war, Bhishma recognised him as Amba reborn and refused to fight 'a woman'. Accordingly, Arjuna hid behind Shikhandi in order to defeat the almost invincible Bhishma. In the Javanese telling, Srikandi (as she is known) never becomes a man, but is a woman equal to men, and is the wife of Arjuna. After his death, Shikhandi's masculinity was transferred back to the yaksha.\nArjuna himself is an example of gender variance. When Arjuna refused her amorous advances, the nymph Urvashi cursed Arjuna; he would become a \"kliba,\" a member of the third gender. Krishna assured Arjuna that this curse would serve as the perfect disguise for Arjuna during his last year of exile. Arjuna took the name Brihannala and dressed in women's clothes, causing the curse to take effect. Thus Arjuna gained entry into the city ruled by king Virata, where he taught the arts of music, singing and dancing to the princess Uttarā and her female attendees. Doniger describes Arjuna's cross-dressing disguise as a source of comedy in the story, with references to his \"hairy arms\". In the \"Padma Purana\", Arjuna is also physically transformed into a woman when he requests permission to take part in Krishna's mystical dance, which only women may attend.\n\nThe story of Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to alternate between being a man and woman each month, appears in several traditional Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the \"Ramayana\" version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the \"Mahabharata\" Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife. In another version, Budha is described as transgender as well.\n\nNumerous deities have been considered patrons of third-sex or homoerotically-inclined people. This patronage can originate in epical stories about the deity, or from religious practices and rituals. For example, Conner and Sparks argue that the goddess of fire, love and sexuality, Arani, has been linked to lesbian eroticism via rituals in her honor: for example two pieces of wood perceived as feminine, called the \"adhararani\" and \"utararani\", are rubbed together, simulating a spiritual lesbian interaction.\nBahuchara Mata is a patron goddess of the Hijra. In popular iconography she is often shown riding a rooster and carrying a sword, trident and a book. Various stories link Bahuchara to castration or other changes in physical sexual characteristics, sometimes as the result of her aiming curses against men. Bahuchara is believed to have originated as a mortal woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off her breasts and dies. In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the woods to engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.\n\nStories also link Bahuchara to gender variance after she becomes divine. One epic concerns a king who prayed to Bahuchara for a son. Bahuchara complied, but the prince grew up to be impotent. One night Bahuchara appeared to the prince in a dream and ordered him to cut off his genitals, wear women's clothes and become her servant. Bahuchara is believed to continue to identify impotent men and command them to do the same. If they refuse, she punishes them: for their next seven incarnations they will be impotent. This epic is the origin of the cult of Bahuchara Mata, whose devotees are required to self-castrate and remain celibate.\n\nSamba, the son of Krishna, is also a patron of eunuchs, transgender people and homoeroticism. Samba dresses in women's clothes to mock and trick people, and so that he can more easily enter the company of women and seduce them. In the \"Mausala Purana\", Samba, dressed as woman, is cursed after being questioned about \"her\" supposed pregnancy. As a result of the curse, Samba, although remaining male, gives birth to an iron pestle and mortar.\n\nHomosexual or bisexual activity also occurs between gods, although such interactions are most usually considered purely ritualistic, or have purposes other than sexual pleasure. Agni, the god of fire, wealth and creative energy, has same-sex sexual encounters that involve accepting semen from other gods. Although married to the goddess Svaha, Agni is also shown as being part of a same-sex couple with Soma, the god of the moon. Agni takes a receptive role in this relationship, accepting semen from Soma with his mouth, paralleling Agni's role in accepting sacrifices from Earth to Heaven. Orthodox Hinduism emphasises that these are \"mithuna\", ritual sexual encounters, and Agni and his mouth represent the feminine role.\n\nAgni also accepts semen in epics of the conception and birth of Karttikeya, a god of male beauty and battle. Numerous versions of Karttikeya's birth story exist, many having a conception from only male input, although heterosexual sex or desire also plays a part. However, Parvati is credited as Karttikeya's mother due to her having sexual intercourse with Shiva, causing him to ejaculate. Ganga is Karttikeya's mother in other versions, accepting semen from Agni and carrying the unborn child. The male progenitor is sometimes Shiva, Agni, or a combination of the two. In the \"Shiva Purana\" and the \"Ramayana\", the gods fear the outcome of Shiva and Parvati's \"unending embrace,\" and interrupt their coitus. Shiva then appears before the gods and declares \"now let him step forward who will accept the semen I discharge\". At the prompting of the gods, Agni captures Shiva's semen in his hands and swallows it. In these stories, Parvati and Shiva condemn Agni's actions, calling them \"wicked\" or \"improper.\" In the eleventh century text \"Kathasaritsagara\", however, Shiva forces the reluctant Agni to receive his semen. The semen causes a burning sensation in those that ingest it, prompting Agni to divest it into wives of a group of sages, under Shiva's advice. The sages' wives in turn drop the semen into the Ganges river (the \"Ganga\"), where it flows to the shore from which Kārttikeya springs. In the \"Mahabharata\", Kārttikeya is also the son of Agni, who ejaculates into the hands of one of the \"Krittikas\" (the Pleiades), who in turn throws the semen into a lake, from whence Kārttikeya is born. In some myths, Agni ejaculates onto a mountain that was itself made from Shiva's divine semen, making Kārttikeya the child of the two gods, according to an interpretation by Markandeya in the \"Vana Parva\".\n\nMitra and Varuna, are gods of great intimacy and often mentioned together in Vedic literature. These Adityas preside over the universal waters wherein Mitra controls the ocean depths and lower portals while Varuna rules over the ocean’s upper regions, rivers and shorelines.\n\nIn Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna are portrayed as icons of affection and intimate friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet and when they are thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana (6.18.3-6) lists Varuna and Mitra as having children through ayoni or non-vaginal sex. For example, Varuna fathered the sage Valmiki when his semen fell upon a termite mound, and Agastya and Vasistha were born from water pots after Mitra and Varuna discharged their semen in the presence of Urvasi. This account is similar to Gay couples having children through surrogate mothers in modern days.\n\nSome versions of the Bengali text \"Krittivasa Ramayana\" contain a story of two queens that conceived a child together. When the famous king of the Sun Dynasty, Maharaja Dilipa, died, the demigods become concerned that he did not have an heir. Shiva appeared before the king's two widowed queens and commanded, \"You two make love together and by my blessings you will bear a beautiful son.\" The two queens execute Shiva's order and one of them conceived a child. The child was born boneless, but by the blessings of the sage Ashtavakra, the child was restored to full health. Ashtavakra named the child \"Bhagiratha\" – he who was born from two vulvas (\"bhaga\"). Bhagiratha later became one of the most famous kings of India and is credited with bringing the Ganges River down to earth through his austerities.\n\nThe elephant-headed, wisdom god Ganesha's conception has numerous versions. Some sources consider him to be the progeny of Shiva and Parvati, although conception occurs outside the womb. However, most versions consider him to have been produced purely through the actions of Parvati, who in the \"Shiva Purana\" fashioned him from clay. However, when Ganesha blocks Shiva, he is beheaded and later restored to life by Shiva. In a 13th-century Kashmiri text, Jayadratha's \"Haracaritacintamani\", Ganesha's birth is the result of Parvati's menstrual blood being washed into the Ganges, where they are swallowed by Parvati's elephant-headed handmaiden Malini, who in turn gives birth, giving Ganesha an all-female origin. Courtright considers the birth to be \"less auspicious\" due to the lack of male input and use of bodily fluids such as sweat or menstrual blood, but Ruth Vanita points out that Hindus consider Ganesha's birth auspicious, and that the use of non-procreative bodily fluids is considered sacred and purifying in many Hindu rituals.\n\nSangam literature use the word ‘Pedi’ to refer to people born with Intersex condition, it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various types of Hirja. Likewise, the famous sangam period characters of King Koperunchozhan and Pisuranthaiyar are another example for same sex love. They are said to have not seen each other at all and yet shared love and regard for each other, so much, that they die at the same time at different places. “For instance, the friendship between King Pari and poet Kabilar is shown as something more than just friendship. There are lyrical undertones suggestive of the intimate relationship they had. But since there are no explicit representation, one can only postulate a possibility.\n\nHindu traditional literary sources say little about homosexuality directly. Homoeroticism in traditional texts is often masked by adherence to strict gender and caste rules. Critical study is further hampered by the lack of Sanskrit words for modern conceptions (such as homosexuality), although words for specific same-sex sexual acts exist. Timothy Murphy writes that LGBT themes are often ignored by \"heterosexist scholars\", and even early investigations into sexual minorities in Hindu culture failed to analyse stories or artwork depicting same-sex sexual acts between mythological beings. Murphy describes the study of LGBT topics in Hindu culture as \"still in their infancy\".\n\nGoldman writes of transsexualism in Hindu literature: \"Few cultures have accorded this phenomenon so prominent a place in the realms of mythology and religion as has that of traditional India.\" Goldman considers the numerous myths concerning gender change to be a manifestation of patriarchal cultures desire to control the sexuality of women, but writes that many myths \"project a positive valuation of women and femininity\". Changes in gender may be caused by a god or through the use of magic, in order to deceive others or to facilitate a romantic encounter. A change in gender may also occur spontaneously due to changes in a person's spiritual or moral character, either in a single life, or through reincarnation.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions\", queer theorists and activists have reinterpreted ancient texts \"searching for alternative voices\" that demonstrate the diversity of gender models and sexualities in Hinduism. These scholars include Gita Thadani, who attempted to uncover lesbian subtext in ancient Vedic and Sanskrit texts in \"Sakhiyani: lesbian desire in ancient and modern India\", and Ruth Vanita, who attempts \"to locate spaces of same-sex intimacy in vernacular texts\" in \"Same-sex love in India: readings from literature and history\".\n\nSome LGBT interpretations of popular stories and characters have been controversial. \"Ganeśa: Lord of obstacles, Lord of beginnings\", applied psychoanalytic approaches to Hindu stories. The book stated that Ganesha's trunk represented a flaccid penis and his love of sweets indicated a desire to perform homosexual oral sex. The deductions of this book, and similar application of psychoanalysis to the study of Hinduism, has been questioned by Western and Indian academics including Antonio De Nicholas, Krishnan Ramaswamy, S.N.Balagangadhara, Saraha Claerhout, who have stated that the book is based on mistranslations and psychoanalytic misinterpretations. The book became infamous in India, triggering protests and resulting in a public apology from the publishers and withdrawal of the book in India.\n\nThe scholarship of Wendy Doniger, which focuses on interpretation of Hindu texts through psychoanalysis, is similarly controversial and has been criticised. Doniger has been described as \"being rude, crude and very lewd in the hallowed portals of Sanskrit Academics.\" Doniger's works that feature LGBT interpretations of Hindu myths include the books \"Siva: The Erotic Ascetic\", \"Tales of Sex and Violence\", and \"Splitting the difference: gender and myth in ancient Greece and India\".\nMichael Witzel, a Professor of Sanskrit, said that Wendy Doniger's knowledge of Vedic Sanskrit is severely flawed. Nicholas Kazanas, a European Indologist, has also criticised Doniger's works and wrote that Doniger seems to be obsessed with only one meaning of myths: the most sexual imaginable.\n\n\n\n"}

A trickster may trick others simply for their amusement, they could be a physically weak character trying to survive in a dangerous world, or they could even be a personification of the chaos that the world needs to function.\n\nAn archetypical example is of a fairy tale of the King who puts suitors for his daughter to the test. No brave and valiant prince or knight succeeds, until a simple peasant arrives. Aided only by his natural wit, he evades danger and triumphs over monsters and villains without fighting. Thus the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the prize. Such characters are a staple of animated cartoons, in particular those used and developed by Tex Avery et al. during the Golden Age of American animation.\n\nHynes and Doty, in \"Mythical Trickster Figures\" (1997) state that every trickster has several of the following six traits:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2649550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2649550", "title": "Loggia dei Lanzi", "text": "Loggia dei Lanzi\n\nThe Loggia dei Lanzi, also called the Loggia della Signoria, is a building on a corner of the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, Italy, adjoining the Uffizi Gallery. It consists of wide arches open to the street. The arches rest on clustered pilasters with Corinthian capitals. The wide arches appealed so much to the Florentines that Michelangelo proposed that they should be continued all around the Piazza della Signoria.\n\nSometimes erroneously referred to as \"Loggia dell' Orcagna\" because it was once thought to be designed by that artist, it was built between 1376 and 1382 by Benci di Cione and Simone di Francesco Talenti, possibly following a design by Jacopo di Sione, to house the assemblies of the people and hold public ceremonies, such as the swearing into office of the Gonfaloniers and the Priors. Simone Talenti is also well-known from his contributions to the churches Orsanmichele and San Carlo.\n\nThe vivacious construction of the Loggia is in stark contrast with the severe architecture of the Palazzo Vecchio. It is effectively an open-air sculpture gallery of antique and Renaissance art.\n\nThe name \"Loggia dei Lanzi\" dates back to the reign of Grand Duke Cosimo I, when it was used to house his formidable landsknechts (In Italian: \"Lanzichenecchi\", corrupted to \"Lanzi\"), or German mercenary pikemen. After the construction of the Uffizi at the rear of the Loggia, the Loggia's roof was modified by Bernardo Buontalenti and became a terrace from which the Medici princes could watch ceremonies in the piazza.\n\nOn the façade of the Loggia, below the parapet, are trefoils with allegorical figures of the four cardinal virtues (Fortitude, Temperance, Justice and Prudence) by Agnolo Gaddi. Their blue enamelled background is the work of Leonardo, a monk, while the golden stars were painted by Lorenzo de' Bicci. The vault, composed of semicircles, was done by the Florentine Antonio de' Pucci. On the steps of the Loggia are the \"Medici lions\"; two Marzoccos, marble statues of lions, heraldic symbols of Florence; that on the right is from Roman times and the one on the left was sculpted by Flaminio Vacca in 1598. It was originally placed in the Villa Medici in Rome, but found its final place in the Loggia in 1789.\n\nOn the side of the Loggia, there is a Latin inscription from 1750 commemorating the change of the Florentine calendar in 1749 to bring it into line with the Roman calendar. The Florentine calendar began on 25 March instead of 1 January. The other inscription from 1893 records the Florentines who distinguished themselves during the annexation of Milan (1865), Venice (1866) and Rome (1871) to the kingdom of Italy.\n\nUnderneath the bay on the far left is the bronze statue of \"Perseus\" by Benvenuto Cellini. It shows the mythical Greek hero holding his sword in his right hand and holding up the Medusa's severed head in his left. The well-proportioned muscular body of Perseus stands poised on the right leg. Perseus is reflecting and he seems to be frightened by his same action. Blood is gushing from the head and the neck of the dead Medusa. The richly decorated marble pedestal, also by Cellini, shows four graceful bronze statuettes of Jupiter, Mercurius, Minerva and Danaë. The bas-relief on the pedestal, representing \"Perseus freeing Andromeda\", is a copy of the one in Bargello.\n\nBenvenuto Cellini worked almost ten years on this bronze (1545-1554). His wax design was immediately approved by Cosimo I de' Medici. He met numerous difficulties which, according to his autobiography, almost brought him to the brink of death. The casting of this bronze statue was several times unsuccessful. When attempting again, the melting furnace got overheated, spoiling the casting of the bronze. Cellini gave orders to feed the furnace with his household furniture and finally with about 200 pewter dishes and plates, and his pots and pans. This caused the bronze to flow again. After the bronze had cooled, the statue was finished, except for three toes on the right foot. These were added later.\nOn the far right is the manneristic group \"Rape of the Sabine Women\" by the Flemish artist Jean de Boulogne, better known by his Italianized name Giambologna. This impressive work was made from one imperfect block of white marble, the largest block ever transported to Florence. The goccia model is now in the Galleria dell' Academia. Giambologna wanted to create a composition with the \"figura serpentina\", an upward snakelike spiral movement to be examined from all sides. This is the first group representing more than a single figure in European sculptural history to be conceived without a dominant viewpoint. It can be equally admired from all sides. The marble pedestal, also by Giambologna, represents bronze bas-reliefs with the same theme. This marble and bronze group is in the Loggia since 1583.\n\nNearby is Giambologna's less celebrated marble sculpture \"Hercules beating the Centaur Nessus\" (1599) and placed here in 1841 from the Canto de' Carnesecchi. It was sculpted from one solid block of white marble with the help of Pietro Francavilla\n\nThe group \"Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus\", discovered in Rome stood originally at the southern end of the Ponte Vecchio. There is another version of this much-restored Roman marble in the Palazzo Pitti. It is an ancient Roman sculpture from the Flavian era, copied from a Hellenistic Pergamene original of the mid third century BC. This marble group was discovered in Rome. It has undergone restorations by Ludovico Salvetti, to a model by Pietro Tacca (1640) and by Stefano Ricci (about 1830).\n\nThe group \"The Rape of Polyxena\", is a fine diagonal sculpture by Pio Fedi from 1865.\nOn the back of the Loggia are five marble female statues (three are identified as Matidia, Marciana and Agrippina Minor), Sabines and a statue of a barbarian prisoner Thusnelda from Roman times from the era of Trajan to Hadrian. They were discovered in Rome in 1541. The statues had been in the Medici villa at Rome since 1584 and were brought here by Pietro Leopoldo in 1789. They all have significant, modern restorations.\n\nThe Feldherrnhalle in Munich, commissioned by King Ludwig I of Bavaria to honor the tradition of his military, was modelled after the Loggia dei Lanzi.\n"}

Music Maker Relief Foundation was founded in 1994 by Tim and Denise Duffy to \"help the true pioneers and forgotten heroes of Southern music gain recognition and meet their day-to-day needs. Music Maker presents these musical traditions to the world so American culture will flourish and be preserved for future generations.\"\n\nIn 1989, while completing his studies for a master's degree in Folklore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Tim Duffy was documenting blues musician James \"Guitar Slim\" Stephens for the university's Southern Folklife Collection. Stephens's health was in decline, and shortly before his death, he advised Duffy to locate a musician named Guitar Gabriel.\n\nAfter his graduation, Duffy began working as a substitute teacher at a middle school in Winston-Salem, hearing an assortment of folkloric tales about Guitar Gabriel from students, until one student volunteered that Gabriel was her neighbor, living in the government housing projects of Winston-Salem. That evening, Duffy followed the student's directions to a \"drink house\" in the neighborhood, where he met Gabriel's nephew, Hawkeye, who took him to meet Gabriel. Duffy forged a close friendship with Gabriel, and the two began recording and performing under the name Guitar Gabriel & Brothers in the Kitchen, releasing the album \"Do You Know What it Means to Have a Friend?\" (also known as \"Toot Blues\") on their own Karibu label in 1991.\n\nGabriel had been inactive in the music industry since the 1970 release of his album \"My South, My Blues\" (as Nyles Jones) on the Gemini label. He had received no royalties and was impoverished. He required almost daily assistance from Duffy, who provided transportation to medical appointments, money, and food for Gabriel and his wife. Through Gabriel, Tim and Denise Duffy made field recordings of other local blues musicians, such as Captain Luke, Macavine Hayes, Mr. Q., and Willa Mae Buckner. They lived in poor conditions and needed regular assistance. Duffy thought their culture was slipping away unnoticed by the music industry.\n\nTim Duffy's father, Allen Duffy, a lawyer, had represented and won a case for audio pioneer Mark Levinson, allowing him to continue working in the hi-fi industry. Levinson heard about Tim Duffy's field recordings, some reminiscent of the work of John and Alan Lomax, and invited Duffy to visit his stereo showroom in New York. After hearing the recordings, as well as the stories of the many destitute musicians, Levinson offered to remaster the tapes, which became an eight-artist CD anthology of traditional North Carolina blues entitled \"A Living Past\". Levinson became a crusader for the cause, and solicited funds and industry connections from his friends and colleagues, which, in 1994, resulted in the incorporation of the Music Maker Relief Foundation.\n\nIn 1995, Tim Duffy met Eric Clapton in a Manhattan bistro, sharing some of his field recordings, as well as the philosophy and goals of the foundation, after which Clapton became a supporter, introducing artists such as B.B. King, Pete Townshend, Bonnie Raitt, Ron Wood, Lou Reed and Rosanne Cash, all of whom donated to the Music Maker Relief Foundation. Duffy was invited to the Los Angeles studio where B.B. King's album \"Deuces Wild\" was recorded and where he met Taj Mahal, who contributed to the foundation's growth and success.\n\nBy 1996, after receiving several sizable donations, Music Maker Relief Foundation had established the Musician Sustenance, Musical Development, and Cultural Access Programs, which provide food, monetary assistance, transportation to doctor's appointments and to pick up medications, home repairs (in some cases, extremely poor living conditions have warranted the relocation of the musician), performance bookings in professional venues, such as the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, as well as European tours and music festivals worldwide. The success of which is due, in large part, to Taj Mahal, who by 1997 had become an advisory board member, artistic consultant, contributor, and co-producer for many of the artists' records. Taj Mahal headlined blues festivals in support of Music Maker, was instrumental in securing advertising in mainstream print media, as well as the creation of the \"Fishin' Blues Tournament\", which raises funds for the foundation. Over the next several years, many new donors and contributors were involved, allowing Duffy to expand the roster of the label, and to release over one hundred albums, the proceeds of which the artists keep, in their entirety. Many of the label's artists have been documented in the collaborative work of artists Harvey Pekar and Gary Dumm, who have contributed artwork since 2003, and whose work was featured in a 2010 calendar, created as a fundraiser for Music Maker Relief Foundation.\n\nIn 2006, Tim Duffy saw the Carolina Chocolate Drops performing at the Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival of Music and Dance in Silk Hope, North Carolina. Duffy signed a management deal with the group and released their debut record, \"Dona Got a Ramblin' Mind\" on the Music Maker Label. During Duffy's time as manager the Carolina Chocolate Drops won a Grammy Award in 2010 for Best Traditional Folk Album with their first album on Nonesuch Records, \"Genuine Negro Jig\". The Chocolate Drops second release with Nonesuch, \"Leaving Eden\" was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nIn 2014, the Music Maker Relief Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary with an exhibit of 28 photographs of Music Maker artists. The exhibit was previewed at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. A double-disc compilation album and 144-page photo book is also set to be released in honor of the foundation's anniversary.\n\nOn October 27, 2014 PBS NewsHour aired segment on the Music Maker Relief Foundation, showing William R. Ferris say, \"They provide a model for what our nation should be doing. The New Deal under FDR did this for the entire nation, and Tim Duffy thankfully is doing it for the community of blues artists.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Located at 905 N Martin Luther King Jr. Ave, its current Branch Manager is Christa Smith.\n\nThe North Greenwood Library's patrons can check out a variety of materials including books, magazines, DVDs, Blu-rays, video games, and a ukulele kit. There is a computer lab with free internet access and free Wi-Fi throughout the library. For non library members, there are two 15 minute express computers. The library offers paid copy and scanning services. It does not have a fax machine. The library has one community room that is used for programs and can be reserved through the online calendar. The newly renovated children's area has Lego tables and coloring areas as well as coloring materials. There is a high definition television that kids can use to watch G or PG rated DVDs and Blu-rays with librarian permission. All books are free to be read inside the library without needing to be checked out. With a library card issued from North Greenwood and other Clearwater Libraries, patrons have access to online applications and materials such as Overdrive, Pronunciator, Zinio, 3M, and Hoopla.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the black community felt that they should have a library for their children and the future generations. The City Commission agreed to fund a library as long as the community found a building and librarian willing to work there. The library, simply referred to as the \"Negro Library\", first opened on March 15, 1950 on the corner of Pennsylvania and Cedar Street in a rented building space. Christine Wigfall Morris was the librarian who first opened the doors of the library and was the first black Librarian to work in Clearwater, Fl.\n\nThe library, loved by both the community and \"Miss Chris\", outgrew its rented space so a building was officially built for the collection on Palmetto street. The new building, named the Northeast Library and designed by Eugene Beach, was meant to be run by a single librarian— Christine Morris. It opened in September, 1962 with a collection of 15,000 books. Christine Morris worked tirelessly to keep the library open acting as not only a librarian, but also janitor and community counselor. It was not until 1983, after Morris' retirement, that the library received its current name of North Greenwood Library.\n\nIn 1970 the \"Edward Allen Henry Jr. Special Collection on Negro Culture and History\" was added to the library. In 2002 the special collection's name was changed to \"The Christine Wigfall Morris African American Collection\" in honor of her decades of work and dedication to the library and the community. In an interview, Christine Morris commented that the community believed the whole library should be named in her honor but the city said she would have to be deceased in order for it to be allowed. She preferred to be alive and see the collection named after herself than to be dead and not see the whole building named.\n\nNorth Greenwood's current location at the corner of N. Martin Luther King Jr. Ave and Palmetto St was built in 2002. Its grand opening was January 18, 2003.\n\n2009 proved to be a worrisome year for North Greenwood Library, as well as East Library, as budget cuts threatened to close the facility and move the collection to a space inside the North Greenwood Recreation center. In protest of closing the library, the NAACP and local ministers staged marches to save the library.After two months of debate, protests, and voting, it was decided that taxes would be raised and the libraries would stay open but with reduced hours. While many people disagreed with the tax increase, one counsel member remarked how surprised she was that so many of her constituents were willing to accept the tax increase if it meant the libraries stayed open. \n"}
{"id": "30599650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30599650", "title": "Palestine Papers", "text": "Palestine Papers\n\nThe Palestine Papers is a collection of confidential documents about the Israeli–Palestinian peace process leaked to Al Jazeera, which published them between 23 and 26 January 2011. Nearly 1,700 of documents from the office of the main PLO negotiator, Sa'eb Erekat, and his team have been published, dating from 1999 to 2010.\n\nAl Jazeera and \"The Guardian\" say they have authenticated the documents, and a media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also affirmed their authenticity. Leaders of the Palestinian Authority have complained about the way the documents were presented by Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Palestine Papers uncover documents about the negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the only recognized representative of the Palestinian people, and Israel from 1999 to 2010. The negotiations in 1993 that led to the Oslo Accords were the first direct negotiations between the parties. The following \"peace process\" focussed on the formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the territory it would govern. The PA, however, represents only the local people in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, not the Palestinians in the diaspora.\n\nIn 2011, when the Papers were published, the negotiations were in a deadlock after the refusal in September 2010 of the Benjamin Netanyahu government to extend the freeze of settlements building over ten months. Ziyad Clot, the until now only identified source, felt frustrated about the fact that the great majority of the Palestinian people, the refugees, being one of the \"remaining issues\" in the \"peace process\", were not properly represented.\n\nThe documents were obtained by Al Jazeera and shared in advance of publication with \"The Guardian\" in an effort to ensure the wider availability of their content. \"The Guardian\" has authenticated the bulk of the Papers independently, but has not sought or been given access to the sources of the documents. Al Jazeera, which published the Papers on their website, has redacted minimal parts of the papers to protect their sources' identities.\n\nMost of the documents are from the Palestinian negotiation support unit (NSU). The NSU was the PLO's main technical and legal advice organ in the peace negotiations, set up in 1999 and headed by Saeb Erekat. Gershon Baskin, codirector of Israel/Palestinian Center for Research, said, \"I'm 100 percent sure that it's a former disgruntled employed\" member of the Negotiations Support Unit headed by Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat. Israel's Channel 10 news show also named the source of the leak as a former member of the NSU.\n\nOn 27 January 2011, following Al Jazeera's broadcast of the Palestine Papers, Saeb Erekat appeared on Al Jazeera Arabic, condemning the publication. He accused Al Jazeera journalist Clayton Swisher, who delivered the disclosure of the Palestine Papers, of being a CIA agent and of working for the NSU. He also said that former British intelligence officer Alastair Crooke was involved. In Ma'an News Agency, Erekat later admitted Clayton Swisher neither worked for the Palestinians nor the US intelligence agency.\n\nA few weeks after the publication of the Palestine Papers, on 11 February 2011, Erekat resigned as Chief PLO Negotiator, citing the release of the papers and due to an internal Palestinian investigation that suggested the Palestine Papers leak had come from a source inside Erekat's office. As of February 2017, however, he was still holding the function of Chief Palestinian Negotiator.\n\nIn his book \"The Palestine Papers: The End of the Road?\", Swisher confirmed account, as he wrote, \"In the fall of 2010, I traveled the world meeting with US, Israeli, and Palestinian Authority officials who had no idea that I held in my possession the secret records of their negotiations\". A complaint filed by Erekat and the PLO against Al Jazeera and Clayton Swisher on grounds of unfairness was wholly dismissed in a 19-page ruling released in October 2011.\n\nIn a 14 May 2011 op-ed article in the \"Guardian\", Ziyad Clot, a French lawyer of Palestinian descent and a former adviser for the NSU involved in 2008 Annapolis negotiations exposed himself as one of the sources of the leaks. In the \"Guardian\" article, Clot said that the so-called peace process was \"an inequitable and destructive political process which had been based on the assumption that the Palestinians could in effect negotiate their rights and achieve self-determination while enduring the hardship of the Israeli occupation\". He also said that \"the \"peace negotiations\" were a deceptive farce whereby biased terms were unilaterally imposed by Israel and systematically endorsed by the US and EU\". Clot emphasized that \"these negotiations excluded for the most part the great majority of the Palestinian people: the seven million Palestinian refugees\". He felt \"that the PLO, given its structure, was not in a position to represent all Palestinian rights and interests\". Clot resigned from the NSU after he witnessed the killing of more than 1,400 Palestinians in Gaza during the Gaza War. After he resigned, he believed he had a duty to inform the public. In the Guardian article, he also stated: \"In full conscience, and acting independently, I later agreed to share some information with al-Jazeera specifically with regard to the fate of Palestinian refugee rights in the 2008 talks. Other sources did the same, although I am unaware of their identity.\"\n\nThe \"Palestine Papers\" include many minutes of bilateral meetings between Israel and the Palestinians and with the USA as well as minutes of joint trilateral meetings. They also include other documents, such as memos, emails, letters, strategy papers, a matrix of positions and even maps of possible land swaps and power point presentations\n\nThere were published 1,684 total documents, including:\n\nAkiva Eldar, writing in \"Haaretz\", said that the documents are more important than those released by Wikileaks because they deal with current issues regarding permanent borders in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nAt a meeting in November 2007, Tzipi Livni told Ahmed Qurei that \"I understand the sentiments of the Palestinians when they see the settlements being built. The meaning from the Palestinian perspective is that Israel takes more land, that the Palestinian state will be impossible, the Israel policy is to take more and more land day after day and that at the end of the day we'll say that it is impossible, we already have the land and cannot create the state\".\n\nAccording to the documents, in a meeting with Livni in Jerusalem, Qurei proposed that Israel annex all settlements along the border except for the large cities and towns of Giv'at Ze'ev, Ma'ale Adumim, Ariel, and Efrat. Livni rejected Qurei's demands that Israel cede these settlements. Qurei suggested to Livni that these settlements be placed under Palestinian sovereignty, but Livni told him \"you know this is not realistic\". Condoleezza Rice similarly told Qurei that \"I don't think that any Israeli leader is going to cede Ma'ale Adumim\", to which Qurei replied \"or any Palestinian\". Rice then told him \"Then you won't have a state!\"\n\n\"Napkin map\" is a colloquial name for a Palestinian sketch made by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on a napkin, of a map with land swap proposals shown to him by then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert during peace negotiations in mid-2008. According to Al Jazeera, Abbas was not allowed to keep the unofficial map, so he sketched it by hand. During the first of several meetings, the Palestinian Authority proposed a land swap, offering Israel the opportunity to annex all of the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem in return for land concessions by Israel. Olmert, however, offered no concessions in return but an even more aggressive land swap.\n\nIn Prime Minister Olmert's own proposal, Israel would annex 6.3% of the West Bank. The land in Olmert's map included the four settlements of Gush Etzion (with Efrat), Ma'ale Adumim, Giv'at Ze'ev, and Ariel, in addition to all settlements in East Jerusalem (Har Homa). In exchange for those concessions by the Palestinian Authority, Olmert offered 5.8% of Israeli land as part of the swap. The land offered consisted of lightly populated farmland, which would be divided between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. When Mahmoud Abbas asked to keep a copy of the map for further consideration, Ehud Olmert refused to comply. Mahmoud Abbas was forced to sketch Ehud Olmert's map by hand on a napkin to have a copy for further consideration. This map was then later referred to as the \"Napkin map\".\n\nThe third and final meeting occurred on 16 September 2008. It was during this time that Ehud Olmert was nearing the end of his political career. At the time, Olmert was under police investigation for alleged corruption that had occurred while he was Mayor of Jerusalem, and as a result of the accusations was not planning on running again. During the final meeting, Mahmoud Abbas was prepared by the Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) to clarify many questions regarding Ehud Olmert's peace plan in which Abbas was quoted as asking questions such as \"How do you see it addressing our interests, especially as Ariel, Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Har Homa and Efrat clearly prejudice contiguity, water aquifers, and the viability of Palestine?\" as well as others about the value of the land that they would receive in such a swap in terms of value and size.\n\nThe Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) also insisted that Prime Minister Olmert provide them with a copy of the map, which was again denied. In the end, however, Mahmoud Abbas asked for a few days to consider the offer. A day after this meeting, Olmert resigned and Tzipi Livni stepped in as Acting Prime Minister, with Benjamin Netanyahu being elected shortly afterward. Palestinian negotiators said Abbas had forgotten another appointment and postponed the next meeting. Netanyahu thought Olmert had made too many concessions and refused to continue from where the last round of negotiations had left off, preferring to restart the negotiations from the beginning.\n\nAccording to one of the documents, the Palestinian Authority was prepared to concede most Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, as well as the Armenian Quarter, with the exception of Har Homa. The Temple Mount would be temporarily administrated by a joint body consisting of the Palestinian Authority, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States until a permanent solution was reached.\n\nAt the meeting in Jerusalem in November 2007, Tzipi Livni became visibly angry when asked about the demographic composition of the future Israeli state. She was quoted as saying, \"Israel the state of the Jewish people—and I would like to emphasize the meaning of 'its people' is the Jewish people—with Jerusalem the united and undivided capital of Israel and of the Jewish people for 3,007 years\". The Palestinians team then protested her position on Jerusalem. She responded by saying \"Now I have to say, before we continue, in order to continue we have to put out Jerusalem from your statement and from our place. We have enough differences, without putting another one out there\". \n\nThe minutes of the trilateral meeting on 26 August 2008 reveal that Israel not only demands a \"demilitarized\" Palestinian state, but also wants to keep control over borders, Jordan Valley and airspace, after withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the West Bank, for reasons of security.\nTzipi Livni: \"In the Jordan Valley – what will be between Palestine and Jordan. EWS. [Early Warning Stations] ... the I is that we will have something on the crossings, borders, etc ... The idea is to withdraw, but to keep a presence, not close to the situation today, on the EWS, on passages ...\"\n\nYankie Galenty, a media adviser for Ehud Olmert, affirmed the complete authenticity of the documents in an interview. In regards to refugees, he stated that \"Olmert, from day one, did not deceive Abu Mazen and told him that Israel will not allow the return of refugees and not one refugee will return to the land of Israel.\"\n\nOther officials in the Israeli government asked for a limited right of return numbering between five and ten thousand, out of a total of five million refugees, who would be carefully picked by Israel and allowed to stay under \"humanitarian conditions\".\n\nUS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice proposed settling Palestinians refugees in Argentina and Chile as an alternative to letting them return to former homes in Israel and the occupied territories during a meeting.\n\nIn her memoirs, Condoleezza Rice wrote that Olmert initially proposed that Israel accept 5,000 Palestinians refugees. Abbas rejected the offer, saying, \"I can't tell four million Palestinians that only 5,000 of them can go home\". According to the second night of the Al-Jazeera broadcast, Israelis and Palestinians eventually agreed that Israel would accept 10,000 refugees.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the leaked documents deliberately confuse Israeli and Palestinian positions, and that he had kept the Arab League updated on all details of the negotiations with Israel. Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the leaks were \"a pack of lies\", containing mistakes and inaccuracies and that his words were taken out of context and he had been misquoted. Erekat said that the \"Palestinian Authority would never give up any of our rights. If we did indeed offer Israel the Jewish and Armenian Quarters of Jerusalem, and the biggest Yerushalayim as they claim, then why did Israel not sign a final status agreement? Is it not strange that we would offer all these concessions which Israel demands, yet there is still no peace deal?\"\n\nYasser Abed Rabbo, giving the PA's first official response, accused \"Al Jazeera\" and the Government of Qatar of attacking the Palestinian Authority, having a hostile attitude towards the PA since the days of former president Yasser Arafat. Abed Rabbo was quoted saying that the Al-Jazeera leaks are \"a distortion of the truth\". Abed Rabbo accused the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, of giving Al Jazeera the \"green light\" to start the campaign, and called on the Emir to \"extend the climate of transparency in his own state and reveal his true relations with Israel and Iran\".\n\nMahmoud al-Zahar, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, stated that the Palestinian Authority officials should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nAhmed Qurei, former Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority and chief Palestinian negotiator in the 2008 talks, said that \"many parts of the documents were fabricated, as part of the incitement against the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian leadership\".\n\nNasser Gawi, a lead organizer for demonstrations in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where he had been recently evicted by Israeli settlers from his home, was quoted as saying \"Erekat must have become more Zionist than Zionist. He has no mandate to give up Sheikh Jarrah or an inch of Palestine.\"\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that \"even the most left-wing government of Olmert and Livni did not manage to reach a peace agreement, despite the many concessions.\" He also promoted his plan for peace, which would allocate 45% to 50% of the West Bank for the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nLivni said that \"the [peace] process did not fail and was not exhausted. It did not end, but was not allowed to ripen until an agreement was reached because of elections in Israel and this government's choice not to continue the negotiations.\"\n\n\n"}

Solomon determined that, owing the supervening circumstances, performance was objectively impossible (\"casus fortuitus\"), and that the contract should therefore be terminated.

A second cathedral is just on the Quadrangle's periphery.\n\nOn the corner of Chestnut and State Streets, Merrick Park is distinguished by sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens \"The Puritan,\" a statue depicting one of Springfield's settlers, Deacon Samuel Chapin. Springfield Central Library and Christ Church Cathedral are adjacent to the park.\n\nThe Central Library, constructed in 1913, was paid for by Andrew Carnegie. It is the second library to be built at that location. The nonfiction department is based in Rice Hall (named for William Rice), consisting of a main floor and mezzanine. Opposite Rice Hall is the Arts and Music Hall, where multimedia, periodicals, and the computer lab are based. The circulation desk lies in the rotunda between the two halls. Fiction, children's literature, and community rooms are in the basement. The Central Library also has a Teen Advisory Board — a grouping of teenagers who help make decisions and organize events at the library geared towards teenagers.\n\nThe Roman Catholic St. Michael's Cathedral adjoins the neo-classical Springfield City Library at the southeast corner of the Quadrangle.\n\nAlso located near that edge of the Quadrangle is the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts' Christ Church Cathedral.\n\nSpringfield Museums Corporation operates the Dr. Seuss Memorial and four museums on the Quadrangle, with a fifth museum due to open in 2017. In 2013, the Springfield Museum consortium achieved national accreditation from the American Alliance of Museums, a distinction awarded to only 6% of national museums in the US. In September 2016, Springfield Museums was named as a Smithsonian affiliate, opening up new opportunities for cultural and historical exhibits, as well as educational programs.\n\nThe George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum is the oldest museum on the Quadrangle. The museum is named for the collection's original owner. Its exhibits express the taste of Smith and his wife, Belle, and they bequeathed their notable collection to begin the museum. The building dates from 1895 and was designed by Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell and Walter T. Owen.\n\nThe Ancient Treasures Gallery displays objects from ancient Egypt, China, Greece and Rome. The gallery also presents Greek and Roman sculpture from the recently acquired Blake/Purnell Collection of antiquities, and ancient Chinese ceramics and bronzes from the Bidwell Collection. Greek pottery and glass from the George Walter Vincent Smith Collection complement the classical sculptures.\n\nThe Japanese Arms and Armor Gallery, in addition to holding Smith's extensive collection of Oriental armor, is the site of an ornate Shinto wheel shrine carved during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Among other collections is a 150-piece holding of Chinese cloisonne work, one of the most extensive collections outside of China.\n\nThe Michele & Donald D’Amour Museum of Fine Arts features mostly American and European works including those of Massachusetts native John Singleton Copley and lithographs of Currier and Ives. Works by Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, and others can be found in the European collection. The Museum features many interactive exhibits as well. It also has Late Medieval and Renaissance paintings by Spinello Aretino, Nicolás Francés, Domingo Valls, Pordenone, Daniele da Volterra (\"Diana\"), and Goswin van der Weyden. It also has Baroque and 18th Century paintings by Pierre Patel, Jacob Jordaens, Emanuel de Witte, Jan van Goyen, Ferdinand Bol, Jean-Étienne Liotard, Canaletto, and Giovanni Paolo Panini. There are also American paintings by Erastus Salisbury Field, Frederic Edwin Church, George Bellows, and Georgia O'Keeffe. There are also contemporary works of art by Helen Frankenthaler, Joseph Grillo, and Lisa Hoke.\n\nThe Springfield Science Museum displays elements of natural and physical science from the Eco-Center featuring live animals, to the African Hall, which gives visitors a ground-sky perspective of an ecosystem on the Savannah. Dinosaur Hall includes a lifesize \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" model and skeletons from other dinosaurs. The museum also features a planetarium – the first built in the United States, and one of the very few of the era not built by Zeiss – and earth science exhibits. Additionally, the museum has its own observatory with a telescope that is periodically open to the public.\n\nThe Quadrangle's perimeter was at one time open to vehicles, but was closed off in the 1990s, becoming a pedestrian-only park. Soon after that, the Dr. Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden was opened. Several statues depicting Springfield native Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and many of his creations were sculpted and placed on the Quadrangle green. Starting in 2017, the William Pynchon Memorial Building, which formerly housed the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum, reopened as the Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum in June 2017.\n\nThe newest museum at the Quadrangle is the Lyman and Merrie Wood Museum of Springfield History. It opened in the fall of 2009 on the former site of famed painter James MacNeill Whistler's childhood home. It tells the story of Springfield, and in particular, highlights its role as \"The City of Progress\" and \"The City of Firsts\". The collection features exhibits on the numerous inventions and pioneering manufacturing techniques innovated there, the city's role in American history, as well as examining Springfield in a broader context as a city during various eras, (e.g. different wars, several mass immigrations, and changing transportation technology). Exhibits of antique cars and firearms, formerly housed at the Connecticut Valley Historical Museum, showcase the city's various industries. Also included is a large number of items from the former Indian Motorcycle Museum.\nThe museum also houses the Springfield History Library and Archives, a collection of historical papers and documents, including genealogical records and over 20,000 books related to genealogy.\n\n"}

The term Roadfood was coined by the Sterns to describe the regional cuisine they discovered when they began driving around America in the early 1970s. Their focus was not on deluxe fare, but on everyday local food – barbecue, chili, fried chicken, apple pie – and the unpretentious restaurants that serve it: diners, small-town cafes, seaside shacks, drive-ins, and bake shops.\n\nThe Sterns, who had no formal training in cuisine or journalism, met at Yale University in 1968, married in 1970, and graduated in 1971, after which they left academia to explore the USA. At first, their focus was on popular culture in general, but after traveling around the country for a few years, they realized they had been keeping an informal diary of unknown and unique places to eat: inconspicuous restaurants that were, at the time, of no interest to the food-writing establishment. After three years of travel in a beat-up Volkswagen Beetle, staying at seedy motels, and occasionally sleeping in the back seat of the car, they drafted the manuscript of \"Roadfood\", a guide to restaurants that were neither fast food nor gourmet dining, but were an expression of local foodways. \n\n\"Roadfood\" was a landmark, the first cross-country guide to regional American food. Since then, the Sterns have written \"Roadfood\" columns for Gourmet magazine and Saveur and report regularly about \"road food\" on public radio's \"The Splendid Table.\" They have won numerous James Beard awards for their writing and have been inducted into the Who’s Who of American Food. \n\nThe book \"Roadfood\" has been updated several times; the 10th edition will be published in 2017. Writing in the New York Times Book Review about \"Two for the Road\", the Sterns' memoir of their pursuit of \"road food\", Nora Ephron commented, \"Jane and Michael Stern write about ordinary food so simply and exuberantly that I couldn't help thinking, as I read this latest book of theirs (the 31st), that they deserved a room of their own in the Smithsonian Institution, right next to Julia Child's Cambridge kitchen.\"\n\nIn the years since its first publication, \"Roadfood\" has inspired countless other writers, television personalities, and internet bloggers to pay attention to regional fare. In 2000, the Sterns partnered with Stephen Rushmore to create Roadfood.com, the first internet website to include photos with restaurant reviews. In 2015, \"Roadfood\" was acquired by Fexy Media of Seattle, Washington. After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of the website.\n"}

In 1892, Tretyakov presented his already famous collection of approximately 2,000 works (1,362 paintings, 526 drawings, and 9 sculptures) to the Russian nation.\n\nThe façade of the gallery building was designed by the painter Viktor Vasnetsov in a peculiar Russian fairy-tale style. It was built in 1902–04 to the south from the Moscow Kremlin. During the 20th century, the gallery expanded to several neighboring buildings, including the 17th-century church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi.\n\nThe collection contains more than 130,000 exhibits, ranging from \"Theotokos of Vladimir\" and Andrei Rublev's \"Trinity\" to the monumental \"Composition VII\" by Wassily Kandinsky and the \"Black Square\" by Kazimir Malevich.\n\nIn 1977 the Gallery kept a significant part of the George Costakis collection.\n\nIn May 2012, the Tretyakov Art Gallery played host to the prestigious FIDE World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand as the organizers felt the event would promote both chess and art at the same time.\nPavel Tretyakov started collecting art in the middle of 1850. The founding year of the Tretyakov Gallery is considered to be 1856, when Tretyakov purchased two paintings of Russian artists: \"Temptation\" by N. G. Schilder and \"Skirmish with Finnish Smugglers\" by V. G. Kudyakov, although earlier, in 1854–1855, he had bought 11 drawings and nine pictures by Dutch Old Masters. In 1867 the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov was opened. The Gallery’s collection consisted of 1,276 paintings, 471 sculptures and 10 drawings by Russian artists, as well as 84 paintings by foreign masters.\nIn August 1892 Tretyakov presented his art gallery to the city of Moscow as a gift. In the collection at this time, there were 1,287 paintings and 518 graphic works of the Russian school, 75 paintings and eight drawings of European schools, 15 sculptures and a collection of icons. The official opening of the museum called the Moscow City Gallery of Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov took place on August 15, 1893.\nThe gallery was located in a mansion that the Tretykov family had purchased in 1851. As the Tretyakov collection of art grew, the residential part of the mansion filled with art and it became necessary to make additions to the mansion in order to store and display the works of art. Additions were made in 1873, 1882, 1885, 1892 and 1902–1904, when there was the famous façade, designed in 1900–1903 by architect V. Bashkirov from the drawings of the artist Viktor Vasnetsov. Construction of the façade was managed by the architect A. M. Kalmykov.\nIn early 1913, the Moscow City Duma elected Igor Grabar as a trustee of the Tretyakov Gallery.\nOn June 3, 1918, the Tretyakov Gallery was declared owned by Russian Federated Soviet Republic and was named the State Tretyakov Gallery. Igor Grabar was again appointed director of the museum. With Grabar’s active participation in the same year, the State Museum Fund was created, which up until 1927 remained one of the most important sources of replenishment of the gallery's collection.\nIn 1926 architect and academician A. V. Shchusev became the director of the gallery. In the following year the gallery acquired the neighboring house on Maly Tolmachevsky Lane (the house was the former home of the merchant Sokolikov). After restructuring in 1928, it housed the gallery's administration, academic departments, library, manuscripts department, and funds and graphics staffs. In 1985–1994, an administrative building was built from the design of architect A. L. Bernstein with two floors and height equal to that of the exposition halls.\nIn 1928 serious renovations were made to the gallery to provide heating and ventilation. In 1929 electricity was installed.\nIn 1929 the church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi was closed, and in 1932 the building was given to the gallery and became a storage facility for paintings and sculptures. Later, the church was connected to the exposition halls and a top floor was built which was specially designed for exhibiting a painting by A. A. Ivanov,\"The Appearance of Christ to the People\" (1837–1857). A transition space was built between rooms located on either side of the main staircase. This ensured the continuity of the view of exposure. The gallery began to develop a new concept of accommodating exhibits.\nIn 1936, a new two floor building was constructed which is located on the north side of the main building – it is known as the Schusevsky building. These halls were first used for exhibitions, and since 1940 have been included in the main route of exposure.\nFrom the first days of the Great War, the gallery's personnel began dismantling the exhibition, as well as those of other museums in Moscow, in preparation for evacuating during wartime. Paintings were rolled on wooden shafts, covered with tissue paper, placed in boxes, and sheathed with waterproof material. In the middle of the summer of 1941 a train of 17 wagons traveled from Moscow and brought the collection to Novosibirsk. The gallery was not reopened in Moscow until May 17, 1945, upon the conclusion of the Great War.\nIn 1956, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Tretyakov Gallery, the Alexander Ivanov Hall was completed.\nFrom 1980 to 1992, the director of the Tretyakov Gallery was Y. K. Korolev. Because of the increased number of visitors, Korolev was actively engaged in expanding the area of exposition. In 1983, construction work began to expand the gallery. In 1985 the Depository, a repository of works of art and restoration workshops, was commissioned. In 1986 renovations began on the main building of the Tretyakov Gallery. The architects I. M. Vinogradsky, G. V. Astafev, B. A. Klimov and others were retained to perform this project. In 1989, on the south side of the main building, a new building was designed and constructed to house a conference hall, a computer and information center, children's studio and exhibition halls. The building was named the \"Corps of Engineers\", because it housed engineering systems and services.\nFrom 1986 to 1995, the Tretyakov Gallery in Lavrushinsky Lane was closed to visitors to accommodate a major renovation project to the building. At the time, the only museum in the exhibition area of this decade was the building on the Crimean Val, 10, which in 1985 was merged with the Tretyakov Gallery.\n\nIn 1985, the Tretyakov Gallery was administratively merged with a gallery of contemporary art, housed in a large modern building along the Garden Ring, immediately south of the Krymsky Bridge. The grounds of this branch of the museum contain a collection of Socialist Realism sculpture, including such highlights as Yevgeny Vuchetich's iconic statue \"Iron Felix\" (which was removed from Lubyanka Square in 1991), the \"Swords Into Plowshares\" sculpture representing a nude worker forging a plough out of a sword, and the \"Young Russia\" monument. Nearby is Zurab Tsereteli's 86-metre-tall statue of Peter the Great, one of the tallest outdoor statues in the world.\n\nNear the gallery of modern art there is a sculpture garden called \"the graveyard of fallen monuments\" that displays statues of former Soviet Union that were relocated.\n\nThere are plans to demolish the gallery constructed in the late Soviet modernism style, though public opinion is strongly against this.\n\n\n"}

New England Avenue in Winter Park, Florida. The library's core mission is education.\n\nThe library dates back to 1885, when nine women organized to create a lending library for Winter Park. The library has been located at its present site since 1995. Books had previously been circulated in an organized reading circle, but a library didn’t exist within the small community. The village of Winter Park was still in its infancy at this time, less than five years old, but both the incorporation of a railroad and the inaugural classes beginning at Rollins College in 1885 influenced the town’s image as a desirable place to live. Intent on creating a lending library for the community, this ambitious group of women held a meeting at the Congregational Parsonage, which is now the location of the current Rollins campus, roughly where the Archibald Granville Bush Science Center sits today. \n\nThis was a time of male-only suffrage, and women had to content themselves with more “ladylike” pursuits, such as ministering to the needy and coming up with ideas for civic projects. All elected officers of the circulating library, however, would be women. The president was Mrs. Elizabeth P. Hooker, the wife of a doctor and Congregational minister, as well as a president of Rollins College. She was raised by a professor at Middlebury College, where she received some advanced education and was likely familiar with the workings of a collage library. The “two Marys” in the group, Mary McClure and Mary E. Brown, were both retired teachers. Brown would be remembered as being \"of a singularly acute and independent mind, a lover of the best books, a keen critic, and an unfailing source of intellectual stimulus to all who knew her.” Alice Guild and her sister, Clara, came from Boston with their father in 1883. Alice, 25 at the time, was elected as fundraiser for the library, while her sister, Clara, albeit not one of the library's noted founders, was in her own right a member of the first class at Rollins and later received the college’s first degree conferred upon a woman. Evaline Lamson was only 30 when she became the driving force behind the library’s survival and for several years served simultaneously as librarian for the town library and the one at Rollins College. Little is known about the remaining members, Mrs. C. J. Ladd, Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Cook, and Mrs. W. O. Cady, except that the latter would become the first librarian for the Winter Park Circulating Library. \n\nWhile deliberating and discussing details, the most crucial decision for the women was not how to get the necessary books, as they had been circulating books among themselves for some time, but where to base their new venture. The first site was the Lamson house at 503 Interlachen Avenue, and initially operating only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Records for the year of 1887 gave some insight into what was being read that year, including \"The Scarlet Letter\", \"The Last Days of Pompeii\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Ivanhoe\", and \"The Rise of Silas Lapham\". Biographies were also popular, such as those on Frederick the Great, and religious titles, \"The Blood of Jesus\", \"Thoughts on Personal Religion\", and \"Scientific Theism\". Since the library shelves and inventory were limited, the rules for borrowing material were that members could take out one book on Wednesday and Saturday and keep it for two weeks, with a one-week renewal. They would impose a 10-cent fine for non-renewals, and those who were not members would be allowed to take out books if they paid a $1 deposit plus 10 cents for each week.\n\nOne year after the library’s founding, as recorded in the minutes of the annual meeting held on December 16, 1886, the officers accepted an offer to move its operations from Miss Lamson’s porch to a room in a building occupied by the Winter Park Company on the southwest corner of New England and Park Avenues. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association wrote its constitution in 1888.\n\nEconomic devastation would bring the library to the brink of closure in 1895. As it is today, Florida’s two biggest commodities are citrus and tourism. Winter Park relied on winter visitors, but according to \"The History of Orlando\" by Eve Bacon, “the temperature dropped to 24 degrees the Sunday after Christmas Day in 1894,” and dropped even lower to an astounding 17 degrees in February. This hard freeze killed trees and citrus, and potential visitors to the area, hearing news of the record cold, decided not to visit. The blow to the area’s economy was evident in the library’s December 1895 annual meeting, where the treasurer’s report revealed an existing balance of $8.60. In spite of this drop in profit, the overall bleak outlook of the time gave an unexpected boost in inventory, which may have been gifted books by families moving from the area. The population of Winter Park would fluctuate dramatically from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, but the welcome addition of some wealthy new residents would bring relief via donations, which enabled the library to buy more books in 1896. \n\nIn 1900, discussion of what should be included in a new, permanent building effectively set the library’s policy for years to come, as the decision was made to include a children’s department. The Winter Park Circulating Library Association’s president, Eleanora Comstock, called a meeting to propose plans and start fundraising efforts. Pledges of $1,216 were received by February 1901, and land was donated by the estate of Francis Knowles. The library opened in April 1902. This also expanded hours of operation to every day. Fundraising consisted of outreach to the public and a financial commitment from the city government, which continues to this day.\n\nIndoor plumbing was not part of the original design of the new building in 1900, and in the absence of modern insulation, complaints about heat in the summer and cold in the winter are recorded aspects of its history.\n\nProsperity inevitably came back to the area due in part to both a revitalized citrus industry and the construction of the new Seminole Hotel in 1912 following a fire that had burned down the prior building, and had long been a great source of revenue for the library. Also, the town council agreed to provide free electricity to the library building in 1914. In light of these developments and donations, the library added a kitchen wing that same year, which inspired the ladies of the library to continue a series of teas, fundraising socials and other events of interest to potential patrons. The library would eventually double in size in 1924 when they added two new wings and a lavatory. And by 1945, the library had a collection of 12,269 books and a circulation of 33,214.\n\nDespite the historical and commendable efforts behind the library’s origin and contribution to the community of Winter Park during this time, it had remained somewhat of an exclusive group of patrons that many residents chose not to join. Furthermore, the library only served the white townspeople. A separate library was founded in the heart of the black residential community in mid-1937. Founded by Dr. Edwin O. Grover in 1937, the Hannibal Square Library was established for African American residents, dedicated in memory of his wife, who had been an activist in the cause of education and the black community. Initially functioning as an independent library, it began receiving regular appropriations from the city in the 1950s, albeit on a smaller scale than that received by the Winter Park Public Library. A children’s room was added in 1955. A popular place for children and local organizations to meet, neighbors maintained the grounds, donated to the organization, and planted shrubbery and flowers to beautify it. The Board of Directors was composed of black and white residents. The Winter Park Public Library integrated in 1962 and 1963, adopting a policy of library service to all residents of Winter Park, irrespective of age, race, creed, color or financial situation. In 1979, the Hannibal Square Library was closed due to decline in circulation and the building and grounds were returned to the city’s council.\nAlthough it was initially proposed to simply build on to the existing library site, the issue of insufficient parking was the inspiration for constructing a new building on a different site. In September 1976, the city bought some land at 460 East New England Avenue, and in July of 1977, the Library received a grant for construction on the site. Soon thereafter, the Winter Park Public Library opened with nearly twice the square footage and increased parking spaces from thirteen to sixty-five. The facility was expanded starting in 1994, adding a third floor to allow more space for services to patrons aged 12 to 18.\n\nAll available \"circulating collection\" items and materials may be checked out from the Winter Park Public Library, including books, DVDs, CDs, audiobooks, video games, software, tablet computers, mobile hotspots, computer keyboards and bicycles.
