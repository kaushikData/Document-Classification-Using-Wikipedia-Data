{"id": "50699812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50699812", "title": "A Chinese-English Dictionary", "text": "A Chinese-English Dictionary\n\nA Chinese-English Dictionary (1892), compiled by the British consular officer and sinologist Herbert Allen Giles (1845-1935), is the first Chinese-English encyclopedic dictionary. Giles started compilation after being rebuked for criticizing mistranslations in Samuel Wells Williams' (1874) \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\". The 1,461-page first edition contains 13,848 Chinese character head entries alphabetically collated by Beijing Mandarin pronunciation romanized in the Wade-Giles system, which Giles created as a modification of Thomas Wade's (1867) system. Giles' dictionary furthermore gives pronunciations from nine regional varieties of Chinese, and three Sino-Xenic languages Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Giles revised his dictionary into the 1,813-page second edition (1912) with the addition of 67 more entries and numerous usage examples.\n\nHerbert Giles served as a British consular officer in late Qing dynasty China until from 1867 to 1892. After his return to England, he was appointed the second professor of Chinese at the University of Cambridge, in succession to Thomas Francis Wade. They are renowned for developing what was later called the Wade-Giles romanization system of Chinese, which Giles' \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" firmly established as the standard in the Western world until the 1958 official international pinyin system (Wilkinson 2000: 93).\n\nIn 1867, Giles passed the competitive Foreign Office examination for a Student lnterpretership in China, and began studying the Chinese language at Peking. He later criticized his first Chinese book, a Part II reprint of Robert Morrison's (1815-1823) \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, in Three Parts\", because it failed to mark aspiration, \"much as if an English-Chinese dictionary, for the use of the Chinese, were published without the letter \"h\", showing no difference between the conjunction \"and\" and the \"[h]and\" of the body\" (Aylmer 1997: 8).\n\nHerbert A. Giles wrote some 60 publications on Chinese culture and language (see ), which may be divided into four broad categories: reference works, language textbooks, translations, and miscellaneous writings (Aylmer 1997: 4). His pioneering reference books established new standards of accuracy. Of all his publications, Giles was most proud of (1892) \"A Chinese Biographical Dictionary\" and (1892, 1912) \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\". Giles' textbooks for Chinese language learners include (1873) \"A Dictionary of Colloquial Idioms in the Mandarin Dialect\" and two Chinese phrasebooks transliterated phonetically according to the English alphabet, \"so that anyone could pick up the book and read off a simple sentence with a good chance of being understood\": the (1872) \"Chinese without a Teacher\" and (1877) \"Handbook of the Swatow Dialect: With a Vocabulary\" for Teochew dialect (Aylmer 1997: 13). His wide-ranging translations cover many genres of Chinese literature. Probably the best known are (1880, 1916) \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\", (1884, 1922) \"Gems of Chinese Literature\", and (1889, 1926) \"Chuang Tzŭ, Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer\". Giles' other writings include some of the first general histories of China, the (1901) \"A History of Chinese Literature\", (1906) \"Religions of Ancient China\", and (1911) \"The Civilization of China\".\n\nHerbert Giles says he decided to compile \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" after his review of Williams' \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" \"brought down on my head many objurgations from the author's friends\" (Aylmer 1997: 14, Wilkinson 2000: 93). As Giles explains in his previously unpublished (c. 1918-1925) typescript memoirs, \n[The] review was of Dr Williams' \"Syllabic Dictionary\" (\"Evening Gazette\", 16 Sept., 1874), for which I was freely bespattered with abuse from all American quarters. I showed up a multiplicity of absurd blunders and equally egregious omissions; and I wound up with these prophetic words: \"We do not hesitate to pronounce Dr Williams the lexicographer, not for the future, but of the past.\" I at once began upon a dictionary of my own. (Aylmer 1997: 15-16) \nProvoked by the American missionary Williams, Giles devoted himself to publishing a new dictionary that \"was meant to bring the glory of having compiled the best Chinese-English dictionary back from America to England\" (Yang 2014: 317).\n\nFive years later, Giles published a 40-page brochure (1879) \"On some Translations and Mistranslations in Dr. Williams' Syllabic Dictionary\" that was reported extensively among English-language newspapers published in China (Aylmer 1997: 21). \"I was badly mauled\" in the \"Daily Press (Hong Kong)\", \"received unstinted praise\" in the \"North China Daily News\", and was supported in the \"Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal\", which said \"the Dictionary is in fault in most of the instances given.\" Giles sent a copy of his brochure to Williams, but received no reply. Since Williams reprinted his dictionary from stereotype plates, he was unable to make corrections, and added a (1883) Errata and Corrections on a fly-sheet at the end—without acknowledgement of Giles' corrections.\n\nHerbert Giles continued working on his Chinese-English dictionary for 15 years until 1889 when the Foreign Office granted his request to be stationed as Consul at Ningpo, where the workload was light and he could prepare the manuscript for press (Aylmer 1997: 32). The Shanghai publishers Kelly & Walsh printed the dictionary in 4 fascicules from 1891 to 1892.\n\nThe first edition \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" (1892) , which Bernard Quaritch also published in London, had 2 royal quarto (250 by 320 mm.) volumes comprising a 46-page front matter (9-page Preface and 32-page Philological Essay) and the 1415-page dictionary, printed in triple columns, beginning with 60 pages of tables. The price was $35. (Aylmer 1997: 34).\n\nFor the subsequent two decades, Giles diligently worked \"to correct mistakes, cut out duplicates and unnecessary matter, prepare revised Tables, and add a very large number of new phrases, taken from my reading in modern as well as in ancient literature\" (Aylmer 1997: 51).\n\nThe revised and enlarged second edition (1912) was likewise published by Kelly & Walsh and Bernard Quaritch in 7 fascicules printed from 1909 to 1912. It had 2 royal quarto volumes, with Part I comprising a 17-page preface (with extracts from the first edition) and 84 pages of tables; and Part II comprising the dictionary itself, printed in triple columns. Compared with the first edition of 1,461 total pages, the 1,813-page second edition is 398 pages longer. Giles produced the first edition entirely at his own risk, and it cost £2300, towards which the Foreign Office gave £300. The second edition cost £4800, towards which they gave £250 (Aylmer 1997: 32).\n\nGiles' Chinese-English dictionary remained in \"constant use\" for generations (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). A compact edition was reprinted by Paragon Books (Chicago) in 1964, Ch'eng Wen (Taibei) in 1978, and is still available online (Yang 1985: 288).\n\nGiles learned that Edmund Backhouse, one of his first Chinese language students at Cambridge, had been trying for years to compile a Chinese-English dictionary. In 1925, he used it to metaphorically describe Chinese bilingual lexicography in terms of international sports competition.\n[Backhouse's dictionary] is of course intended to supersede my own work. Well, dictionaries are like dogs, and have their day; and I should be the last person to whine over the appearance of the dictionary of the future, which it is to be hoped will come in good time, and will help to an easier acquisition of \"the glorious language.\" Morrison and Medhurst, both Englishmen, between them held the blue ribbon of Chinese lexicography from 1816 to 1874; then it passed to Wells Williams, who held it for America until 1892, when I think I may claim to have recaptured it for my own country, and to have held it now for thirty-three years. (Aylmer 1997: 38) \n\nIn the history of bilingual Chinese lexicography, Giles' (1892, 1912) \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" is the fourth major Chinese-English dictionary after Robert Morrison's (1815-1823) \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language\", Walter Henry Medhurst's (1842) \"Chinese and English Dictionary\", and Samuel Wells Williams' (1874) \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\". Giles' dictionary was superseded by Robert Henry Mathews' (1931) \"A Chinese-English Dictionary Compiled for the China Inland Mission\". In contrast to Morrison, Medhurst, Williams, and Mathews, who were all Christian missionaries in China, Giles was an agnostic anti-clericalist (Aylmer 1977: 2).\n\nThe historian Huiling Yang (2014: 318) found that although Giles strongly criticized Williams' dictionary, it turns out that Giles' own dictionary is more closely linked to Williams' than to Morrison's, which Giles praised highly. Medhurst's, Williams', and Giles' Chinese-English dictionaries are all members of a tradition that originated with Morrison's work. Each of their dictionaries made contributions and improvements to the art of Chinese-English dictionary compilation.\n\nGiles' preface to the second edition gives a \"Comparative Table of Phrases under Various Characters, Taken as Specimens, to illustrate the Progress of Chinese–English Lexicography\", for example (1912: vii):\n\nHerbert Giles worked for 18 years to compile and publish the 1892 first edition \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\", which contains 10,859 character head entries plus 2,989 variant characters for a total of 13,848 entries. He decided to number every head entry—an improvement lacking in the earlier dictionaries of Morrison, Medhurst, and Williams—in order to facilitate internal cross-referencing and make it easier for users to find characters (1892: v). Giles subsequently worked for 20 years revising and adding \"a vast number of compounds and phrases\" to the 1912 second edition, which contains 10,926 head entries (67 more) plus 2,922 variants, also totaling 13,848 (Norman 1998: 173).\n\nDespite the addition of new head entries to the second edition, Giles kept the original 13,848 numerical arrangement owing to an unintended consequence (1912: viii). People in China were using the dictionary numbers as a Chinese telegraph code, that is, a character encoding index for telegraphs written in Chinese characters—analogous with modern Chinese input methods for computers. Another example of using Giles' 13,848 numbers to index characters is Vernon Nash's (1936) \"Trindex: an Index to Three Dictionaries\" or \"San zidian yinde\" 三字典引得, for \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\", (1711) \"Peiwen Yunfu\" rime dictionary, and (1716) \"Kangxi Dictionary\".\n\nThe dictionary is alphabetically collated by Beijing Mandarin pronunciation romanized in the Wade-Giles system, \"a\", \"ai\", \"an\", \"ang\", etc. Within each syllabic pronunciation section, characters sharing the same phonetic element and different graphic radicals are arranged together, for instance, the phonetic \"ai\" 艾 (number 32) \"mugwort; artemisia\" is followed by \"ai\" 哎 (33, with the mouth radical) \"an interjection of surprise\", \"ai\" 餀 (34, food radical) \"food which has been spoilt\", and \"ai\" 鴱 (35, bird radical) \"the hen of the tailor-bird\".\n\nPronunciations are glossed in late 19th-century standard Beijing Mandarin. In addition, Giles glosses pronunciations in archaic Middle Chinese rime (\"R.\" according to the \"Peiwen Yunfu\" rime dictionary) and \"fanqie\", nine regional varieties of Chinese (commonly mistaken for mutually-understandable \"dialects\"), and the Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean languages (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). Giles' dictionary went far beyond Williams', which glosses pronunciations in Middle Chinese and four regional varieties: Shantou, Amoy, Fuzhou, and Shanghai Chinese. Giles' dictionary abbreviates the nine varieties (\"dialects\") by their initial letter: C. Cantonese, H. Hakka, F. Foochow, W. Wênchow, N. Ningpo, P. Pekingese, M. \"Mid-China\", Y. Yangchow, and S. Ssuch'uan, as well as in K. Korean, J. Japanese, and A. Annamese languages.\n\nTones are annotated with a superscript number in the upper right of a character or romanized word; the four tones of Beijing Mandarin are indicated as 1 \"high-level\", 2 \"rising\", 3 \"dipping\", and 4 \"falling\". In the first edition, Giles uses 5 to denote alternate tonal pronunciations that he had heard, eruditely described as \"tra cotanto senno\" (Italian for \"amid such wisdom\", from Dante's \"Inferno\") (1892: vii). The prior dictionaries of Morrison, Williams, and Medhurst annotate tones in terms of the outdated four tones of Middle Chinese pronunciation used in rime dictionaries such as the \"Kangxi\"; namely \"píng\" 平 \"level\" tone, \"shàng\" 上 \"rising\", \"qù\" 去 \"departing\", and \"rù\" 入\"entering\" tone. Giles uses an asterisk to indicate archaic entering tone, with denoting second tone with a \"-p\", \"-t\", or \"-k\" stop consonant. Despite the historical fact that the \"entering\" tone had already ceased to exist in 19th-century Beijing pronunciation, Norman notes that early Chinese-English dictionaries were \"much concerned with including it\" (1988: 173).\n\nDictionary pages are formatted in three columns, each split between the head entry character, number, and pronunciations on the left, and the translation equivalents (\"definitions\"), cross references, and subentries of terms on the right. Giles attempts to arrange the subentry example words and phrases according to the order of the translation equivalents. The dictionary's approximately \"hundred thousand examples\" diversely range from the \"best and highest planes of Chinese thought\" to everyday words and nursery rhymes (1892: vii).\n\nThe Chinese character 道 for \"dào\" \"way; path; say; the Dao\" or \"dǎo\" \"guide; lead; conduct; instruct; direct\" (or 導 clarified with Radical 41 寸 \"thumb; inch\") is a good litmus test for a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. The sample entry from Giles' dictionary for \"tao\" 道 (10,780) gives the character and number over pronunciations from Cantonese \"tou\" to Vietnamese \"dau\" on the left, and the translation equivalents and examples on the right. Note that {} brackets indicate translation equivalents added in the second edition.\nA road; a path; a way. Hence; the road \"par excellence\"; the right way; the true path; {the λόγος of the New Test.; identified by Kingsmill with the Buddhist \"Mârga\", the path which leads to Nirvâna;} the truth; religion{; principles \"see\" 8032}. Of or belonging to Taoism {\"see\" 太極 859}. A district; a region; a political division of the empire, varying under different dynasties; a circuit; a \"Tao-t'ai\". To speak; to tell. {A numerative; \"see\" entries.} (1892: 1066, {1912: 1332}) \nThe 1912 second edition adds references to Christian Greek scriptural λόγος \"logos\", Thomas William Kingsmill's (1899) \"Daodejing\" translation comparing \"dào\" with Sanskrit \"mārga\" \"path; (Buddhist) paths to liberation\", the meaning \"principles\" under \"mou\" 謀 (8032) \"to plot; to scheme\", \"Tai chi\" 太極 under 極 (859), \"dàotái\" 道臺 \"(historical) the magistrate of a \"dào\" district/circuit\", and the syntactic use of 道 as a classifier or measure word for rivers/topics/etc.\n\nThe first edition 道 (1892: 1066-1068) entry gives 230 examples of words and phrases for \"tao\" \"way; path\" (e.g., \"黃道 the ecliptic; good luck; a lucky day; the conjunction of the sun and moon; in Taoist language, the state of unconscious innocence, as of an unborn babe\"), and \"Read \"tao\". To lead; \"see\" No. 10,781\" with 6 examples. The second edition (1912: 1332-1336) gives 255 examples (for instance, adding \"一達謂之道 that which passes through is called \"tao\"\", quoting the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" dictionary definition of \"dào\") and \"Read \"tao\". To lead; \"see\" 10,781\" and 6 examples. The following \"tao\" 導 (10,781) \"To lead; to guide\" entry gives 7 examples in the first edition and 8 in the second, for instance \"導師 the guiding Teacher—Buddha\".\n\nHerbert Giles created the first Chinese-English encyclopedic dictionary in two ways, with comprehensive explanations under head entries and with informative tables. His example was followed by many later Chinese-English dictionaries up to the present time (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). First, some dictionary entries include in-depth information. Take \"pǔlu\" 氆氇 \"a woolen fabric made in Tibet\" as an example. Giles gives \"P'u\" 氆 (9514) \"An open-woven, thick woolen cloth, either plain or flowered, with a nap on one side, known as 氆氇. It comes from Tibet, and is used for making the winter caps of Lamas. Known to the Mongols as \"cheng-mé\" and \"chalma\".\" Second, Giles's dictionary has six tables, in addition to the requisite table of the 214 Kangxi Radicals (essential for using a radical-and-stroke index) included by Morrison, Medhurst, and Williams. The tables are for Insignia of Official Rank, The Family Names, The Chinese Dynasties, Topographical, The Calendar, and Miscellaneous (Chinese numerals). Another table is found in the dictionary front matter, called the Table of Sounds (1892) or Table of Sounds for Dialects (1912).\n\nGiles was the first Chinese-English lexicographer to systematically include homographs \"a character with two or more readings\" (which he calls \"duplicate characters\"). For instance, the character 長 can be pronounced \"cháng\" \"long; lasting\", \"zhǎng\" \"grow up; increase\", or \"zhàng\" \"plenty; surplus\": Wade-Giles \"ch'ang\", \"chang\" and \"chang\", respectively. The main entry \"ch'ang\" 長 (450) first has \"Long, of time or space, as opposed to 短 short. Excelling; advantageous; profitable.\" with 59 words and phrases (e.g., \"長生 long life; immortality. Used as a euphemism for coffins, death, etc.\"); then \"Read \"chang\". Old; senior. To excel; to increase; to grow.\" with 38 (\"長妾 the senior concubine\"); and then \"Read \"chang\". with 4 terms (e.g., 無長物 there is nothing over.\"). The alternate entry \"chang\" 長 [no tone] (408) says \"\"See\" 450.\"\n\nGiles' \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" has received both acclaim and censure. An early critic, the Chinese Malaysian scholar Gu Hongming (1857-1928) criticized Giles' lack of overall insight into Chinese literature, and said\nIt is this want of philosophical insight in Dr. Giles which makes him so helpless in the arrangement of his materials in his books. Take for instance his great dictionary. It is in no sense a dictionary at all. It is merely a collection of Chinese phrases and sentences, translated by Dr. Giles without any attempt at selection, arrangement, order or method. As a dictionary for the purposes of the scholar, Dr. Giles' dictionary is decidedly of less value than even the old dictionary of Dr. Williams. (1915: ) \n\nArthur C. Moule, son of the Anglican missionary George Moule, wrote a critical review of Giles' dictionary, for instance, the 否 entry (3596) gives \"fou\" \"Not; on the contrary; negative\" and \"p'i\" \"Bad; wicked. One of the diagrams.\" \"Diagram\" refers to the \"Yijing\" Hexagram 12 \"pǐ\" 否 \"Obstruction\". Moule (1922: 130) says \"fou\", \"p'i\", or \"pei\" has three meanings\" \"not\", \"to obstruct; an obstacle\", and \"evil\", but Giles accidentally omitted the second, which is the hexagram's meaning.\n\nThe English sinologist Charles Aylmer, who first published \"The Memoirs of H. A. Giles\" from a Cambridge University Library manuscript, gives a balanced evaluation on the dictionary. Aylmer says the second edition \"impresses by its sheer bulk\" but falls short of the \"highest standards of the best 19th-century lexicography\". First, the dictionary does not cite sources for terms, but diversely includes both Classical Chinese literary archaisms from sources like the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" and modern vernacular colloquialisms that Giles \"laboriously collected from books read and conversations held during a long stretch of years.\" Second, Giles failed to indicate stylistic level, which he justifies on the \"(somewhat specious) grounds\" that, \"No division of phraseology into classical and colloquial has been made, for the simple reason that no real line of demarcation exists. Expressions are used in ordinary conversation which occur in the \"Book of Odes\". The book-language fades imperceptibly into the colloquial.\" (1912: viii). A third lexicographical shortcoming is the random arrangement of subentries, \"requiring the reader to con up and down the columns\". As a general rule, Giles explains (1892: vii), \"the meanings found in the Classics stand first, and more modern and colloquial meanings follow. But to this rule there are some striking exceptions, purposely introduced, so as not to impair any value this Dictionary may have as a practical book of reference.\" Despite these deficiencies, Aylers says Giles' dictionary \"held the field for many decades and lives on in successors\", such as Robert Mathews' (1931) \"A Chinese-English Dictionary Compiled for the China Inland Mission\", many of whose definitions \"are taken, without acknowledgment, from Giles\". \nToday the dictionary is most often cited as the locus classicus of the so-called \"Wade-Giles\" romanisation system, for which the name of Giles is widely known even to non-specialists. Apart from this, its practical use is mainly as a repository of late Ch'ing bureaucratic phraseology, though it is replete with fascinating nuggets of information and is a wonderful book for browsing. (1997: 5)\n\nThe American sinologist and linguist Jerry Norman (1998: 173) calls Giles' dictionary the \"first truly adequate Chinese-English dictionary\", with pronunciation glosses that were \"by and large free of the artificiality found in earlier works\". He also says that Giles, like his predecessors, mixed literary and colloquial definitions together without distinction, and concludes that the dictionary \"remains a rich depository of nineteenth-century Peking colloquial words and phrases, in other respects it has been superseded by later dictionaries\".\nA recent book on Chinese lexicography says Giles' dictionary has \"special significance and interest\" and \"enjoys pride of place in the history of Chinese bilingual dictionaries as the authoritative source for the Wade-Giles system of Romanization.\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 387).\n\nThe English sinologist and historian Endymion Wilkinson (2013: 85) says Giles' dictionary is \"still interesting as a repository of late Qing documentary Chinese, although there is little or no indication of the citations, mainly from the \"Kangxi zidian\").\" (Wilkinson 2013: 85)\n\n"}

(for Marianne Moore) is a sculpture by American artist Mark di Suvero. It is in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, in Washington, D.C., United States. The sculpture is named after poet Marianne Moore's \"What Are Years\". From May 22, 2013 through May 26, 2014, the sculpture resided temporarily in San Francisco, as part of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's Mark di Suvero exhibition at Crissy Field.\n\nThis 10-ton sculpture is made of nine red-orange steel I-beams, welded together, with one section suspended as a giant mobile with wire, shaped like a \"V\".\n\n\"Are Years What? (for Marianne Moore)\" is signature of di Suvero's monumental early 1960s \"open-work constructions.\" These works utilize cast-off construction materials like chains, metal bars, and ladders. This sculpture is the first that di Suvero built, from beginning to end, with I-beams and using a crane, solely by himself.\n\n\"Are Years What?\" was originally in the collection of the artist, then the collection of Enrico Martignoni of Winnemucca, Nevada. Hirshhorn director James Demetrion first saw the sculpture when it was on display in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. The sculpture was acquired by the Hirshhorn with funds from the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Purchase Fund, a gift from the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and by exchange of the di Suvero artwork \"ISIS\", in 1999. The sculpture was installed on June 13, 1999, by crane into the museum's sculpture garden.\n\nThe dangling \"V\" shaped piece of the sculpture has been described as representing the prow of a ship, or, as by art critic Irving Sandler as a representation of di Suvero's family's maritime heritage in Venice. Sandler also stated that the acute angles have male and female associations, with the horizontal representing a penis and the vertical \"V\", a vagina, which di Suvero does not associate with the work. The \"V\" has also been suggested to represent birds in flight or a \"V\" for victory. Jayne Merkel believed that \"Are Years What?\" exploited the strengths of the I-beams yet \"at the same time, he has made a piece that is graceful and well balanced - aesthetically pleasing and intriguing from a number of points of view.\" Upon the sculpture's installation at the Hirshhorn, The Washington Post received the work as \"brilliant in conception,\" \"prominent, beautiful and memorable. It lifts the heart and stays in the mind. It is a gift to the city and all who visit.\" \"Are Years What?\" is considered by some to be di Suvero's \"breakthrough work.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote that \"it is very useful and convenient that there should be in this city and kingdom a public library, where all sorts of people will be able to study as they wish\".\n\nMore than a century later, Francisco Fabián y Fuero ordered the construction of the premises which currently house the Biblioteca Palafoxiana. He donated his own collection, and the collections of the bishops Manuel Fernández de Santa Cruz and Francisco Pablo Vázquez and the dean of the Francisco Irigoyen Cathedral were gradually added, as were volumes from Pueblan religious schools and individuals. Books confiscated from Jesuits upon their expulsion in 1767 were also added.\n\nThe library was finished in 1773, consisting of a 43-meter-long vaulted hall on the Colegio's second floor. Two levels of bookshelves were built, and a retablo of the Madonna of Trapani by Nino Pisano was acquired. By the mid-19th century, the size of the collection necessitated a third level of bookshelves.\n\nTwo earthquakes in 1999 caused damage to the building and shelves, leading to a restoration program in 2001. The library is open Tuesday through Friday 10am-6pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10am to 6pm.\n\nThe library has, since its inception, been used by any person who wishes to study. \n\nToday, it houses the Institute for Bibliographical Research which has been in charge of publishing \"Los Impresos de la Biblioteca Palafoxiana\" promoting the historical value of the collections and its museum.\n\nThe Biblioteca Palafoxiana has more than 41,000 books and manuscripts, ranging from the 15th to the 20th century. It has three major collections: old books, manuscripts, and pamphlets and broadsheets. It also has nine incunabula. The oldest text in the library is the Chronicle of Nuremberg dated 1493\n\n"}

It is a cel animated cartoon series narrated by John Le Mesurier and Maggie Henderson with music by Derek Griffiths and produced by David Yates. The four books were published in 1965 in the United Kingdom and later in the United States and France. They are: \"Bod's Apple\", \"Bod's Present\", \"Bod's Dream\" and \"Bod and the Cherry Tree\". The French version of \"Bod's Apple\" is called \"La Pomme de Gus\".\n\nBefore the animated series was commissioned, the four books had been read on another BBC children's programme: \"Play School\". In 1974, thirteen five-minute episodes were created for transmission on the BBC as part of the \"Watch with Mother\" series, and were also sold to Australia's ABC channel. Soon thereafter, it was shown in New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Poland and Israel. In the United States, \"Bod\" aired on Nickelodeon as a segment on the \"Pinwheel\" program.\n\nThe character of Bod is a boy who lives in a town with Aunt Flo, PC Copper, Frank the Postman and Farmer Barleymow. Each of the characters has their own theme music performed by Griffiths which is heard when they appear. Regular features are animal identification and Bod Snap.\n\nThere is also another set of characters who appear in each episode called \"Alberto Frog and his Amazing Animal Band\" with artwork by Joanne Cole. This section featured short extracts from famous pieces of classical music as part of the story, and always ended with Alberto choosing a different flavour of milkshake as his reward for solving a problem, and was narrated by Maggie Henderson.\n\n\"Bod\" has appeared in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows and 100 Greatest Cartoons.\n\nAll thirteen Bod episodes are available on DVD.\n\nThe \"Alberto Frog\" segments were produced separately by the BBC and were originally shown alongside the Bod episodes; only five of these thirteen segments are known to survive, following a decision in the early 1990s to wipe a large amount of videotaped 1970s children's programmes  . The five surviving segments are marked above with an asterisk and are present on the Bod DVD. Another was recovered from an old VHS tape and is available on YouTube.\n\nAs well as books for each of the televised episodes, there have been two other tie-in books based on \"Bod\", by Alison and Lo Cole, the children of creators Joanne and Michael Cole. \"Bod's Way: The Meaning of Life\" was being worked on by Michael Cole before he died in 2001, and was completed by Alison.\n\nThe books reveal the Taoist beliefs of Bod's original creators.\n\nBod is a fictional deity in the BBC Radio 4 science fiction comedy \"Nebulous\", and the \"Bod\" theme music is heard in one episode.\n\n\n"}

Cobham Brewer, it was aimed at the growing number of people who did not have a university education, but wanted to understand the origins of phrases and historical or literary allusions. The 'phrase' part of the title refers mainly to the explanation of various idioms and proverbs, while the \"fable\" part might more accurately be labelled \"folklore\" and ranges from classical mythology to relatively recent literature. On top of this, Brewer added notes on important historical figures and events, and other things which he thought would be of interest, such as Roman numerals.\n\nAlthough intended as a comprehensive reference work, early editions of \"Brewer's\" are highly idiosyncratic, with certain editorial decisions suggestive of the author's personal bias. For instance, a list under the entry for \"John\" purported to show the bad luck associated with that name, ending \"Certainly a disastrous list of Popes\" despite several being described merely as \"nonentities\". Some entries seem so trivial as to be hardly worth including, and others are almost definitely apocryphal.\n\nDespite this inconsistency, however, the book was a huge success, providing information often not included in more traditional dictionaries and encyclopedias. A revised and updated edition was published in 1896, shortly before Brewer died. Since then, it has been continually revised and reprinted, often in facsimile, with the 15th edition being the first to make truly wide-scale changes to the content.\n\nEditions of \"Brewers Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\":\n\n\nThis retitled and updated version, initially edited by Adrian Room, was first published in 2000 (). A second edition (), edited by Ian Crofton and John Ayto, was published on 30 November 2010. While this title is based on the structure of \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\", it contains entries from 1900 onwards and exists alongside its parent volume as a separate work.\n\nA variety of spin-off editions has been published in the past, some straying quite far from the theme of 'phrase and fable', such as \"Brewer's Dictionary of Cinema\" (1997) and William Donaldson's A-Z of 'roguish Britons', \"Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics\" (2002). \"Brewer's Dictionary of London Phrase and Fable\" was published in 2009 and \"Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase and Fable\" was reissued at the same time.\n\n\n"}

Operating systems lacking such features, such as DOS, Windows implementations prior to Windows NT (and its descendants), CP/M-80, and all Mac operating systems prior to Mac OS X, had only one category of user who was allowed to do anything. With separate execution contexts it is possible for multiple users to store private files, for multiple users to use a computer at the same time, to protect the system against malicious users, and to protect the system against malicious programs. The first multi-user secure system was Multics, which began development in the 1960s; it wasn't until UNIX, BSD, Linux, and NT in the late 80s and early 90s that multi-tasking security contexts were brought to x86 consumer machines.\n\n\nA major security consideration is the ability of malicious applications to simulate keystrokes or mouse clicks, thus tricking or spoofing the security feature into granting malicious applications higher privileges.\n\n\n\nAnother security consideration is the ability of malicious software to spoof dialogs that look like legitimate security confirmation requests. If the user were to input credentials into a fake dialog, thinking the dialog was legitimate, the malicious software would then know the user's password. If the Secure Desktop or similar feature were disabled, the malicious software could use that password to gain higher privileges.\n\nAnother consideration that has gone into these implementations is usability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order for an operating system to know when to prompt the user for authorization, an application or action needs to identify itself as requiring elevated privileges. While it is technically possible for the user to be prompted at the exact moment that an operation requiring such privileges is executed, it is often not ideal to ask for privileges partway through completing a task. If the user were unable to provide proper credentials, the work done before requiring administrator privileges would have to be undone because the task could not be seen though to the end.\n\nIn the case of user interfaces such as the Control Panel in Microsoft Windows, and the Preferences panels in Mac OS X, the exact privilege requirements are hard-coded into the system so that the user is presented with an authorization dialog at an appropriate time (for example, before displaying information that only administrators should see). Different operating systems offer distinct methods for applications to identify their security requirements:\n\n pete ALL = /usr/bin/passwd [A-z]*, !/usr/bin/passwd root\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5139911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5139911", "title": "Entering Heaven alive", "text": "Entering Heaven alive\n\nEntering Heaven alive (called by various religions \"ascension\", \"assumption\", or \"translation\") is a belief held in various religions. Since death is the normal end to an individual's life on Earth and the beginning of afterlife, entering Heaven without dying first is considered exceptional and usually a sign of a deity's special recognition of the individual's piety.\n\nUnlike the other entries in this article, this paragraph does not, in the view of most Christians, relate to \"entering Heaven alive\". Jesus is considered by the vast majority of Christians to have died before being resurrected and ascending to heaven. In regard to his mother Mary, Eastern Orthodoxy considers her to have died prior to being assumed (translated) into heaven. In like manner, Roman Catholicism affirms that Mary, the mother of Jesus, suffered death prior to her assumption which has been \"expressly affirmed in the Liturgy of the Church\" and is expressly seen in paragraph 20 of the proclamation of this teaching. \nProtestantism generally believes that Mary died a natural death like any other human being and was not subsequently assumed into heaven, although the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism often affirms the assumption.\n\nMost Christians believe Jesus did initially die, but was then resurrected from the dead by God, before being raised bodily to heaven to sit at the Right Hand of God with a promise to someday return to earth. The minority views that Jesus didn't die are known as the Swoon hypothesis and Docetism. \n\nSince the adoption of the Nicene Creed in 325, the Ascension of Jesus into heaven, as related in the New Testament, has been officially taught by all orthodox Christian churches and is celebrated on Ascension Thursday. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Ascension of the Lord is a Holy Day of Obligation. In the Eastern Orthodox Church the Ascension is one of twelve Great Feasts.\n\nIn the Reformed churches' tradition of Calvinism, belief in the ascension of Christ is included in the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Heidelberg Catechism and the Second Helvetic Confession.\"\n\nThe \"Rapture\" is a reference to \"being caught up\" as found in 1 Thessalonians 4:17, when the \"dead in Christ\" and \"we who are alive and remain\" will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord.\n\nAnother kind of entering Heaven alive is mentioned in the Old Testament: the prophet Elijah and the patriarch Enoch, son of Jared and ancestor of Noah.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between \"The Ascension\", in which Christ rose to heaven by his own power, and \"The Assumption\" in which Mary, mother of Jesus, was raised to heaven by God's power. (Enoch and Elijah are said in scripture to have been \"assumed\" [experienced assumption] into heaven.)\n\nOn November 1, 1950, Pope Pius XII, acting \"ex cathedra\", issued \"Munificentissimus Deus\", an authoritative statement of official doctrine of Roman Catholicism. In Section 44 the pope stated:\n\nThe doctrine is based on Sacred Tradition that Mary, mother of Jesus, was bodily assumed into heaven. For centuries before that, the assumption was celebrated in art. The proclamation states that Mary suffered bodily death before being assumed into Heaven. Some theologians have argued that Mary didn't die, but this is contrary to the text of the dogma's proclamation.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that three other persons were taken bodily into heaven: Enoch, Elijah (Elias) and the Theotokos (Virgin Mary). Similar to the Western \"Assumption\" of Mary, the Orthodox celebrate the Dormition of the Theotokos on August 15. Unlike Western uncertainty about Mary's physical death, the Orthodox teach that Mary died a natural death like any other human being, that she was buried by the Apostles (except for Thomas, who was late), and three days later (after Thomas had arrived) was found to be missing from her tomb. The church teaches that the Apostles received a revelation during which the Theotokos appeared to them and told them she had been resurrected by Jesus and taken body and soul into heaven. The Orthodox teach that Mary already enjoys the fullness of heavenly bliss that the other saints will experience only after the Last Judgment.\n\nThere is a teaching among the Orthodox that the \"Two Witnesses\" referred to in the Book of Revelation are Enoch and Elijah, who will be sent back to earth to preach the Gospel in the time of apostasy, and will be the last Christian martyrs before the Second Coming. According to Revelation, they will be resurrected and ascend again to heaven.\n\n\nYudhishthira of the Mahabharata is believed to be the only human able to cross the plane between mortals and heaven, while still in his mortal body.\nBut before him, his brother Arjuna had been to heaven and lived there for 5 years in his human body.\nHis grand-uncle Bhishma had lived and studied in heaven. \nHis ancestor, King Puru had been to heaven. Indeed, many kings, including Nahusha were admitted to heaven in their human body. \nSant Tukaram was taken to Vaikunta on Garuda Vahan which was witnessed by all the village people.\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu disappeared after entering the temple deity room of Lord Jagannath.\n\nRamalinga Swamigal (Swami Ramalinga), a great Sage revered by his teaching. Ramalinga supposedly attained the Supreme Body of the Godhead when Divinity itself merged with him. He was reported to have disappeared after deciding to de-materialize his immortal body by his own free will, his body was never found.\n\nThe Mother (Mirra Alafassa), the foremost disciple of the Hindu philosopher and guru Sri Aurobindo, attempted the physical transformation of her body in order to become what she felt was the first of a new type of human individual by opening to the Supramental Truth Consciousness, a new power of spirit that Sri Aurobindo had allegedly discovered. She believed that she could create for herself a new kind of “light body”. However, she died and was cremated.\n\nIslamic teaching states that Muhammad ascended into heaven alive at the site of the Dome of the Rock. However, this ascent was temporary and he came back to Earth. It is ascribed to the exact descriptions presented in both the Quran and the Hadith.\n\nIslamic texts deny the idea of crucifixion or death attributed to Jesus by the New Testament. The Quran states that people (i.e., the Jews and Romans) sought to kill Jesus, but they could not crucify or kill him, although \"this was made to appear to them\". Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead he was raised by God unto the heavens. This \"raising\" is often understood to mean through bodily ascension.\n\nSome Islamic scholars have identified the prophet Idris to be the same person as Enoch from the Bible. This is because the Qu'ran states that God \"raised him to a lofty station\", and that has been taken to be a term for ascending, upon which it is concluded that \"Idris\" was \"Enoch\".\n\nIn the Hebrew bible the word for \"heavens\" is \"shamayim\". This is plural - it means \"heavens\", not \"heaven\" - but seems nevertheless to have a singular meaning: i.e., the older parts of the bible speak of \"heavens\" in the plural but evidence for a belief in more than one heaven from the bible is lacking. Shamayim also meant \"sky\", the atmosphere, as it does in modern English. The blue dome of the sky was called the \"raqia\", and was believed to be a solid shield between the atmosphere and the true heaven where God lived. Heaven was the realm of God, earth of mankind, and the underworld was for the dead, and travel between them was generally impossible, although God and his messengers frequently appear on earth and the dead can be summoned up from the underworld as the Witch of Endor summons the shade of Samuel.\n\nThere are two possible exceptions to this general rule that humans could not go to heaven, Enoch and Elijah, but neither is clear. The Book of Genesis mentions Enoch as one who \"was no more\" because \"God took him\", but it does not explicitly say whether he was alive or dead, and it does not say where God took him. The Books of Kings describes the prophet Elijah being taken towards \"shamayim\" in a whirlwind, but the word can mean both heaven as the abode of God, or the sky (as the word \"heavens\" does in modern English), and so again the text is ambiguous.\n\nAccording to the post-biblical Jewish Midrash, eight people went to heaven (also referred to as the Garden of Eden and Paradise) alive: \n\nIt is believed in Zoroastrianism that the Peshotanu was taken up into Heaven alive and will someday return as the Zoroastrian messiah.\n\nMembers of various Ascended Master Teachings, a group of New Age religions based on Theosophy, believe that Francis Bacon underwent a physical Ascension without experiencing death (he then became the deity St. Germain). They also believe numerous others have undergone Ascension; they are called the Ascended Masters and are worshipped in this group of religions. The leaders of these religions claim to be able to receive channeled messages from the Ascended Masters, which they then relay to their followers.\n\n\n"}

The song describes the outcome of an affair between a young weaver and a girl he courted for some time. She initially comes to his bed because she is afraid of the \"foggy, foggy dew\" but it seems she often returned. Early versions of the song refer to her fear of the \"bugaboo\" rather than the foggy dew. It is cataloged as Laws No. O03 and Roud Folk Song Index No. 558.\n\nThe song is a lamentful ballad of a lover. It was published on a broadside around 1815, though there are very many versions: Cecil Sharp collected eight versions. Burl Ives, who popularized the song in the United States in the 1940s, claimed that a version dated to colonial America, and he was once jailed in Mona, Utah, for singing it in public, when authorities deemed it a bawdy song. BBC Radio likewise restricted broadcast of the song to programmes covering folk tunes or the works of Benjamin Britten. The tune is a late 18th or early 19th century revision of \"When I First Came to Court\", licensed in 1689. \n\n\"When I was a bachelor, I liv'd all alone\"\n\"I worked at the weaver's trade\"\n\"And the only, only thing that I ever did wrong\"\n\"Was to woo a fair young maid.\"\n\"I wooed her in the wintertime\"\n\"And in the summer, too\"\n\"And the only, only thing that I did that was wrong\"\n\"Was to keep her from the foggy, foggy dew.\"\n\n\"One night she came to my bedside\"\n\"When I was fast asleep.\"\n\"She laid her head upon my bed\"\n\"And she began to weep.\"\n\"She sighed, she cried, she damn near died\"\n\"She said what shall I do?\"\n\"So I hauled her into bed and covered up her head\"\n\"Just to keep her from the foggy foggy dew.\"\n\n\"So, I am a bachelor, I live with my son\"\n\"And we work at the weaver's trade.\"\n\"And every single time that I look into his eyes\"\n\"He reminds me of that fair young maid.\"\n\"He reminds me of the wintertime\"\n\"And of the summer, too,\"\n\"And of the many, many times that I held her in my arms\"\n\"Just to keep her from the foggy, foggy, dew.\"\n\nA further verse, generally used as the penultimate one, is:\n\n\"Twas in the first part of the night\"\n\"That we did sport and play\"\n\"And in the second part of the night\"\n\"She in my arms did lay\"\n\"When morning came, she said to me\"\n\"Oh sir, I am undone.\"\n\"Oh hold your row, you silly young gal<br>\n\"The foggy dew is gone\".<br>\"\n"}

{"id": "419375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419375", "title": "National Museum of the American Indian", "text": "National Museum of the American Indian\n\nThe National Museum of the American Indian is part of the Smithsonian Institution and is committed to advancing knowledge and understanding of the Native cultures of the Western Hemisphere—past, present, and future—through partnership with Native people and others. The museum works to support the continuance of culture, traditional values, and transitions in contemporary Native life. It has three facilities: the National Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., which opened on September 21, 2004, on Fourth Street and Independence Avenue, Southwest; the George Gustav Heye Center, a permanent museum in New York City; and the Cultural Resources Center, a research and collections facility in Suitland, Maryland. The foundations for the present collections were first assembled in the former Museum of the American Indian in New York City, which was established in 1916, and which became part of the Smithsonian in 1990.\n\nFollowing controversy over the discovery by Native American leaders that the Smithsonian Institution held more than 12,000–18,000 Indian remains, mostly in storage, United States Senator Daniel Inouye introduced in 1989 the National Museum of the American Indian Act. Passed as Public Law 101-185, it established the National Museum of the American Indian as \"a living memorial to Native Americans and their traditions\". The Act also required that human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony be considered for repatriation to tribal communities, as well as objects acquired illegally. Since 1989 the Smithsonian has repatriated over 5,000 individual remains – about 1/3 of the total estimated human remains in its collection.\n\nOn September 21, 2004, for the inauguration of the Museum, Senator Inouye addressed an audience of around 20,000 American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians, which was the largest gathering in Washington D.C. of indigenous people to its time.\n\nThe creation of the museum brought together the collections of the George Gustav Heye Center in New York City, founded in 1922, and the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nThe Heye collection became part of the Smithsonian in June 1990, and represents approximately 85% of the holdings of the NMAI. The Heye Collection was formerly displayed in the Audubon Terrace location, but had long been seeking a new building.\n\nThe Museum of the American Indian considered options of merging with the Museum of Natural History, accepting a large donation from Ross Perot to be housed in a new museum building to be built in Dallas, or moving to the U.S. Customs House. The Heye Trust included a restriction requiring the collection to be displayed in New York City, and moving the collection to a Museum outside of New York aroused substantial opposition from New York politicians. The current arrangement represented a political compromise between those who wished to keep the Heye Collection in New York, and those who wanted it to be part of the new NMAI in Washington, DC. The NMAI was initially housed in lower Manhattan at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, which was refurbished for this purpose and remains an exhibition site; its building on the Mall in Washington, DC opened in 2005.\n\nThe museum of American Indian has three branches: National Museum of the American Indian in the National Mall (Washington, D.C.), George Gustav Heye Center in New York City, and the Cultural Resources Center in Maryland.\n\nThe site on the National Mall opened in September 2004. Fifteen years in the making, it is the first national museum in the country dedicated exclusively to Native Americans. The five-story, , curvilinear building is clad in a golden-colored Kasota limestone designed to evoke natural rock formations shaped by wind and water over thousands of years.\n\nThe museum is set in a -site and is surrounded by simulated wetlands. The museum's east-facing entrance, its prism window and its high space for contemporary Native performances are direct results of extensive consultations with Native peoples. Similar to the Heye Center in Lower Manhattan, the museum offers a range of exhibitions, film and video screenings, school group programs, public programs and living culture presentations throughout the year.\n\nThe museum's architect and project designer is Canadian Douglas Cardinal (Blackfoot); its design architects are GBQC Architects of Philadelphia and architect Johnpaul Jones (Cherokee/Choctaw). Disagreements during construction led to Cardinal's being removed from the project, but the building retains his original design intent. He provided continued input during the museum's construction. The structural engineering firm chosen for this project was Severud Associates.\n\nThe museum's project architects are Jones & Jones Architects and Landscape Architects Ltd. of Seattle and SmithGroup of Washington, D.C., in association with Lou Weller (Caddo), the Native American Design Collaborative, and Polshek Partnership Architects of New York City; Ramona Sakiestewa (Hopi) and Donna House (Navajo/Oneida) also served as design consultants. The landscape architects are Jones & Jones Architects and Landscape Architects Ltd. of Seattle and EDAW, Inc., of Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nIn general, Native Americans have filled the leadership roles in the design and operation of the museum and have aimed at creating a different atmosphere and experience from museums of European and Euro-American culture. Donna E. House, the Navajo and Oneida botanist who supervised the landscaping, has said, \"The landscape flows into the building, and the environment is who we are. We are the trees, we are the rocks, we are the water. And that had to be part of the museum.\" This theme of organic flow is reflected by the interior of the museum, whose walls are mostly curving surfaces, with almost no sharp corners.\n\nThe Mitsitam Native Foods Cafe is divided into Native regional sections such as the Northern Woodlands, South America, the Northwest Coast, Meso-America, and the Great Plains; The museum has published a \"Mitisam Cafe Cookbook.\" The only Native American groups not represented in the café are the south eastern tribes such as the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee and Seminole, many of which supported the United States throughout the tribes' histories.\n\nGeorge Gustav Heye (1874–1957) traveled throughout North and South America collecting native objects. His collection was assembled over 54 years, beginning in 1903. He started the Museum of the American Indian and his Heye Foundation in 1916. The Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian opened to the public on Audubon Terrace in New York City in 1922.\n\nThe museum at Audubon Terrace closed in 1994 and part of the collection is now housed at The Museum's George Gustav Heye Center, that occupies two floors of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Lower Manhattan. The Beaux Arts-style building, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, was completed in 1907. It is a designated National Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark. The center's exhibition and public access areas total about . The Heye Center offers a range of exhibitions, film and video screenings, school group programs and living culture presentations throughout the year.\n\nIn Suitland, Maryland, the National Museum of the American Indian operates the Cultural Resources Center, an enormous, nautilus-shaped building which houses the collection, a library, and the photo archives. The Cultural Resources Center opened in 2003.\n\nThe National Museum of the American Indian is home to the collection of the former Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The collection includes more than 800,000 objects, as well as a photographic archive of 125,000 images. It is divided into the following areas: Amazon; Andes; Arctic/Subarctic; California/Great Basin; Contemporary Art; Mesoamerican/Caribbean; Northwest Coast; Patagonia; Plains/Plateau; Woodlands.\n\nThe collection, which became part of the Smithsonian in June 1990, was assembled by George Gustav Heye (1874–1957) during a 54-year period, beginning in 1903. He traveled throughout North and South America collecting Native objects. Heye used his collection to found New York's Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation and directed it until his death in 1957. The Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian opened to the public in New York City in 1922.\n\nThe collection is not subject to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. When the National Museum was created in 1989, a law governing repatriation was drafted specifically for the museum, the National Museum of the American Indian Act, upon which NAGPRA was modeled. In addition to repatriation, the museum dialogues with tribal communities regarding the appropriate curation of cultural heritage items. For example, the human remains vault is smudged once a week with tobacco, sage, sweetgrass, and cedar, and sacred Crow objects in the Plains vault are smudged with sage during the full moon. If the appropriate cultural tradition for curating an object is unknown, the Native staff uses their own cultural knowledge and customs to treat materials as respectfully as possible.\n\nThe museum has programs in which Native American scholars and artists can view NMAI's collections to enhance their own research and artwork.\n\nIn 2014 NMAI opened a new exhibition \"Nation to Nation: Treaties,\" curated by Indian rights activist Suzan Shown Harjo. The exhibit is built around the Two Row Wampum Treaty, known from both Indian oral tradition and a written document that some believe is a modern forgery. Museum reviewer Diana Muir Appelbaum has said that \"There is no evidence that there ever was a 1613 treaty\" and describes NMAI as \"a museum that peddles fairy tales.\"\n\nThe National Museum of the American Indian has been criticized occasionally for a perceived disjointedness of its exhibits. Two \"Washington Post\" reviews on the museum were hostile at the representation of the American Indian. Two writers, Fisher and Richard, expressed \"irritation and frustration at the cognitive dissonance they experienced once inside the museum\". Fisher expected the displays that depicted the clash between foreign colonists and the native people. The exhibit lacked a trace of Indians' evolution from centuries of life on this land, and gave little information as to the history of their survival. He concludes, \"The museum feels like a trade show in which each group of Indians gets space to sell its founding myth and favorite anecdotes of survival. Each room is a sales booth of its own, separate, out of context, gathered in a museum that adds to the balkanization of a society that seems ever more ashamed of the unity and purpose that sustained it over two centuries\". Richards, who also had a similar assessment of the NMAI, begins his criticism by observing that he found the exhibits to be confusing and unclearly marked. To him, the exhibits were full with a mixture of \"totem poles and T-shirts, headdresses and masks, toys and woven baskets, projectile points and gym shoes\". According to him, the items were presented in a hodgepodge that displayed history in an incoherent demonstration.\n\nEdward Rothstein described the NMAI as an \"identity museum\" that \"jettisons Western scholarship and tells its own story, leading one tribe to solemnly describe its earliest historical milestone: \"Birds teach people to call for rain\"; similarly, Diana Muir accused the curators of going \"with verve and confidence to a place where subjective personal narrative is privileged above factual evidence, and the deliberate myth-making of an active national revival trumps scholarship.\"\n\nAttendance is low, compared to other museums on the Mall. Although the museum had 2.4 million visitors the year it opened, it has averaged only 1.4 million in the years since and is said to be \"best known\" for its cafeteria. The Washington Post described it in 2015 as \"remarkably empty\" of visitors and attributed this to exhibits that feel \"disjointed and incomplete.\"\n\nKevin Gover is the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian as of December 2, 2007. He is a former professor of law at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University in Tempe, an affiliate professor in its American Indian Studies Program and co-executive director of the university's American Indian Policy Institute. Gover, 52, grew up in Oklahoma and is a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and of Comanche descent. He received his bachelor's degree in public and international affairs from Princeton University and his law degree from the University of New Mexico. He was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from Princeton University in 2001.\n\nGover succeeds W. Richard West Jr. (Southern Cheyenne), who was the founding director of the National Museum of the American Indian (1990–2007).\n\nWest was strongly criticized in 2007 for having spent $250,000 on travel in four years and being away from the museum frequently on overseas travel. This was official travel funded by the Smithsonian, and many within the Native American community offered defenses of West and his tenure.\n\nThe museum publishes a quarterly magazine, called the \"American Indian\", which focuses on a wide range of topics pertaining to Native Americans. It won the Native American Journalists Association's General Excellence awards in 2002 and 2003. The magazine's mission is to: \"Celebrate Native Traditions and Communities\".\n\n\n"}

It served as residence to the Portuguese Royal Family and later to the Brazilian Imperial Family until 1889, when the country became a republic through a coup d'état deposing Emperor Pedro II. Then, the palace briefly served as a public building by the provisional government for the constituent assembly of the first republican constitution. It housed the major part (92.5%) of the collection of the National Museum of Brazil, which, together with the building, were largely destroyed by a fire on 2 September 2018..\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the area where the Palace is currently located, was part of a Jesuit farm in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. With the expulsion of the Order in 1759, the property was dismembered and passed into private ownership.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the area known as \"Quinta da Boa Vista\" (Good View Estate), because could be seen from there the Tijuca Forest, the Corcovado Hill and the Cajú Beach, belonged to the Portuguese-Lebanese slave merchant, \"Elie Antun Lubbus\", (\"Elias Antônio Lopes\" in Portuguese language), who had erected, around 1803, a manor house on top of a hill, from which one had a good view of the Guanabara Bay – which gave rise to the current name of region. When the Portuguese court was transferred to Brazil, in 1808, Elias António Lopes donated his farm to the Prince Regent John VI. John VI appreciated the gift and stayed for long periods in the manor house. Before belonging to the monarchy, the residence had nothing special. It was just one of many colonial-style mansions scattered throughout the country. With the arrival of John VI to Brazil, who had left Lisbon fleeing Napoleon in 1808, countless houses in Rio were expropriated to house the Portuguese of the royal entourage. Before his Quinta da Boa Vista was confiscated, the merchant Elias Antônio Lopes hastened to donate it to the king. In thanks for his mime, João VI granted Lopes titles of nobility and a fat indemnity. The mansion underwent countless renovations over the decades. An imposing masonry and cast iron gate was set there. It was built a side tower in Moorish style. There was a semicircular staircase to enter the residence on the second floor. Later, another tower rose, at the opposite end, in neoclassical style. The ladder was destroyed, and the entrance turned to the first floor. The third floor was built. The Moorish tower was rebuilt, which became also neoclassical.\n\nThe purpose of the changes was to leave the Palace of São Cristóvão to the height of the power of the Brazilian Empire. In 1847, Parliament approved a government bill that would allocate 240 contos de reis to the completion of the reforms. The works seemed to have no end. For Senator \"Clemente Pereira (PA)\", Pedro II would do better if he left Sao Cristóvão, Pereira's proposal was approved, but the government did not even design a new imperial palace.\n\nPrince Regent John and his family had been living in the Paço Imperial since their arrival in Rio de Janeiro in 1808. The prince regent felt very honored by Elias's gift of the best house in Rio and rewarded Elias with another property, not quite as grand. He began transforming the manor into a royal residence. \n\nAt the time, the area of the farm was still surrounded by mangroves and communication by land with the city was difficult. Later, the wetlands were drained and the roads improved.\n\nTo better accommodate the royal family, the manor house, though vast and comfortable, needed to be adapted. The most important renovation was begun at the time of the nuptials of Prince Pedro with the Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, in 1819, and finished 1821. The renovation was directed by English architect John Johnston. In front of the palace, Johnston installed a decorative portico, a gift sent from England to Brazil by Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. The gate, inspired by Robert Adams' porch for the \"Sion House\", the nobleman's residence in England, is shaped in a kind of terracotta called \"Coade stone\" manufactured by the English company Coade & Sealy.\n\nThe architectural line of the palace is similar to that of the Ajuda Palace which, left behind in Lisbon, was never finished. The Palace of São Cristóvão won deserved prominence as the new state palace of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and, subsequently, of the Portuguese Empire.\n\nAfter the declaration of Independence of Brazil in 1822, the palace became the residence of Emperor Pedro I. The remodelling and expansion of the palace continued under Portuguese architect Manuel da Costa (1822–1826), followed by French architect Pedro José Pezerát (1826–1831), credited as the author of the definitive Neoclassical project of the building. He added a new tower to the left of the main façade and added a third floor to the palace. The works were continued after 1847 by Brazilian artist Manuel de Araújo Porto-alegre, who harmonised the style of the façades, followed by the German Theodore Marx (1857–1868). Italian painter Mario Bragaldi decorated many of the rooms of the palace, including the Throne Room and the Ambassadors' Room, with paintings in \"trompe-l'œil\".\n\nAfter the marriage of Pedro I and Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria in 1817, the Imperial couple resided in the palace. The future Queen of Portugal, Maria II, and the future Emperor of Brazil Pedro II were born here. Empress Maria Leopoldina died in the palace in 1826. Pedro II, future Emperor, grew up and was educated in the palace, and in 1869 ordered the remodelling of the gardens. French garden designer Auguste François Marie Glaziou was put in charge of the project, which included artificial lakes, bridges, caves and fake ancient temples, all following the Romantic trend of the time. Pedro II's children were also born in the palace, including Princess Isabel, famous for having abolished slavery from Brazil in 1888. After the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, the Imperial family left the country and the palace and its surrounding gardens became empty.\n\nIn 1891, the building was used by Brazilian politicians writing the first Republican Constitution of the country. \n\nIn 1892, the director of the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro managed to transfer the institution from the Campo de Santana to the palace. The inner decoration of the palace was dispersed, but part of it can still be found in other museums, like the Imperial Museum of Petrópolis, in which the Throne Room was reassembled.\n\nAt the time, the gardens had a long period of abandonment, but in 1909 President Nilo Peçanha had them restored and surrounded, preserving the characteristics that were given to him by Glaziou.\n\nFounded in 1818 by King John VI of Portugal, the National Museum was transferred to the old Imperial Palace of São Cristóvão in 1892. During its long history, its collections have been greatly expanded by acquisitions and donations, including by Emperor Pedro II, a great sponsor of the sciences. The collections included Astronomy (mostly meteorites), Palaeontology, Natural history, Ethnology (including many interesting works by Brazilian indigenous peoples) and Archaeology (mostly antiquities from ancient Egypt).\n\nMuch of the art collection displayed by the Museum still consisted of what was gathered by the Emperor Pedro II himself. In this manner, it reflects 19th-century views of Anthropology, Archeology and sciences in general.\n\nVisitors could also see a few rooms of the ancient Palace with its original painted and stucco decoration, like the Throne Room, the Ambassadors' Room and the room of Empress Teresa Cristina. These rooms still displayed a couple original pieces but were overall empty.\n\nOn 2 September 2018, the palace was devastated by a enxtensive fire. The damage to heritage assets have been reported to be \"incalculable\". One of the few known surviving major artifacts is the Bendegó meteorite. After the fire, a metallic roof covering 5,000 m² upper the debris is planned to be built.\n\nSince then, years, months and days have passed since the fire.\n\n<br>\n\n\n"}

{"id": "766132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=766132", "title": "Shortfin mako shark", "text": "Shortfin mako shark\n\nThe shortfin mako shark (\"Isurus oxyrinchus\"), also known as the blue pointer or bonito shark, is a large mackerel shark. It is commonly referred to as the mako shark, as is the longfin mako shark (\"Isurus paucus\"). The shortfin mako is on record as the fastest-swimming shark, capable of bursts of speed up to .\n\n\"Mako\" comes from the Māori language, meaning either the shark or a shark tooth. As in the Māori language (where there is no letter \"s\"), \"mako\" is both singular and plural. The word may have originated in a dialectal variation as it is similar to the common words for shark in a number of Polynesian languages—\"makō\" in the Kāi Tahu Māori dialect, \"mangō\" in other Māori dialects, \"mago\" in Samoan, \"ma'o\" in Tahitian, and \"mano\" in Hawaiian. The first written usage is in Lee and Kendall's \"Grammar and vocabulary of the language of New Zealand\" (1820), which simply states, \"Máko; A certain fish\". Richard Taylor's \"A leaf from the natural history of New Zealand\" (1848) is more elaborate: \"Mako, the shark which has the tooth so highly prized by the Maoris\".\nIn 1809, Constantine Rafinesque gave the shortfin mako the scientific name \"Isurus oxyrinchus\" (\"isurus\" means \"the same tail\", \"oxyrinchus\" means \"pointy snout\").\n\nThe shortfin mako shark is a fairly large species of shark. Growth rates appear to be somewhat accelerated in comparison to other species in the lamnid family. An average adult specimen measures around in length and weighs from . The species is sexually dimorphic, with females typically larger than males. Large specimens are known, with a few large, mature females exceeding a length of and a weight of . The largest taken on hook-and-line was , caught off the coast of California on June 3, 2013, and the longest verified length was caught off of the coast of France in September 1973. A specimen caught off the coast of Italy and examined in an Italian fish market in 1881 was reported to weigh an extraordinary at a length of . Yet another fish was caught off Marmaris, Turkey in the late 1950's at an estimated size of between 5.77 m (18.9 ft) and 6.19 m (20.3 ft) making it the largest known specimen of the species. However, this estimate was created using photos of the shark and not at the time of capture so this estimate must be taken with reasonable caution. The authors did not estimate a weight for this specimen.\n\nThe shortfin mako shark is cylindrical in shape, with a vertically elongated tail. This species exhibits countershading, with brilliant metallic blue coloration dorsally and white ventrally. The line of demarcation between blue and white on the body is distinct. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth are white. Larger specimens tend to possess darker coloration that extends onto parts of the body that would be white in smaller individuals. The juvenile mako differs in that it has a clear blackish stain on the tip of the snout. The longfin mako shark very much resembles the shortfin mako shark, but has larger pectoral fins, dark rather than pale coloration around the mouth and larger eyes. The presence of only one lateral keel on the tail and the lack of lateral cusps on the teeth distinguish the mako from the closely related porbeagle sharks of the genus \"Lamna\".\n\nThe shortfin mako inhabits offshore temperate and tropical seas worldwide. The closely related longfin mako shark is found in the Gulf Stream or warmer offshore waters. (For ex. New Zealand and Maine.)\n\nIt is a pelagic species that can be found from the surface to depths of , normally far from land, though occasionally closer to shore, around islands or inlets. One of the very few known endothermic sharks, it is seldom found in waters colder than 16 °C (61 °F).\n\nIn the western Atlantic, it can be found from Argentina and the Gulf of Mexico to Browns Bank off of Nova Scotia. In Canadian waters, these sharks are neither abundant nor rare. Swordfish are good indicators of shortfin mako populations, as the former are a source of food and prefer similar environmental conditions.\n\nShortfin mako sharks travel long distances to seek prey or mates. In December 1998, a female tagged off California was captured in the central Pacific by a Japanese research vessel, meaning this fish traveled over . Another specimen swam in 37 days, averaging a day.\n\nThe shortfin mako shark feeds mainly upon cephalopods and bony fish including mackerels, tunas, bonitos, and swordfish, but it may also eat other sharks, porpoises, sea turtles, and seabirds. They hunt by lunging vertically up and tearing off chunks of their preys' flanks and fins. Mako swim below their prey, so they can see what is above and have a high probability of reaching prey before it notices. In Ganzirri and Isola Lipari, Sicily, shortfin mako have been found with amputated swordfish bills impaled into their head and gills, suggesting swordfish seriously injure and likely kill them. In addition, this location, and the late spring and early summer timing, corresponding to the swordfish's spawning cycle, suggests they hunt while the swordfish are most vulnerable, typical of many predators.\n\nShortfin mako sharks consume 3% of their weight each day and take about 1.5–2.0 days to digest an average-sized meal. By comparison, the sandbar shark, an inactive species, consumes 0.6% of its weight a day and takes 3 to 4 days to digest it. An analysis of the stomach contents of 399 male and female mako sharks ranging from suggest mako from Cape Hatteras to the Grand Banks prefer bluefish, constituting 77.5% of their diet by volume. The average capacity of the stomach was 10% of the total weight. Shortfin mako sharks consumed 4.3% to 14.5% of the available bluefish between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank.\n\nShortfin mako sharks over have interior teeth considerably wider and flatter than smaller mako, which enables them to prey effectively upon dolphins, swordfish, and other sharks. An amateur videotape, taken in Pacific waters, shows a moribund pantropical spotted dolphin whose tail was almost completely severed being circled by a shortfin mako. Mako also tend to scavenge long-lined and netted fish.\n\nIts endothermic constitution partly accounts for its relatively great speed.\n\nLike other lamnid sharks, the shortfin mako shark has a heat-exchange circulatory system that allows the shark to be 7–10 °F (4–7 °C) warmer than the surrounding water. This system enables them to maintain a stable, very high level of activity, giving it an advantage over its cold-blooded prey.\n\nThe shortfin mako is the fastest species of shark. Its speed has been recorded at , with bursts of up to allowing it to jump to heights of approximately . These characteristics have made the shortfin mako a highly sought-after game fish worldwide. Some cases of shortfin mako jumping into a boat after having been hooked have been reported.\n\nThe shortfin mako shark is a yolk-sac ovoviviparous shark, giving birth to live young. Developing embryos feed on unfertilized eggs (oophagy) within the uterus during the 15- to 18-month gestation period. They do not engage in sibling cannibalism unlike the sand tiger shark (\"Carcharias taurus\"). The four to 18 surviving young are born live in the late winter and early spring at a length of about . Females may rest for 18 months after birth before mating again. Shortfin mako sharks bear young on average every three years.\n\nShortfin mako sharks, as with most other sharks, are aged by sectioning vertebrae — one of the few bony structures in sharks — and counting growth bands. The age of shortfin mako, and therefore important parameters, such as age at sexual maturity and longevity, were severely underestimated until 2006 (e.g. claims of sexual maturity at 4–6 years, claims of longevity as low as 11 years), because of a poorly supported belief that shortfin mako sharks deposited two growth bands per year in their vertebrae. This belief was overturned by a landmark study which proved that shortfin mako sharks only deposit one band in their vertebrae per year, as well as providing validated ages for numerous specimens. Natanson et al. (2006) aged 258 shortfin mako specimens and recorded:\n\nSimilar, validated age findings were made (median age at maturity in males 7–9 years, median age at maturity in females 19–21 years, longevity estimates 29 years and 28 years respectively) in New Zealand waters.\n\nDue to this error, fishery management models and ecological risk assessment models in use around the world were underestimating both the longevity and the age at sexual maturity in shortfin mako sharks, particularly in females, by two-thirds or more (i.e. 6 years versus 18+ years), and some of these inaccurate models remain in use.\n\nOf all studied sharks, the shortfin mako has one of the largest brain:body ratios. This large brain size prompted New Zealand Sealife Australia and New Zealand senior curator Craig Thorburn of Auckland, New Zealand, and film-maker Mike Bhana to investigate the intelligence of the mako. From tests involving shape differentiation to electroreception tests and individual recognition, Isuru Somawardana and his team of shark experts discovered mako are fast-learning sharks, able to determine whether or not the researchers were threatening. The sharks involved in the study (while never the same individuals) after initial caution showed unique and never before seen behaviors, such as refusing to roll back their eyes during feeding and allowing themselves to be briefly restrained and touched while being offered bait. Shortfin mako also do not rely on electroreception when hunting, unlike the great white shark, based on tests involving wired fiberglass fish designed to emit weak electrical signals resembling real fish of similar size. Instead, they rely on smell, hearing, and most prominently, vision. The results of this research were featured on a documentary presented by Shark Week in 1999 called \" Mako: Swift, Smart & Deadly\".\n\nMako fishing is a predominant activity around the world. As one of the fastest species in the water they offer acrobatic flips, fast runs, and heavy fights that entertain anglers. Traditionally the sharks are hooked through the use of chum and baitcasters. However fly fishing for them has become more popular, particularly in San Diego, where one of the 3 known worldwide mako rookeries is located. A cottage industry of fishing in this rookery has emerged, specifically catch and release with charter operations out of Mission Bay. For many years the mass commercial boats hunted them for restaurant catch but through the efforts of many local fishing companies and national organizations such as Orvis this has been curbed.\n\nOf all recorded attempts to keep pelagic shark species in captivity, the shortfin mako shark has fared the poorest, even more so than the oceanic whitetip shark, the blue shark, and the great white shark. The current record is held by a specimen kept at the New Jersey Aquarium for only five days in 2001. Like past attempts at keeping \"Isurus\" in captivity, the animal appeared strong on arrival, but had trouble negotiating the walls of the aquarium, refused to feed, quickly weakened, and died.\n\nISAF statistics records 9 shortfin attacks on humans between 1580 and 2017, one of which was fatal, along with 20 boat attacks. This mako is regularly blamed for attacks on humans and, due to its speed, power, and size, it is certainly capable of injuring and killing people. However, this species will not generally attack humans and does not seem to treat them as prey. Most modern attacks involving shortfin mako sharks are considered to have been provoked due to harassment or the shark being caught on a fishing line. Sharks can be attracted to spear fishermen carrying a stuck fish, and may slap them with cavitation bubbles from a swift tail flick. Divers who have encountered shortfin mako note, prior to an attack, they swim in a figure-eight pattern and approach with mouths open.\n\nThe shortfin mako is currently classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN, having been uplisted from Near threatened in 2007. The species is being targeted by both sport and commercial fisheries, and there is a substantial proportion of bycatch in driftnet fisheries for other species.\n\nThe largest Mako ever recorded was caught in June 2013 off Huntington Beach, California. Its dimensions were 3.73 m (12.2 feet) long, 2.44 m circumference shortfin mako shark, and weighing 600 kg (1,323 lb). A certified weigh master called it a world record.\n\n\n"}

After a career sailing from Great Britain to India and New Zealand, she became a salmon hauler on the Alaska to California route. Retired in 1926, she was not restored until 1962–63 and is a seaworthy museum ship home-ported at the Maritime Museum of San Diego in San Diego, California. She is the oldest ship still sailing regularly and also the oldest iron-hulled merchant ship still floating. The ship is both a California Historical Landmark and United States National Historic Landmark.\n\nNamed for Euterpe, the muse of music, she was a full-rigged ship (a ship that is square-rigged on all three masts), built of iron in 1863 by Gibson, McDonald & Arnold, of Ramsey, Isle of Man, for the Indian jute trade of Wakefield Nash & Company of Liverpool. She was launched on 14 November 1863, and assigned British Registration No.47617 and signal VPJK.\n\n\"Euterpe's\" career had a rough beginning. She sailed for Calcutta from Liverpool on 9 January 1864, under the command of Captain William John Storry. A collision with an unlit Spanish brig off the coast of Wales carried away the jib-boom and damaged other rigging. The crew became mutinous, refusing to continue, and she returned to Anglesey to repair; 17 of the crew were confined to the Beaumaris Jail at hard labor. Then, in 1865, \"Euterpe\" was forced to cut away her masts in a gale in the Bay of Bengal off Madras and limped to Trincomalee and Calcutta for repair. Captain Storry died during the return voyage to England and was buried at sea.\n\nAfter her near-disastrous first two voyages \"Euterpe\" was sold, first in 1871 to David Brown of London for whom she made four more relatively uneventful voyages to India, then again (displaced by steamers after the opening of the Suez Canal) in 1871 to Shaw, Savill and Company of London (which in 1882 became the Shaw, Savill & Albion Line). In late 1871 she began twenty-five years of carrying passengers and freight in the New Zealand emigrant trade, each voyage going eastward around the world before returning to England. The fastest of her 21 passages to New Zealand took 100 days, the longest 143 days. She also made ports of call in Australia, California, and Chile. A baby was born on one of those trips en route to New Zealand, and was given the middle name Euterpe. Another child, John William Philips Palmer, was born on the 1873 journey to Dunedin, New Zealand, and was partially named after the captain Theo E. Philips (\"Born Lo 42.30 south La 0.30 west at 11 am Feb 21\").\n\nIn 1897, after 21 round-the-world trips, \"Euterpe\" was sold, first to Hawaiian owners, then in 1899 to the Pacific Colonial Ship Company of San Francisco, California and from 1898 to 1901 made four voyages between the Pacific Northwest, Australia and Hawaii carrying primarily lumber, coal and sugar. She was registered in the United States on 30 October 1900.\n\nIn 1901, \"Euterpe\" was sold to the Alaska Packers' Association of San Francisco, who re-rigged her as a barque (converting the square-rigged aftermost mast to fore-and-aft) and in 1902 began carrying fishermen, cannery workers, coal and canning supplies each spring from Oakland, California to Nushagak in the Bering Sea, returning each fall with holds full of canned salmon. In 1906, the Association changed her name to be consistent with the rest of their fleet, and she became \"Star of India\". She was laid up in 1923 after 22 Alaskan voyages; by that time, steam ruled the seas.\n\nIn 1926, \"Star of India\" was sold to the Zoological Society of San Diego, California, to be the centerpiece of a planned museum and aquarium. The Great Depression and World War II caused that plan to be canceled, and it was not until 1957 that restoration began. Alan Villiers, a windjammer captain and author, came to San Diego on a lecture tour. Seeing \"Star of India\" decaying in the harbor, he publicized the situation and inspired a group of citizens to form the \"Star of India Auxiliary\" in 1959 to support the restoration of the ship. Progress was still slow, but in 1976, \"Star of India\" finally put to sea again. She houses exhibits for the Maritime Museum of San Diego, is kept fully seaworthy, and sails at least once a year. With the many other ships now in the Museum, she hosts frequent docent-led school tours for over 6,000 children a year, as well as a Living History Program in which students \"step back in time\" and are immersed in history and teamwork activities during overnight visits.\n\nThe 1863 \"Star of India\" is the fourth oldest ship afloat in the United States, after the 1797 , the 1841 \"Charles W. Morgan\", and 1854 , and is the oldest ship in the world that still sails regularly. Unlike many preserved or restored vessels, her hull, cabins and equipment are nearly 100% original.\n\n\"Star of India\" is home-ported at the San Diego Maritime Museum, just south of Lindbergh Field (San Diego International Airport), on the west side of North Harbor Drive at approximately Ash Street – all within the Port of San Diego tidelands. This location is slightly west of downtown San Diego, California. The other ships belonging to the Maritime Museum are always docked to the north of \"Star of India\". Her nearest neighbor – since 2007 – is (a.k.a. HMS \"Rose\"), a replica of a British frigate.\n\nWhen she sails, \"Star of India\" often remains within sight of the coast of San Diego County, and usually returns to her dock within a day. She is sailed by a skilled volunteer crew of Maritime Museum members, who train all year. She has become one of the landmark ships in San Diego's Harbor.\n\nIn August – September 2009, \"Star of India\" was removed from display to a local drydock facility for a required Coast Guard inspection and various maintenance below the waterline, at a cost of approximately $225,000, and 3–4 weeks off display.\n\nThe \"Star of India\" has appeared in episodes of:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "333400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333400", "title": "The Perfumed Garden", "text": "The Perfumed Garden\n\nThe Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight ( \"Al-rawḍ al-ʿāṭir fī nuzhaẗ al-ḫāṭir\") by Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi is a fifteenth-century Arabic sex manual and work of erotic literature.\n\nThe book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive, gives advice on sexual technique, warnings about sexual health, and recipes to remedy sexual maladies. It gives lists of names for the penis and vagina, has a section on the interpretation of dreams, and briefly describes sex among animals. Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement.\nAccording to the introduction of Colville's English translation, Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote \"The Perfumed Garden\" sometime during the twelfth century. Sheikh Nefzawi, full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi, was born among the Berber Nefzawa tribe in the south of present-day Tunisia. He compiled at the request of the Hafsid ruler of Tunis, Abū Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Mutawakkil, the present work. The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the \"Arabian Nights\".\n\n\"The Perfumed Garden\" first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir Richard Francis Burton. Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of Aretin and Rabelais, and the French book \"Conjugal Love\" by Nicolas Venette. But what he believes makes \"The Perfumed Garden\" unique in the genre is \"the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented.\" Burton points out that not all of the ideas in \"The Perfumed Garden\" are original: \"For instance, all the record of Moçama and of Chedja is taken from the work of Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi; the description of the different positions for coition, as well as the movements applicable to them, are borrowed from Indian works; finally, the book \"Birds and Flowers\" by Azeddine el Mocadecci (Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams.\"\n\nThe French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886. This manuscript's last chapter — Chapter 21 — was incomplete, apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed. When Burton died in late 1890, he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript, including this missing chapter. The revised translation, due to be retitled \"The Scented Garden\", was never published as Burton's wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death.\n\nA new French translation by René R. Khawam was published in 1976.\n\nIn 1999, Jim Colville published the first English \"Perfumed Garden\" translated directly from the Arabic original. Of the Burton translation, he says, \"details were expanded, episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other, non-Arabic, sources. The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation. The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original\".\n\nExaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6, titled \"Sexual Technique\" in Colville's translation and \"Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition\" in Burton's. Burton's translation is perhaps 25 pages long, lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement, and gives creative names to many of these. Colville's translation is 2½ pages long, and lists 12 unnamed sex positions.\n\nIn 1923 the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote \"Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo\".\n\nRAH Band released a single entitled “Perfumed Garden” in 1982.\n\nOmnium Gatherum, a Finnish melodic death metal band, also wrote a song called \"The Perfumed Garden\", released on their \"Spirits and August Light\" album in 2003.\n\nRay Manzarek, inspired by this, recorded a track called Perfumed Garden for his solo album The Whole Thing Started With Rock & Roll, Now It's Out Of Control.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "769310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=769310", "title": "Verne Gagne", "text": "Verne Gagne\n\nLaverne Clarence Gagne (; February 26, 1926 – April 27, 2015) was an American professional wrestler, football player, wrestling trainer, and wrestling promoter. He was the owner and promoter of the Minneapolis-based American Wrestling Association (AWA), the predominant promotion throughout the Midwest and Manitoba for many years. He remained in this position until 1991, when the company folded.\n\nGagne was a 16-time World Heavyweight Champion, having held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship ten times, the World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version) five times, and the IWA World Heavyweight Championship once. He holds the record for the longest combined reign as a world champion and is third (behind Bruno Sammartino and Lou Thesz) for the longest single world title reign. He is one of only six men inducted into each of the WWE, WCW and Professional Wrestling halls of fame.\n\nGagne was born in Corcoran, Minnesota and grew up on a farm in Robbinsdale, Minnesota. He left home at the age of 14 after his mother died. He went to Robbinsdale High School and excelled in football, baseball and wrestling, winning district, regional, and state championships in high school wrestling, as well as being named to the All-State Football Team. In 1943, he was recruited to play football at the University of Minnesota, where he was named to the All-Big Ten Team.\n\nAfter one year of college, Gagne enlisted with the Navy Underwater Demolition Team. He chose to return to the University of Minnesota, where, as an amateur wrestler, he captured two NCAA titles. He was also an alternate for the U.S freestyle wrestling team at the 1948 Olympic Games; he later said that he might have wrestled in the Olympics, but his coaches had discovered that he had earned money winning a wrestling match at a carnival, thus putting his amateur standing in question.\n\nGagne joined the National Football League (NFL) soon after being drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 16th round (145th pick) of the 1947 NFL Draft. Bears owner George Halas prevented Gagne from pursuing both football and wrestling (likely due to former Bears Football Hall of Fame great Bronko Nagurski having moonlighted as a professional wrestler during the height of his NFL career), and forced Gagne to make a choice. In a 2006 interview for WWE, Gagne's son Greg mentioned that wrestling was a much better paying job at the time than playing football (as recently as the 1970s, it was not uncommon for NFL players to have a second job during the NFL offseason to help make ends meet), and as a result, Verne chose wrestling over football.\n\nIn 1949, Gagne decided to wrestle professionally, starting his career in Texas. In his debut, he defeated Abe Kashey, with former World Heavyweight boxing Champion Jack Dempsey as the referee. On November 13, 1950, Gagne captured the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) Junior Heavyweight title in a tournament for the vacant championship.\n\nIn September 1953 in Fred Kohler Enterprises, Gagne was awarded the newly-created Chicago version of the NWA United States Championship. Gagne became one of the most well-known stars in wrestling during the golden age of television, thanks to his exposure on the Dumont Network, where he wowed audiences with his technical prowess. He was rumored to be one of the highest paid wrestlers during the 1950s, reportedly earning a hundred thousand dollars a year.\n\nOn June 14, 1957, Edouard Carpentier defeated NWA Champion Lou Thesz in Chicago. The NWA later overruled the decision of the referee in Chicago and gave the title back to Thesz. However, certain wrestling territories of the NWA including Nebraska refused to go along with the decision and continued to recognize Carpentier. Carpentier lost his title to Gagne in Omaha on August 9, 1958, making him the recognized NWA World champion in the NWA territories that had recognized Carpentier, before dropping the belt three months later to Wilbur Snyder. By early 1960, the highly wealthy Gagne rarely wrestled and turned his focus towards building a wrestling promotion of his own.\n\nIn 1960, Gagne formed his own promotion, the American Wrestling Alliance (later it became Association). Before this, the Minneapolis territory was under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) umbrella. Setting up to pull away from the NWA, the Minneapolis territory (as it was known), gave a \"story-line only\" edict to the NWA in May 1960 that unless their NWA World Champion Pat O'Connor defended his title to Verne Gagne with 90 days, Verne Gagne would become recognized World Champion by default. There was never any intention of such a match taking place. At the end of the 90 period, the AWA was formed in August 1960 and it was announced that because NWA champion Pat O'Connor failed to meet Gagne, that the AWA recognized Gagne as the first AWA World Champion. \n\nSome of Gagne's biggest feuds were against Gene Kiniski, Dr. Bill Miller (under a mask both as Dr. X and then Mr. M), Fritz Von Erich, Dr. X, The Crusher, Ray Stevens, Mad Dog Vachon, Larry Hennig and Nick Bockwinkel. He always wrestled as a face, and utilized the sleeper hold as his finisher.\n\nAs promoter of the AWA, Gagne was known for putting on an \"old school\" show. He sought out wrestlers with amateur backgrounds over the hulking brutes who dominated wrestling in the 1980s. This led to a problem with his biggest draw, Hulk Hogan, whom Gagne had acquired after Hogan had been let go by the World Wrestling Federation and who Gagne also felt was not championship material, due to the fact that Hogan was a powerhouse wrestler and not a technical wrestler. Seeing Hogan as the company's top draw, Gagne did, however, let Hogan feud with Bockwinkel. Eventually, as noted on the 2006 \"Spectacular Legacy of AWA\" DVD, Gagne settled with making Hogan his champion after Hogan's feud with Bockwinkel ran its course in April 1983, but only under the condition that he would receive the bulk of the revenue Hogan made from both merchandise sales and his matches in Japan. Hogan refused. In late 1983, Hogan accepted an offer from Vincent K. McMahon to return to the WWF. The Iron Sheik, whom Gagne trained, has alleged that he was offered a cash bribe by the AWA's owner to inflict career threatening damage on Hogan's knee after it became apparent that he was going to go to the WWF. This allegation was supported by Hogan during an interview for A&E's \"Biography\".\n\nWhat followed was a purge of stars from various territories and promotions, including Gagne's AWA, by Vince McMahon, who wished to take his WWF \"national\" and do away with the traditional territorial system that dominated the North American pro wrestling landscape for decades. Unlike most of his contemporaries, by the mid 1980s, Gagne began promoting the AWA beyond the geographical bounds of the company's traditional territory. In September 1985, ESPN began broadcasting \"AWA Championship Wrestling\", granting the AWA national exposure similar to what the World Wrestling Federation was experiencing. However, the AWA suffered numerous setbacks; \"AWA Championship Wrestling\" wasn't treated as a priority by ESPN, the show was sometimes not aired in its regular timeslot, sometimes it was preempted by live sporting events and occasional changes in timeslots without advertising the changes resulted in many fans being unable to tune in on a regular basis. Gagne's booking strategies for the wrestlers themselves continued to be more old school than those of the WWF in that Gagne felt the biggest stars should be the most talented technical wrestlers instead of wrestlers with charismatic personas and over-the-top personalities. Throughout the mid to late 1980s, the AWA would lose nearly every one of its top stars while ratings and live attendance continued to decline. By 1991, the damage had been done, and the AWA shut down, after 30 years. Gagne would eventually end up in bankruptcy court.\n\nIn April 2006, Gagne was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by his son, Greg Gagne. He is one of only six people to be inducted into the WWE, WCW and Professional Wrestling halls of fame.\n\nOn January 26, 2009, Gagne got into an altercation with Helmut Gutmann, a 97-year-old resident of the Bloomington, Minnesota facility where they both resided. According to Gutmann's widow, who was not present during the altercation, Gagne picked Gutmann up and hurled him to the floor, then broke his hip by pulling back on his body. \"'The attack – which was not a wrestling body slam – happened quickly while the men were at a table,' Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said. 'It was more like \"a push and a shove\" and it caused Gutmann to fall.'\"\n\nNeither man had any recollection of the incident. Gutmann was admitted to the hospital, and died on February 14 from complications of the injury. On February 25, 2009, the older man's death was officially ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County medical examiner's office. On March 12, 2009, the Hennepin County Prosecutor's office officially announced that Gagne would not be criminally charged as a result of the death as, because of Gagne's dementia, he lacked the mental capacity necessary to have intended to harm Gutmann.\n\nGagne was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (or possibly chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by a lifetime of head injuries) and had been living in the memory-loss section of a Bloomington, Minnesota health care facility. In January 2012 (and possibly since the 2009 altercation), he was living in the home of his daughter Beth and her husband Will. He continued to make public appearances in his last years, aided by his son Greg.\n\nOn the night of April 27, 2015, Gagne died in Bloomington at the age of 89.\n\n\n\n"}

Each volume was anywhere between 500 and 1500 pages long. They are often used by genealogists for family research in pre-revolutionary Russia and the early Soviet period when vital records are missing or prove difficult to find. Historians use them to research the social histories of the city.\n\nEach directory was written exclusively in Russian Cyrillic only, and contains various sections among which was an alphabetical list of residents in the city. Those listed usually were the head of their respective household and so spouses and minors are not listed. \n\nThe following information can be found:\n\nA section immediately preceding or following that listing residents in alphabetical order was a directory of all streets, houses and flats with the names of their owners and occupants.

The collection gathers around 60 rare minerals obtained in the 18th century from the Freiberg Mining Academy, Germany, by the Portuguese nobleman António de Araújo e Azevedo. The name of the collection is due to the main researcher of the German academy, scientist Abraham Gottlob Werner. The collection came to Brazil in the 19th century, brought by the Royal Family, who was escaping from the Napoleonic invasion, and was initially sent to the Royal Military Academy, being moved to the Royal Museum (former name of the National Museu) in 1819. It is considered that it was the first collection to compose the National Museum.\n\nThis collection was stuck by the fire of 2018 at the National Museum, but it was reported that its restoration will be possible.\n\n"}
