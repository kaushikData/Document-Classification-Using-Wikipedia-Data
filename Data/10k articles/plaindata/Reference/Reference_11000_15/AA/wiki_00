One employee Premini Thanuskodi was gang raped and murdered.\n\nSeven TRO workers were abducted in two separate incident on January 2006 in Jaffna. The first incident happened when five workers were traveling from Batticalo to Kilinochchi. They were subjected to checks at the Sri Lanka Army checkpoint at Welikanda. At this point they noticed a white van behind them. After traveling a short distance from the checkpoint the workers were attacked by armed men in the white van. The assaulter then tied the workers and took them to a camp in the jungle. Three of the five abducted were released later. The next day another 15 workers were abducted 100 meters in front of the Walikanda checkpoint. 10 of the 15 abducted were released and were told to prepare the funeral rights for their colleges.\n\nThe President of Sri Lanka has asked the security forces to speed up the investigation concerning the abduction of the TRO workers. He further asked to search the Walikanda area for the abducted. The government also denied any links to this abduction.\n\nTamils Rehabilitation Organisation has alleged that their staff were abducted by the Karuna Group, a paramilitary organization which is believed to be working with the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. It further added that they have not received any reports or response from any investigating authorities.\n\nThe Amnesty International has asked for the immediate release of these workers \n\nThe former US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Christina Rocca, made an appeal for their release.\n\nThe LTTE expressed concern over the abduction of the TRO workers.\n\nUTHR reported that the LTTE had staged the abduction of the TRO workers but later said that they were not correct on this statement. However, TRO alleged that a government backed paramilitary was responsible for this abduction \n"}

People diagnosed with ALS live on average 2–4 years after diagnosis due to the quick progression of the disease. The progression and severity of ALS is rated by doctors on the ALS Functional Rating Scale, which has been revised and is referred to as ALSFRS-R.\n\nALSFRS-R includes 12 questions that can have a score of 0 to 4. A score of 0 on a question would indicate no function while a score of 4 would indicate full function. This scale has been useful for doctors in diagnosing patients, measuring disease progression and also for researchers when selecting patients for a study and measuring the potential effects of a clinical trial.\n\nThe ALSFRS-R scale has some limitations though since it is not useful to compare scores of people who present with different onset. In ALS the main type of onset is bulbar, followed by limb-onset; which describes the region of motor neurons first affected. Individuals may also present with respiratory onset, but this occurs very rarely. Since there are three different types of ALS, ALSFRS-R scores are often grouped in categories depending on type of onset.\n\nSince there are three main pathways of progression, the questions are also divided in relation to the types of onset. Questions 1 to 3 are related to bulbar onset, questions 4 to 9 are related to limb onset and questions 10-12 are related to respiratory onset.\n\nALSFRS-R scores calculated at diagnosis can be compared to scores throughout time to determine the speed of progression. The rate of change, called the ALSFRS-R slope can be used as a prognostic indicator.\n\nAlthough the ALSFRS-R score is a recognized prognostic indicator, it is more useful to compare various indicators including vital capacity (FVC%) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) to increase the accuracy of a given prognosis.\n\nRelating the ALSFRS-R score to staging criteria is also useful in determining prognosis. King's system relies on the clinical spread of disease as a measure of progression while Milano-Torino Staging (MiToS) utilizes the subscores produced by the ALSFRS-R to define stages.\n\nThe questions used to determine an individuals ALSFRS-R score are listed below.\n"}
{"id": "50293089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50293089", "title": "A Dictionary of the Chinese Language", "text": "A Dictionary of the Chinese Language\n\nA Dictionary of the Chinese Language, in Three Parts or Morrison's Chinese dictionary (1815-1823), compiled by the Anglo-Scottish missionary Robert Morrison was the first Chinese-English, English-Chinese dictionary. Part I is Chinese-English arranged by the 214 Kangxi radicals, Part II is Chinese-English arranged alphabetically, and Part III is English-Chinese also arranged alphabetically. This groundbreaking reference work is enormous, comprising 4,595 pages in 6 quarto volumes and including 47,035 head characters taken from the 1716 \"Kangxi Dictionary\". However, Morrison's encyclopedic dictionary had flaws, notably failing to distinguish aspirated consonants: the pronunciation \"taou\" is given for both aspirated \"táo\" (桃, \"peach\") and unaspirated \"dào\" (道, \"way; the Tao\").\n\nRobert Morrison (1782-1834) is credited with several historical firsts in addition to the first bidirectional Chinese and English dictionary. He was the first Protestant missionary in China, started the first Chinese-language periodical in 1815 , collaborated with William Milne to write the first translation of the Bible into Chinese in 1823, helped to found the English-language \"The Canton Register\" in 1827, and compiled the first Western-language dictionary of a regional variety of Chinese .\n\nMorrison joined the London Missionary Society in 1804 and was chosen to lead a mission to China. They sent him to study at Gosport and introduced him to a young Cantonese man studying English in London: Robert Morrison transcribes his name as \"Yong Sam Tak\", Eliza Morrison as \"Yung-san-tih\" in \"Mandarin\" transcription , and whose actual name was probably Rong Sande () . In 1807, the LMS instructed Morrison to sail to Guangzhou (then known as \"Canton\") and continue studying until he had \"accomplished [his] great object of acquiring the language\", whereupon he would \"turn this attainment into a direction which may be of extensive use to the world: perhaps you may have the honour of forming a Chinese Dictionary, more comprehensive and correct than any preceding one\", as well as translating the Bible into Chinese .\n\nUpon his arrival in the Qing Empire, Morrison learned that the Chinese were prohibited from teaching their language to foreigners, forcing him to study Chinese secretly and hide his books from sight. Morrison eventually found two tutors, the scholar \"Ko Seen-sang\" and Abel Yun, who had learned Latin from Catholic missionaries. Together, they began to translate the scriptures and compile the dictionary. In 1809, the East India Company employed Morrison as their translator, which legitimized his presence in Guangzhou's Thirteen Factories and provided sufficient income to continue working on the dictionary project and Bible translation. He translated and printed the Acts of the Apostles in 1810 and completed his Chinese Grammar in 1811. The situation worsened in 1812 when the Jiaqing Emperor issued an edict adding Christianity to the list of banned witchcrafts and superstitions, making the printing of Chinese-language books on the subject a capital crime . The LMS sent the missionary William Milne to assist Morrison in translating and printing the scriptures. In 1814, the East India Company sent the printing engineer Peter Perring Thoms. Together with Morrison's Chinese assistants such as Cai Gao and Liang Fa, he created the Chinese character font for the dictionary. Morrison worked on producing \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" for more than 15 years with \"extraordinary perseverance, industry, and ingenuity\" .\n\nMorrison described the bilingual Chinese dictionaries that he used as sources for his own lexicographical work: \"several MS. Dictionaries of the old Missionaries, in English and French, and, latterly, the printed copy of Father Basil's Dictionary\" . This refers to the 9,000-entry 1698 \"Dictionarium Sino-Latinum\" manuscript of the Italian Franciscan Basilio Brollo or de Glemona (1648-1704), which the French orientalist Joseph de Guignes (1759-1845) translated as the 1813 \"\" without any attribution to the original author . Brollo's innovation was to provide a Chinese character dictionary alphabetically collated by transliteration, with a user-friendly index arranged by radicals and strokes, successfully combining Chinese and European lexicographic traditions . This lexicographical macrostructure was adopted in Morrison's dictionary, and most bilingual Chinese dictionaries up to the present day.\n\nThe first volume of Morrison's Chinese dictionary was published in 1815 and the last in 1823. All 6 volumes were printed by in Macao and published and sold by Black, Parbury, & Allen, the booksellers to the East India Company. The dictionary was printed in a run of 750 copies at a total cost of ₤10,440 or ₤12,000 ; they sold for the \"princely sum\" of 20 guineas . The LMS was unable to subsidize the entire project, but the directors of the East India Company agreed to pay because they recognized the dictionary's incalculable benefit, not only to missionaries but also to their own employees . The later volumes were published simultaneously in London by Kingsbury, Parbury, & Allen or by Black, Parbury, & Allen.\n\nThe \"Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" marked a new era in the compilation and publication of bilingual Chinese works. Before the 19th century, Catholic missionaries such as Basilio Brollo had compiled many bilingual manuscript dictionaries, but their circulation was inevitably restricted by the difficulties of copying a dictionary by hand. The initial edition of 750 copies and subsequent reprints enabled Morrison's dictionary to reach a wider readership and have a far more profound impact .\n\nMorrison's dictionary is composed of three parts or six quarto () volumes published in different years. Part I has 3 volumes with Volume I published in 1815 containing 18 pages in the preface, 930 pages in the dictionary proper, and 2 additional pages consisting of advertisements . Volume II, published in 1822, is composed of 884 pages , and Volume III, published in 1823, is composed of 908 pages . Part II has two volumes: Volume I published in 1819 contains 20 pages in the preface and 1,090 pages in the dictionary proper , and Volume II published in 1820 contains 6 pages in the preface, 178 pages in the first section, and 305 pages in the second section of the dictionary proper . Part III was published in 1822 with only one volume containing 5 pages in the preface and 480 pages in the dictionary proper .\n\nThe publication of Morrison's dictionary attracted the attention of scholars worldwide, and Part II was reprinted from 1865 until 1913. The revised preface says the second part \"has been generally commended by experienced Sinologues as the most perfect and useful of the whole\" . In 1865, the London Mission Press in Shanghai and Trubner & Co. in London first republished Part II in 2 volumes, totaling 1630 pages. In 1913, Zhonghua Book Company reprinted Part II in a pocketbook size, which made it much more affordable and easier to carry .\n\nMorrison's lexicographical legacy is reflected in two facts: his dictionary's macrostructure and microstructure became the model for many later Chinese-English dictionaries, and his transliteration system was adopted as the basis for Wade-Giles romanization .\n\nMorrison's Chinese dictionary became the prototype for other 19th-century works. The English Congregationalist missionary and Bible translator Walter Henry Medhurst compiled the 1842 and 1847 \"Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing all the Words in the Chinese Imperial Dictionary, Arranged According to the Radicals\". Medhurst claimed this was an original translation based on the \"Kangxi Zidian\", but it was in fact just an edited abridgment of Morrison's dictionary, a \"plagiarism rather than an original compilation\" . The American sinologist and missionary Samuel Wells Williams compiled the 1874 \"Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\", whose Chinese title () echoed that of Part II of Morrison's work (). The preface says that although many similar Chinese-English dictionaries by Medhurst, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and others were published in small numbers, they became \"very scarce, while the number of students has increased tenfold\", and learners of Chinese relied on reprints of Morrison . Williams explicitly identified \"Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien\" as a more important source for his own work than Morrison's dictionary . The British diplomat and sinologist Herbert Giles edited \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\", published in 1892 and 1912. Giles praised Morrison as \"the great pioneer\" of Chinese-English lexicography, but criticized his failure to mark aspiration. He said Medhurst \"attempted aspirates\" but omitted some and wrongly inserted others. While Williams correctly marked aspiration and tones, Giles says \"he provided too few phrases, and mistranslated a large number of those\" . Ironically, Yang's textual analysis finds that Giles's dictionary is more closely linked to Williams's than to Morrison's .\n\nMorrison's Chinese dictionary introduced a systematic transliteration system that was used for over four decades until it was replaced by Thomas Francis Wade's romanization scheme in 1867; that became the basis for the Wade-Giles system of 1892-1912, which was widely used and still survives alongside pinyin romanization. Morrison's system was almost forgotten after being replaced by Wade romanization, but James Legge adopted it virtually unchanged into the Legge romanization used in his \"Chinese Classics\" series . Morrison's romanization system influenced the Wade, Legge, and Wade-Giles schemes .\n\nRobert Morrison's dictionary is still in use two hundred years after its publication. For example, the American sinologist W. South Coblin analyzed Morrison's romanization of Mandarin for clues about the pronunciation of early 19th-century standard Chinese . Morrison's pronunciation glosses followed the lower Yangtze koiné as the standard Mandarin of the time, \"what the Chinese call the Nanking Dialect, than the Peking\" .\n\nThe title pages of the dictionary's parts give two versions of the full title. Part I's title page (shown above) reads \"Part the First; Containing Chinese and English, Arranged According to the Radicals; Part the Second; Chinese and English, Arranged Alphabetically; and Part the Third, English and Chinese\". The title pages of Part II and Part iii read \"Part the First, Containing Chinese and English Arranged According to the Keys; Part the Second, Chinese and English Arranged Alphabetically, and Part the Third, Consisting of English and Chinese\". Each part of the dictionary is a complete and independent unit in itself .\n\nPart I, A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, is supertitled in Chinese—but not English—as a \"character dictionary\" (). It was a Chinese-to-English dictionary, organized by the 214 radical system employed by the 1716 \"Kangxi Dictionary\". These radicals are the initial or major graphic components of Chinese characters, ranging from 1 to 17 strokes. In Morrison's dictionary, Volume I starts with Radical 1 (, \"one\") and ends at Radical 41 ( (\"thumb; Chinese inch\") ; Volume II starts with Radical 42 (, \"small\") and stops at Radical 119 (, \"rice\") ; and Volume III begins with Radical 120 (, \"silk\") and ends the dictionary with Radical 214 (, \"flute\") . Vols. II & III were published simultaneously in London by Kingsbury, Parbury, & Allen.\n\nMorrison acknowledged his debt to the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" in his introduction to Volume I, saying it \"forms the ground work\" of Part I , including its arrangement, number of characters (47,035), and many of its definitions and examples . However, it also differed in significant ways. Chinese scholars have found that the majority of the Kangxi dictionary's usage examples were taken from books before the 10th century and ignored vulgar forms and expressions. Morrison also noticed this and chose examples better suited to his intended readership , adding vulgar, humorous, colloquial, and modern examples. For instance , Morrison included descriptions for (\"wángba\", \"tortoise\" but also \"cuckold; son of a bitch; pimp\") and (\"wūguī\", \"tortoise\" but also \"cuckold\") as \"terms of abuse, denoting one who lives on his wife's prostitution; one lost to virtue\". Similarly (\"wángbadàn\", \"turtle egg\" but also \"son of a bitch\") as \"a bastard, in opprobrious language\" . Morrison's dictionary also gives Chinese usage examples and quotations from a wide range of sources, including classical literature, law, medicine, novels, and numerous unidentified contemporary sources.\n\nHis orthographic standard for the dictionary's \"Radicals, and of the large Characters throughout the work,\" was said to have been \"taken from an excellent Dictionary\" . This was either Sha Mu's 1787 \"Yiwen Beilan\" (, \"Literary Writings for Consultation\", or \"E-wǎn-pe-lan\" in Sha's romanization) or its 1807 reprint. Morrison's copy is now located at the University of London's SOAS Library. A comparative study of its annotations confirms its influence, although this remained less marked than that of the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" .\n\nPhilosophically, Morrison's dictionary departed from that ordered by the Kangxi Emperor by including not only the Confucian Four Books and Five Classics but many more items drawn from Taoist and Buddhist texts. Yang uses the example of the dictionary's first entry, (\"yi\", \"one\") , which notes\nThe Secl [Sect] Taou affirms, that \"Taou produced one, one produced two, two produced three, and three produced all things.\" If it be asked, what then is Taou? They reply, 靜極乃道也… \"Extreme quiescence, or a state of perfect stillness is Taou.\" The Three, when speaking of their external appearance, they call \"The heaven's adorning principle, earth's life giving principle, and the pure principle of the exciting harmonizing wind\"; or as they define it, \"That aerial principle, or influence, by which the heavens and earth act on each other.\" The internal Three, they call \"The clear unmixed influence, the intelligence of spirit; the purity of essence; in the midst of quiescence separated the Yin and Yang. Essence, influence and spirit, together operated in a state of vacuum.\" (Taou tĭh king). Their notions of the great One Cause of all things, are very fanciful and obscure .\nThe first quote is from \"Tao Te Ching\" (Ch. 42) and the others from commentaries.\n\nThe first volume of Part I and its two companion volumes were written in notably different styles. Volume I is \"notoriously abundant\" in encyclopedic examples and quotations, while the other two volumes of Part I just provide brief definitions and a few examples . When Morrison published the first volume of Part I in 1815 after 8 years of hard work, he realized that if he tried to compile the rest of the dictionary on such a comprehensive scale, he might not finish the dictionary in his lifetime. He then changed course and rapidly published Part II in 1819 and 1820. His dictionary's alphabetically arranged Part II, with concise definitions and brief usage examples, proved to be more useful for learners of Chinese but lacked the rich quotations that made the first volume of Part I a model of an \"encyclopedic and culturally rich bilingual dictionary\" . To illustrate Volume I's \"grand scope\" and \"many surprises\", Wu Xian & al. cited the 40-page entry for (\"xue\", \"study; receive instruction; practice; imitate; learn; a place of studying\") whose usage examples and illustrations range across the traditional Chinese educational system from \"private school\" (, \"xueguan\") to \"government-run prefectural school\" (, \"fuxue\"), explain the imperial examination civil service system from \"county candidates\" (, \"xiucai\") to \"members of the imperial Hanlin Academy\" (, \"hanlin\"), and include a variety of related terms and passages such as 100 rules for schools, details on examination systems, and a list of books for classical study. They conclude that the dictionary's \"richness of information was unprecedented\" .\n\nAn example of a later entry is (\"dào\", \"way\") in Volume III . It is given with his atonal romanization \"TAOU\" under Radical 162 (, \"walk\"), with the roman numeral IX noting that it has nine strokes beyond those of the base radical. The regular script character and pronunciation are given alongside its small seal and cursive forms, followed by English translations, derived terms, and usage examples. In this case, the word is glossed as \"A way; a path; being at the head; the way that leads to; a thoroughfare on all sides. A principle. The principle from which heaven, earth, man, and all nature emanates.\" Of the 22 words and usages given, the first six are medical terms (e.g., \"Seaou pëen taou the urinary passage; the vagina\") and the last thirteen are administrative circuits of imperial China (e.g., \" Ho-nan taou\") The other three are notice of the Daoguang Emperor's era name (\"Taou-kwang yuen nëen the first of Taoukwang, 'reason's glory,' title of the reigning emperor of China (A.D. 1821)\"); the common word \"dàoxǐ\" (\"Taou he to congratulate, an expression used amongst equals\"); and a citation from Confucius's \"Analects\" (\"Taou tsëen shing che kwǒ To rule or govern a nation that can send forth a thousand war chariots\").\n\nPart II, A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, Arranged Alphabetically, is supertitled in Chinese—but not English—as a \"Wuche Yunfu\" (, \"Erudition Phonetic Dictionary\"). The name literally means a \"five-cart[loads of books, a classical idiom for \"erudite\"] storehouse of euphony\", and copies the title of an earlier rime dictionary compiled by Chen Jinmo () and Han Yihu (), who gave its unpublished manuscript to the editors of the \"Kangxi Dictionary\". They made extensive use of it, with definitions often identical in both works . Morrison claimed to have worked from Chen and Han's dictionary, rearranging its roughly 40,000 characters according to syllables instead of pronunciations and tones with the help of the \"Fenyun\" (, \"Divisions of Rimes\") and Basilio Brollo's dictionary, as well as contemporary words from elsewhere. This work took about seven years . Yang's comparative study of Parts I and II found, however, that the definitions of both are clearly based on the \"Kangxi Dictionary\" and reflect little content from original \"Wuche Yunfu\" .\n\nPart II is in two volumes. In Volume I, the preface explains the dictionary's composition, purpose and orthography and the main section is a \"Syllabic Dictionary\" in which romanized Chinese words are collated in alphabetical order . In Volume II, the first section contains a table of the 214 \"Kangxi\" radicals, a radical-and-stroke index of the characters in Volume I, and an English-to-Chinese index of words that gives the character numbers in Volume I . The second independent section \"A Synopsis of Various Forms of the Chinese Character\" giving the regular script, semi-cursive script, cursive script, clerical script, small seal script, and bronze script forms of various characters . Part II of the dictionary contains 12,674 character entries, far fewer than the 47,035 entries in Part I . On the other hand, it continued to provide an estimated 20,000 examples and Chinese quotations in Chinese characters, accompanied with romanization and English translations, a vast improvement over earlier dictionaries without examples or Basilio Brollo's Chinese–Latin dictionaries, which presented its examples only in romanization . Vol. I was only published in Macao, but Vol. II was published simultaneously at London by Black, Parbury, & Allen.\n\nThe preface notes Morrison's intent: \"The Author's object has been, and the intention of the Dictionary ought to be, to communicate the Language to \"Europeans\".\" . Its content is wide-ranging. \"There are beautiful pieces of poetry, interesting and instructive portions of History and Biography; and important Moral Maxims, in Chinese that is a language amongst the \"most ancient\" and the \"most extensively\" known on earth,… it is the \"living language\" of five nations, which together, constitute one third of the mankind.\" Wu and Zheng say, \"Far more than a mere dictionary of the Chinese language, Morrison's dictionary is a history book, a biography, a collection of idiomatic expressions and common sayings of the Chinese people, and, last but not least, full of the Christian evangelical message expressed in many ways.\" , In both Part I and II , discussion of paper () occasions discussion of its invention by Cai Lun, although his name appears as both \"Tsae Lun\" or \"Tsae-lun\" and one entry mistakenly places him in the 10th century instead of the 1st. Another example is the entry on (\"cāi\", \"guess; suspect\"), which occasions a digression on a Chinese drinking game: \" to guess the number of fingers thrown out, or stretched straight from a previously folded hand, which is a drunken amusement of the Chinese. When the opponent guesses the right number of fingers thrown out, at the instant he speaks, he wins, and the person throwing out his fingers has to drink as a forfeit.\" .\n\nPart II—unlike Part I—includes notation regarding Chinese tones. Unfortunately, Morrison transcribed the four tone distinctions of Middle Chinese rhyme dictionaries rather than those of modern Chinese. The romanizations of Part II are left unmarked for a \"level\" tone (, \"píng\"), given a grave accent (e.g., à) for a \"rising\" tone (, \"shǎng\"), given an acute accent (e.g., á) for a \"departing\" tone (, \"qù\"), and a breve (e.g., ǎ) for an \"entering\" tone. By the time Morrison was composing his dictionary, the old level tone had begun dividing into modern Mandarin's high and rising tones; the old rising tone had begun dividing into the modern third and falling tones; and the entering tone had ceased to exist . Only the old departing tone continued to exist, as the modern falling tone. (In other dialects of Chinese, such as Cantonese, these tones developed separately but Morrison employed the Nanjing dialect of his era's Mandarin.) .\n\nPart II also includes etymological glosses of the formation of the Chinese characters. Although these were often (inaccurate) guesses or folk etymologies, they helped students of Chinese as a second language to comprehend and memorize characters. Wu Xian & al. draw attention to his treatment of the character (\"yǎng\", \"look up; admire\"), which now consists of Radical 9 (, \"person\") and (\"áng\", \"high\") . Morrison wrote, \"YANG 仰, from \"man\" and \"to look upwards\". To raise the head and look upwards with expectation or desire...\" . Two subsequent centuries of study and archeological discoveries have greatly increased understanding of how Chinese characters originated. It is now established that \"Originally depicted a person standing next to (\"jié\") a person kneeling. Another ( \"rén\") person was added later, forming .\" .\n\nThe entry for in the second part of Morrison's dictionary gives a graphic variant , the entry number 9945, the acute accent \"departing\" tone, the character origin \"From \"to walk\" and \"head\"\", translation equivalents, and 12 usage examples. The English translation runs:\nA way; a path; being at the head; the way that leads to; a thoroughfare on all sides. A principle. The priuciple from which heaven, earth, man, and all nature emanates. Le is a latent principle; Tanu is a principle in action. Correct, virtuous principles and course of action. Order and good principles in a government and country. A word; to speak; to say; the way or cause from or by which; to direct; to lead in the way. To accord with or go in a course pointed out. The name of a country. Used by the Buddhists for a particular state of existence, whether amongst human beings or amongst brutes .\nThe usage examples include words from Taoism and Buddhism: \"Taou in the books of Laou-tsze is very like the \"Eternal Reason\" of which some Europeans speak; \"\" of the Latins, and the \"Logos\" of the Greeks.\"; and using \"zhì\" (, \"cloth case for a book\"), \"Taou těë a certificate by which the priests of Buddha are entitled to three days provision at every temple they go to.\"\n\nPart III, An English and Chinese Dictionary, was given without a Chinese supertitle. It comprises Morrison's English-to-Chinese dictionary and is arranged alphabetically from \"A\" (\"A, Ying wǎn, yin moo suy tsze che te yǐh, The first letter of the English Alphabet.\") to \"Zone\" (\"ZONE, a girdle, tae tsze; wei tai.\") . It was printed simultaneously in London by Black, Parbury, & Allen.\n\nIts entries are terser than those of the Chinese volumes, particularly Part I, Volume 1. The entry for \"way\" is \"WAY, road, or path, loo; taou; too. A method or means, fa\" . The fraught issue of Chinese names for God occasioned a somewhat fuller treatment:\nGOD or the Deus of the Chinese was originally, and is still most generally Shin; in the plural, Dii, Shin kwei, and Shin ke. A sort of Supreme God, is in the ancient books expressed by Shang-te. Genii of particular places are also expressed by Shin, as ho shin, God of the river; shan shin, god of the hill, &c. All these gods are in Chinese notions inferior to Ten, Heaven .\n\nRobert Morrison's Chinese-English dictionary has received both blame and praise. Considering that he was a self-taught lexicographer who compiled a dictionary of such a colossal size and scope, working with assistants who did not speak English, it would inevitably fall short of perfection, such the typographical errors and misprints noted above. Within his lifetime, the publication of Morrison's Chinese dictionary did not bring him universal acclaim, but instead triggered a controversy as to the authorship . In 1818 and again in 1830, the German orientalist Julius Klaproth accused Morrison of merely translating Chinese dictionaries rather than compiling a new or original one . In response to Klaproth's challenges, Morrison wrote an 1831 letter to the \"Asiatic Journal\" that describes the dictionary's compilation in detail. \nI know of no better way of writing a Dictionary of any language, than that which I pursued; namely, to make use of all the native Dictionaries I could collect, with the original books referred to in them; to employ native scholars to assist me in consulting those several works, and in ascertaining their exact meaning... In the whole of the work, there was no mere copying from one book into another; no mere translation from one language into another; but an exercise of judgment and choice, throughout: and if any man may be called the author of a Dictionary, Morrison may justly be called the author of the Dictionary attributed to him. \n\nIn retrospect, a \"major flaw\" in Morrison's dictionary is the failure to distinguish the phonemic contrast between aspirated and unaspirated consonants . Herbert Giles's \"Chinese-English Dictionary\" says Morrison's 1819 volume gave no aspirates, \"a defect many times worse\" than would be omitting the rough breathing in a Greek lexicon, and Medhurst's 1843 edition attempted aspirates, but omitted many and wrongly inserted others . Samuel Wells Williams's 1874 \"Syllabic Dictionary\" was apparently the first dictionary to get this distinction sorted out .\n\nAnother flaw is Morrison's treatment of some characters that have more than one pronunciation and meaning: means \"foul; stinking; disgusting; disgraceful\" when pronounced \"chòu\" but simply \"odor; smell; scent\" when read \"xiù\" . Morrison listed both senses with the first pronunciation and treated it as similar to the neutral and disagreeable senses of the English \"smell\":\nIn these derived terms, the negative senses would be read \"chòu\", but the pleasant \"fragrant as an orchid\" would use the pronunciation \"xiù\". Another example is when he takes the in to mean \"bride\" when the intended sense is a \"bridegroom\" being invited to live with his in-laws .\n\nOn the other hand, Morrison's Chinese dictionary has won critical acclaims from scholars all over the world since the publication of the first volume in 1815. Alexander Leith Ross wrote to Morrison that his dictionary had an extensive circulation in Europe, and would be \"an invaluable treasure to every student of Chinese\" . The French sinologist Stanislas Julien described Part II as \"without dispute, the best Chinese Dictionary composed in a European language\" . The American missionary William A. Macy said all the missionaries and scholars of Chinese had used Morrison's dictionary as the \"common fountain\" from which they could \"obtain the knowledge they desired\" . One modern scholar calls Morrison's dictionary \"the greatest achievement of any researcher of Chinese\" . Another describes the comprehensive bilingual dictionary compilation and publication project as \"unprecedented and unsurpassed in 19th-century China\" . Wu and Zheng say Morrison's was the first widely used Chinese-English dictionary and has served as a \"milestone in the early promotion of communications between China and the West\" . A recent book on Chinese lexicography says that although Morrison's dictionary \"contained numerous errors\" when examined from a modern perspective, \"the dictionary delineated the basic configuration of a bilingual dictionary and shed a good deal of light upon the design and compilation of English-Chinese, Chinese-English, and other bilingual dictionary types\" . Morrison's obituary notice summarizes his dedication and contribution to the world, \"In efforts to make this [Chinese] language known to foreigners and chiefly to the English, he has done more than any other man living or dead.\" .\n\n\n\n"}

Volume 5 (1911) was illustrated by Norwegian illustrator Louis Moe, after which Bauer resumed illustrating from 1912 to 1915 (volumes 6-9). 1916 had no issue, but the series continues in 1917, illustrated by Aina Masolle and Gustaf Tengren, marking the series' first woman illustrator. From 1918 to 1926 Gustaf Tenggren was the sole illustrator. Between 1927 and 1980, Einar Norelius was the chief illustrator. Among the writers were authors such as Hjalmar Bergman, Helena Nyblom, Margareta Ekström, Gösta Knutsson and Edith Unnerstad.\n\nSeveral books with extracts from the original volumes illustrated by John Bauer have been published.

{"id": "2575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2575", "title": "André the Giant", "text": "André the Giant\n\nAndré René Roussimoff (May 19, 1946 – January 27, 1993), best known as André the Giant, was a French professional wrestler and actor.\n\nHe famously feuded with Hulk Hogan, culminating at WrestleMania III in 1987. His best-remembered film role was that of Fezzik, the giant in \"The Princess Bride\". His size was a result of gigantism caused by excess growth hormone, which later resulted in acromegaly. It also led to his being called \"The Eighth Wonder of the World\".\n\nIn the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as WWE), André was a one-time WWF World Heavyweight Champion and a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion. In 1993, André was the first ever to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 1993.\n\nAndré Roussimoff was born in Molien, in the canton of La Ferté-sous-jouarre, of Slavic heritage, the son of Boris and Mariann Roussimoff. His parents were immigrants to France, his father was Bulgarian and his mother was Polish. His nickname growing up was \"Dédé\". As a child, he displayed symptoms of gigantism very early, reaching a height of and a weight of by the age of 12.\n\nRoussimoff was a good student, particularly in mathematics, but he dropped out after the eighth grade since he did not think having a high school education was necessary for a farm labourer. He spent years working on his father's farm, where, according to his brother, Jacques, he could perform the work of three men. He also completed an apprenticeship in woodworking, and next worked in a factory that manufactured engines for hay balers. None of these occupations, however, brought him any satisfaction.\n\nAt the age of 18, Roussimoff moved to Paris and was taught professional wrestling by a local promoter who recognised the earning potential of Roussimoff's size. He trained at night and worked as a mover during the day to pay living expenses. Roussimoff was billed as \"Géant Ferré\", a name based on the French folk hero , and began wrestling in Paris and nearby areas. Canadian promoter and wrestler Frank Valois met Roussimoff in 1966, becoming his business manager and adviser. Roussimoff began making a name for himself wrestling in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.\n\nHe made his Japanese debut in 1970, billed as \"Monster Roussimoff\", wrestling for the International Wrestling Enterprise. Wrestling as both a singles and tag-team competitor, he quickly was made the company's tag-team champion alongside Michael Nador. During his time in Japan, doctors first informed Roussimoff that he suffered from acromegaly.\n\nRoussimoff next moved to Montréal, Canada, where he became an immediate success, regularly selling out the Montreal Forum. However, promoters eventually ran out of plausible opponents for him and, as the novelty of his size wore off, the gate receipts dwindled. Roussimoff was defeated by Adnan Al-Kaissie in Baghdad in 1971, and wrestled numerous times in 1972 for Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association (AWA) as a special attraction until Valois appealed to Vince McMahon Sr., founder of the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), for advice. McMahon suggested several changes. He felt Roussimoff should be portrayed as a large, immovable monster, and to enhance the perception of his size, McMahon discouraged Roussimoff from performing maneuvers such as dropkicks (although he was capable of performing such agile maneuvers before his health deteriorated in later life). He also began billing Roussimoff as \"André the Giant\" and set up a travel-intensive schedule, lending him to wrestling associations around the world, to keep him from becoming overexposed in any area. Promoters had to guarantee Roussimoff a certain amount of money as well as pay McMahon's WWWF booking fee.\n\nOn March 26, 1973, André debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later World Wrestling Federation) as a fan favorite, defeating Buddy Wolfe in New York's Madison Square Garden.\n\nAndré was one of professional wrestling's most beloved \"babyfaces\" throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. As such, Gorilla Monsoon often stated that André had never been defeated for 15 years by pinfall or submission prior to WrestleMania III; however, André had lost in matches outside of the WWF: a pinfall loss in Mexico to Canek in 1984 and a submission loss in Japan to Antonio Inoki in 1986. He also had sixty-minute time-limit draws with the two other major world champions of the day, Harley Race and Nick Bockwinkel.\n\nIn 1976, André fought professional boxer Chuck Wepner in an unscripted boxer-versus-wrestler fight. The wild fight was shown via telecast as part of the undercard of the Muhammad Ali versus Antonio Inoki fight and ended when André threw Wepner over the top rope and outside the ring and won via count out.\n\nIn 1980, he feuded with Hulk Hogan, where unlike their more famous matches in the late 1980s, Hogan was the villain and André was the hero, wrestling him at Shea Stadium's Showdown at Shea and in Pennsylvania, where after André pinned Hogan to win the match, Hogan bodyslammed André much like their legendary WrestleMania III match in 1987. The feud continued in Japan in 1982 and 1983 with their roles reversed and with Antonio Inoki also involved.\n\nIn 1982, Vince McMahon, Sr. sold the World Wide Wrestling Federation to his son, Vince McMahon, Jr. As McMahon began to expand his newly acquired promotion to the national level, he required his wrestlers to appear exclusively for him. McMahon signed André to these terms in 1984, although he still allowed him to work in Japan for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW).\n\nOne of André's feuds pitted him against the \"Mongolian Giant\" Killer Khan. According to the storyline, Khan had snapped André's ankle during a match on May 2, 1981, in Rochester, New York, by leaping off the top rope and crashing down upon it with his knee-drop. In reality, André had broken his ankle getting out of bed the morning before the match. The injury and subsequent rehabilitation was worked into the existing André/Khan storyline. After a stay at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, André returned with payback on his mind. The two battled on July 20, 1981, at Madison Square Garden in a match that resulted in a double disqualification. Their feud continued as fans filled arenas up and down the east coast to witness their matches. On November 14, 1981, at the Philadelphia Spectrum, André decisively defeated Khan in what was billed as a \"Mongolian stretcher match\", in which the loser must be taken to the dressing room on a stretcher. The same type of match was also held in Toronto. In early 1982 the two also fought in a series of matches in Japan with Arnold Skaaland in André's corner.\nAnother feud involved a man who considered himself to be the \"true giant\" of wrestling: Big John Studd. Throughout the early to mid-1980s, André and Studd fought all over the world, battling to try to determine who the real giant of wrestling was. In 1984, Studd took the feud to a new level when he and partner Ken Patera knocked out André during a televised tag-team match and proceeded to cut off André's hair. After gaining revenge on Patera, André met Studd in a \"body slam challenge\" at the first WrestleMania, held March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. André slammed Studd to win the match and collect the $15,000 prize, then proceeded to throw cash to the fans before having the bag taken from him by Studd's manager, Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan.\n\nThe following year, at WrestleMania 2, on April 7, 1986, André continued to display his dominance by winning a twenty-man battle royal which featured top National Football League stars and wrestlers. André last eliminated Bret Hart to win the contest.\n\nAfter WrestleMania 2, André continued his feud with Studd and King Kong Bundy. Around this time, André requested a leave of absence to tend to his health, effects from his acromegaly that were beginning to take their toll, as well as tour Japan. He had also been cast in the film \"The Princess Bride\". To explain André's absence, a storyline was developed in which Heenan—suggesting that André was secretly afraid of Studd and Bundy, whom Heenan bragged were unbeatable—challenged André and a partner of his choosing to wrestle Studd and Bundy in a televised tag-team match. When André failed to show, WWF president Jack Tunney indefinitely suspended him. Later in the summer of 1986, upon André's return to the United States, he began wearing a mask and competing as the \"Giant Machine\" in a stable known as the Machines. (Big Machine and Super Machine were the other members, (Hulk Hogan (as \"Hulk Machine\") and Roddy Piper (as \"Piper Machine\") were also one-time members). The WWF's television announcers sold the Machines—a gimmick that was copied from the New Japan Pro Wrestling character \"Super Strong Machine\", played by Japanese wrestler Junji Hirata, —as \"a new tag-team from Japan\" and claimed not to know the identities of the wrestlers, even though it was obvious to fans that it was André competing as the Giant Machine. Heenan, Studd, and Bundy complained to Tunney, who eventually told Heenan that if it could be proven that André and the Giant Machine were the same person, André would be fired. André thwarted Heenan, Studd, and Bundy at every turn. Then, in late 1986, the Giant Machine \"disappeared,\" and André was reinstated. Foreshadowing André's heel turn, Heenan expressed his approval of the reinstatement but did not explain why.\n\nAndré agreed to turn heel in early 1987 to be the counter to the biggest \"babyface\" in professional wrestling at that time, Hulk Hogan. On an edition of \"Piper's Pit\" in 1987, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years; André came out to congratulate him. On the following week's \"Piper's Pit\", André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being \"the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history.\" Although André had suffered a handful of countout and disqualification losses in WWF, he had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring. Hogan came out to congratulate André and ended up being the focal point of the interview. Apparently annoyed, André walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech. A discussion between André and Hogan was scheduled, and on a \"Piper's Pit\" that aired February 7, 1987, the two met. Hogan was introduced first, followed by André. André was led by longtime rival Bobby Heenan.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his new protégé, Heenan accused Hogan of being André's friend only so he would not have to defend his title against him. Hogan tried to reason with André, but his pleas were ignored as he challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania III. Hogan was still seemingly in disbelief as to what André was doing, prompting Heenan to say \"You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this, Hogan\" before André ripped off the T-shirt and crucifix from Hogan, with the crucifix scratching Hogan's chest, causing him to bleed.\n\nFollowing Hogan's acceptance of André's challenge on a later edition of \"Piper's Pit\", the two were part of a 20-man over-the-top rope battle-royal on the 14 March edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit. Although the battle royal was won by Hercules, André claimed to have gained a psychological advantage over Hogan when he threw the WWF World Heavyweight Champion over the top rope. The match, which was actually taped on February 21, 1987, aired only two weeks before WrestleMania III to make it seem like Hogan had met his match in André the Giant.\n\nAt WrestleMania III, he was billed at , and the stress of such immense weight on his bones and joints resulted in constant pain. After recent back surgery, he was also wearing a brace underneath his wrestling singlet. In front of a record crowd, Hogan won the match after body-slamming André (later dubbed \"the bodyslam heard around the world\"), followed by Hogan's running leg drop finisher. Years later, Hogan claimed that André was so heavy, he felt more like , and that he tore his latissimus dorsi muscle when slamming him.\n\nAnother myth about the match is that no one, not even WWF owner Vince McMahon, knew until the day of the event whether André would lose the match. In reality, André had agreed to lose the match some time before, mostly for health reasons. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body-slammed André in a WWF match. A then-heel Hogan had slammed a then-face André following their match at the \"Showdown at Shea\" on August 9, 1980, though André was much lighter (around ) and more athletic at the time (Hogan also slammed André in a match in Hamburg, Pennsylvania, a month later). This took place in the territorial days of American wrestling three years before WWF began national expansion, so many of those who watched WrestleMania III had never seen the Giant slammed (André had also previously allowed Harley Race, El Canek and Stan Hansen, among others, to slam him).\n\nBy the time of WrestleMania III, the WWF had gone national, giving more meaning to the André–Hogan match that took place then. The feud between André and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when wrestlers were named the captains of rival teams at the inaugural Survivor Series event. During their approximately one minute of battling each other during the match, Hogan dominated André and was on the brink of knocking him from the ring, but was tripped up by André's partners, Bundy and One Man Gang, and would be counted out. André went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning Bam Bam Bigelow before Hogan returned to the ring to attack André and knock him out of the ring. André later got revenge when, after Hogan won a match against Bundy on \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", he snuck up from behind and began choking Hogan to the brink of unconsciousness, not letting go even after an army of seven face-aligned wrestlers ran to the ring to try to pull André away; it took Hacksaw Jim Duggan breaking a piece of wood over André's back (which he no-sold) for him to let go, after which Hogan was pulled to safety. As was the case with the \"SNME\" battle royal a year earlier, the series of events was one of the pieces that helped build interest in a possible one-on-one rematch between Hogan and André, and to make it seem that André was certain to win easily when they did meet.\n\nIn the meantime, the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to André to win it for him. André and DiBiase had teamed several times in the past, including in Japan and in the WWF in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both were faces, but this was not acknowledged during this new storyline. The earlier attack and DiBiase's insertion into the feud set up the Hogan-André rematch on \"The Main Event\", to air 5 February 1988, on a live broadcast on NBC. Acting as his hired gun, André won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan (his first singles title) in a match where it was later revealed that appointed referee Dave Hebner was \"detained backstage\", and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave, but was revealed to have been his evil twin brother, Earl Hebner), made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat.\n\nAfter winning, André \"sold\" the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-WWF president Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant. This was shown on WWF's NBC program \"The Main Event\". At WrestleMania IV, André and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that André was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, André and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at \"WrestleFest\" on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee.\n\nAt the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at Madison Square Garden, André and DiBiase (billed as The Mega Bucks) faced Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage (known as The Mega Powers) in the main event, with Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura as the special guest referee. During the match, the Mega Powers' manager, Miss Elizabeth, (Savage's wife Elizabeth Hulette) distracted the Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase. Savage forced Ventura's hand down for the final three-count, due to Ventura's character historically being at odds with Hogan, and his unwillingness to count the fall.\n\nConcurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, André was placed in a feud with Jim Duggan, which began after Duggan knocked out André with a two-by-four board during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, André regularly got the upper hand in the feud.\nAndré's next major feud was against Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts. In this storyline, it was said André was afraid of snakes, something Roberts exposed on \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened André; as a result, André suffered a kayfabe mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside during André's matches, causing him to run from the ring in fright (since he knew what was inside the bag). Throughout their feud (which culminated at WrestleMania V), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger André.\n\nIn 1989, André and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, beginning at WrestleMania V, when Studd was the referee in the match with Roberts, this time with Studd as a face and André as the heel. During the late summer and Autumn of 1989, André engaged in a brief feud, consisting almost entirely of house shows (non-televised events), with then-Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior. The younger Warrior, WWF's rising star, regularly squashed the aging André in an attempt to showcase his star quality and promote him as the \"next big thing\".\n\nIn late 1989, André was joined with fellow Heenan Family member Haku to form a new tag team called the Colossal Connection, in part to fill a void left by the departure of Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson (the Brain Busters, who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging André in the main event spotlight. The Colossal Connection immediately targeted WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (who had recently won the belts from the Brain Busters). At a television taping on December 13, 1989, the Colossal Connection defeated Demolition to win the titles. André and Haku successfully defended their title, mostly against Demolition, until WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990, when Demolition took advantage of a mistimed move by the champions to regain the belts. After the match, a furious Heenan blamed André for the title loss and after shouting at him, slapped him in the face; an angry André responded with a slap of his own that sent Heenan staggering from the ring. André also caught Haku's kick attempt, sending him reeling from the ring as well, prompting support for André and turning him face for the first time since 1987. Due to his ongoing health issues, André was not able to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging in André.\n\nOn weekend television shows following WrestleMania VI, Bobby Heenan vowed to spit in André's face when he came crawling back to the Heenan Family. However André would wrestle one more time with Haku, teaming up to face Demolition on a house show in Honolulu, HI, on April 10, André was knocked out of the ring and The Colossal Connection lost via countout. After the match, André and Haku would fight each other, marking the end of the team. André's final match of 1990 came at a combined WWF/All Japan/New Japan show on April 13 in Tokyo, Japan when teamed with Giant Baba to defeat Demolition in a non-title match. André would win by gaining the pinfall on Smash.\n\nAndré returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, André made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11 in Reseda, California. (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF. The following month, on November 30 at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced André's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). André was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury.\n\nHis on-air return finally took place at the WWF's \"Super-Stars & Stripes Forever\" USA Network special on March 17, 1991, when he came out to shake the hand of The Big Boss Man after an altercation with Mr. Perfect. The following week, at WrestleMania VII, he came to the aid of the Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. André finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10 he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit André one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to André and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on \"WWF Superstars\" to announce that he had successfully signed André to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, André denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking André from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to André's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. André was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack André, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and André, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with André's crutch, allowing Smith to win.\n\nHis last U.S. television appearance was in a brief interview on World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) \"\" special that aired on TBS on 2 September 1992.\n\nAfter WrestleMania VI, André spent the rest of his in-ring career in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Mexico's Universal Wrestling Association, where he performed under the name \"André el Gigante.\" He toured with AJPW three times per year, from 1990 to 1992, usually teaming with Giant Baba in tag-team matches. He also made a couple of guest appearances for Herb Abrams' Universal Wrestling Federation, in 1991, feuding with Big John Studd, though he never had a match in the promotion. He did his final tour of Mexico in 1992 in a selection of six-man tag matches alongside Bam Bam Bigelow and a variety of Lucha Libre stars facing among others Bad News Allen and future WWF Champion Yokozuna. André wrestled his final match for AJPW in 1992, after which he retired from professional wrestling.\n\nAndré branched out into acting again in the 1970s and 1980s, after a 1967 French boxing film, making his USA acting debut playing a Sasquatch (\"Bigfoot\") in a two-part episode aired in 1976 on the television series \"The Six Million Dollar Man\". He appeared in other television shows, including \"The Greatest American Hero\", \"B. J. and the Bear\", \"The Fall Guy\" and 1990's \"Zorro\".\n\nTowards the end of his career, André starred in several films. He had an uncredited appearance in the 1984 film \"Conan the Destroyer\" as Dagoth, the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger). That same year, André also made an appearance in \"Micki & Maude\" (billed as André Rousimmoff). He appeared most notably as Fezzik, his own favorite role, in the 1987 film \"The Princess Bride\". Both the film and André's performance retain a devoted following. In shoot interviews, wrestlers have stated that Andre was so proud of being in \"Princess Bride\", he carried a copy of the movie everywhere he went to watch whenever he could.\n\nIn his last film, he appeared in a cameo role as a circus giant in the comedy \"Trading Mom\", which was released a year after his death.\n\n\nRoussimoff was mentioned in the \"1974 Guinness Book of World Records\" as the highest-paid wrestler in history at that time. He had earned US $400,000 in one year during the early 1970s.\n\nRoussimoff has been unofficially crowned \"the greatest drunk on Earth\" for once consuming 119 beers (over 41 litres/72 pints) in six hours. On an episode of WWE's \"Legends of Wrestling\", Mike Graham said Roussimoff once drank 156 beers (over 73 litres/126 pints) in one sitting, which was confirmed by Dusty Rhodes. The Fabulous Moolah wrote in her autobiography that Roussimoff drank 127 beers in a Reading, Pennsylvania, hotel bar and later passed out in the lobby. The staff could not move him and had to leave him there until he awoke. A tale recounted by Cary Elwes in his book about the making of \"The Princess Bride\" has Roussimoff falling on top of somebody while drunk, after which the NYPD sent an undercover officer to follow Roussimoff around whenever he went out drinking in their city to make sure he did not fall on anyone again. Another story also says prior to his famous WrestleMania III match, Andre drank 14 bottles of wine. \n\nAn urban legend exists surrounding Roussimoff's 1987 surgery in which his size made it impossible for the anesthesiologist to estimate a dosage via standard methods; consequently, his alcohol tolerance was used as a guideline instead, which has since become a widely used measuring tool in medicine.\n\nRoussimoff was arrested by the Linn County, Iowa, sheriff in 1989 and charged with assault after he allegedly roughed up a local television cameraman.\n\nWilliam Goldman, the author of the novel and the screenplay of \"The Princess Bride\", wrote in his nonfiction work \"Which Lie Did I Tell?\" that Roussimoff was one of the gentlest and most generous people he ever knew. Whenever Roussimoff ate with someone in a restaurant, he would pay, but he would also insist on paying when he was a guest. After one meal, Arnold Schwarzenegger had quietly moved to the cashier to pay before Roussimoff could, but then found himself being physically lifted, carried from his table and deposited on top of his car by Roussimoff and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nThis is despite the lack of official references to Roussimoff's height other than the 7 ft 4 in (224 cm) (the WWE website lists Roussimoff as being 7'4\").\n\nRoussimoff owned a ranch in Ellerbe, North Carolina, looked after by two of his close friends. When he was not on the road, he loved spending time at the ranch tending to his cattle, playing with his dogs and entertaining company. While there were custom-made chairs and a few other modifications in his home to account for his size, tales that everything in his home was custom-made for a large man are said to be exaggerated. Since Roussimoff could not easily go shopping due to his fame and size, he was known to spend hours watching QVC and made frequent purchases from the shopping channel.\n\nRoussimoff died in his sleep of congestive heart failure on the night of January 27, 1993, in a Paris hotel room. He was found by his chauffeur. He was in Paris to attend his father's funeral. While there, Roussimoff decided to stay in France longer to be with his mother on her birthday. He spent the day before his death visiting and playing cards with some of his oldest friends in Molien.\n\nAndré had finalized his will in New York on October 30, 1990, with his lawyer. In the will, André specified that his remains be cremated and \"disposed of\". Upon his death in Paris, André's family in France held a funeral for him, intending to bury him near his father. When they learned of André's wish to be cremated, his body was flown to the United States, where he was cremated according to his wishes. His ashes were scattered at his ranch () in Ellerbe, North Carolina. In addition, as per his will, André left his estate to his sole beneficiary: his daughter Robin.\n\nAndré made numerous appearances as himself in video games, starting with \"WWF WrestleMania\". He also appears posthumously in \"WWF Superstars\", \"WWF No Mercy\", \"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw\", \"WWE All Stars\", WWE 2K14, WWE 2K16, \"WWE 2K17\", \"WWE 2K18\", \"WWE 2K19\" and many others.\n\nIn January 2005, WWE released \"André The Giant\", a DVD focusing on the life and career of André. The DVD is a reissue of the out-of-print \"André The Giant\" VHS made by Coliseum Video in 1985, with commentary by Michael Cole and Tazz replacing Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura's commentary on his WrestleMania match with Big John Studd. The video is hosted by Lord Alfred Hayes. Later matches, including André's battles against Hulk Hogan while a heel, are not included on this VHS.\n\n\nOn 9 May 2016, it was announced that a movie based on the 2015 authorized graphic novel biography \"André the Giant: Closer to Heaven\" was in the plans made by Lion Forge Comics along with producers Scott Steindorff, Dylan Russell and consulted by André's daughter, Robin Christensen-Roussimoff.\n\nOn April 10, 2018 HBO aired a documentary film called \"André the Giant\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24222749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24222749", "title": "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", "text": "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The original manuscript of the \"Chronicle\" was created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great (r. 871–899). Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, the \"Chronicle\" was still being actively updated in 1154.\n\nNine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the \"Chronicle\" is in the form of annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC (the annals' date for Caesar's invasions of Britain), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\n\nThe \"Chronicle\" is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the \"Chronicle\" is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.\n\nSeven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in the British Library. The remaining two are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.\n\nAll of the surviving manuscripts are copies, so it is not known for certain where or when the first version of the \"Chronicle\" was composed. It is generally agreed that the original version – sometimes known as the \"Early English Annals\" – was written in the late 9th century by a scribe in Wessex. Frank Stenton argued from internal evidence that it was first compiled for a secular, but not royal patron; and that “its origin is in one of the south-western shires...at some point not far from the boundary between Somerset and Dorset”. After the original \"Chronicle\" was compiled, copies were made and distributed to various monasteries. Additional copies were made, for further distribution or to replace lost manuscripts, and some copies were updated independently of each other. Some of these later copies are those that have survived.\n\nThe earliest extant manuscript, the \"Winchester Chronicle\", was written by a single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, in the margin of the next line; subsequent material was written by other scribes. This appears to place the composition of the chronicle at no later than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop Asser's use of a version of the Chronicle in his work \"Life of King Alfred\", known to have been composed in 893. It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original \"Chronicle\"; as a result, there is no proof that the \"Chronicle\" was compiled at Winchester. It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of Alfred the Great (871–99), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of English as a written language. The \"Chronicle\", as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.\n\nOf the nine surviving manuscripts, seven are written entirely in Old English (also known as Anglo-Saxon). One, known as the \"Bilingual Canterbury Epitome\", is in Old English with a translation of each annal into Latin. Another, the \"Peterborough Chronicle\", is in Old English except for the last entry, which is in early Middle English. The oldest (Corp. Chris. MS 173) is known as the \"Winchester Chronicle\" or the \"Parker Chronicle\" (after Matthew Parker, an Archbishop of Canterbury, who once owned it). Six of the manuscripts were printed in an 1861 edition for the Rolls Series by Benjamin Thorpe with the text laid out in columns labelled A to F. He also included the few readable remnants of a burned seventh manuscript, which he referred to as [G]. Following this convention, the two additional manuscripts are often called [H] and [I]. The surviving manuscripts are listed below.\n\nThe manuscripts are all thought to derive from a common original, but the connections between the texts are more complex than simple inheritance via copying. The diagram at right gives an overview of the relationships between the manuscripts. The following is a summary of the relationships that are known.\n\nAll the manuscripts described above share a chronological error between the years 756 and 845, but it is apparent that the composer of the \"Annals of St Neots\" was using a copy that did not have this error and which must have preceded them. Æthelweard's copy did have the chronological error but it had not lost a whole sentence from annal 885; all the surviving manuscripts have lost this sentence. Hence the error and the missing sentence must have been introduced in separate copying steps, implying that none of the surviving manuscripts are closer than two removes from the original version.\n\n[A]: The \"Winchester\" (or \"Parker\") Chronicle is the oldest manuscript of the \"Chronicle\" that survives. It was begun at Old Minster, Winchester, towards the end of Alfred's reign. The manuscript begins with a genealogy of Alfred, and the first chronicle entry is for the year 60 BC. The section containing the \"Chronicle\" takes up folios 1–32. Unlike the other manuscripts, [A] is of early enough composition to show entries dating back to the late 9th century in the hands of different scribes as the entries were made. The first scribe's hand is dateable to the late 9th or very early 10th century; his entries cease in late 891, and the following entries were made at intervals throughout the 10th century by several scribes. The eighth scribe wrote the annals for the years 925–955, and was clearly at Winchester when he wrote them since he adds some material related to events there; he also uses \"ceaster\", or \"city\", to mean Winchester. The manuscript becomes independent of the other recensions after the entry for 975. The book, which also had a copy of the Laws of Alfred and Ine bound in after the entry for 924, was transferred to Canterbury some time in the early 11th century, as evidenced by a list of books that Archbishop Parker gave to Corpus Christi. While at Canterbury, some interpolations were made; this required some erasures in the manuscript. The additional entries appear to have been taken from a version of the manuscript from which [E] descends. The last entry in the vernacular is for 1070. After this comes the Latin \"Acta Lanfranci\", which covers church events from 1070–1093. This is followed by a list of popes and the Archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium. The manuscript was acquired by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury (1559–1575) and master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, following the dissolution of the monasteries, and bequeathed to the college on his death. It now forms part of the Parker Library.\n\n[B] \"The Abingdon Chronicle I\" was written by a single scribe in the second half of the 10th century. The \"Chronicle\" takes up folios 1–34. It begins with an entry for 60 BC and ends with the entry for 977. A manuscript that is now separate (British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178) was originally the introduction to this chronicle; it contains a genealogy, as does [A], but extends it to the late 10th century. [B] was at Abingdon in the mid-11th century, because it was used in the composition of [C]. Shortly after this it went to Canterbury, where interpolations and corrections were made. As with [A], it ends with a list of popes and the archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium.\n\n[C] includes additional material from local annals at Abingdon, where it was composed. The section containing the \"Chronicle\" (folios 115–64) is preceded by King Alfred's Old English translation of Orosius's world history, followed by a menologium and some gnomic verses of the laws of the natural world and of humanity. Then follows a copy of the chronicle, beginning with 60 BC; the first scribe copied up to the entry for 490, and a second scribe took over up to the entry for 1048. [B] and [C] are identical between 491 and 652, but differences thereafter make it clear that the second scribe was also using another copy of the \"Chronicle\". This scribe also inserted, after the annal for 915, the \"Mercian Register\", which covers the years 902–924, and which focuses on Æthelflæd. The manuscript continues to 1066 and stops in the middle of the description of the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In the 12th century a few lines were added to complete the account.\n\n[D] The Worcester Chronicle appears to have been written in the middle of the 11th century. After 1033 it includes some records from Worcester, so it is generally thought to have been composed there. Five different scribes can be identified for the entries up to 1054, after which it appears to have been worked on at intervals. The text includes material from Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\" and from a set of 8th-century Northumbrian annals. It is thought that some of the entries may have been composed by Archbishop Wulfstan. [D] contains more information than other manuscripts on northern and Scottish affairs, and it has been speculated that it was a copy intended for the Anglicised Scottish court. From 972 to 1016, the sees of York and Worcester were both held by the same person—Oswald from 972, Ealdwulf from 992, and Wulfstan from 1003, and this may explain why a northern recension was to be found at Worcester. By the 16th century, parts of the manuscript were lost; eighteen pages were inserted containing substitute entries from other sources, including [A], [B], [C] and [E]. These pages were written by John Joscelyn, who was secretary to Matthew Parker.\n\n[E] \"The Peterborough Chronicle\": In 1116, a fire at the monastery at Peterborough destroyed most of the buildings. The copy of the \"Chronicle\" kept there may have been lost at that time or later, but in either case shortly thereafter a fresh copy was made, apparently copied from a Kentish version—most likely to have been from Canterbury. The manuscript was written at one time and by a single scribe, down to the annal for 1121. The scribe added material relating to Peterborough Abbey which is not in other versions. The Canterbury original which he copied was similar, but not identical, to [D]: the Mercian Register does not appear, and a poem about the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, which appears in most of the other surviving copies of the Chronicle, is not recorded. The same scribe then continued the annals through to 1131; these entries were made at intervals, and thus are presumably contemporary records. Finally, a second scribe, in 1154, wrote an account of the years 1132–1154; but his dating is known to be unreliable. This last entry is in Middle English, rather than Old English. [E] was once owned by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury 1633–1654, so is also known as the \"Laud Chronicle\". The manuscript contains occasional glosses in Latin, and is referred to (as \"the Saxon storye of Peterborowe church\") in an antiquarian book from 1566. According to Joscelyn, Nowell had a transcript of the manuscript. Previous owners include William Camden and William L'Isle; the latter probably passed the manuscript on to Laud.\n\n[F] The Canterbury Bilingual Epitome: In about 1100, a copy of the \"Chronicle\" was written at Christ Church, Canterbury, probably by one of the scribes who made notes in [A]. This version is written in both Old English and Latin; each entry in Old English was followed by the Latin version. The version the scribe copied (on folios 30–70) is similar to the version used by the scribe in Peterborough who wrote [E], though it seems to have been abridged. It includes the same introductory material as [D] and, along with [E], is one of the two chronicles that does not include the \"Battle of Brunanburh\" poem. The manuscript has many annotations and interlineations, some made by the original scribe and some by later scribes, including Robert Talbot.\n\n[A]/[G] Copy of \"the Winchester Chronicle\": [A] was copied from [A] at Winchester in the eleventh century and follows a 10th-century copy of an Old English translation of Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\". The last annal copied was 1001, so the copy was made no earlier than that; an episcopal list appended to [A] suggests that the copy was made by 1013. This manuscript was almost completely destroyed in the 1731 fire at Ashburnham House, where the Cotton Library was housed. Of the original 34 leaves, seven remain, ff. 39–47 in the manuscript. However, a transcript had been made by Laurence Nowell, a 16th-century antiquary, which was used by Abraham Wheelocke in an edition of the \"Chronicle\" printed in 1643. Because of this, it is also sometimes known as [W], after Wheelocke. Nowell's transcript copied the genealogical introduction detached from [B] (the page now British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178), rather than that originally part of this document. The original [A] introduction would later be removed prior to the fire and survives as British Library Add MS 34652, f. 2. The appellations [A], [A] and [G] derive from Plummer, Smith and Thorpe, respectively.\n\nThe \"Cottonian Fragment\" [H] consists of a single leaf, containing annals for 1113 and 1114. In the entry for 1113 it includes the phrase \"he came to Winchester\"; hence it is thought likely that the manuscript was written at Winchester. There is not enough of this manuscript for reliable relationships to other manuscripts to be established. Ker notes that the entries may have been written contemporarily.\n\n[I] \"Easter Table Chronicle\": A list of \"Chronicle\" entries accompanies a table of years, found on folios 133-37 in a badly burned manuscript containing miscellaneous notes on charms, the calculation of dates for church services, and annals pertaining to Christ Church, Canterbury. Most of the Chronicle's entries pertain to Christ Church, Canterbury. Until 1109 (the death of Anselm of Canterbury) they are in English; all but one of the following entries are in Latin. Part of [I] was written by a scribe soon after 1073, in the same hand and ink as the rest of the Caligula MS. After 1085, the annals are in various contemporary hands. The original annalist's entry for the Norman conquest is limited to \"Her forðferde eadward kyng\"; a later hand added the coming of William the Conqueror, \"7 her com willelm.\" At one point this manuscript was at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury.\n\nTwo manuscripts are recorded in an old catalogue of the library of Durham; they are described as \"cronica duo Anglica\". In addition, Parker included a manuscript called \"Hist. Angliae Saxonica\" in his gifts but the manuscript that included this, now Cambridge University Library MS. Hh.1.10, has lost 52 of its leaves, including all of this copy of the chronicle.\n\nThe \"Chronicle\" incorporates material from multiple sources. The entry for 755, describing how Cynewulf took the kingship of Wessex from Sigebehrt, is far longer than the surrounding entries, and includes direct speech quotations from the participants in those events. It seems likely that this was taken by the scribe from existing saga material. Early entries, up to the year 110, probably came from one of the small encyclopaedic volumes of world history in circulation at the time the Chronicle was first written. The chronological summary to Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\" was used as a source. The Chronicle gives dates and genealogies for Northumbrian and Mercian kings, and provides a list of Wessex bishops; these are likely to have had separate sources. The entry for 661 records a battle fought by Cenwalh that is said to have been fought \"at Easter\"; this precision implies a contemporary record, which survived and was re-used by the Chronicle scribe.\n\nContemporary annals began to be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The material compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon history, but, with the exception of the Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The \"Chronicle\" grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.\n\nAs with any historical source, the \"Chronicle\" has to be treated with some caution. For example, between 514 and 544 the \"Chronicle\" makes reference to Wihtgar, who is supposedly buried on the Isle of Wight at \"Wihtgar's stronghold\" (which is \"Wihtgaræsbyrg\" in the original) and purportedly gave his name to the island. However, the name of the \"Isle of Wight\" derives from the Latin \"Vectis\", not from Wihtgar. The actual name of the fortress was probably \"Wihtwarabyrg\", \"the stronghold of the inhabitants of Wight\", and either the chronicler or an earlier source misinterpreted this as referring to Wihtgar.\n\nThe dating of the events recorded also requires care. In addition to dates that are simply inaccurate, scribes occasionally made mistakes that caused further errors. For example, in the [D] manuscript, the scribe omits the year 1044 from the list on the left hand side. The annals copied down are therefore incorrect from 1045 to 1052, which has two entries. A more difficult problem is the question of the date at which a new year began, since the modern custom of starting the year on 1 January was not universal at that time. The entry for 1091 in [E] begins at Christmas and continues throughout the year; it is clear that this entry follows the old custom of starting the year at Christmas. Some other entries appear to begin the year on 25 March, such as the year 1044 in the [C] manuscript, which ends with Edward the Confessor's marriage on 23 January, while the entry for 22 April is recorded under 1045. There are also years which appear to start in September.\n\nThe manuscripts were produced in different places, and each manuscript reflects the biases of its scribes. It has been argued that the \"Chronicle\" should be regarded as propaganda, produced by Alfred's court and written with the intent of glorifying Alfred and creating loyalty. This is not universally accepted, but the origins of the manuscripts clearly colour both the description of interactions between Wessex and other kingdoms, and the descriptions of the Vikings' depredations. An example can be seen in the entry for 829, which describes Egbert's invasion of Northumbria. According to the Chronicle, after Egbert conquered Mercia and Essex, he became a \"bretwalda\", implying overlordship of all of England. Then when he marched into Northumbria, the Northumbrians offered him \"submission and peace\". The Northumbrian chronicles incorporated into Roger of Wendover's 13th-century history give a different picture: \"When Egbert had obtained all the southern kingdoms, he led a large army into Northumbria, and laid waste that province with severe pillaging, and made King Eanred pay tribute.\"\n\nOccasionally the scribes' biases can be seen by comparing different versions of the manuscript they created. For example, Ælfgar, earl of East Anglia, and son of Leofric, the earl of Mercia, was exiled briefly in 1055. The [C], [D] and [E] manuscripts say the following:\n\n\nAnother example that mentions Ælfgar shows a different kind of unreliability in the \"Chronicle\": that of omission. Ælfgar was Earl of Mercia by 1058, and in that year was exiled again. This time only [D] has anything to say: \"Here Earl Ælfgar was expelled, but he soon came back again, with violence, through the help of Gruffydd. And here came a raiding ship-army from Norway; it is tedious to tell how it all happened.\" In this case other sources exist to clarify the picture: a major Norwegian attempt was made on England, but [E] says nothing at all, and [D] scarcely mentions it. It has sometimes been argued that when the \"Chronicle\" is silent, other sources that report major events must be mistaken, but this example demonstrates that the\" Chronicle\" does omit important events.\n\nThe three main Anglo-Norman historians, John of Worcester, William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon, each had a copy of the \"Chronicle\", which they adapted for their own purposes. Symeon of Durham also had a copy of the \"Chronicle\". Some later medieval historians also used the \"Chronicle\", and others took their material from those who had used it, and so the \"Chronicle\" became \"central to the mainstream of English historical tradition\".\n\nHenry of Huntingdon used a copy of the \"Chronicle\" that was very similar to [E]. There is no evidence in his work of any of the entries in [E] after 1121, so although his manuscript may actually have been [E], it may also have been a copy—either one taken of [E] prior to the entries he makes no use of, or a manuscript from which [E] was copied, with the copying taking place prior to the date of the last annal he uses. Henry also made use of the [C] manuscript.\n\nThe Waverley Annals made use of a manuscript that was similar to [E], though it appears that it did not contain the entries focused on Peterborough. The manuscript of the chronicle translated by Geoffrey Gaimar cannot be identified accurately, though according to historian Dorothy Whitelock it was \"a rather better text than 'E' or 'F'\". Gaimar implies that there was a copy at Winchester in his day (the middle of the 12th century); Whitelock suggests that there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to the present day was at Winchester in the mid-tenth century. If it survived to Gaimar's time that would explain why [A] was not kept up to date, and why [A] could be given to the monastery at Canterbury.\n\nJohn of Worcester's \"Chronicon ex chronicis\" appears to have had a manuscript that was either [A] or similar to it; he makes use of annals that do not appear in other versions, such as entries concerning Edward the Elder's campaigns and information about Winchester towards the end of the chronicle. His account is often similar to that of [D], though there is less attention paid to Margaret of Scotland, an identifying characteristic of [D]. He had the Mercian register, which appears only in [C] and [D]; and he includes material from annals 979–982 which only appears in [C]. It is possible he had a manuscript that was an ancestor of [D]. He also had sources which have not been identified, and some of his statements have no earlier surviving source.\n\nA manuscript similar to [E] was available to William of Malmesbury, though it is unlikely to have been [E] as that manuscript is known to have still been in Peterborough after the time William was working, and he does not make use of any of the entries in [E] that are specifically related to Peterborough. It is likely he had either the original from which [E] was copied, or a copy of that original. He mentions that the chronicles do not give any information on the murder of Alfred Aetheling, but since this is covered in both [C] and [D] it is apparent he had no access to those manuscripts. On occasion he appears to show some knowledge of [D], but it is possible that his information was taken from John of Worcester's account. He also omits any reference to a battle fought by Cenwealh in 652; this battle is mentioned in [A], [B] and [C], but not in [E]. He does mention a battle fought by Cenwealh at Wirtgernesburg, which is not in any of the extant manuscripts, so it is possible he had a copy now lost.\n\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" is the single most important source for the history of England in Anglo-Saxon times. Without the \"Chronicle\" and Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" (the \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\"), it would be impossible to write the history of the English from the Romans to the Norman conquest; Nicholas Howe called them \"the two great Anglo-Saxon works of history\". It is clear that records and annals of some kind began to be kept in England at the time of the earliest spread of Christianity, but no such records survive in their original form. Instead they were incorporated in later works, and it is thought likely that the \"Chronicle\" contains many of these. The history it tells is not only that witnessed by its compilers, but also that recorded by earlier annalists, whose work is in many cases preserved nowhere else.\n\nIts importance is not limited to the historical information it provides, however. It is just as important a source for the early development of English. The \"Peterborough Chronicle\" changes from the standard Old English literary language to early Middle English after 1131, providing some of the earliest Middle English text known. Howe notes, in \"Rome: Capitol of Anglo-Saxon England\", that many of the entries indicate that Rome was considered a spiritual home for the Anglo-Saxons, Rome and Roman history being of paramount importance in many of the entries; he cites the one for AD 1, for instance, which lists the reign of Octavian Augustus before it mentions the birth of Christ.\n\nThe \"Chronicle\" is not without literary interest. Inserted at various points since the 10th century are Old English poems in celebration of royal figures and their achievements: \"The Battle of Brunanburh\" (937), on King Æthelstan's victory over the combined forces of Vikings, Scots and the Strathclyde Britons, and five shorter poems, \"Capture of the Five Boroughs\" (942), \"The Coronation of King Edgar\" (973), \"The Death of King Edgar\" (975), \"The Death of Prince Alfred\" (1036), and \"The Death of King Edward the Confessor\" (1065).\n\nAn important early printed edition of the \"Chronicle\" appeared in 1692, by Edmund Gibson, an English jurist and divine who became Bishop of Lincoln in that year. Titled \"Chronicon Saxonicum\", it printed Latin and Old English versions of the text in parallel columns and became the standard edition until the 19th century. It was superseded in 1861 by Benjamin Thorpe's Rolls edition, which printed six versions in columns, labelled A to F, thus giving the manuscripts the letters which are now used to refer to them.\n\nJohn Earle wrote \"Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel\" (1865). Charles Plummer edited this book, producing a \"Revised Text\" with notes, appendices, and glossary in two volumes in 1892 and 1899. This edition of the A and E texts, with material from other versions, was widely used; it was reprinted in 1952.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, a new set of scholarly editions have been printed under the series title \"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition\". Some volumes are still projected, such as a volume focusing on the northern recension, but existing volumes such as Janet Bately's edition of [A] are now standard references. A recent translation of the Chronicle is Michael Swanton's \"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", which presents translations of [A] and [E] on opposite pages, with interspersed material from the other manuscripts where they differ.\n\nA facsimile edition of [A], \"The Parker Chronicle and Laws\", appeared in 1941 from the Oxford University Press, edited by Robin Flower and Hugh Smith. A recent scholarly edition of the [B] text is \"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition, 4, MS B\" by S. Taylor (Cambridge, 1983). The [C] manuscript was edited by H.A. Rositzke; \"The C-Text of the Old English Chronicles\", in \"Beitrage z. engl. Phil.\", XXXIV, Bochum-Langendreer, 1940; and the [D] manuscript in \"An Anglo-Saxon Chronicle from British Museum Cotton MS., Tiberius B. iv\", edited by E. Classen and F.E. Harmer, Manchester, 1926. Rositzke also published a translation of the [E] text in \"The Peterborough Chronicle\" (New York, 1951). The [F] text was printed in F.P. Magoun, Jr., \"Annales Domitiani Latini: an Edition\" in \"Mediaeval Studies of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies\", IX, 1947, pp. 235–295. The first edition of [G] was Abraham Whelock's 1644 \"Venerabilis Bedae Historia Ecclesiastica\", printed in Cambridge; there is also an edition by Angelica Lutz, \"Die Version G der angelsächsischen Chronik: Rekonstruktion und Edition\" (Munich, 1981).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9661414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9661414", "title": "Arbeidernes Leksikon", "text": "Arbeidernes Leksikon\n\nArbeidernes Leksikon (\"The Laborers' Encyclopedia\") is a Norwegian encyclopedia published in six volumes in the 1930s.\n\nIt was the first reference book in Norwegian to have a pronounced class bias, and the first encyclopedia outside of the Soviet Union to be directed specifically at the working class. The publication had a connection with the Norwegian labor movement's goal to spread knowledge among the working and lower class, and in doing so could break the monopoly the middle class had on the dissemination of information in society. They thought that the existing encyclopedias had a middle class bias.\n\nThe idea of such an encyclopedia came within the group that produced the laborers' magazine \"Arbeidermagasinet\". This magazine was produced from 1927 by members of the Communist Party of Norway (founded 1923). Communist Party member Jakob Friis was hired as chief editor of the encyclopedia in 1930. The work was published by the \"Arbeidermagasinet\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publishing company in six volumes from 1932 to 1936. In addition to Jakob Friis, Trond Hegna worked as editor; from the third volume on, Dagfin Juel worked as a co-editor.\n\nThe Communist Party was reluctant to the whole project, and the Norwegian Labour Party was negative as well. In April 1933, \"Arbeidernes Leksikon\" received a grant from the group \"Mot Dag\", which had formerly been affiliated with the Communist and Labour parties, but now was independent. \"Mot Dag\" leader Erling Falk was involved with the editorial work.\n\nA selection of articles from the encyclopedia was published in 1974 in a three-volume reprint by the publishing house Pax Forlag. This publishing house also published its own class encyclopedia, \"Pax Leksikon\".\n\nPortions of the encyclopedia are available online.\n\nThis is a list of the six volumes of the encyclopedia \"Arbeidernes Leksikon\".\n\n"}

{"id": "377103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377103", "title": "Blandings Castle", "text": "Blandings Castle\n\nBlandings Castle is a recurring fictional location in the stories of British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being the seat of Lord Emsworth (Clarence Threepwood, 9th Earl of Emsworth), home to many of his family and the setting for numerous tales and adventures. The stories were written between 1915 and 1975.\n\nThe series of stories taking place at the castle, in its environs and involving its denizens have come to be known as the \"Blandings books\", or indeed, in a phrase used by Wodehouse in his preface to the 1969 reprint of the first book, \"the Blandings Castle Saga\".\n\nIn a radio broadcast on 15 July 1961, Evelyn Waugh said: \"The gardens of Blandings Castle are that original garden from which we are all exiled.\"\n\nBlandings Castle, lying in the picturesque Vale of Blandings, Shropshire, England, is two miles from the town of Market Blandings, home to at least nine pubs, most notably the Emsworth Arms.\n\nThe tiny hamlet of Blandings Parva lies directly outside the castle gates and the town of Much Matchingham, home to Matchingham Hall, the residence of Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, is also nearby.\n\nThe castle is a noble pile, of Early Tudor building (\"its history is recorded in England's history books and Viollet-le-Duc has written of its architecture\", according to \"Something Fresh\"). One of England's largest stately homes, it dominates the surrounding country, standing on a knoll of rising ground at the southern end of the celebrated Vale of Blandings; the Severn gleams in the distance. From its noble battlements, the Wrekin can be seen.\n\nThe famous moss-carpeted Yew Alley (subject to the devious gravelling schemes of Angus McAllister) leads to a small wood with a rough gamekeeper's cottage, which Psmith made use of, not to write poetry as he at first claimed, but to stash stolen jewellery. Another gamekeeper's cottage, in the West Wood, makes a pleasant home for the Empress of Blandings for a spell. The rose garden is another famous beauty spot, ideal for courting lovers. There is a lake, where Lord Emsworth often takes a brisk swim in the mornings.\n\nThe house has numerous guest rooms, many of which haven't been used since Queen Elizabeth roamed the country. Of those still in use, the Garden Room is the finest, usually given to the most prestigious guest; it has a balcony outside its French windows, which can be easily accessed via a handy drainpipe.\n\nThe main library has a smaller library leading off it, and windows overlooking some flowerbeds; it is here that Lord Emsworth is often to be found on wet days, his nose deep in an improving tome of country lore, his favourite being Whiffle on \"The Care of the Pig\".\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to locate and identify the possible locations of Blandings:\n\n\nThe master of Blandings is, nominally at least, Lord Emsworth. Clarence, the ninth Earl, is an amiably absent-minded old chap, who is charming because of his slow, relaxed lifestyle and the simple obsessions that make him oblivious to the absurd melodrama of his family, namely his home, gardens, pumpkins, and his champion pig, Empress of Blandings. He is never happier than when pottering about the grounds on a fine sunny day.\n\nLord Emsworth's ten sisters (all of whom look like the \"daughter of a hundred earls\", except for Hermione, who looks like a cook), his brother Galahad (\"Gally\"), his daughter Mildred, his sons Freddie and George, and his numerous nieces, nephews, and in-laws inhabit the castle from time to time. For the Threepwood family, and their friends, the castle is forever available for indefinite residence, and is occasionally used as a temporary prison—known as \"Devil's Island\" or \"The Bastille\"—for love-struck young men and ladies to calm down.\n\nEmsworth's sister Ann plays the role of châtelaine when we first visit the Castle, in \"Something Fresh\". Following her reign, Lady Constance Keeble acts as châtelaine until she marries American millionaire James Schoonmaker.\n\nLady Julia Fish is \"the iron hand beneath the leather glove\", whose son Ronald Fish (\"Ronnie\") marries a chorus girl named Sue Brown, who is the daughter of the only woman whom Gally ever loved—Dolly Henderson, though Gally insists Sue is not Ronnie's cousin.\n\nThe other sisters are: Charlotte, Dora, Florence, Georgiana, Jane, and Diana, the only one that Gally likes (\"Sunset at Blandings\").\n\nBlandings's ever-present butler is Sebastian Beach, with eighteen years service at the castle under his ample belt, and its other domestic servants have at various times included Mrs Twemlow the housekeeper, an under-butler named Merridew, and a number of footmen, such as Charles, Thomas, Stokes, James and Alfred. The chauffeurs Slingsby and Alfred Voules drive the castle's stately Hispano-Suiza, or, in an emergency, the Albatross or the Antelope (\"Summer Lightning\").\n\nOutside of the house, Scottish head gardeners Thorne and Angus McAllister have tended the grounds, while George Cyril Wellbeloved, James Pirbright and the Amazonian Monica Simmons have each in turn taken care of Lord Emsworth's beloved prize pig, Empress of Blandings.\n\nEmsworth has employed a series of secretaries, most notable among them Rupert Baxter, the highly efficient young man who never seems to be able to keep away from Blandings, despite Lord Emsworth's increasingly low opinion of his sanity. He was succeeded in the post by Ronald Psmith, and later by the likes of Hugo Carmody and Monty Bodkin. The castle's splendid library was catalogued, for the first time since 1885, by Eve Halliday.\n\nMany people pass through the doors of Blandings, including guests and friends of the family, prospective additions to the family, temporary staff, pig-lovers, day-trippers, detectives, crooks and of course impostors galore. Among the most distinguished are the grumpy Duke of Dunstable; leading brain-specialist Sir Roderick Glossop; publishing magnate Lord Tilbury; the Fifth Earl of Ickenham, known to all as Uncle Fred; and Percy Pilbeam, head of the Argus Enquiry Agency employed to locate the lost pig and recover Gally's manuscript of his memoirs.\n\nBlandings Castle serves as the setting for eleven novels and nine short stories.\n\n\nWodehouse worked on \"Sunset at Blandings\" until his death, writing even in his hospital bed. It was unfinished and untitled when he died, and was subsequently edited (by Richard Usborne) and released in its incomplete form with extensive notes on the content.\n\nAll nine Blandings short stories were collected together in one volume entitled \"Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best\" in 1992.\n\nThe Folio Society published a six volume set \"The Best of Blandings\" consisting of \"Summer Lightning, Heavy Weather, Uncle Fred in the Springtime, Full Moon, Pigs Have Wings,\" and \"Service with a Smile\".\n\nHorace Hodges played Lord Emsworth in a 1933 silent film adaptation of \"Summer Lightning\"\n\nThe Castle and its inhabitants were the subject of six half-hour adaptations under the title \"Blandings Castle\", made by the BBC (also known as \"The World of Wodehouse\" series). Adapted from some of the shorts in \"Blandings Castle and Elsewhere\" and the classic \"The Crime Wave at Blandings\", they were broadcast in 1967 and starred Ralph Richardson as Lord Emsworth, Meriel Forbes as Lady Constance, Stanley Holloway as Beach and Derek Nimmo as Freddie. Only extracts from one episode survive (\"Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend\"), the series having suffered the fate of being wiped.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1992, BBC Radio 4 broadcast several adaptations, starring Richard Vernon as Emsworth and Ian Carmichael as Galahad.\n\nIn 1995, the BBC, with partners including WGBH Boston, adapted \"Heavy Weather\" into a 95-minute TV movie. It was first screened on Christmas Eve 1995 in the UK, and shown in the US by PBS on February 18, 1996. It starred Peter O'Toole as Lord Emsworth, Richard Briers as Gally, Roy Hudd as Beach, Samuel West as Monty Bodkin and Judy Parfitt as Lady Constance. It was directed by Jack Gold with a screenplay by Douglas Livingstone, and was generally well received by fans.\n\nMany of the stories and novels are available as audiobooks, including an abridged series narrated by Martin Jarvis.\n\nBBC One has produced a new series of six episodes, called \"Blandings\", starring Timothy Spall and Jennifer Saunders which premiered in January 2013. A second series of seven episodes aired in February 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The geographical aspect of a subject may be conveyed through three types of headings labeled A, B, and C. Heading A uses a primary topical description with geographical subdivisions (e.g. Art—Paris). Type B uses a place-name for the main heading with a topical subdivision (e.g. Paris—Description). C headings use a geographical description of a phrase (e.g. Paris Literature). \n\nBrinkler explores what type of heading is more useful to a patron, and he finds that it depends on the level of familiarity a patron has with a topic and what approach they take when searching for resources on their topic. Ideally readers will either be looking for everything on a particular topic, or everything regarding a particular place. Bartol Brinkler investigates a system of classification that will best serve these two ideal types of patrons. He finds working with Type A headings will best assist a patron who is more topic oriented, while using Type B headings is preferable for those who are primarily interested in one place. \n\nHowever this is problematic in practice. One possibility is to assign Type A and Type B headings to every resource, but the cataloguing cost would be high. A system that aids readers regardless of their approach to a topic involves using cross-references (e.g. Canada—Botany, See Botany—Canada). Admitting that see and see also references would require more work on the part of librarians, Bartol Brinkler notes that librarians must keep in mind \"...readers do not have the same knowledge [of classification] and do need all the help they can get...\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15642138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15642138", "title": "Chapels of Versailles", "text": "Chapels of Versailles\n\nThe present chapel of the Palace of Versailles is the fifth in the history of the palace. These chapels evolved with the expansion of the château and formed the focal point of the daily life of the court during the Ancien Régime (Bluche, 1986, 1991; Petitfils, 1995; Solnon, 1987).\n\nThe château's first chapel dated from the time of Louis XIII, and was located in a detached pavilion at the northeast of the château. Today, the \"pièce de la vaisselle d'or\" in the \"Petit Appartement du Roi\" occupies the approximate emplacement of the château's first chapel. This chapel followed the two-story palatine model, which was traditional in France; successive chapels at Versailles followed this model. This chapel was destroyed in 1665 during the construction of the Grotte de Thétys (Batifol, 1909, 1913; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1968; Verlet, 1985).\n\nThe château's second chapel was created during Louis XIV's second building campaign (1669–1672), when Louis Le Vau constructed the \"Château Neuf\". When the new part of the château was completed, the chapel was situated in the \"Grand Appartement de la Reine\" and formed the symmetrical pendant with the \"Salon de Diane\" in the \"Grand Appartement du Roi\". This chapel was used by the royal family and court until 1678 at which time a new chapel was constructed, and this one was converted into the \"Salle des Gardes de la Reine\" (Félibien, 1674; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1972, 1976; Scudéry, 1669; Verlet, 1985).\n\nLocated next to the new \"Salle des Gardes de la Reine\", this chapel served the needs of life at Versailles for a short period of time. Soon after its construction, Louis XIV found it inconvenient and impractical for his needs as well as those of his court, which he had officially installed at Versailles in 1682. In 1682, this room was converted into the \"Grande Salles des Gardes de la Reine\" (and now exists as \"la Salle du Sacre\") and a new chapel was built (Combes, 1681; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1972, 1976; Verlet, 1985).\n\nWith the construction of the \"Aile du Nord\", the north wing of the château, a new chapel was built. Construction of the north wing necessitated the destruction of the Grotte de Thétys; it was on this site that the new chapel was built in 1682. When the fourth chapel was constructed, the \"Salon de l'Abondance\", which had served as entry to the \"Cabinet des Médailles\" in the Petit Appartement du Roi, was transformed into the \"Vestibule de la Chapelle\" — so named as it was from this upper level of the chapel that king and selected members of the royal family heard daily mass. This chapel remained in use until 1710, and was witness to many of the important events of the court and royal family during the reign of Louis XIV. Today the \"salon d'Hercule\" and the lower vestibule occupy the space of this site (Félibien, 1703; Kimball, 1944; Le Guillou, 1983, 1989; Marie, 1972, 1976; Piganiole de la Force, 1701; Verlet, 1985).\n\nAs the focal point of Louis XIV's fourth (and last) building campaign (1699–1710), the fifth and final chapel of the château of Versailles is an unreserved masterpiece. Begun in 1689, construction was halted due to the War of the League of Augsburg; Jules Hardouin-Mansart resumed construction in 1699. Hardouin-Mansart continued working on the project until his death in 1708, at which time his brother-in-law, Robert de Cotte, finished the project (Blondel, 1752–1756; Marie, 1972, 1976; Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993). It was to become the largest of the royal chapels at Versailles, and the height of its vaulting alone was allowed to disturb the rather severe horizontality everywhere else apparent in the palace's roof-line, leading to the design being badly treated by some contemporaries; the duc de Saint-Simon characterized it as an \"enormous catafalque\". Nevertheless, the magnificent interior has been widely admired to the present day and served as inspiration for Luigi Vanvitelli when he designed the chapel for the Palace of Caserta (Defilippis, 1968).\n\nDedicated to Saint Louis, patron saint of the Bourbons, the chapel was consecrated in 1710. The palatine model is of course traditional; however, the corinthian colonnade of the tribune level is of a classic style that anticipates the neo-classicism that evolved during the 18th century, although its use here bespeaks a remarkable virtuosity. The tribune level is accessed by a vestibule, known as the \"Salon de la Chapelle\", that was constructed at the same time as the chapel. The \"Salon de la Chapelle\" is decorated with white stone and the bas-relief sculpture, \"Louis XIV Crossing the Rhine\" by Nicolas and Guillaume Coustou forms the focal point of the rooms décor (Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993).\n\nThe floor of the chapel itself is inlaid with polychromatic marbles, and at the foot of the steps leading to the altar is the crowned monogram of an interlaced double \"L\" alluding to Saint Louis and Louis XIV (Nolhac, 1912–1913; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993). The sculptural and painted decoration uses both Old Testament and New Testament themes (Lighthart, 1997; Nolhac, 1912–1913; Sabatier, 1999; Verlet, 1985; Walton, 1993). The ceiling of the nave represent \"God the Father in His Glory Bringing to the World the Promise of Redemption\" and was painted by Antoine Coypel; the half-dome of the apse is decorated with Charles de la Fosse's \"The Resurrection of Christ\"; and, above the royal tribune is Jean Jouvenet's \"The Descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Virgin and the Apostles\" (Nolhac, 1912–1913; Walton, 1993).\n\nDuring the 18th century, the chapel witnessed many court events. \"Te Deums\" were sung to celebrate military victories and the births of children (\"Fils de France\" and \"fille de France\") born to the king and queen; marriages were also celebrated in this chapel, such as the wedding of Louis XV's son the dauphin Louis with the Infanta Marie-Thérèse d'Espagne of Spain on 23 February 1745 and the wedding on 16 May 1770 of the dauphin – later Louis XVI of France – with Marie-Antoinette. However, of all the ceremonies held in the chapel, those associated the Order of the Holy Spirit were among the most elaborate. (Blondel, 1752–1756; Bluche, 2000; Boughton, 1986; Campan, 1823; Croÿ-Solre, 1906–1921; Hézuques, 1873; Luynes, 1860–1865; Nolhac, 1912–1913).\n\nThe chapel was de-consecrated in the 19th century and has since served as a venue for state and private events. Musical concerts are often held in the chapel of Versailles.\n\nThe organ of the fifth chapel of Versailles was built by Robert Clicquot and Julien Tribuot in 1709–1710. His first official presentation took place on Pentecost, Juin 8, 1710; the organist was Jean-Baptiste Buterne.\n\n\n\n\nBooks\n\nJournals\n"}

{"id": "1719952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1719952", "title": "Comparative research", "text": "Comparative research\n\nComparative research is a research methodology in the social sciences that aims to make comparisons across different countries or cultures. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of poverty).\n\nAs Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of \"episteme\" and \"philo-sophia\", as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. \"Episteme\", as a form and activity in the field of \"logos\", marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.\n\nMoreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic \"polis\". Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ \"Histories\" demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. \"isegoria\" and \"parrhesia\"), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.\n\nAccording also to Karl Deutsch, we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time. Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.\n\nTextbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after World War II. There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. Globalization has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. Information technology has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.\n\nComparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research. The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a \"seamless whole.\" \n\nThere are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data. The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful. \n\nSecondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent. A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.\n\nIn line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate \"grand theories,\" such as Marxism. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it. A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related. The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of decommodification. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy. Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.\n\nComparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to. Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.\n\nThe historical comparative research involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.\n\nWhen it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.\n\n\n"}

(A 2001 Wall Street Journal article describes the rise and fall and disappearance of its founder, Chris Mays.) Originally begun as a way to lease handmade, one-of-a-kind, Japanese-produced robot dinosaurs to North American shopping malls, in time Dinamation defied its original mandate and came to produce its own production-line models for exhibit in science museums and zoos worldwide. Dinamation was an example of an American company following, improving upon, and then outpacing its Japanese rivals.\n\nDinamation started out with a dozen movie special effects technicians, sculptors, painters, and engineers housed in third-tier industrial spaces in Santa Ana, California, where municipal, safety and corporate oversight was minimal and creative freedom maximal. Given vague guidelines and a selection of consumer-grade dinosaur books for reference, they produced one \"beta\" show (which was sold, not leased) for a museum in Boston and also sold a display to the Mesa Southwest Museum in Phoenix, AZ, US (D.I.C. creatures are still on active exhibit there). Techniques improved (and so did scientific fidelity, up to a point, under the guidance of paleontologists Dr.s Robert Bakker and George Callison and given the contributions made by many skilled engineers, inventor/sculptors such as public artists Raymond Persinger and Marianne O'Barr, movie effects artists Steve Koch (also designed paint schemes), Brian Sipe and Matt Croteau. By 1988, Dinamation had grown to 150 employees embedded in a complex corporate structure and operating out of a facility in Tustin, California.\n\nMuseum attendances soared with every visit by the \"Dinosaurs Alive!\" shows and remained fairly high afterwards, boosting the revenues (and often the survival) of almost every venue. Dinamation was for a time quite successful, with exhibits around the world in important museums including the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the National Geographic Museum, and the British Museum of Natural History.\n\nAt the end, under a cloud of financial mystery, over 700 American-made 'creatures' were left in limbo, scattered in science museums, trucks, and shipping containers across the United States and abroad. Some of the orphaned robots have become permanent parts of the displays in the museums that had shows running when the company folded. Other dinos were sold, lost, disassembled, disposed of, or recycled as spare parts for other dinos in better shape. Other final vestiges of Dinamation can be seen as ubiquitous uncredited photographs of the dinosaur robots and preproduction art, scattered in children's books, toy art, video backgrounds, and recycled magazine illustrations, as well as appearances in cinema, for example, Woody Allen's film, Alice. Images of the sculptures in process and in completed sculptures in museum displays are available online.\n\nHowever, by far the largest collection of Dinamation creatures ended up as the possessions of Wonder Works USA, in Abilene, TX. WonderWorks is now owned by Jack Hull, who has been leasing out this collection since 2001 (with the, now former, partner of Hull, John Thomas).\n\nThis huge collection has been kept in service by WonderWorks with the reliance upon two former Dinamation technicians, Ken Diggs and Mike Short, that formed Creature Craft in Nebraska.\n\nThe T-rex Cafe in Kansas City, KS also has a set of running Dinamation dinosaurs. Much to children's and parents disappointments, they have always been a mechanically unsound, with extremely poor half attempts - if any- were made for the opening. Besides gaping holes and pneumatic leaks, camouflage was possibly attempted, resulting in a very garish color palette and extremely questionable decisions to use patterns and techniques, resulting in something horrendous. \nThe conditions have not improved in the decade since opening.\n\nSome examples of Dinamation's sculptures can still be seen at the Otway Fly in Victoria, Australia. They can also be viewed at the Museum of Western Colorado's Dinosaur Journey Museum in Fruita, Colorado. These include a \"Dilophosaurus\", \"Triceratops\", \"Stegosaurus\", \"Utahraptor\", and \"Apatosaurus\" robots, along with \"Tyrannosaurus\" sculptures.\n\nA (very) partial list of the Dinamation robot creatures:\n\n\nand various neotonous 'baby' dinosaurs, including hatching eggs and a pteranadon feeding a fish to youths in a rocky \"nest\".

{"id": "14371951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14371951", "title": "Executive summary", "text": "Executive summary\n\nAn executive summary, or management summary, is a short document or section of a document, produced for business purposes, that summarizes a longer report or proposal or a group of related reports in such a way that readers can rapidly become acquainted with a large body of material without having to read it all. It usually contains a brief statement of the problem or proposal covered in the major document(s), background information, concise analysis and main conclusions. It is intended as an aid to decision-making by managers and has been described as the most important part of a business plan.\n\nAn executive summary differs from an abstract in that an abstract will usually be shorter and is typically intended as an overview or orientation rather than being a condensed version of the full document. Abstracts are extensively used in academic research where the concept of the executive summary is not in common usage. \"An abstract is a brief summarizing statement... read by parties who are trying to decide whether or not to read the main document\", while \"an executive summary, unlike an abstract, is a document in miniature that may be read in place of the longer document\".\n\nThere is general agreement on the structure of an executive summary - books and training courses emphasise similar points. Typically, an executive summary will:\n\nExecutive summaries are important as a communication tool in both academia and business. For example, members of Texas A&M University Department of Agricultural Economics observes that \"An executive summary is an initial interaction between the writers of the report and their target readers: decision makers, potential customers, and/or peers. A business leader’s decision to continue reading a certain report often depends on the impression the executive summary gives.\"\n\nIt has been said that, by providing an easy digest of an often complex matter, an executive summary can lead policy makers and others to overlook important issues. Prof. Amanda Sinclair of the University of Melbourne has argued that this is often an active rather than a passive process. In one study, centred on globalization, she found that policy makers face \"pressures to adopt a simple reading of complex issues\" and \"to depoliticise and universalize all sorts of differences\". She claims that \"all research was framed under pre-defined and generic headings, such as business case points. The partners' reports were supposed to look the same. The standardization of research occurred via vehicles such as executive summaries: “executives only read the summaries” we were told”. Similarly Colin Leys, writing in The Socialist Register, argues that executive summaries are used to present dumbed down arguments: \"there is remarkably little adverse comment on the steep decline that has occurred since 1980 in the quality of government policy documents, whose level of argumentation and use of evidence is all too often inversely related to the quality of their presentation (in the style of corporate reports, complete with executive summaries and flashy graphics).\"\n\n\n"}

The aim of the third-party-funds financed research project is to automate the process of virtualization of herbar specimens and their management to make them digitally accessible to botanists and biologists. An examplary solution for the example herbarium of the botanic Garden in Berlin-Dahlem (ca. 3,5 million plant specimens) will allow to generalize the applied structure, software and technique to a level from that general reference solutions for efficient high-resolution scanning of any object of museum quality can be derived.\n\nHerbar specimens have been scanned for some time at different spaces. However, the degree of automation of these solutions is very low, so that only a small number of herbarium specimens can be scanned each day. The University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hannover has analysed industrial production workflows and derived approaches for scanning herbarium specimens. Automation is divided into three development focus points:\n\nThe herbar specimens get scanned to RAW data with a scanner camera attached to a standard personal computer and stored on a server using SilverFast Ai software. Image opimization (color, contrast, and brightness) is done on a second computer with SilverFast HDR software. The post processed RAW files get converted in a suitable image format, controlled at a profiled graphic screen and stored back on the server.\n\nA base unit is suited for paper sizes from DIN A3 to DIN A2 and is equipped with panel lights, a standard camera column and a scanner camera. The use of a controlled rotary indexing table provides new possibilities to improve performance. The rotary indexing table allows a new herbarium specimen to be loaded while another one is scanned. Access is also much easier, as the herbarium specimens are not reloaded directly under the panel lights. Apart from the time needed for scanning and turning the table 180°, the user determines the timing of the machine (3–12 rpm). The rotary indexing table can be controlled with a standard PC connected through a USB port. The scanner software is also installed on this computer. The rotary indexing table can be accessed from this computer without any problems using Herbar Digital Control software (HDC).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19894", "title": "Mosque", "text": "Mosque\n\nA mosque (; from ) is a place of worship for Muslims. There are strict and detailed requirements in Sunni jurisprudence (, \"fiqh\") for a place of worship to be considered a mosque, with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as musallas. There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque (which is often a small portion of the larger complex), and in the Islamic \"Sharī‘ah\" (, Law), after an area is formally designated as a mosque, it remains so until the Last Day.\n\nMany mosques have elaborate domes, minarets, and prayer halls, in varying styles of architecture. Mosques originated on the Arabian Peninsula, but are now found in all inhabited continents.\n\nThe word 'mosque' entered the English language from the French word \"mosquée\" that was probably derived from Italian \"moschea\", a variant of Italian \"moscheta\", from either Middle Armenian մզկիթ (\"mzkit‘\") or Medieval (\"masgídion\") or Spanish \"mezquita\", from (meaning \"site of prostration (in prayer)\" and hence a place of worship), either from Nabataean \"masgdhā́\" or from Arabic (meaning \"to bow down in prayer\"), probably ultimately from Aramaic \"sghēdh\".\n\nThe first mosque in the world is often considered to be the area around the \"Ka‘bah\" (, 'Cube') in Mecca, which is now known as \"Al-Masjid Al-Ḥarâm\" (, the Sacred Mosque). A Hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari states that the \"Kaaba\" was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the Temple in Jerusalem. Since as early as 638 AD, the Sacred Mosque has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as \"Ḥajj\" () to the city. Others regard the first mosque in history to be the Quba Mosque in present-day Medina since it was the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from Mecca in 622, though the Mosque of the Companions in the Eritrean city of Massawa may have been constructed at around the same time.\n\nThe Islamic Prophet Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina, which is now known as the Masjid an-Nabawi, or the Prophet's Mosque. Built on the site of his home, Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city. The Masjid al-Nabawi introduced some of the features still common in today's mosques, including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the \"mihrab\" and the tiered pulpit called the \"minbar\". The Masjid al-Nabawi was also constructed with a large courtyard, a motif common among mosques built since then.\n\nMosques had been built in Iraq and North Africa by the end of the 7th century, as Islam spread outside the Arabian Peninsula with early caliphates. The Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala is reportedly one of the oldest mosques in Iraq, although its present formtypical of Persian architectureonly goes back to the 11th century. The shrine, while still operating as a mosque, remains one of the holiest sites for Shia Muslims, as it honors the death of the third Shia imam, and Prophet Muhammad's grandson, Hussein ibn Ali. The Mosque of Amr ibn al-As was reportedly the first mosque in Egypt, serving as a religious and social center for Fustat (present-day Cairo) during its prime. Like the Imam Husayn Shrine, though, nothing of its original structure remains. With the later Shia Fatimid Caliphate, mosques throughout Egypt evolved to include schools (known as \"madrasas\"), hospitals, and tombs.\n\nThe Great Mosque of Kairouan in present-day Tunisia was reportedly the first mosque built in northwest Africa, with its present form (dating from the 9th century) serving as a model for other Islamic places of worship in the Maghreb. It was the first to incorporate a square minaret (as opposed to the more common circular minaret) and includes naves akin to a basilica. Those features can also be found in Andalusian mosques, including the Grand Mosque of Cordoba, as they tended to reflect the architecture of the Moors instead of their Visigoth predecessors. Still, some elements of Visigothic architecture, like horseshoe arches, were infused into the mosque architecture of Spain and the Maghreb.\n\nThe first mosque in East Asia was reportedly established in the 8th century in Xi'an. However, the Great Mosque of Xi'an, whose current building dates from the 18th century, does not replicate the features often associated with mosques elsewhere. Indeed, minarets were initially prohibited by the state. Following traditional Chinese architecture, the Great Mosque of Xi'an, like many other mosques in eastern China, resembles a pagoda, with a green roof instead of the yellow roof common on imperial structures in China. Mosques in western China were more likely to incorporate elements, like domes and minarets, traditionally seen in mosques elsewhere.\n\nA similar integration of foreign and local influences could be seen on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java, where mosques, including the Demak Great Mosque, were first established in the 15th century. Early Javanese mosques took design cues from Hindu, Buddhist, and Chinese architectural influences, with tall timber, multi-level roofs similar to the pagodas of Balinese Hindu temples; the ubiquitous Islamic dome did not appear in Indonesia until the 19th century. In turn, the Javanese style influenced the styles of mosques in Indonesia's Austronesian neighbors—Malaysia, Brunei, and the Philippines.\nMuslim empires were instrumental in the evolution and spread of mosques. Although mosques were first established in India during the 7th century, they were not commonplace across the subcontinent until the arrival of the Mughals in the 16th and 17th centuries. Reflecting their Timurid origins, Mughal-style mosques included onion domes, pointed arches, and elaborate circular minarets, features common in the Persian and Central Asian styles. The Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore, built in a similar manner in the mid-17th century, remain two of the largest mosques on the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Umayyad Caliphate was particularly instrumental in spreading Islam and establishing mosques within the Levant, as the Umayyads constructed among the most revered mosques in the region — Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, and the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. The designs of the Dome of the Rock and the Umayyad Mosque were influenced by Byzantine architecture, a trend that continued with the rise of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSeveral of the early mosques in the Ottoman Empire were originally churches or cathedrals from the Byzantine Empire, with the Hagia Sophia (one of those converted cathedrals) informing the architecture of mosques from after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. Still, the Ottomans developed their own architectural style characterized by large central rotundas (sometimes surrounded by multiple smaller domes), pencil-shaped minarets, and open facades.\n\nMosques from the Ottoman period are still scattered across Eastern Europe, but the most rapid growth in the number of mosques in Europe has occurred within the past century as more Muslims have migrated to the continent. Many major European cities are home to mosques, like the Grand Mosque of Paris, that incorporate domes, minarets, and other features often found with mosques in Muslim-majority countries. The first mosque in North America was founded by Albanian Americans in 1915, but the continent's oldest surviving mosque, the Mother Mosque of America, only dates back to the 1930s. As in Europe, the number of American mosques has rapidly increased in recent decades as Muslim immigrants, particularly from South Asia, have come in the United States. Greater than forty percent of mosques in the United States were constructed after 2000.\n\nAccording to early Muslim historians, towns that surrendered without resistance and made treaties with the Muslims were allowed to retain their churches and the towns captured by Muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques. One of the earliest examples of these kinds of conversions was in Damascus, Syria, where in 705 Umayyad caliph Al-Walid I bought the church of St. John from the Christians and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the Christians in Damascus. Overall, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (Al-Waleed's father) is said to have transformed 10 churches in Damascus into mosques.\n\nThe process of turning churches into mosques were especially intensive in the villages where most of the inhabitants converted to Islam. The Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun turned many churches into mosques. Ottoman Turks converted nearly all churches, monasteries, and chapels in Constantinople, including the famous Hagia Sophia, into mosques immediately after capturing the city in 1453. In some instances mosques have been established on the places of Jewish or Christian sanctuaries associated with Biblical personalities who were also recognized by Islam.\n\nMosques have also been converted for use by other religions, notably in southern Spain, following the conquest of the Moors in 1492. The most prominent of them is the Great Mosque of Cordoba, itself constructed on the site of a church demolished during the period of Muslim rule. Outside of the Iberian Peninsula, such instances also occurred in southeastern Europe once regions were no longer under Muslim rule.\n\nThe \"masjid jāmi‘\" (), a central mosque, can play a role in religious activities such as teaching the Quran and educating future imams.\n\nThere are two holidays (\"Eids\") in the Islamic calendar: \"ʻĪd al-Fiṭr\" () and \"ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā\" (), during which there are special prayers held at mosques in the morning. These Eid prayers are supposed to be offered in large groups, and so, in the absence of an outdoor \"Eidgah\" (), a large mosque will normally host them for their congregants as well as the congregants of smaller local mosques. Some mosques will even rent convention centers or other large public buildings to hold the large number of Muslims who attend. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host Eid prayers outside in courtyards, town squares or on the outskirts of town in an \"Eidgah\".\n\nIslam's holiest month, \"Ramaḍān\" (), is observed through many events. As Muslims must fast during the day during Ramadan, mosques will host \"Ifṭār\" () dinners after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, that is \"Maghrib\" (). Food is provided, at least in part, by members of the community, thereby creating daily potluck dinners. Because of the community contribution necessary to serve \"iftar\" dinners, mosques with smaller congregations may not be able to host the \"iftar\" dinners daily. Some mosques will also hold \"Suḥūr\" () meals before dawn to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, \"Fajr\" (). As with iftar dinners, congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing charity during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.\nFollowing the last obligatory daily prayer (\"‘Ishâ’\" ()) special, optional \"Ṫarâwîḥ\" () prayers are offered in larger mosques. During each night of prayers, which can last for up to two hours each night, usually one member of the community who has memorized the entire Quran (a Hafiz) will recite a segment of the book. Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe Laylat al-Qadr, the night Muslims believe that Muhammad first received Quranic revelations. On that night, between sunset and sunrise, mosques employ speakers to educate congregants in attendance about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night\nDuring the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques within the Muslim community will host \"I‘ṫikāf\" (), a practice in which at least one Muslim man from the community must participate. Muslims performing itikaf are required to stay within the mosque for ten consecutive days, often in worship or learning about Islam. As a result, the rest of the Muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food, drinks, and whatever else they need during their stay.\n\nThe third of the Five Pillars of Islam states that Muslims are required to give approximately one-fortieth of their wealth to charity as \"Zakâṫ\" (). Since mosques form the center of Muslim communities, they are where Muslims go to both give \"zakat\" and, if necessary, collect it. Before the holiday of \"Eid ul-Fitr\", mosques also collect a special \"zakat\" that is supposed to assist in helping poor Muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday.\n\nThe frequency by which Muslims attend mosque services vary greatly around the world. In some countries, weekly attendance at religious services are common among Muslims while in others, attendance is rare.\n\nIn the United States in particular, it has been shown in a study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding that Muslim Americans who regularly attend mosques are more likely to work with their neighbors to solve community problems (49 vs. 30 percent), be registered to vote (74 vs. 49 percent), and plan to vote (92 vs. 81 percent). Overall, “there is no correlation between Muslim attitudes toward violence and their frequency of mosque attendance.” \n\nWhen it comes to mosque attendance, data shows that American Muslim women and American Muslim men attend the mosque at similar rates (45% for men and 35% for women). Additionally, when compared to the general public looking at the attendance of religious services, young Muslim Americans attend the mosque at closer rates to older Muslim Americans.\n\nThe late 20th century saw an increase in the number of mosques used for political purposes. Today, civic participation is commonly promoted in mosques in the Western world. Because of the importance in the community, mosques are used for preaching peaceful coexistence with non-believers, even in times of adversity.\n\nLarge mosques sometimes play a political role as well. In Islamic countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, political subjects are preached by imams at Friday congregations on a regular basis. In other Islamic countries, imams are usually banned from mentioning political issues.\n\nCountries with a minority Muslim population are more likely than Muslim-majority countries of the Greater Middle East to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation. American mosques host voter registration and civic participation drives that promote involving Muslims, who are often first- or second-generation immigrants, in the political process. As a result of these efforts as well as attempts at mosques to keep Muslims informed about the issues facing the Muslim community, regular mosque attendants are more likely to participate in protests, sign petitions, and otherwise be involved in politics.\n\nNevertheless, a link between political views and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world. Following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in February 2006, imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and Friday prayers as vehicles to call for calm and peace in the midst of widespread violence.\n\nAs they are considered important to the Muslim community, mosques, like other places of worship, can be at the heart of social conflicts. The Babri Mosque was the subject of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was demolished. Before a mutual solution could be devised, the mosque was destroyed on December 6, 1992 as the mosque was built by Babur allegedly on the site of a previous Hindu temple marking the birthplace of Rama. The controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to rioting in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) as well as bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people.\n\nBombings in February 2006 and June 2007 seriously damaged Iraq's al-Askari Mosque and exacerbated existing tensions. Other mosque bombings in Iraq, both before and after the February 2006 bombing, have been part of the conflict between the country's groups of Muslims. However, mosque bombings have not been exclusive to Iraq; in June 2005, a suicide bomber killed at least 19 people at an Afghan Shia mosque near Jade Maivand. In April 2006, two explosions occurred at India's Jama Masjid.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks, several American mosques were targeted in attacks ranging from simple vandalism to arson. Furthermore, the Jewish Defense League was suspected of plotting to bomb the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California. Similar attacks occurred throughout the United Kingdom following the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Outside the Western world, in June 2001, the Hassan Bek Mosque was the target of vandalism and attacks by hundreds of Israelis after a suicide bomber killed 19 people in a night club in Tel Aviv. Although mosquegoing is highly encouraged for men, it is permitted to stay at home when one feels at risk from Islamophobic persecution.\n\nAlthough the Saudi involvement in Sunni mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s, it was not until later in the 20th century that the government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in foreign Sunni mosques. Beginning in the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of Sunni mosques in countries around the world. An estimated US$45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Sunni Islamic schools in foreign countries. \"Ain al-Yaqeen\", a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have contributed to building as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers.\n\nSaudi citizens have also contributed significantly to mosques in the Islamic world, especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, in 1992, mosques in war-torn Afghanistan saw many contributions from Saudi citizens. The King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, California and the Islamic Cultural Center of Italy in Rome represent two of Saudi Arabia's largest investments in foreign mosques as former Saudi king Fahd bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud contributed US$8 million and US$50 million to the two mosques, respectively.\n\nIn the western world, and in the United States in particular, Anti-Muslim sentiment and targeted domestic policy has created challenges for mosques and those looking to build them. There has been government and police surveillance of mosques in the US and local attempts to ban mosques and block constructions, despite data showing that in fact, most Americans opposing banning the building of mosques (79%) and the surveillance of U.S. mosques (63%) as shown in a 2018 study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding.\n\n\"Arab-plan\" or hypostyle mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the Umayyad Dynasty. These mosques have square or rectangular plans with an enclosed courtyard and covered prayer hall. Historically, in the warm Middle Eastern and Mediterranean climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques had flat roofs on prayer halls, which required the use of numerous columns and supports. One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain, the building being supported by over 850 columns. Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer arcades so that visitors can enjoy the shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, the mosques consequently losing popularity.\n\nThe first departure within mosque design started in Persia (Iran). The Persians had inherited a rich architectural legacy from the earlier Persian dynasties, and they began incorporating elements from earlier Parthian and Sassanid designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the Palace of Ardashir and the Sarvestan Palace. Thus, Islamic architecture witnessed the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as \"iwans\". During Seljuq rule, as Islamic mysticism was on the rise, the four-iwan arrangement took form. The four-iwan format, finalized by the Seljuqs, and later inherited by the Safavids, firmly established the courtyard façade of such mosques, with the towering gateways at every side, as more important than the actual buildings themselves. They typically took the form of a square-shaped central courtyard with large entrances at each side, giving the impression of gateways to the spiritual world. The Persians also introduced Persian gardens into mosque designs. Soon, a distinctly Persian style of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later Timurid, and also Mughal, mosque designs.\n\nThe Ottomans introduced central dome mosques in the 15th century. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having a large central dome, a common feature is smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed. This style was heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes. Hajja Soad's mosque took a pyramid shape that is a creative style in Islamic architecture.\n\nThe Faisal Mosque in Islamabad, Pakistan, in a relatively unusual design fuses contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an Arab Bedouin's tent, with its large triangular prayer hall and four minarets. However, unlike traditional mosque design, it lacks a dome. The mosque's architecture is a departure from the long history of South Asian Islamic architecture.\n\nMosques built in Southeast Asia often represent the Indonesian-Javanese style architecture, which are different from the ones found throughout the Greater Middle East. The ones found in Europe and North America appear to have various styles but most are built on Western architectural designs, some are former churches or other buildings that were used by non-Muslims. In Africa, most mosques are old but the new ones are built in imitation of those of the Middle East. This can be seen in the Abuja National Mosque in Nigeria and others.\n\nA common feature in mosques is the minaret, the tall, slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure. The top of the minaret is always the highest point in mosques that have one, and often the highest point in the immediate area. The tallest minaret in the world is located at the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, Morocco. It has a height of and completed in 1993, it was designed by Michel Pinseau.\nThe first mosques had no minarets, and even nowadays the most conservative Islamic movements, like Wahhabis, avoid building minarets, seeing them as ostentatious and hazardous in case of collapse. The first minaret was constructed in 665 in Basra during the reign of the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I. Muawiyah encouraged the construction of minarets, as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with Christian churches with their bell towers. Consequently, mosque architects borrowed the shape of the bell tower for their minarets, which were used for essentially the same purpose—calling the faithful to prayer. The oldest standing minaret in the world is the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, built between the 8th and the 9th century, it is a massive square tower consisting of three superimposed tiers of gradual size and decor.\n\nBefore the five required daily prayers, a \"Mu’adhdhin\" () calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the \"Adhān\" (, Call to Prayer), although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community. The \"adhan\" is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a \"muezzin\" for each prayer to say the \"adhan\" as it is a recommended practice or \"Sunnah\" () of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the \"adhan\" is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The \"Iqâmah\" (), which is similar to the \"adhan\" and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.\nA \"miḥrāb\" (), also spelled as \"mehrab\" is a semicircular niche in the wall of a mosque that indicates the \"qiblah\" (, the direction of the Kaaba) in Mecca, and hence the direction that Muslims should face when praying. The wall in which a \"mihrab\" appears is thus the \"\"qibla\" wall.\" \"Mihrab\"s should not be confused with the \"minbar\" (), which is the raised platform from which an Imam (leader of prayer) addresses the congregation.\n\nThe domes, often placed directly above the main prayer hall, may signify the vaults of the heaven and sky. As time progressed, domes grew, from occupying a small part of the roof near the mihrab to encompassing the whole roof above the prayer hall. Although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere, the Mughals in India popularized onion-shaped domes in South Asia which has gone on to become characteristic of the Arabic architectural style of dome. Some mosques have multiple, often smaller, domes in addition to the main large dome that resides at the center.\n\nThe prayer hall, also known as the \"muṣallá\" (), rarely has furniture; chairs and pews are generally absent from the prayer hall so as to allow as many worshipers as possible to line the room. Some mosques have Islamic calligraphy and Quranic verses on the walls to assist worshippers in focusing on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book, the Quran, as well as for decoration.\nOften, a limited part of the prayer hall is sanctified formally as a masjid in the sharia sense (although the term masjid is also used for the larger mosque complex as well). Once designated, there are onerous limitations on the use of this formally designated masjid, and it may not be used for any purpose other than worship; restrictions that do not necessarily apply to the rest of the prayer area, and to the rest of the mosque complex (although such uses may be restricted by the conditions of the \"waqf\" that owns the mosque).\n\nIn many mosques, especially the early congregational mosques, the prayer hall is in the hypostyle form (the roof held up by a multitude of columns). One of the finest examples of the hypostyle-plan mosques is the Great Mosque of Kairouan (also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in Tunisia.\n\nUsually opposite the entrance to the prayer hall is the \"qiblah\" wall, the visually emphasized area inside the prayer hall. The qiblah wall should, in a properly oriented mosque, be set perpendicular to a line leading to Mecca, the location of the Kaaba. Congregants pray in rows parallel to the qiblah wall and thus arrange themselves so they face Mecca. In the qiblah wall, usually at its center, is the mihrab, a niche or depression indicating the direction of Mecca. Usually the mihrab is not occupied by furniture either. Sometimes, especially during Friday prayers, a raised \"minbar\" or pulpit is located to the side of the mihrab for a \"Khaṭīb\" (), or some other speaker to offer a \"Khuṭbah\" (, Sermon). The mihrab serves as the location where the imam leads the five daily prayers on a regular basis.\n\nAs ritual purification precedes all prayers, mosques often have ablution fountains or other facilities for washing in their entryways or courtyards. However, worshippers at much smaller mosques often have to use restrooms to perform their ablutions. In traditional mosques, this function is often elaborated into a freestanding building in the center of a courtyard. This desire for cleanliness extends to the prayer halls where shoes are disallowed to be worn anywhere other than the cloakroom. Thus, foyers with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques.\n\nModern mosques have a variety of amenities available to their congregants. As mosques are supposed to appeal to the community, they may also have additional facilities, from health clinics to libraries to gymnasiums, to serve the community.\n\nCertain symbols are represented in a mosque's architecture to allude to different aspects of the Islamic religion. One of these feature symbols is the spiral. The \"cosmic spiral\" found in designs and on minarets is a references to heaven as it has \"no beginning and no end\". Mosques also often have floral patterns or images of fruit and vegetables. These are allusions to the paradise after death.\n\nMosques, in accordance with Islamic practices, institute a number of rules intended to keep Muslims focused on worshiping God. While there are several rules, such as those regarding not allowing shoes in the prayer hall, that are universal, there are many other rules that are dealt with and enforced in a variety of ways from mosque to mosque.\n\nAppointment of a prayer leader is considered desirable, but not always obligatory. The permanent prayer leader (imam) must be a free honest individual and is authoritative in religious matters. In mosques constructed and maintained by the government, the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler; in private mosques, however, appointment is made by members of the congregation through majority voting. According to the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, the individual who built the mosque has a stronger claim to the title of imam, but this view is not shared by the other schools.\n\nLeadership at prayer falls into three categories, depending on the type of prayer: five daily prayers, Friday prayer, or optional prayers. According to the Hanafi and Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, appointment of a prayer leader for Friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid. The Shafi'i and Hanbali schools, however, argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation. A slave may lead a Friday prayer, but Muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor. An imam appointed to lead Friday prayers may also lead at the five daily prayers; Muslim scholars agree to the leader appointed for five daily services may lead the Friday service as well.\n\nAll Muslim authorities hold the consensus opinion that only men may lead prayer for men. Nevertheless, women prayer leaders are allowed to lead prayer in front of all-female congregations.\n\nAll mosques have rules regarding cleanliness, as it is an essential part of the worshippers' experience. Muslims before prayer are required to cleanse themselves in an ablution process known as \"wudu\". However, even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying, there are still rules that apply. Shoes must not be worn inside the carpeted prayer hall. Some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer. Congregants and visitors to mosques are supposed to be clean themselves. It is also undesirable to come to the mosque after eating something that smells, such as garlic.\n\nIslam requires that its adherents wear clothes that portray modesty. Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body. Likewise, it is recommended that women at a mosque wear loose clothing that covers to the wrists and ankles, and cover their heads with a \"Ḥijāb\" (), or other covering. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear Middle Eastern clothing associated with Arabic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques.\n\nAs mosques are places of worship, those within the mosque are required to remain respectful to those in prayer. Loud talking within the mosque, as well as discussion of topics deemed disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. In addition, it is disrespectful to walk in front of or otherwise disturb Muslims in prayer. The walls within the mosque have few items, except for possibly Islamic calligraphy, so Muslims in prayer are not distracted. Muslims are also discouraged from wearing clothing with distracting images and symbols so as not to divert the attention of those standing behind them during prayer. In many mosques, even the carpeted prayer area has no designs, its plainness helping worshippers to focus.\n\nThere is nothing written in the Qurʼan about the issue of space in mosques and gender separation. However, traditional rules have segregated women and men. By traditional rules, women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men. In part, this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayerkneeling on the floor, head to the groundmade mixed-gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men. Traditionalists try to argue that Muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque, and they cite a \"ḥadīth\" () in which Muhammad supposedly said: \"The best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses,\" although women were active participants in the mosque started by Muhammad. Muhammad told Muslims not to forbid women from entering mosques. They are allowed to go in. The second Sunni caliph ʻUmar at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be sexually harassed or assaulted by men, so he required them to pray at home. Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.\n\nMany mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in South and Southeast Asia put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of American mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers, such as the Friday Jumuʻah, are mandatory for men but optional for women. Although there are sections exclusively for women and children, the Grand Mosque in Mecca is desegregated.\n\nUnder most interpretations of \"sharia\", non-Muslims are permitted to enter mosques provided that they respect the place and the people inside it. A dissenting opinion and minority view is presented by followers of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, who argue that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances.\n\nThe Quran addresses the subject of non-Muslims, and particularly polytheists, in mosques in two verses in its ninth chapter, Sura At-Tawba. The seventeenth verse of the chapter prohibits those who \"join gods with Allah\"—polytheists—from entering mosques:\nThe twenty-eighth verse of the same chapter is more specific as it only considers polytheists in the Sacred Mosque, the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca:\nAccording to Ahmad ibn Hanbal, these verses were followed to the letter at the times of Muhammad, when Jews and Christians, considered monotheists, were still allowed to the Masjid al-Haram. However, the Umayyad caliph Umar II later forbade non-Muslims from entering mosques, and his ruling remains in practice in present-day Saudi Arabia. Today, the decision on whether non-Muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies. With few exceptions, mosques in the Arabian Peninsula as well as Morocco do not allow entry to non-Muslims. For example, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.\n\nHowever, there are also many other places in the West as well as the Islamic world where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques. Most mosques in the United States, for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month. Many mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community as well as to encourage conversions to Islam.\n\nIn modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mosque and all of Mecca are open only to Muslims. Likewise, the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and the city of Medina that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam. For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of religious affiliation are expected to respect the rules and decorum for mosques.\n\nIn modern Turkey, non-Muslim tourists are allowed to enter any mosque, but there are some strict rules. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes, women must cover their heads; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying Muslims, especially by taking photos of them; no loud talk is allowed; and no references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures, etc.) Similar rules apply to mosques in Malaysia, where larger mosques that are also tourist attractions (such as the Masjid Negara) provide robes and headscarves for visitors who are deemed inappropriately attired.\n\nIn certain times and places, non-Muslims were expected to behave a certain way in the vicinity of a mosque: in some Moroccan cities, Jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque; in 18th-century Egypt, Jews and Christians had to dismount before several mosques in veneration of their sanctity.\n\nThe association of the mosque with education remained one of its main characteristics throughout history, and the school became an indispensable appendage to the mosque. From the earliest days of Islam, the mosque was the center of the Muslim community, a place for prayer, meditation, religious instruction, political discussion, and a school. Anywhere Islam took hold, mosques were established; and basic religious and educational instruction began.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40478368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40478368", "title": "Muki (mythology)", "text": "Muki (mythology)\n\nThe muki (Quechua for asphyxia, also for a goblin who lives in subterranean caves, also spelled \"muqui\" or \"mooqui\") is a goblin-like creature in the mythology of the Central Andes in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. He is known to be a miner and his existence is constrained to underground spaces: The \"muki\" lives inside the mines.\n\nDespite the distance and the isolation of the mining camps, the belief and the description of the \"muki\" is consistent throughout Peru, from the highlands of Puno in the south to Cajamarca in the north. Nonetheless, the names differ: \"chinchiliku\" (Moquegua), \"anchanchu\" or \"janchanchu\" (Puno), \"jusshi\" (Cajamarca) and \"muki\" (Pasco and Andean regions of Bolivia).\n\nThe \"muki\" is considered to be a dwarf due to its height, since it is no taller than 2 feet (0,61 meters). In the traditions of Cerro de Pasco, the \"muki\" is a small brawny creature with a disproportionate body. His head is attached to his body, but he lacks a neck. His voice is deep and husky, not matching his appearance, his long hair is bright blonde, his face is hairy and reddish, with a long white beard. His look is deep, aggressive and hypnotic and his eye reflect the light as if they were made of metal. In some mining traditions, he has two horns that are used to break the rocks and point at the mineral veins. His skin is very pale and he carries a mining lantern. Sometimes he is described as having pointy ears.\n\nAs it is noted above, there is more than one type of \"muki\" in legend. Just like there is diversity in the mining elves at a universal level, there are many varieties of \"muki\" in the underground world of the Andes. They are known for the places where they became visible. The oral traditions of each mine help to identify them by region, thus a \"muki\" can be from Huacracocha, Goyllar, Morococha, El Diamante, Santender, La Mina Tentadora, La Mina Julcani, Excelsior.\n\nFollowing the safety regulations of his work, the \"muki\" wears a helmet, a miner’s outfit and studded boots. In other traditions, he is described as a small elf with a green outfit, sometimes with a very fine vicuña cape or with the waterproof outfit proper of a miner. He usually carries a lantern or a flashlight, depending on the technological level of the mine. He also walks like a duck because his feet are of abnormal size, and sometimes his legs can take the shape of a goose or crow’s.\n\nBut the description of the \"muki\" changes with time. Around the 1930s, he was said to wander the mines while holding a gas lantern and wearing a vicuña poncho. He was described as having two small shiny horns and to speak with a soft voice. Nowadays he has a more updated look: mining outfit, rain boots and a battery flashlight. Sometimes he shape shifts into an animal or a blonde white man to appear to the miners and deceive them.\n\nThe \"muki\" lives in lonely places and their attacks inspire fear in their victims and adversaries. They are known for stealing defenseless children. Elders advise that when dealing with the \"muki\", one should use his/her belt to battle him without succumbing to fear.\n\nThe fusion (syncretism) of the Andean and Christian cultures brought European beliefs into this myth, such that the main victims of these goblins were the morito (unbaptized) children. Or as it is said in the southern regions of Peru, that these unbaptized children are the ones that become \"mukis\" themselves. In some tales, these unbaptized children are kidnapped by the goblins, who live in fig or banana trees, and kept until they turn into goblins too. The skin of the children who spend time with these creatures turns very pale and it is advised to take the victims to church at once so they can receive the sacrament.\n\nThe belief in the \"muki\" comes from old Andean traditions about demons and small creatures who inhabit the Ukhu Pacha (“world of below”) and the miners need to explain many of the extraordinary daily occurrences of their lives.\n\nThe \"muki\" can be by himself or in groups, but they are known to prefer living on their own. They live in a timeless world of eternal darkness and they don’t age, as if they were not affected by the pass of time. The \"muki\" likes to whistle loudly, and thus warn of danger to the miners of their liking.\n\nThe \"muki\" is a goblin with a lot of power: he can make the metal veins appear and disappear, sense the moods and emotions of the miners, help with the miner’s work by softening or hardening the metal veins, etc. He is known to help miners and sometimes to make pacts with them. He gravitates towards discreet and honest people, who will fulfill their promises and not share the details of their interaction with him.\n\nMany stories coincide on the fact that it is possible to capture the Mooqui and make a pact with him. Very often he offers to do the miners’ work for some coca, alcohol or the company of a woman, as that helps him feel less lonely. Yet, the outcome tends to be tragic due to the miner rarely being able to do as promised. When this occurs, the \"muki\" takes the miner’s life.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55066", "title": "Nanjing Massacre", "text": "Nanjing Massacre\n\nThe Nanjing Massacre, or Rape of Nanjing, was an episode of mass murder and mass rape committed by Japanese troops against the residents of Nanjing (Nanking), then the capital of the Republic of China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the Postal romanization system used at the time, the city's name was transliterated as \"Nanking\", and the event called the Nanking Massacre or Rape of Nanking.\n\nThe massacre occurred over a period of six weeks starting on December 13, 1937, the day that the Japanese captured Nanjing. During this period, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army murdered Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants who numbered an estimated 40,000 to over 300,000, and perpetrated widespread rape and looting.\n\nSince most Japanese military records on the killings were kept secret or destroyed shortly after the surrender of Japan in 1945, historians have been unable to accurately estimate the death toll of the massacre. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo estimated in 1946 that over 200,000 Chinese were killed in the incident. China's official estimate is more than 300,000 dead based on the evaluation of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947. The death toll has been actively contested among scholars since the 1980s.\n\nThe event remains a contentious political issue and a stumbling block in Sino-Japanese relations. The Chinese government has been accused of exaggerating aspects of the massacre such as the death toll, while historical negationists and Japanese nationalists go as far as claiming the massacre was fabricated for propaganda purposes. The controversy surrounding the massacre remains a central issue in Japanese relations with other Asia-Pacific nations as well, such as South Korea.\n\nAlthough the Japanese government has admitted to the killing of a large number of non-combatants, looting, and other violence committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after the fall of Nanjing, and Japanese veterans who served there have confirmed that a massacre took place, a small but vocal minority within both the Japanese government and society have argued that the death toll was military in nature and that no such crimes ever occurred. Denial of the massacre and revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of Japanese nationalism. In Japan, public opinion of the massacre varies, but few deny outright that the event occurred.\n\nIn August 1937, the Japanese army invaded Shanghai where they met strong resistance and suffered heavy casualties. The battle was bloody as both sides faced attrition in urban hand-to-hand combat. By mid-November the Japanese had captured Shanghai with the help of naval bombardment. The General Staff Headquarters in Tokyo initially decided not to expand the war due to heavy casualties and low troop morale. Nevertheless, on December 1, headquarters ordered the Central China Area Army and the 10th Army to capture Nanjing, then-capital of the Republic of China.\n\nAfter losing the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek knew that the fall of Nanjing was a matter of time. He and his staff realized that they could not risk the annihilation of their elite troops in a symbolic but hopeless defense of the capital. To preserve the army for future battles, most of it was withdrawn. Chiang's strategy was to follow the suggestion of his German advisers to draw the Japanese army deep into China and use China's vast territory as a defensive strength. Chiang planned to fight a protracted war of attrition to wear down the Japanese in the hinterland of China.\n\nIn a press release to foreign reporters, Tang Shengzhi announced the city would not surrender and would fight to the death. Tang gathered about 100,000 soldiers, largely untrained, including Chinese troops who had participated in the Battle of Shanghai. To prevent civilians from fleeing the city, he ordered troops to guard the port, as instructed by Chiang Kai-shek. The defense force blocked roads, destroyed boats, and burnt nearby villages, preventing widespread evacuation. The Chinese government left for relocation on December 1, and the president left on December 7, leaving the fate of Nanjing to an International Committee led by John Rabe.\n\nIn an attempt to secure permission for this cease-fire from Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, a German national by the name of John Rabe who was living in Nanjing and had been acting as the Chairman of the Nanjing International Safety Zone Committee, boarded the USS Panay on December 9. From this gunboat, Rabe sent two telegrams. The first was through an American ambassador in Hankow to Chiang, asking that Chinese forces \"undertake no military operations\" within Nanjing.\n\nThe second telegram was sent through Shanghai to Japanese military leaders, advocating for a three-day cease-fire so the Chinese could withdraw from the city. The following day, on December 10, Rabe got his answer from the Generalissimo. The American ambassador in Hankow replied that although he supported Rabe's proposal for a cease-fire, Chiang did not. Rabe says that the ambassador also \"sent us a separate confidential telegram telling us that he has been officially informed by the Foreign Ministry in Hankow that our understanding that General Tang agreed to a three-day armistice and the withdrawal of his troops from Nanjing is mistaken, and moreover that Chiang Kai-shek has announced that he is not in a position to accept such an offer.\"\n\nThis rejection of the Committee's cease-fire plan, in Rabe's mind, sealed the fate of the city. Nanjing had been constantly bombed for days and the Chinese troops that remained there were disheartened and had taken to drinking before the city's inevitable fall. On December 11, Rabe found that Chinese soldiers were still residing in areas of the Safety Zone, meaning that it became an intended target for Japanese attack despite the majority were innocent civilians. Rabe commented on how efforts to remove these Chinese troops failed and Japanese soldiers began to lob grenades into the refugee zone.\n\nAlthough the massacre is generally described as having occurred over a six-week period after the fall of Nanjing, the crimes committed by the Japanese army were not limited to that period. Many atrocities were reported to have been committed as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing.\n\nAccording to one Japanese journalist embedded with Imperial forces at the time, \"The reason that the [10th Army] is advancing to Nanjing quite rapidly is due to the tacit consent among the officers and men that they could loot and rape as they wish.\"\n\nNovelist Tatsuzō Ishikawa vividly described how the 16th Division of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force committed atrocities on the march between Shanghai and Nanjing in his novel \"Ikiteiru Heitai\" (Living Soldiers), which was based on interviews that Ishikawa conducted with troops in Nanjing in January 1938.\n\nPerhaps the most notorious atrocity was a killing contest between two Japanese officers as reported in the \"Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun\" and the English language \"Japan Advertiser\". The contest – a race between the two officers to see which could kill 100 people first using only a sword – was covered much like a sporting event with regular updates on the score over a series of days. In Japan, the veracity of the newspaper article about the contest was the subject of ferocious debate for several decades starting in 1967.\n\nIn 2000, historian Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi concurred with certain Japanese scholars who had argued that the contest was a concocted story, with the collusion of the soldiers themselves for the purpose of raising the national fighting spirit.\n\nIn 2005, a Tokyo district judge dismissed a suit by the families of the lieutenants, stating that \"the lieutenants admitted the fact that they raced to kill 100 people\" and that the story cannot be proven to be clearly false. The judge also ruled against the civil claim of the plaintiffs because the original article was more than 60 years old. The historicity of the event remains disputed in Japan.\n\nThe Nanjing garrison force set fire to buildings and houses in the areas close to Xiakuan to the north as well as in the environs of the eastern and southern city gates. Targets within and outside of the city walls – such as military barracks, private homes, the Chinese Ministry of Communication, forests and even entire villages – were completely burnt down, at an estimated value of 20 to 30 million (1937) US dollars.\n\nMany Westerners were living in the city at that time, conducting trade or on missionary trips. As the Japanese army approached Nanjing, most of them fled the city, leaving 27 foreigners. Five of these were journalists who remained in the city a few days after it was captured, leaving the city on December 16. Fifteen of the remaining 22 foreigners formed a committee, called the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone in the western quarter of the city.\n\nGerman businessman John Rabe was elected as its leader, in part because of his status as a member of the Nazi Party and the existence of the German-Japanese bilateral Anti-Comintern Pact. The Japanese government had previously agreed not to attack parts of the city that did not contain Chinese military forces, and the members of the Committee managed to persuade the Chinese government to move their troops out of the area. The Nanking Safety Zone was demarcated through the use of Red Cross Flags\n\nOn December 1, 1937, Nanjing Mayor Ma Chao-chun ordered all Chinese citizens remaining in Nanjing to move into the \"Safety Zone\". Many fled the city on December 7, and the International Committee took over as the \"de facto\" government of Nanjing.\n\nIn a memorandum for the palace rolls, Hirohito singled Prince Yasuhiko Asaka out for censure as the one imperial kinsman whose attitude was \"not good\". He assigned Asaka to Nanjing as an opportunity to make amends. It appears that Hirohito had never learned about, or had refused to admit, Asaka's role in the ensuing massacre.\n\nOn December 5, Asaka left Tokyo by plane and arrived at the front three days later. He met with division commanders, lieutenant-generals Kesago Nakajima and Heisuke Yanagawa, who informed him that the Japanese troops had almost completely surrounded 300,000 Chinese troops in the vicinity of Nanjing and that preliminary negotiations suggested that the Chinese were ready to surrender.\n\nPrince Asaka is alleged to have issued an order to \"kill all captives\", thus providing official sanction for the crimes which took place during and after the battle. Some authors record that Prince Asaka signed the order for Japanese soldiers in Nanjing to \"kill all captives\". Others assert that lieutenant colonel Isamu Chō, Asaka's aide-de-camp, sent this order under the Prince's sign-manual without the Prince's knowledge or assent. Nevertheless, even if Chō took the initiative, Asaka was nominally the officer in charge and gave no orders to stop the carnage.\nWhile the extent of Prince Asaka's responsibility for the massacre remains a matter of debate, the ultimate sanction for the massacre and the crimes committed during the invasion of China were issued in Emperor Hirohito's ratification of the Japanese army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners on August 5, 1937.\n\nThe Japanese military continued to move forward, breaching the last lines of Chinese resistance, and arriving outside the city gates of Nanjing on December 9.\n\nAt noon on December 9, the Japanese military dropped leaflets into the city, urging the city of Nanjing to surrender within 24 hours, promising \"no mercy\" if the offer is refused.\n\nIn the meanwhile, members of the Committee contacted Tang and proposed a plan for three-day cease-fire, during which the Chinese troops could withdraw without fighting while the Japanese troops would stay in their present position.\n\nJohn Rabe boarded the U.S. gunboat on December 9 and sent two telegrams, one to Chiang Kai-shek by way of the American ambassador in Hankow, and one to the Japanese military authority in Shanghai.\n\nThe Japanese awaited an answer to their demand for surrender but no response was received from the Chinese by the deadline on December 10. General Iwane Matsui waited another hour before issuing the command to take Nanjing by force. The Japanese army mounted its assault on the Nanjing walls from multiple directions; the SEF's 16th Division attacked three gates on the eastern side, the 6th Division of the 10A launched its offensive on the western walls, and the SEF's 9th Division advanced into the area in-between.\n\nOn December 12, under heavy artillery fire and aerial bombardment, General Tang Sheng-chi ordered his men to retreat. What followed was nothing short of chaos. Some Chinese soldiers stripped civilians of their clothing in a desperate attempt to blend in, and many others were shot by the Chinese supervisory unit as they tried to flee.\n\nOn 13 December, the 6th and the 116th Divisions of the Japanese Army were the first to enter the city, facing little military resistance. Simultaneously, the 9th Division entered nearby Guanghua Gate, and the 16th Division entered the Zhongshan and Taiping gates. That same afternoon, two small Japanese Navy fleets arrived on both sides of the Yangtze River.\n\nJapanese troops pursued the retreating Chinese army units, primarily in the Xiakuan area to the north of the city walls and around the Zijin Mountain in the east. Although most sources suggest that the final phase of the battle consisted of a one-sided slaughter of Chinese troops by the Japanese, some Japanese historians maintain that the remaining Chinese military still posed a serious threat to the Japanese. Prince Yasuhiko Asaka told a war correspondent later that he was in a very perilous position when his headquarters was ambushed by Chinese forces that were in the midst of fleeing from Nanjing east of the city. On the other side of the city, the 11th Company of the 45th Regiment encountered some 20,000 Chinese soldiers who were making their way from Xiakuan.\n\nThe Japanese army conducted its mopping-up operation both inside and outside the Nanjing Safety Zone. Since the area outside the safety zone had been almost completely evacuated, the mopping-up effort was concentrated in the safety zone. The safety zone, an area of 3.85 square kilometres, was packed with the remaining population of Nanjing. The Japanese army leadership assigned sections of the safety zone to some units to separate alleged plain-clothed soldiers from the civilians. The number of Chinese soldiers in plain clothes that were executed are estimated to be around 4,000.\n\nEyewitness accounts of Westerners and Chinese present at Nanjing in the weeks after the fall of the city say that, over the course of six weeks following the fall of Nanjing, Japanese troops engaged in mass rape, murder, theft, arson, and other war crimes. Some of these primary accounts, including the diaries of John Rabe and American Minnie Vautrin, came from foreigners who opted to stay behind to protect the Chinese civilians from harm. Other accounts include first-person testimonies of Nanjing Massacre survivors, eyewitness reports of journalists (both Western and Japanese), as well as the field diaries of military personnel. American missionary John Magee stayed behind to provide a 16 mm film documentary and first-hand photographs of the Nanjing Massacre.\n\nA group of foreign expatriates headed by Rabe had formed a 15-man International Committee on November 22 and mapped out the Nanjing Safety Zone in order to safeguard civilians in the city. The city population of Nanjing inflated drastically during the mid-1930s, as many refugees fled from the Japanese aggression in the north. Rabe and American missionary Lewis S. C. Smythe, secretary of the International Committee and a professor of sociology at the University of Nanking, recorded the actions of the Japanese troops and filed complaints with the Japanese embassy.\n\nIn 1937, the \"Osaka Mainichi Shimbun\" and its sister newspaper, the \"Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun\", covered a contest between two Japanese officers, Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division. The two men were described as vying to be the first to kill 100 people with a sword before the capture of Nanjing. From Jurong to Tangshan (two cities in Jiangshu Province, China), Mukai had killed 89 people while Noda had killed 78 people. The contest continued because neither had killed 100 people. By the time they had arrived at Zijin Mountain, Noda had killed 105 people while Mukai had killed 106 people. Both officers supposedly surpassed their goal during the heat of battle, making it impossible to determine which officer had actually won the contest. Therefore, according to journalists Asami Kazuo and Suzuki Jiro, writing in the \"Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun\" of December 13, they decided to begin another contest to kill 150 people. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Mukai and Noda were both arrested and tried as war criminals, and both of them were found guilty and executed by shooting.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East estimated that, 20,000 women, including some children and the elderly, were raped during the occupation. A large number of rapes were done systematically by the Japanese soldiers as they went from door to door, searching for girls, with many women being captured and gang raped. The women were often killed immediately after being raped, often through explicit mutilation or by penetrating vaginas with bayonets, long sticks of bamboo, or other objects. Young children were not exempt from these atrocities and were cut open to allow Japanese soldiers to rape them.\n\nOn 19 December 1937, the Reverend James M. McCallum wrote in his diary:\nI know not where to end. Never I have heard or read such brutality. Rape! Rape! Rape! We estimate at least 1,000 cases a night and many by day. In case of resistance or anything that seems like disapproval, there is a bayonet stab or a bullet ... People are hysterical ... Women are being carried off every morning, afternoon and evening. The whole Japanese army seems to be free to go and come as it pleases, and to do whatever it pleases.\n\nOn March 7, 1938, Robert O. Wilson, a surgeon at the university hospital in the Safety Zone administrated by the United States, wrote in a letter to his family, \"a conservative estimate of people slaughtered in cold blood is somewhere about 100,000, including of course thousands of soldiers that had thrown down their arms\".\n\nHere are two excerpts from his letters of 15 and 18 December 1937 to his family:The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief. Two bayoneted corpses are the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning or reason and killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the hospital.\n\nLet me recount some instances occurring in the last two days. Last night the house of one of the Chinese staff members of the university was broken into and two of the women, his relatives, were raped. Two girls, about 16, were raped to death in one of the refugee camps. In the University Middle School where there are 8,000 people the Japs came in ten times last night, over the wall, stole food, clothing, and raped until they were satisfied. They bayoneted one little boy of eight who [had] five bayonet wounds including one that penetrated his stomach, a portion of omentum was outside the abdomen. I think he will live. \n\nIn his diary kept during the aggression against the city and its occupation by the Imperial Japanese Army, the leader of the Safety Zone, John Rabe, wrote many comments about Japanese atrocities. For 17 December:Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital ... Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College ... alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.\n\nThere are also accounts of Japanese troops forcing families to commit incestuous acts. Sons were forced to rape their mothers, and fathers were forced to rape their daughters.\n\nFollowing the capture of Nanjing, a massacre, which was perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), led to the deaths of up to 60,000 residents in the city, a figure difficult to precisely calculate due to the many bodies deliberately burnt, buried in mass graves, or deposited in the Yangtze River by the IJA. Japanese ultra-nationalists have strongly disputed such death tolls, with some claiming that no more than several hundred civilians were killed during the massacre. B. Campbell, in an article published in the journal \"Sociological Theory\", has described the Nanjing Massacre as a genocide, given the fact that residents were still slaughtered \"en masse\" during the aftermath, despite the successful and certain outcome in battle. On 13 December 1937, John Rabe wrote in his diary:It is not until we tour the city that we learn the extent of destruction. We come across corpses every 100 to 200 yards. The bodies of civilians that I examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had presumably been fleeing and were shot from behind. The Japanese march through the city in groups of ten to twenty soldiers and loot the shops ... I watched with my own eyes as they looted the café of our German baker Herr Kiessling. Hempel's hotel was broken into as well, as [was] almost every shop on Chung Shang and Taiping Road.\n\nOn 10 February 1938, Legation Secretary of the German Embassy, Rosen, wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend John Magee to recommend its purchase.\n\nDuring the Japanese reign of terror in Nanking – which, by the way, continues to this day to a considerable degree – the Reverend John Magee, a member of the American Episcopal Church Mission who has been here for almost a quarter of a century, took motion pictures that eloquently bear witness to the atrocities committed by the Japanese ... One will have to wait and see whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed, as they have indicated, in stopping the activities of their troops, which continue even today.\n\nOn December 13, about 30 soldiers came to a Chinese house at No. 5 Hsing Lu Koo in the southeastern part of Nanking, and demanded entrance. The door was open by the landlord, a Mohammedan named Ha. They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs. Ha, who knelt before them after Ha's death, begging them not to kill anyone else. Mrs. Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her. Mrs. Hsia was dragged out from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1 year old baby. After being stripped and raped by one or more men, she was bayoneted in the chest, and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina. The baby was killed with a bayonet. Some soldiers then went to the next room, where Mrs. Hsia's parents, aged 76 and 74, and her two daughters aged 16 and 14 [were]. They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them. The soldiers killed her with a revolver. The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed. The two girls were then stripped, the elder being raped by 2–3 men, and the younger by 3. The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina. The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother. The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 7–8, who was also in the room. The last murders in the house were of Ha's two children, aged 4 and 2 respectively. The older was bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword.\nOn 5 February 2009, the Japanese Supreme Court ordered Shyudo Higashinakano and the publisher \"Tendensha\" to pay four million yen in damages to Mrs. Shuqin Xia, who claims to be the 7- or 8-year-old girl who appears in Magee's film. Higashinakano had claimed in his book, \"Thorough Review of Nanjing Massacre\", that she and the girl were different persons, and that she was not a witness of the Nanjing massacre, but he was unable to prove this at trial.\nPregnant women were targeted for murder, as their stomachs were often bayoneted, sometimes after rape. Tang Junshan, survivor and witness to one of the Japanese army's systematic mass killings, testified:\nThe seventh and last person in the first row was a pregnant woman. The soldier thought he might as well rape her before killing her, so he pulled her out of the group to a spot about ten meters away. As he was trying to rape her, the woman resisted fiercely ... The soldier abruptly stabbed her in the belly with a bayonet. She gave a final scream as her intestines spilled out. Then the soldier stabbed the fetus, with its umbilical cord clearly visible, and tossed it aside.\n\nAccording to Navy veteran Sho Mitani, \"The Army used a trumpet sound that meant 'Kill all Chinese who run away'\". Thousands were led away and mass-executed in an excavation known as the \"Ten-Thousand-Corpse Ditch\", a trench measuring about 300 m long and 5 m wide. Since records were not kept, estimates regarding the number of victims buried in the ditch range from 4,000 to 20,000. However, most scholars and historians consider the number to be more than 12,000 victims.\n\nThe Hui people, a minority Chinese group, the majority of them Muslim, suffered as well during the massacre. One mosque was found destroyed and others found to be \"filled with dead bodies\". Hui volunteers and imams buried over a hundred of their dead following Muslim ritual.\n\nOn 5 August 1937, the Deputy Minister of Military of Japan notified Japanese Troops in Shanghai that the army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners (\"Riku Shi Mitsu No.198\"). The directive also advised staff officers to no longer to use the term Prisoner of War.\n\nSoon after the fall of the city, Japanese troops made a thorough search for Chinese soldiers and summarily arrested thousands of young Chinese men. Many were taken to the Yangtze River, where they were machine-gunned to death. What was probably the single largest massacre of Chinese troops, the Straw String Gorge Massacre, occurred along the banks of the Yangtze River on December 18. For most of the morning, Japanese soldiers tied the POWs' hands together. At dusk, the soldiers divided POWs into four columns and opened fire. Unable to escape, the POWs could only scream and thrash desperately. It took an hour for the sounds of death to stop and even longer for the Japanese to bayonet each individual. The majority of the bodies were dumped directly into the Yangtze River.\n\nThe Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at Taiping Gate and murdered them. The victims were blown up with landmines, then doused with petrol and set on fire. The survivors were killed with bayonets.\n\nAmerican news correspondents F. Tillman Durdin and Archibald Steele reported seeing corpses of massacred Chinese soldiers forming mounds six feet high at the Nanjing Yijiang gate in the north. Durdin, who worked for \"The New York Times\", toured Nanjing before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. He would later state that he had seen tank guns used on bound soldiers.\n\nTwo days later, in his report to \"The New York Times\", Durdin stated that the alleys and street were filled with the dead, amongst them women and children. Durdin stated \"[i]t should be said that certain Japanese units exercised restraint and that certain Japanese officers tempered power with generosity and commission,\" but continued \"the conduct of the Japanese army as a whole in Nanjing was a blot on the reputation of their country\".\"\n\nRalph L. Phillips, a missionary, testified to the U.S. State Assembly Investigating Committee, that he was \"forced to watch while the Japs disembowled a Chinese soldier\" and \"roasted his heart and liver and ate them\".\n\nOne-third of the city was destroyed as a result of arson. According to reports, Japanese troops torched newly built government buildings as well as the homes of many civilians. There was considerable destruction to areas outside the city walls. Soldiers pillaged from the poor and the wealthy alike. The lack of resistance from Chinese troops and civilians in Nanjing meant that the Japanese soldiers were free to divide up the city's valuables as they saw fit. This resulted in the widespread looting and burglary.\n\nOn 17 December, chairman John Rabe wrote a complaint to Kiyoshi Fukui, second secretary of the Japanese Embassy. The following is an excerpt:\nIn other words, on the 13th when your troops entered the city, we had nearly all the civilian population gathered in a Zone in which there had been very little destruction by stray shells and no looting by Chinese soldiers even in full retreat ... All 27 Occidentals in the city at that time and our Chinese population were totally surprised by the reign of robbery, raping and killing initiated by your soldiers on the 14th. All we are asking in our protest is that you restore order among your troops and get the normal city life going as soon as possible. In the latter process we are glad to cooperate in any way we can. But even last night between 8 and 9 p.m. when five Occidental members of our staff and Committee toured the Zone to observe conditions, we did not find any single Japanese patrol either in the Zone or at the entrances! \n\nThe Japanese troops did respect the Zone to an extent; until the Japanese occupation, no shells entered that part of the city except a few stray shots. During the chaos following the attack of the city, some were killed in the Safety Zone, but the crimes that occurred in the rest of the city were far greater by all accounts.\n\nThe Japanese soldiers committed actions in the Safety Zone that were part of the larger Nanjing Massacre. The International Committee appealed a number of times to the Japanese army, with Rabe using his credentials as a Nazi Party member, but to no avail. Rabe wrote that, from time to time, the Japanese would enter the Safety Zone at will, carry off a few hundred men and women, and either summarily execute them or rape and then kill them.\n\nBy February 5, 1938, the International Committee had forwarded to the Japanese embassy a total of 450 cases of murder, rape, and general disorder by Japanese soldiers that had been reported after the American, British and German diplomats had returned to their embassies.\n\nIt is said that Rabe rescued between 200,000 and 250,000 Chinese people.\n\nJonathan Spence writes \"there is no obvious explanation for this grim event, nor can one be found. The Japanese soldiers, who had expected easy victory, instead had been fighting hard for months and had taken infinitely higher casualties than anticipated. They were bored, angry, frustrated, tired. The Chinese women were undefended, their menfolk powerless or absent. The war, still undeclared, had no clear-cut goal or purpose. Perhaps all Chinese, regardless of sex or age, seemed marked out as victims.\"\n\nOn December 18, 1937, as General Iwane Matsui began to comprehend the full extent of the rape, murder, and looting in the city, he grew increasingly dismayed. He reportedly told one of his civilian aides: \"I now realize that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese friends who have fled from Nanjing and of the future of the two countries, I cannot but feel depressed. I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to rejoice about this victory ... I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents. Now, in the winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep emotion, to a million innocent people.\"\n\nOn New Year's Day, over a toast he confided to a Japanese diplomat: \"My men have done something very wrong and extremely regrettable.\"\n\nIn late January 1938, the Japanese army forced all refugees in the Safety Zone to return home, immediately claiming to have \"restored order\". After the establishment of the \"weixin zhengfu\" (the collaborating government) in 1938, order was gradually restored in Nanjing and atrocities by Japanese troops lessened considerably.\n\nOn 18 February 1938, the Nanjing Safety Zone International Committee was forcibly renamed \"Nanking International Rescue Committee\", and the Safety Zone effectively ceased to function. The last refugee camps were closed in May 1938.\n\nIn February 1938 both Prince Asaka and General Matsui were recalled to Japan. Matsui returned to retirement, but Prince Asaka remained on the Supreme War Council until the end of the war in August 1945. He was promoted to the rank of general in August 1939, though he held no further military commands.\n\nEstimates of the number of victims vary based on the definitions of the geographical range and the duration of the event.\n\nThe extent of the atrocities is debated, with numbers ranging from some Japanese claims of several hundred, to the Chinese claim of a non-combatant death toll of 300,000. Historian Tokushi Kasahara states \"more than 100,000 and close to 200,000, or maybe more\", referring to his own book. This estimation includes the surrounding area outside of the city of Nanjing, which is objected to by a Chinese researcher (the same book, p. 146). Hiroshi Yoshida concludes \"more than 200,000\" in his book. Tomio Hora writes of 50,000–100,000 deaths.\n\nMainstream scholars consider figures from 40,000 to over 300,000 to be an accurate estimate. According to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, estimates made at a later date indicate that the total number of civilians and prisoners of war murdered in Nanjing and its vicinity during the first six weeks of the Japanese occupation was up to 200,000. These estimates are borne out by the figures of burial societies and other organizations, which testify to over 155,000 buried bodies. These figures also do not take into account those persons whose bodies were destroyed by burning, drowning or other means, or whose bodies were interred in mass graves.\n\nAccording to the verdict of the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal on 10 March 1947, there are \"more than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof. Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organizations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims.\" However, this estimate includes an accusation that the Japanese Army murdered 57,418 Chinese POWs at Mufushan, though the latest research indicates that between 4,000 and 20,000 were massacred, and it also includes the 112,266 corpses allegedly buried by the Chongshantang, a charitable association, though today mainstream historians agree that the Chongshantang's records were at least greatly exaggerated if not entirely fabricated. Bob Wakabayashi concludes from this that estimates of over 200,000 are not credible. Ikuhiko Hata considers the number 300,000 to be a \"symbolic figure\" representative of China's wartime suffering and not a figure to be taken literally.\n\nSome researchers estimate that between 40,000 and 60,000 people were killed, which corresponds to the figures from three sources; one is the Red Army's official journal of the time, Hangdibao and another is that of Miner Searle Bates of the International Safety Zone Committee, and the third is the aforementioned figure written by John Rabe in a letter. John Rabe, Chairman of the International Committee and Nanjing Safety Zone, estimated that between 50,000 and 60,000 (civilians) were killed. However, Erwin Wickert, the editor of \"The diaries of John Rabe\", points out that \"It is likely that Rabe's estimate is too low, since he could not have had an overview of the entire municipal area during the period of the worst atrocities. Moreover, many troops of captured Chinese soldiers were led out of the city and down to the Yangtze, where they were summarily executed. But, as noted, no one actually counted the dead.\"\n\nThe casualty count of 300,000 was first promulgated in January 1938 by Harold Timperley, a journalist in China during the Japanese invasion, based on reports from contemporary eyewitnesses. Other sources, including Iris Chang's \"The Rape of Nanking\", also conclude that the death toll reached 300,000. In December 2007, newly declassified U.S. government archive documents revealed that a telegraph by the U.S. ambassador to Germany in Berlin sent one day after the Japanese army occupied Nanjing, stated that he heard the Japanese Ambassador in Germany boasting that Japanese army killed 500,000 Chinese people as the Japanese army advanced from Shanghai to Nanjing. According to the archives research \"The telegrams sent by the U.S. diplomats [in Berlin] pointed to the massacre of an estimated half a million people in Shanghai, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Wuxi and Changzhou\".\n\nIn the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed.\n\nThe most conservative viewpoint is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few km of the city known as the Safety Zone, where the civilians gathered after the invasion. Many Japanese historians have insisted that during the Japanese invasion there were only 200,000–250,000 citizens in Nanjing as reported by John Rabe, to argue that the PRC's estimate of 300,000 deaths is an exaggeration.\n\nMany historians include a much larger area around the city. Including the Xiaguan district (the suburbs north of Nanjing, about 31 km in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city, the population of greater Nanjing was between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just before the Japanese occupation. Some historians also include six counties around Nanjing, known as the Nanjing Special Municipality.\n\nThe duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The Battle of Nanking ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanjing. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say that the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks. Historians who define the Nanjing Massacre as having started from the time that the Japanese Army entered Jiangsu province push the beginning of the massacre to around mid-November to early December (Suzhou fell on November 19), and stretch the end of the massacre to late March 1938.\n\nTo many Japanese scholars, post-war estimations were distorted by \"victor's justice\", when Japan was condemned as the sole aggressor. They believed the 300,000 toll typified a \"Chinese-style exaggeration\" with disregard for evidence. Yet, in China, this figure has come to symbolize the justice, legality, and authority of the post-war trials condemning Japan as the aggressor.\n\nJapanese historians, depending on their definition of the geographical and time duration of the killings, give wide-ranging estimates for the number of massacred civilians, from several thousand to upwards of 200,000. The lowest estimate by a Japanese historian is 40,000.\n\nChinese language sources tend to place the figure of massacred civilians upwards of 200,000.\n\nJapanese sources assert that there was a population of only 200,000 in Nanjing, thus making the 300,000 death toll impossible. In 2003, Zhang Lianhong, professor of Nanjing Massacre Research Center in Nanjing Normal University, published an article in the \"Beijing Daily\" in which he used historical facts to show that the population of Nanjing urban area was between 367,000 and 467,000, and the overall Nanjing population was between 535,000 and 635,000, to refute the assertion of a population of 200,000.\n\nShortly after the surrender of Japan, the primary officers in charge of the Japanese troops at Nanjing were put on trial. General Matsui was indicted before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for \"deliberately and recklessly\" ignoring his legal duty \"to take adequate steps to secure the observance and prevent breaches\" of the Hague Convention. Hisao Tani, the lieutenant general of the 6th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army in Nanjing, was tried by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.\n\nOther Japanese military leaders in charge at the time of the Nanjing Massacre were not tried. Prince Kan'in, chief of staff of the Imperial Japanese Army during the massacre, had died before the end of the war in May 1945. Prince Asaka was granted immunity because of his status as a member of the imperial family. Isamu Chō, the aide to Prince Asaka, and whom some historians believe issued the \"kill all captives\" memo, had committed suicide during the Battle of Okinawa.\n\nOn May 1, 1946, SCAP officials interrogated Prince Asaka, who was the ranking officer in the city at the height of the atrocities, about his involvement in the Nanjing Massacre and the deposition was submitted to the International Prosecution Section of the Tokyo tribunal. Asaka denied the existence of any massacre and claimed never to have received complaints about the conduct of his troops.\n\nThe prosecution began the Nanjing phase of its case in July 1946. Dr. Robert O. Wilson, a surgeon and a member of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone, took the witness stand first. Other members of the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone who took the witness stand included Miner Searle Bates and John Magee. George A. Fitch, Lewis S. C. Smythe, and James McCallum filed affidavits with their diaries and letters.\n\nAnother piece of evidence that was submitted to the tribunal was Harold Timperley's telegram regarding the Nanjing Massacre which had been intercepted and decoded by the Americans on January 17, 1938. One of the books by Hsü, Documents of the Nanjing Safety Zone, was also adduced in court. According to Matsui's own diary, one day after he made the ceremonial triumphal entry into the city on December 17, 1937, he instructed the chiefs of staff from each division to tighten military discipline and try to eradicate the sense of disdain for Chinese people among their soldiers.\n\nOn February 7, 1938, Matsui delivered a speech at a memorial service for the Japanese officers and men of the Shanghai Expeditionary Force who were killed in action. In front of the high-ranking officers, Domei News Agency reported, he emphasized the necessity to \"put an end to various reports affecting the prestige of the Japanese troops\".\n\nThe entry for the same day in Matsui's diary read, \"I could only feel sadness and responsibility today, which has been overwhelmingly piercing my heart. This is caused by the Army's misbehaviors after the fall of Nanjing and failure to proceed with the autonomous government and other political plans.\"\n\nMatsui's defence varied between denying the mass-scale atrocities and evading his responsibility for what had happened. Eventually he ended up making numerous conflicting statements. In the interrogation in Sugamo prison preceding the trial Matsui admitted that he heard about the many outrages committed by his troops from Japanese diplomats when he entered Nanjing on December 17, 1937.\n\nIn court, he contradicted the earlier testimony and told the judges that he was not \"officially\" briefed at the consulate about the evildoings, presumably to avoid admitting any contact with the consulate officials such as Second Secretary (later Acting Consul-General) Fukui Kiyoshi and Attaché Fukuda Tokuyasu who received and dealt with the protests filed by the International Committee.\n\nIn the same interrogation session before the trial Matsui said one officer and three low-ranking soldiers were court-martialled because of their misbehavior in Nanjing and the officer was sentenced to death. In his affidavit Matsui said he ordered his officers to investigate the massacre and to take necessary action. In court, however, Matsui said that he did not have jurisdiction over the soldiers' misconduct since he was not in the position of supervising military discipline and morals.\n\nMatsui asserted that he had never ordered the execution of Chinese POWs. He further argued that he had directed his army division commanders to discipline their troops for criminal acts, and was not responsible for their failure to carry out his directives. At trial, Matsui went out of his way to protect Prince Asaka by shifting blame to lower ranking division commanders.\n\nKōki Hirota, who had been the Foreign Minister when Japan conquered Nanjing, was convicted of participating in \"the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy\" (count 1), waging \"a war of aggression and a war in violation of international laws, treaties, agreements and assurances against the Republic of China\" (count 27) and count 55. Matsui was convicted by a majority of the judges at the Tokyo tribunal who ruled that he bore ultimate responsibility for the \"orgy of crime\" at Nanjing because, \"He did nothing, or nothing effective, to abate these horrors.\"\nOrganized and wholesale murder of male civilians was conducted with the apparent sanction of the commanders on the pretext that Chinese soldiers had removed their uniforms and were mingling with the population. Groups of Chinese civilians were formed, bound with their hands behind their backs, and marched outside the walls of the city where they were killed in groups by machine gun fire and with bayonets. --- From Judgment of the International Military Tribunal\n\nOn November 12, 1948, Matsui and Hirota, along with five other convicted Class-A war criminals, were sentenced to death by hanging. Eighteen others received lesser sentences. The death sentence imposed on Hirota, a six-to-five decision by the eleven judges, shocked the general public and prompted a petition on his behalf, which soon gathered over 300,000 signatures but did not succeed in commuting the Minister's sentence.\n\nGeneral Hisao Tani was sentenced to death by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal.\n\n\nOn October 9, 2015, Documents of Nanjing Massacre have been listed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\nChina and Japan have both acknowledged the occurrence of wartime atrocities. Disputes over the historical portrayal of these events continue to cause tensions between Japan on one side and China and other East Asian countries on the other side.\n\nBefore the 1970s, China did relatively little to draw attention to the Nanjing massacre. In her book \"Rape of Nanking,\" Iris Chang asserted that the politics of the Cold War encouraged Chairman Mao to stay relatively silent about Nanjing in order to keep a trade relationship with Japan.\n\nThe major waves of Japanese treatment of these events have ranged from total cover-up during the war, confessions and documentation by the Japanese soldiers during the 1950s and 1960s, minimization of the extent of the Nanjing Massacre during the 1970s and 1980s, official Japanese government distortion and rewriting of history during the 1980s, and total denial of the occurrence of the Nanjing Massacre by some government officials in 1990.\n\nThe debate concerning the massacre took place mainly in the 1970s. During this time, the Chinese government's statements about the event were attacked by the Japanese because they were said to rely too heavily on personal testimonies and anecdotal evidence. Aspersions were cast regarding the authenticity and accuracy of burial records and photographs presented in the Tokyo War Crime Court, which the Japanese government claimed were fabrications by the Chinese government, artificially manipulated or incorrectly attributed to the Nanjing Massacre.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Katsuichi Honda wrote a series of articles for the \"Asahi Shimbun\" on war crimes committed by Japanese soldiers during World War II (such as the Nanjing Massacre). The publication of these articles triggered a vehement response from Japanese right-wingers regarding the Japanese treatment of the war crimes. In response, Shichihei Yamamoto and Akira Suzuki wrote two controversial yet influential articles which sparked the negationist movement.\n\nIn 1984, in an attempt to refute the allegations of war crimes in Nanjing, the Japanese Army Veterans Association (Kaikosha) interviewed former Japanese soldiers who had served in the Nanjing area from 1937 to 1938. Instead of refuting the allegations, the interviewed veterans confirmed that a massacre had taken place and openly described and admitted to taking part in the atrocities. The results of the survey were published in the association's magazine, \"Kaiko\", in 1985 along with an admission and apology that read, \"Whatever the severity of war or special circumstances of war psychology, we just lose words faced with this mass illegal killing. As those who are related to the prewar military, we simply apologize deeply to the people of China. It was truly a regrettable act of barbarity.\"\n\nOn August 15, 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the Surrender of Japan, the Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama gave the first clear and formal apology for Japanese actions during the war. He apologized for Japan's aggression and the great suffering that it inflicted in Asia.\n\nHe offered his apology to all survivors and to the relatives and friends of the victims. That day, the prime minister and the Japanese Emperor Akihito pronounced statements of mourning at Tokyo's Nippon Budokan. The emperor offered his condolences and expressed the hope that such atrocities would never be repeated. Iris Chang, author of \"The Rape of Nanking\", criticized Murayama for not providing the written apology that had been expected. She said that the people of China \"don't believe that an... unequivocal and sincere apology has ever been made by Japan to China\" and that a written apology from Japan would send a better message to the international community.\n\nIn May 1994, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano called the Nanjing Massacre a \"fabrication\".\n\nOn June 19, 2007, a group of around 100 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers again denounced the Nanjing Massacre as a fabrication, arguing that there was no evidence to prove the allegations of mass killings by Japanese soldiers. They accused Beijing of using the alleged incident as a \"political advertisement\".\nOn February 20, 2012, Takashi Kawamura, mayor of Nagoya, told a visiting delegation from Nanjing that the massacre \"probably never happened\". Two days later he defended his remarks, saying, \"Even since I was a national Diet representative, I have said [repeatedly] there was no [Nanjing] massacre that resulted in murders of several hundred thousands of people.\" On April 1, 2013, Kawamura said his position remained unchanged when the issue came up during an election debate.\n\nOn February 24, 2012, Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara said that he also believes that the Nanjing massacre never happened. He reportedly claims it would have been impossible to kill so many people in such a short period of time. He believes the actual death toll was 10,000.\n\nOn February 3, 2014, Naoki Hyakuta, a member of the board of governors of Japan's public broadcasting company, NHK, was quoted as saying the massacre never occurred. He said that there were isolated incidents of brutality but no widespread atrocity, and criticized the Tokyo Trials figure of 200,000.\n\nThe memory of the Nanjing Massacre has been a stumbling block in Sino-Japanese relations since the early 1970s. Bilateral exchanges on trade, culture and education have increased greatly since the two countries normalized their bilateral relations and Japan became China's most important trading partner. Trade between the two nations is worth over $200 billion annually. Despite this, many Chinese people still have a strong sense of mistrust and animosity toward Japan that originates from the memory of Japanese war crimes such as the Nanjing Massacre. This sense of mistrust is strengthened by the belief that Japan is unwilling to admit to and apologize for the atrocities.\n\nTakashi Yoshida described how changing political concerns and perceptions of the \"national interest\" in Japan, China, and the U.S. have shaped collective memory of the Nanjing massacre. Yoshida contended that over time the event has acquired different meanings to different people. People from mainland China saw themselves as the victims. For Japan, it was a question they needed to answer, but were reluctant to do so because they too identified themselves as victims after the A-bombs. The U.S., which served as the melting pot of cultures and is home to descendants of members of both of Chinese and Japanese cultures, took up the mantle of investigator for the victimized Chinese. Yoshida has argued that the Nanjing Massacre has figured in the attempts of all three nations as they work to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.\n\nMany Japanese prime ministers have visited the Yasukuni Shrine, a shrine for Japanese war deaths up until the end of the Second World War, which includes war criminals that were involved in the Nanjing Massacre. In the museum adjacent to the shrine, a panel informs visitors that there was no massacre in Nanjing, but that Chinese soldiers in plain clothes were \"dealt with severely\". In 2006 former Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi made a pilgrimage to the shrine despite warnings from China and South Korea. His decision to visit the shrine regardless sparked international outrage. Although Koizumi denied that he was trying to glorify war or historical Japanese militarism, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Koizumi of \"wrecking the political foundations of China-Japan relations\". An official from South Korea said they would summon the Tokyo ambassador to protest.\n\nYoshida asserts that \"Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies.\"\n\nIn Japan, the Nanjing Massacre touches upon national identity and notions of \"pride, honor and shame\". Yoshida argues that \"Nanking crystallizes a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or ... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression.\" Recognizing the Nanjing Massacre as such can be viewed in some circles in Japan as \"Japan bashing\" (in the case of foreigners) or \"self-flagellation\" (in the case of Japanese).\n\nThe government of Japan believe it can not be denied that the killing of a large number of noncombatants, looting and other acts by Japanese army occurred. However, the actual number of victims is hard to be determined according to government of Japan. In the 2010 Japan-China Joint History Research Committee meeting, scholars from the Japanese side set the maximum possible number of civilian victims at 200,000, with estimates of around 40,000 or 20,000. The Chinese scholars of the committee maintained that at least 300,000 were killed. Range of death toll estimated by Japanese historians are from tens of thousand to 200,000.\n\nAccording to a brief reference to Nanjing at the Yasukuni museum in Tokyo, the Japanese general in charge gave his men maps showing foreign settlements and a civilian \"safety zone\", and ordered them to maintain strict military discipline. The visitor is left to assume they did. The museum notes only that \"Chinese soldiers disguised in civilian clothes, which numbered around 4000 were severely prosecuted\".\n\nThis nationalist view does not, however, represent a widely shared understanding of what happened at Nanjing, as illustrated by Japanese textbooks' rather different treatment of the atrocity. While the books' take on Nanjing is stilted and feels like the product of a committee, in various versions they acknowledge the deaths of thousands of Chinese including women and children, as well as looting, arson and assaults by Japanese soldiers. They do not mention sexual assaults.\n\n\"During this period, when the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing it killed a large number of Chinese and carried out looting, arson and assaults. In regard to the number of victims of this Nanjing Massacre ... the Tokyo (War Crime) Trials later found it in excess of 200,000, and prosecuted Japan's responsibility severely\", reads one Japanese textbook.\n\nAnother history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, which had been approved by the government in 2001, attempts to whitewash Japan's war record during the 1930s and early 1940s. It referred to the Nanjing massacre as an \"incident\", and glossed over the issue of comfort women. Indeed, there is only one sentence that refers to this event: \"they [the Japanese troops] occupied that city in December.\"\n\nThe Nanjing massacre has emerged as one fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity. Modern Chinese (including citizens of the PRC, Taiwan, and overseas) will refer to the Nanjing Massacre to explain certain stances they hold or ideas they have; this 'national unifying event' holds true to middle-school educated peasants and to senior government officials alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2007, the PRC government published the names of 13,000 people who were killed by Japanese troops in the Nanking Massacre. According to Xinhua News Agency, it is the most complete record to date. The report consists of eight volumes and was released to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of the massacre. It also lists the Japanese army units that were responsible for each of the deaths and states the way in which the victims were killed. Zhang Xianwen, editor-in-chief of the report, states that the information collected was based on \"a combination of Chinese, Japanese and Western raw materials, which is objective and just and is able to stand the trial of history\". This report formed part of a 55-volume series (Collection of Historical Materials of Nanjing Massacre () about the massacre.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

Following a fire in 1837 they were rebuilt under the direction of Vasily Stasov. Frequently used as the palace ballrooms, they formed a processional route, and were the focus of the imperial court. In 1915, the last Tsar, Nicholas II, had the enfilade transformed into a military hospital. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the enfilade, along with the remainder of the building, has been used as a series of exhibition halls of the State Hermitage Museum.\n\nThe Palace was originally built in 1732, as an official residence for the Tsaritsa Anna I of Russia and designed by the architect Francesco Rastrelli. The Tsaritsa found the small Winter palace of Peter the Great insufficiently grand, and had taken over the neighbouring, and grander, palace of Admiral General Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin, this she had rebuilt to form her own Winter Palace.\n\nDuring the reign of Anna's successor, Elizabeth, Rastrelli, still working to his original plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale—the present Baroque Winter Palace (externally the palace seen today); the Tsaritsa wanted the palace to exceed in beauty and size all other European royal palaces. The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of national honour to the Empress, and to pay for it taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for Russia's wars. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles. By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, an imperial Palace truly worthy of the name was nearing completion; at that time, the Neva enfilade contained five the principal state rooms. Work continued during the short reign of Elizabeth's nephew Peter III and on into the reign of Peter's widow Catherine the Great.\n\nDuring Catherine the Great's reign, Neoclassicism came into vogue, and the new Tsaritsa was a great admirer. Rastrelli was dismissed and new architects working in the new fashions were employed. During this period, the original ornate rococo decoration of the palace was replaced with the more simple and stark neoclassicism which is a hallmark of the Palace today. The Neva enfilade was completely redesigned between 1790–93 by the architect Giacomo Quarenghi. Taking in the floor above, he transformed the original five rooms into three vast halls: the Concert Hall, the Great Hall and the Great Ante-Room. They were decorated in classical style with faux marbre and columns supporting life size statues.\n\nFollowing a disastrous fire which destroyed most of the Winter Palace's interiors in 1837, the halls were recreated in similar style by the architect Vasily Stasov.\n\nUntil 1905, during the winter months, the Tsar and Tsaritsa were traditionally resident in the palace; this was the period of the Saint Petersburg social season and the first floor piano nobile would be in near constant use. The remainder of the year the imperial couple resided elsewhere, and the palace housed the staff and the officials of the monarchy, who occupied the ground and second floors. The halls of the enfilade were designed to form an important part in the ceremonial life of the court, not just as ballrooms for festivities but for processional use. From the entrance to the private apartments at the western end of the Concert Hall, Imperial processions would proceed in state through the enfilade to the Jordan Staircase or turn and continue through the eastern state rooms.\n\nBefore 1917, during ceremonies and functions, access to the various hall of the enfilade was dictated by rank. Those who were most important were positioned closest to the beginning of an imperial procession in the Concert Hall, the lesser exalted in the Nicholas Hall and the least important in the Great Ante-Room. The imperial court was very conscious of rank. This was particularly obvious amongst the ladies attached to the court. Etiquette dictated that all these ladies, regardless of age, wore white silk dresses with a low decolletage and a red or olive green velvet train with gold embroidery. On their heads they wore red or green kokoshniks studded with jewels. While other women present were allowed coloured dresses, the train and kokoshnik was mandatory court dress.\n\nFurther classification was given to the women's ranks by indication of whether they were \"Dames a Portrait\" or \"Demoiselles d'Honneur.\" The former, higher ranking class wore the Tsaritsa's portrait mounted in diamonds on their left breast, while the latter wore the Tsaritsa's monogram surrounded by diamonds. In between these two ranks were the \"Dames du Palais\" who like the \"Dames a portrait\" wore olive green, the lower ranking \"Demoiselles d'Honneur\" wore red.\n\nWhile red and green were the colours of the Tsar and Tsaritsa, further colour was added by the women attached to the numerous Grand Duchesses. Each Grand Duchess had her own colour, and all the ladies attached to the suite would wear it. Queen Victoria's foreign secretary, writing to her in 1894 of a state procession through the enfilade, recorded of the Grand Duchesses' colours that one \"is a particularly hideous shade of orange.\" The Foreign Secretary then went on to describe the \"8,000 to 10,000\" people present in the Winter palace's \"interminable halls\", and a particular \"Demoiselle d'Honneur\" who was \"so old that she was propped up against a wall.\" Overall, the splendour and size of the Winter Palace and its colourful and bejewelled ladies failed to impress the Foreign Secretary for he reported to the Queen that the Grand Church \"was not very large\" and that the assembled imperial court had \"an absence of beauty as compared with that seen at one of Your Majesty's drawing rooms.\" He did, however, concede that the Queen's granddaughter looked \"simply magnificent...the perfection of what one would imagine an Empress of Russia on her way to the altar would be.\" That wedding of Queen Victoria's granddaughter to the Tsar was to be one of the final huge gatherings at the Palace, however. The palace's state rooms had had their swan song during the reign of Alexander II between 1855 and 1881.\n\nAlexander II was the last Tsar to use the Winter Palace extensively not only for governing the empire but also entertaining. Of special note were the Bals des Palmiers given at the palace. On these occasions, 100 palm trees were brought from the hot houses at Tsarskoe Selo; these would be scattered throughout the enfilade, and around them supper tables seating 15 people would be constructed. During the course of the evening the Tsar would make the rounds of the tables, eating a piece of bread or fruit at each, in order that the guests may say that they had dined with the Tsar.\n\nFollowing the assassination of Alexander II, the Winter Palace was never truly inhabited again. The new Tsar Alexander III was informed by his security advisers that it was impossible to make the Winter Palace secure. The Imperial family then moved to the seclusion of the Palace of Gatchina, some 40 miles from St. Petersburg. When in St. Petersburg, the Imperial family resided at the Anichkov Palace, but the Winter Palace was used for official functions. Alexander III, however, was not a lover of society and, when using the Winter Palace, preferred playing bridge in an anteroom to dancing. While most St Petersburg balls did not conclude until 6am, at the Winter Palace, from 2am the Tsar would dismiss the musicians from the orchestra one by one, until only the pianist and a fiddler remained, by which time his guests had taken the hint and gone.\n\nThe final imperial reception at the Winter Palace was a themed, fancy dress ball celebrating the reign of Alexei I, which took place on 22 January 1903. The Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovitch recalled the occasion as \"the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low.\" The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as Alexei I and the Tsaritsa as Maria Miloslavskaya, all dressed in rich 17th century attire posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the Kremlin, for what was to be their final photograph together. The following year Russia was at war, and the Tsar and Tsaritsa abandoned St Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Tsaritsa to be decadent and immoral) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo.\n\nThe Concert Hall has an architrave seemingly supported by paired Corinthian columns, the capitals of which serve as plinthes for life-size statues of the various muses. It is decorated in a similar loose Baroque influenced neoclassical style as the Great Anteroom at the western end of the Enfilade. It is indicative of the size of the Winter Palace, that whereas most other royal palaces such as Buckingham Palace, Queluz and Sanssouci all have music rooms, the Winter Palace has a concert hall. This is because it was the intention of the builders of the Winter Palace that their palace should outshine all other royal palaces. In fact Catherine the Great, for whom the enfilade was designed, was delighted when she bought an art collection for the Winter palace that Frederick the Great, the creator of Sanssouci could not afford.\n\nSo it was, that from this vast double height hall that solemn Imperial processions began. On such occasions the Concert Hall would be reserved for the highest ranking guest and members of the court. At a given moment, four \"massive Ethiopians\", the Tsar's official bodyguards, fantastically dressed in scarlet trousers, gold jackets, white turbans and curved shoes, would ceremonially open the doors from the private Arabian Hall (\"2 on plan above\") and the imperial procession would pass through the enfilade. The procession through would be preceded by the Marshal of the Court carrying a gold staff seven feet high topped with a diamond crown. On less formal occasions, as the hall's name suggests, it was used for concerts, balls and grand receptions.\n\nToday, as part of the State Hermitage Museum, the room houses the silver reliquary of St Alexander Nevsky, formerly at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. The reliquary was brought to the Palace in 1922, where it was set up to obscure the now blocked, grand doors from which the Imperial family used to enter from the private apartments.\n\nThe Nicholas Hall is located in the centre of the enfilade. The largest room in the palace at , it was originally simply known as the Great Hall, and was the setting for many imperial balls and receptions. Following the death of Nicholas I in 1855, a large equestrian portrait of the late tsar was hung from the wall, and the hall was renamed the Nicholas Hall.\n\nWhile in the same architectural rhythm as the preceding Concert Hall, the architecture is more severe. Here, the architrave is immediately below the ceiling. The only ornamentation is the carving of the corinthian capitals and the entablature.\n\nWriting in 1902, the Duchess of Sutherland and the American-born Duchess of Marlborough, herself the chatelaine of one of Britain's great palaces, described their impressions of a court ball held in the Nicholas Hall.\n\nIronically, the Duchess of Sutherland then went on to describe the hungry peasants outside the gates - \"... all the want of penury of the peasants and this strange show to keep up the prestige of the aristocracy and the autocracy of one gentle, quiet little man.\"\n\nDuring World War I, the hall was used as an infirmary. It was restored in 1957, when the State Hermitage Museum was under the direction of Mikhail Artamonov.\n\nThe Great Ante-Chamber of the Winter Palace is the principal entrance hall to the state apartments of the palace. The first room of the piano nobile at the head of the Jordan staircase, it formed the processional exit of the Neva enfilade, and presented a procession with a choice, either to descend the staircase and exit the palace, which happened once a year for the ceremony of blessing the waters of the Neva, or to turn right and continue through the next enfilade to the small throne room (\"5\") or continue on through the Armorial Hall (\"6\") and Military Gallery (\"7\") to the Great Throne Room (\"8\") or Grand Church (\"9\").\n\nToday, as part of the State Hermitage Museum the halls of the Neva enfilade are preserved as \"palace interiors\" containing only minimal furniture they are used for exhibitions. Many of the mirrors which lined the interior walls opposite each window have been concealed behind exhibition boards which creates a utilitarian feel to the halls, and one has to look upwards to the carved captals, statues, great chandeliers and moulded ceilings to gain an impression of the hall's glacial grandeur and classical architecture.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

Selling for 15 cents (later raised to a quarter), 47 issues were published in all, with press runs averaging 8000 to 10,000 copies. Subscriptions were free to prisoners and soldiers.\n\n\"Old Mole\" was produced by a floating staff of 20 to 30 volunteers, with no more than 4 paid staffers. The staff was split evenly between men and women, almost all white, most of them college graduates and many connected with nearby Harvard University. About half of the paper's news coverage was local. One of its founders was Michael Ansara.

Packaging also refers to the process of designing, evaluating, and producing packages. Packaging can be described as a coordinated system of preparing goods for transport, warehousing, logistics, sale, and end use. Packaging contains, protects, preserves, transports, informs, and sells. In many countries it is fully integrated into government, business, institutional, industrial, and personal use.\n\nPackage labeling (American English) or labelling (British English) is any written, electronic, or graphic communication on the package or on a separate but associated label.\n\nThe first packages used the natural materials available at the time: baskets of reeds, wineskins (bota bags), wooden boxes, pottery vases, ceramic amphorae, wooden barrels, woven bags, etc. Processed materials were used to form packages as they were developed: for example, early glass and bronze vessels. The study of old packages is an important aspect of archaeology.\n\nThe earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a Persian traveler visiting markets in Cairo noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold.\n\nThe use of tinplate for packaging dates back to the 18th century. The manufacture of tinplate was long a monopoly of Bohemia; in 1667 Andrew Yarranton, an English engineer, and Ambrose Crowley brought the method to England where it was improved by ironmasters including Philip Foley. By 1697, John Hanbury had a rolling mill at Pontypool for making \"Pontypoole Plates\". The method pioneered there of rolling iron plates by means of cylinders enabled more uniform black plates to be produced than was possible with the former practice of hammering.\n\nTinplate boxes first began to be sold from ports in the Bristol Channel in 1725. The tinplate was shipped from Newport, Monmouthshire. By 1805, 80,000 boxes were made and 50,000 exported. Tobacconists in London began packaging snuff in metal-plated canisters from the 1760s onwards.\n\nWith the discovery of the importance of airtight containers for food preservation by French inventor Nicholas Appert, the tin canning process was patented by British merchant Peter Durand in 1810. After receiving the patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the Royal Navy.\n\nThe progressive improvement in canning stimulated the 1855 invention of the can opener. Robert Yeates, a cutlery and surgical instrument maker of Trafalgar Place West, Hackney Road, Middlesex, UK, devised a claw-ended can opener with a hand-operated tool that haggled its way around the top of metal cans. In 1858, another lever-type opener of a more complex shape was patented in the United States by Ezra Warner of Waterbury, Connecticut.\n\nSet-up boxes were first used in the 16th century and modern folding cartons date back to 1839. The first corrugated box was produced commercially in 1817 in England. Corrugated (also called pleated) paper received a British patent in 1856 and was used as a liner for tall hats. Scottish-born Robert Gair invented the pre-cut paperboard box in 1890—flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair's invention came about as a result of an accident: as a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, he was once printing an order of seed bags, and the metal ruler, normally used to crease bags, shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes.\n\nCommercial paper bags were first manufactured in Bristol, England, in 1844, and the American Francis Wolle patented a machine for automated bag-making in 1852.\n\nPackaging advancements in the early 20th century included Bakelite closures on bottles, transparent cellophane overwraps and panels on cartons. These innovations increased processing efficiency and improved food safety. As additional materials such as aluminum and several types of plastic were developed, they were incorporated into packages to improve performance and functionality.\nIn 1952, Michigan State University became the first university in the world to offer a degree in Packaging Engineering.\n\nIn-plant recycling has long been common for producing packaging materials. Post-consumer recycling of aluminum and paper-based products has been economical for many years: since the 1980s, post-consumer recycling has increased due to curbside recycling, consumer awareness, and regulatory pressure.\nMany prominent innovations in the packaging industry were developed first for military use. Some military supplies are packaged in the same commercial packaging used for general industry. Other military packaging must transport materiel, supplies, foods, etc. under severe distribution and storage conditions. Packaging problems encountered in World War II led to Military Standard or \"mil spec\" regulations being applied to packaging, which was then designated \"military specification packaging\". As a prominent concept in the military, mil spec packaging officially came into being around 1941, due to operations in Iceland experiencing critical losses, ultimately attributed to bad packaging. In most cases, mil spec packaging solutions (such as barrier materials, field rations, antistatic bags, and various shipping crates) are similar to commercial grade packaging materials, but subject to more stringent performance and quality requirements.\n\n, the packaging sector accounted for about two percent of the gross national product in developed countries. About half of this market was related to food packaging.\n\nPackaging and package labeling have several objectives\n\n\n\nPackaging may be of several different types. For example, a transport package or distribution package can be the shipping container used to ship, store, and handle the product or inner packages. Some identify a consumer package as one which is directed toward a consumer or household.\n\nCustom packaging is an evolutionary use of modern materials. Thermoforming and vacuum forming allow for expanded capabilities for large trays, displays, and specialty needs. Thermoforming is a method which uses vacuum, heat, and pressure to form the desired material into a shape determined by its mold. This type of packaging is often used by the cosmetic and medical industry.\n\nPackaging may be described in relation to the type of product being packaged: medical device packaging, bulk chemical packaging, over-the-counter drug packaging, retail food packaging, military materiel packaging, pharmaceutical packaging, etc.\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to categorize packages by layer or function: \"primary\", \"secondary\", etc.\n\nThese broad categories can be somewhat arbitrary. For example, depending on the use, a shrink wrap can be primary packaging when applied directly to the product, secondary packaging when used to combine smaller packages, or tertiary packaging when used to facilitate some types of distribution, such as to affix a number of cartons on a pallet.\n\nMany types of symbols for package labeling are nationally and internationally standardized. For consumer packaging, symbols exist for product certifications (such as the FCC and TÜV marks), trademarks, proof of purchase, etc. Some requirements and symbols exist to communicate aspects of consumer rights and safety, for example the CE marking or the estimated sign that notes conformance to EU weights and measures accuracy regulations. Examples of environmental and recycling symbols include the recycling symbol, the recycling code (which could be a resin identification code), and the \"Green Dot\". Food packaging may show food contact material symbols. In the European Union, products of animal origin which are intended to be consumed by humans have to carry standard, oval-shaped EC identification and health marks for food safety and quality insurance reasons.\n\nBar codes, Universal Product Codes, and RFID labels are common to allow automated information management in logistics and retailing. Country of Origin Labeling is often used. Some products might use QR codes or similar matrix barcodes. Packaging may have visible registration marks and other printing calibration and troubleshooting cues.\n\nTechnologies related to shipping containers are identification codes, bar codes, and electronic data interchange (EDI). These three core technologies serve to enable the business functions in the process of shipping containers throughout the distribution channel. Each has an essential function: identification codes either relate product information or serve as keys to other data, bar codes allow for the automated input of identification codes and other data, and EDI moves data between trading partners within the distribution channel.\n\nElements of these core technologies include UPC and EAN item identification codes, the SCC-14 (UPC shipping container code), the SSCC-18 (Serial Shipping Container Codes), Interleaved 2-of-5 and UCC/EAN-128 (newly designated GS1-128) bar code symbologies, and ANSI ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT EDI standards.\n\nSmall parcel carriers often have their own formats. For example, United Parcel Service has a MaxiCode 2-D code for parcel tracking.\n\nRFID labels for shipping containers are also increasingly used. A Wal-Mart division, Sam's Club, has also moved in this direction and is putting pressure on its suppliers to comply.\n\nShipments of hazardous materials or dangerous goods have special information and symbols (labels, placards, etc.) as required by UN, country, and specific carrier requirements. On transport packages, standardized symbols are also used to communicate handling needs. Some are defined in the ASTM D5445 \"Standard Practice for Pictorial Markings for Handling of Goods\" and ISO 780 \"Pictorial marking for handling of goods\".\n\nPackage design and development are often thought of as an integral part of the new product development process. Alternatively, development of a package (or component) can be a separate process, but must be linked closely with the product to be packaged.\nPackage design starts with the identification of all the requirements: structural design, marketing, shelf life, quality assurance, logistics, legal, regulatory, graphic design, end-use, environmental, etc. The design criteria, performance (specified by package testing), completion time targets, resources, and cost constraints need to be established and agreed upon. Package design processes often employ rapid prototyping, computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing and document automation.\n\nAn example of how package design is affected by other factors is its relationship to logistics. When the distribution system includes individual shipments by a small parcel carrier, the sorting, handling, and mixed stacking make severe demands on the strength and protective ability of the transport package. If the logistics system consists of uniform palletized unit loads, the structural design of the package can be designed to meet those specific needs, such as vertical stacking for a longer time frame. A package designed for one mode of shipment may not be suited to another.\n\nWith some types of products, the design process involves detailed regulatory requirements for the packaging. For example, any package components that may contact foods are designated food contact materials.\nToxicologists and food scientists need to verify that such packaging materials are allowed by applicable regulations. Packaging engineers need to verify that the completed package will keep the product safe for its intended shelf life with normal usage. Packaging processes, labeling, distribution, and sale need to be validated to assure that they comply with regulations that have the well being of the consumer in mind.\n\nSometimes the objectives of package development seem contradictory. For example, regulations for an over-the-counter drug might require the package to be tamper-evident and child resistant: These intentionally make the package difficult to open. The intended consumer, however, might be handicapped or elderly and unable to readily open the package. Meeting all goals is a challenge.\n\nPackage design may take place within a company or with various degrees of external packaging engineering: independent contractors, consultants, vendor evaluations, independent laboratories, contract packagers, total outsourcing, etc. Some sort of formal project planning and project management methodology is required for all but the simplest package design and development programs. An effective quality management system and Verification and Validation protocols are mandatory for some types of packaging and recommended for all.\n\nPackage development involves considerations of sustainability, environmental responsibility, and applicable environmental and recycling regulations. It may involve a life cycle assessment\nwhich considers the material and energy inputs and outputs to the package, the packaged product (contents), the packaging process, the logistics system, waste management, etc. It is necessary to know the relevant regulatory requirements for point of manufacture, sale, and use.\n\nThe traditional “three R’s” of reduce, reuse, and recycle are part of a waste hierarchy which may be considered in product and package development.\n\n\nDevelopment of sustainable packaging is an area of considerable interest to standards organizations, governments, consumers, packagers, and retailers.\n\nChoosing packaging machinery includes an assessment of technical capabilities, labor requirements, worker safety, maintainability, serviceability, reliability, ability to integrate into the packaging line, capital cost, floorspace, flexibility (change-over, materials, multiple products, etc.), energy requirements, quality of outgoing packages, qualifications (for food, pharmaceuticals, etc.), throughput, efficiency, productivity, ergonomics, return on investment, etc.\n\nPackaging machinery can be:\n\nEfforts at packaging line automation increasingly use programmable logic controllers and robotics.\n\nPackaging machines may be of the following general types:\n\n\n\n"}

The allegation was that it was an \"inside job,\" as Tandwa was an employee of the bank. It looked like Tandwa was a victim, but he was actually working with the bank robbers.\n\nThe first appellant also contended that his right to a fair trial had been violated in that his counsel had been incompetent, had given him bad advice, and had conducted himself obstructively. In particular, he claimed that he had not been properly informed about the consequences of not testifying, and that his counsel had misled him on the legal position in this regard.\n\nThe court held that the right to legal representation meant a right to representation that was competent and of a quality and nature that ensured that the trial was indeed fair.\n\nIt also followed that an accused had the right to represent himself, and if the unwanted or inept advice of counsel unfairly thwarted the exercise of that right, the accused's right to a fair trial would have been infringed.\n\nThe court held that the evidence in favour of the State was very strong and the accused's allegations were so weak, contradictory and inherently improbable that they could be rejected on affidavit without further enquiry.\n\nFurthermore, it was held that it was inherently improbable that a well-educated accused with experience of testifying in previous proceedings would not either insist on testifying, as previously agreed, or complain at the first opportunity about having been unjustly thwarted in his wish to do so\n\nTherefore the appeals were dismissed.\n"}

{"id": "690034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690034", "title": "Superstar Billy Graham", "text": "Superstar Billy Graham\n\nEldridge Wayne Coleman (born June 7, 1943) is an American retired professional wrestler currently signed to WWE under a Legends Contract. An iconic figure in professional wrestling, he worked under the ring name \"Superstar\" Billy Graham and gained recognition for his tenure as the WWWF Heavyweight Champion in 1977–1978. As an award-winning bodybuilder, he was a training partner and close friend of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is most remembered for revolutionizing the interview and physique aspects of the professional wrestling industry, and for his charismatic performance style. Some of his wrestling protégés include Hulk Hogan, Jesse Ventura, and Ric Flair.\n\nWayne Coleman was born into a working-class family in Phoenix, Arizona on June 7, 1943. His father was from Mississippi, and his mother, who also claimed Cherokee ancestry, was from Arkansas. Coleman was attracted to weight lifting in the fifth grade. As a teenager he was an avid reader of bodybuilding magazines, his idols being Steve Reeves and John Grimek. As a teenager, he became a devout Christian and traveled to religious revivals where he incorporated feats of strength into his sermons.\n\nColeman was a shot put champion in high school. He also dabbled in amateur and professional boxing, participating in the 1959 Golden Gloves. At age 26, he tried out for the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders but was traded to the Montreal Alouettes. He played in only a couple of games. In between football engagements, he worked as a bouncer in various nightclubs in Phoenix, New York and Los Angeles. After tearing his Achilles tendon, he decided to pursue a career in professional wrestling.\n\nIn 1961 Coleman was the winner of the West Coast division of the Mr. Teenage America bodybuilding contest (Frank Zane winning in the East Coast division), and his photo appeared soon after in Bob Hoffman's \"Strength and Fitness\" magazine. Coleman began to train intensively in 1968 at Gold's Gym in Santa Monica, where he worked out with Dave Draper, Franco Columbu and Arnold Schwarzenegger. At this time he was able to bench press 605 lbs (the world record, held by his friend Pat Casey, was 616 lbs). One of Coleman's photo shoots with Schwarzenegger featured that year in Joe Weider's \"Muscle Fitness\" magazine.\n\nWhen Coleman decided to become a professional wrestler two years later, he had the inspiration of marrying wrestling to bodybuilding. As a wrestler he weight-trained continuously, and in 1975 prepared for the World Bodybuilding Guild's Pro. Mr. America contest in New York City, where his 22-inch biceps won first place in the Best Developed Arms division. At the peak of his wrestling career in 1977, Coleman weighed 275 lbs. From 1978 he gained more weight and in 1980, at 325 lbs, he took part in the World's Strongest Man competition in Great Gorge, New Jersey. He finished seventh in this contest in spite of injuring himself in one of the events. On December 6 of the same year Coleman hosted the U.S. Invitational Powerlifting Championship in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nIn 1969, Coleman was encouraged by professional wrestler Bob Lueck to train with Stu Hart for the latter's Stampede Wrestling promotion. He trained under Hart in Calgary before debuting on January 16, 1970 in a match with Dan Kroffat. After wrestling briefly under his real name, Coleman traveled back to the United States in May, wrestling for a few months with Dr. Jerry Graham, Brick Darrow, Rick Cahill and Ron Pritchard in Arizona before he and Jerry Graham joined the National Wrestling Alliance's Los Angeles promotion (run by Mike LeBell) as a tag team the following August. He changed his ring name to Billy Graham, as a tribute to the famous evangelist of the same name. Later, while wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida, the name would serve both as his ring name and to make him the (kayfabe) youngest brother of Jerry and the other Graham Brothers (Eddie and Luke).\n\nIn late December 1970 Graham went north to join Roy Shire's NWA San Francisco promotion, working with Pat Patterson (his tag-team partner), Ray Stevens, Cyclone Negro, and Peter Maivia. Graham's nearly two-year run in central California included a stint wrestling in Hawaii in February and March 1972. It was during his Californian period that Graham developed a new aspect of his character; before a match he would stage an arm wrestling contest, encouraging public challenges to his title of \"Arm Wrestling Champion of the World\".\n\nOn October 2, 1972, Graham premiered in Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association (AWA) based in Minneapolis, where he took on the moniker \"Superstar\". As he toured the north-central states and adjacent areas of Canada, Graham feuded with Gagne, The Crusher, The Bruiser, Wahoo McDaniel, Billy Robinson, Ken Patera and Ivan Koloff, the latter becoming his tag-team partner. By this time, Graham was integrating into his performances not only arm wrestling contests but also weightlifting challenges (mainly involving ex-Olympian Ken Patera) and posing routines.\n\nIn September and October 1974 Graham took leave from the AWA to join the International Wrestling Alliance's \"Super Wide Series\" tour of Japan, where he fought such local stars as Mighty Inoue, Animal Hamaguchi and Rusher Kimura. Following his return from Japan, Graham formed a tag team with Dusty Rhodes. He left the AWA and returned to the NWA in May 1975, signing up with Red Bastien's Dallas-based promotion for five months and taking the local \"Brass Knucks\" title from Mad Dog Vachon on August 8. For most of October, Graham worked for the Mid Atlantic promotion in North Carolina, standing in for Ric Flair, who had just been injured in a plane crash.\n\nGraham made his in–ring debut in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on October 25, 1975, in a tag-team match at the Boston Garden in which he and Spiros Arion defeated WWWF Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino and Dominic De Nucci. At this time The Grand Wizard became the Graham's manager. Another major feud at this time was with Polish muscleman Ivan Putski.\n\nA brief contract with the NWA in Houston, Texas followed from June to August 1976, after which Graham went on his second tour of Japan, this time accompanied by Ivan Koloff. He feuded with Antonio Inoki during this Japanese run. After returning to America, Graham and Koloff made an unsuccessful attempt to launch their own wrestling promotion in Southern California. In November 1976, on the invitation of Dusty Rhodes, Graham joined the NWA promotion in Florida, beating Rhodes for the Florida heavyweight title on November 22 at the West Palm Beach Auditorium. His work in this period included occasional visits to St Louis, Missouri, where he took on NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race.\n\nGraham returned to the WWWF in April 1977 after an agreement with promoter Vincent J. McMahon (Senior). Graham defeated Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship on April 30, 1977, in Baltimore, Maryland. Graham held the title for nine and a half months.\n\nDuring his reign, he wrestled across America and in Japan (February 1978), facing challengers such as former champion Bruno Sammartino, Jack Brisco, Dusty Rhodes, Pedro Morales, Don Muraco, Mil Mascaras, Strong Kobayashi and Riki Choshu. On 25 January 1978 in Miami, Florida at the Orange Bowl football stadium, Graham wrestled against then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Harley Race in a WWWF World Heavyweight Championship vs. NWA World Heavyweight Championship unification match which ended in a one-hour time-limit draw. Although a defeat by Bob Backlund, who was to embody the virtuous junior \"all-American\" wrestler, had been written into Graham's current contract with the WWWF, Graham suggested another outcome to McMahon: that Ivan Koloff should turn on him, thus starting a feud that would make Graham a fan favorite. McMahon refused because of the handshake deal to make Backlund the new fan favorite champion and he did not want to go back on his word. It was also unheard of for a counter-cultural character like Graham to be a fan favorite, because McMahon and many old promoters saw Graham as a confirmed heel and therefore a negative role model. Graham eventually \"lost\" the title to Backlund on February 20, 1978.\n\nAnother feud Graham had as champion was with Dusty Rhodes, which culminated in a Texas Bullrope match. His confrontations with Rhodes continued after Graham had been forced to drop the belt to Backlund. Rhodes himself, a long-time friend of Graham's, recalled these matches with Graham in 1978 as among the most exciting and memorable of his career.\n\nDisillusioned by the premature loss of his belt, Graham left the WWWF in December 1978 and accepted an offer to join Paul Boesch's promotion in Houston, Texas, lending himself out for other NWA events in California and Florida as well. In April 1979 he embarked on his third IWA tour of Japan, where he wrestled the same men he had worked with in 1974. In March 1979, the new Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) named Graham as their World Champion. On November 8, 1979 Graham lost the belt to Jerry Lawler in Lexington, Kentucky. His following NWA engagements in Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Texas became fewer and rarer until he stopped wrestling in April 1980. Graham wrestled only two matches (one in Canada and one in Los Angeles) in the whole of 1981. He spent some time competing in Japan, where he added some martial arts techniques to his repertoire.\n\nGraham returned to the now renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in September 1982. He debuted in the promotion with entirely new look: lean, with a bald head and mustache, and sporting black karate pants. Graham later stated that he wanted to retire the \"Superstar\" character out of frustration with Vince McMahon Sr. for not letting him become a fan favorite. After his return, he attacked Backlund, destroying his championship belt. He challenged Backlund for the WWF Championship, but was unable to win the title. He left the promotion in April 1983.\n\nGraham signed up with the AWA again in October 1983, wrestling mainly in the Mid West. By the following year he had regained his earlier body weight and in April 1984 he began his NWA run with Championship Wrestling from Florida, first as a member of Kevin Sullivan's Army of Darkness and later as the group's opponent after he tired of Sullivan's abuse of his valet Fallen Angel and stopped Sullivan from beating her at ringside. From November 1984 Graham joined Jim Crockett Promotions (Mid-Atlantic Wrestling) in North Carolina, working for Paul Jones in his feud against Jimmy Valiant. It was during this stint, in the summer of 1985, that Graham bulked up further, and returned to his tie-dyed look, growing a full goatee and dyeing the mustache blond.\n\nGraham returned to the WWF one more time in June 1986, now as a fan favorite. After a few appearances, it was diagnosed in August that he required a hip replacement. The footage of Graham's hip replacement surgery was shown on WWF TV on September 27 as a means of promoting his comeback. He returned in mid-1987 and worked a heavy schedule from mid July to late October, feuding with Harley Race and Butch Reed. However, the strain on his hip as well as his ankles also deteriorating proved to be too much. In Syracuse on October 27, the One Man Gang supposedly retired him from active competition permanently with a running splash on the concrete floor after Graham's win over Reed. In this incident, aired on the November 14, 1987 episode of \"Superstars\", Don Muraco came to Graham's aid, and Graham subsequently became Muraco's manager. Graham's last wrestling match, also against Butch Reed and at 44 years of age, actually took place on November 7, 1987, in St Louis, Missouri. Over the next year, in between bouts of surgery, Graham worked for the WWF as a commentator.\n\nOn March 14, 2004, Graham was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004, the night before \"WrestleMania XX\", by then-World Heavyweight Champion Triple H, whom Graham had helped inspire to become a professional wrestler. Graham later sold his WWE Hall of Fame ring to purchase anti-rejection medications to help treat his liver transplant.\n\nSeveral months later, Graham joined WWE on a swing of nine televised events where he was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman (on December 28) before performing a skit which ended with Coachman getting knocked out. On February 25, 2005, Graham appeared at another live event and was again interviewed by Coachman before knocking him out. Three days later, Graham appeared on \"Raw\", where he encouraged Randy Orton to do something to make himself notable. On October 3 at \"WWE Homecoming\", Graham participated in a Legends Ceremony with 24 other WWE legends. On the January 23, 2006 episode of \"Raw\", he promoted his book and DVD. Graham parted ways with WWE in 2009.\n\nIn November 2015, Graham announced that he had signed a legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) in a Facebook post.\n\nRoberta Morgan's 1979 kayfabe book \"Main Event\" wrote, \"Although he is a rule bender, [Graham] has managed to stay very popular with the fans, probably because of his skill, strength, and colorful personality\". As a headliner in Madison Square Garden, which was the WWF's primary arena throughout his tenure, Graham sold out 19 of 20 shows.\n\nMany wrestlers have based their looks and styles on Billy Graham. Some examples are Ric Flair, Austin Idol, Scott Steiner, Triple H, Hulk Hogan and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura. Graham was also famous for his characteristic use of the word \"brother\" in his promos, referring to either commentators or fellow wrestlers. This stems from his background attending evangelical revival meetings, where everybody referred to each other as \"brother\" or \"sister\" (in Christ). Graham's use of the word caught on, and since then countless wrestlers have also used \"brother\" in their own respective promos, most notably Hulk Hogan.\n\nGraham has often lectured young athletes on the dangers of steroids. His autobiography, \"Tangled Ropes\", was released by WWE on January 10, 2006. WWE also released a DVD about Graham's career, titled \"20 Years Too Soon: The \"Superstar\" Billy Graham Story\". Graham had a new DVD released in 2013 through Hannibal Pro Wrestling and Seriocity Productions titled \"\"Superstar\" Billy Graham: Full Disclosure\".\n\nIn the early 1990s US federal agents were investigating Dr. George Zahorian, a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania physician who had been dispensing anabolic steroids and other drugs to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) wrestlers at WWF events. In 1991 Dr. Zahorian was convicted under the US federal Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 which prohibited the prescription of steroids for non-therapeutic purposes. This led to WWF owner Vince McMahon Jr., who admitted to being a steroid user himself, being put on trial on charges of steroid distribution in 1994. The trial concluded with McMahon's acquittal. During this time Graham personally sued Zahorian and the WWF, claiming that they had forced him to take steroids to maintain his position in the company. His lawsuit was unsuccessful, partly because he had been using steroids for a decade preceding his WWF debut. Recalling the lawsuit on a 2003 episode of \"WWE Confidential\", he attributed the litigation to his bitterness and claimed that he was an innovator of steroid use in the organization.\n\nGraham went on a public awareness campaign regarding the dangers of steroids during this time, including an appearance with McMahon on \"The Phil Donahue Show\" in 1992. During the \"Donahue\" taping Graham claimed to have witnessed WWF officials sexually abuse children. McMahon claimed the abuse had never taken place, and Graham later admitted that he made up the allegations, hoping to extort \"hush money\" out of the WWF. In his autobiography, Graham describes making the allegations as being \"my most shameful moment, not only in the wrestling profession, but in my life\". Graham wrote an apology to McMahon but received no response until his 2002 liver transplant.\n\nFive years after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, Graham was released from his consultancy position in World Wrestling Entertainment. He sold his Hall of Fame ring on eBay to help pay for medical bills and requested that he be entirely removed from the Hall of Fame after Abdullah the Butcher was inducted. Graham complained that Abdullah had never wrestled in the promotion.\n\nGraham spoke out against Linda McMahon during her 2010 Senate campaign, claiming that she was distancing herself from the racy programming that she profited from while acting as CEO for WWE. Upon learning that his liver condition had worsened, Graham reached out to apologize to the McMahons, even offering to be a spokesman for Linda McMahon's campaign.\n\nIn July 2015, Graham sent a letter to Vince McMahon requesting to take the position of Dusty Rhodes, who had recently died, at NXT. Graham received criticism from fans due to his timing and opportunism. He defended himself, calling his critics \"evil, sub humans\", and compared a possible reconciliation with McMahon to that of long-time WWE critic Bruno Sammartino, who reconciled with McMahon and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2013.\n\nAs stated in his autobiography \"Tangled Ropes\", Graham and his wife Valerie, whom he married in 1978, were never able to have children. Graham has two children from a previous marriage to Madelyn Miluso. His daughter Capella was born on June 8, 1972. She was named after a star he read about in the \"Atlas of the Universe\". His son Joey was born on March 18, 1975. Joey was born with double pneumonia and an enlarged heart, which was later surgically corrected. His godfather was wrestler Dusty Rhodes.\n\nGraham received a liver transplant in 2002 from a 26-year-old female donor, who had died in a car crash. Graham's liver was in the cirrhosis stage at the time of his transplant. Graham was again hospitalized on May 24, 2006, due to a bowel obstruction from an earlier surgery.\n\nIn July 2010, Graham was hospitalized due to liver problems. Afterward, he announced that he probably only had one year left to live without another liver transplant. Graham reserved a burial spot at the Green Acres cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona, next to Eddie Guerrero. On March 31, 2011, \"The Phoenix New Times\" reported that Graham's doctor, Hector Rodriguez-Luna, acknowledged that Graham's advanced fibrosis may be early cirrhosis and that he could live for two more years if he took Interferon—a drug to help slow his hepatitis C—and stayed in shape. By 2012, Graham was diagnosed with third-stage liver disease and cirrhosis.\n\nOn January 17, 2013 Graham was hospitalized with double pneumonia and possible heart failure. He was re-hospitalized for a liver complication in October 2014.\n\nOn August 2, 2016, Graham was hospitalized while undergoing a medical procedure due to internal bleeding; he underwent the surgery on August 3 to identify the cause of the issues.\n\n\n"}

Jody Hamilton, the original Assassin, was a member throughout the various incarnations of the team, teaming with Tom Renesto, Roger Smith, Randy Colley and Hercules Hernandez while donning the masks.\n\nThe team had its origins in 1961 in the Georgia territory, when Hamilton, a five-year veteran, first began competing in Atlanta as the Assassin. Shortly afterward, Tom Renesto arrived in the area and began teaming with Hamilton to form the original Assassins team.\n\nHamilton and Renesto became a well-traveled heel tandem through the 1960s, competing in the Mid-Atlantic territory, Georgia, Florida, California, Arizona, the Pacific Northwest, Canada, Japan and Australia among other areas, and winning championship gold along the way. They returned to Georgia in 1968 and competed in that state primarily until 1974; they spent most of their time competing in Georgia Championship Wrestling during that period, but they also went to work for an independent group called the All-South Wrestling Alliance, with Hamiilton going solo in the beginning while Renesto worked behind the scenes, then facing off in opposite corners from each other, then reuniting as babyfaces before All-South closed in late 1974.\n\nAfter Renesto retired from the ring, Hamilton continued The Assassins with new partners in later years, teaming up with Roger Smith and then Randy Colley, before forming the 1980s version of the masked team with Hercules Hernandez in Jim Crockett Promotions, under the management of Paul Jones, who used them as part of his feud with the popular Jimmy Valiant. That version of the team lasted until Hernandez was unmasked after losing to Valiant in a mask vs. hair match at a JCP/Maple Leaf Wrestling show in Toronto, Ontario on April 15, 1984. Hamilton continued on solo after Hernandez left JCP, breaking his ties with Jones to turn babyface once again and feud with his former manager, which climaxed with Hamilton teaming with Buzz Tyler to beat Jones' Zambuie Express (Elijah Akeem and Kareem Muhammed) at Starrcade 1984 in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nJody Hamilton wound down his in-ring career in the Alabama territory competing under a different identity as The Flame before starting up his own promotion in Georgia, Deep South Wrestling, in 1986, which he ran for about two years before selling the promotion. He then opened up the Power Plant as a training facility for World Championship Wrestling and was last seen reprising his Assassin role as the manager of Pretty Wonderful (Paul Orndorff and Paul Roma) in WCW in 1994. Hamilton reopened Deep South Wrestling in 2005 to serve as a developmental territory for World Wrestling Entertainment, but WWE severed its developmental deal with DSW on April 18, 2007, and Hamilton continued running the promotion on his own as an independent until he folded DSW shortly after its October 11, 2007 event.\n\nTom Renesto retired from wrestling in 1974. On April 25, 2000, Renesto died at 72 years old. \n\nRandy Colley went on to form The Moondogs tag team (as Moondog Rex), which competed in the then-WWF and in the Memphis area, and he was also the original Demolition Smash. He also competed in Mid-South Wrestling as the masked Nightmare, wearing the same mask he had as one of the Assassins. He retired in 1996.\n\nRoger Smith went on to fame in Memphis in the mid-1980s under the ring name Dirty Rhodes (for his resemblance to Dusty Rhodes in both appearance and mannerisms), both as a heel and a babyface. He has also since retired.\n\nHercules Hernandez went on to fame under that name in World Class Championship Wrestling, Florida, the WWF and Japan, as the masked Mr. Wrestling III in Mid-South, and as the masked Super Invader in WCW. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in Tampa, Florida on March 6, 2004 at age 47.\n\nJim Ross stated that the Masked Assassins \"were the greatest tag team that [he] ever saw.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Books\"\n"}
