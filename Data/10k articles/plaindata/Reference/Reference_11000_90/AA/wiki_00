Compiled by Mortimer Adler, an American philosopher, under the guidance of Robert Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, the volumes were billed as a collection of the 102 great ideas of the western canon. The term “syntopicon” was coined specifically for this undertaking, meaning “a collection of topics.” The volumes catalogued what Adler and his team deemed to be the fundamental ideas contained in the works of the Great Books of the Western World, which stretched chronologically from Homer to Freud. The \"Syntopicon\" lists, under each idea, where every occurrence of the concept can be located in the collection’s famous works.\n\nThe \"Syntopicon\" was created to set the Great Books collection apart from previously published sets (such as Harvard Classics). Robert Hutchins, at the time, in addition to being the president of the University of Chicago, also served as Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Hutchins and Adler were recruited by the encyclopedia’s publisher for a “special idea” which would increase the collection’s marketability.\n\nWith this mission, Adler undertook a project that would consume over a decade of his life: identifying and indexing the western world’s Great Ideas. In the end, the \"Syntopicon\" would require over 400,000 man-hours of reading and cost over two million dollars. Britannica publisher Senator William Benton joked at the Great Books presentation dinner that “the Syntopicon is said to be the most expensive two volumes editorially in all publishing history. How Hutchins and Adler achieved that unique distinction, the publisher is still trying to figure out. (Clifton Fadiman) assured me some day the story will be told. I’d like it whenever I can get it.”\n\nThe process of cataloging each appearance of one of the “Great Ideas” in all 431 works by 71 authors in the collection was so arduous that the \"Syntopicon\" nearly did not make it to print. Before it even came time to print, the budget had topped a million dollars and there was not even “a penny for paper” left. Adler persevered, however, having spent the previous eight years of his life on the project. He single-handedly raised funds by selling more expensive “Founders Editions” of the sets, and disobeyed the order to fire his entire staff. There were times, during the process when he admitted: “the question was could we sell the plates for junk! Could we dispose of the plates as old metal?”\n\nAdler felt, through it all, that he was creating something completely new. The \"Syntopicon\", he felt, would be revolutionary, its release on par with such events as the creation of the first dictionary. It would do for ideas what previous reference books had done for words and facts. He worked with a team of over 100 readers who met twice a week for years to discuss the readings and the ideas within them. Among his editorial team was a young Saul Bellow.\n\nIn the end, he produced two volumes, which listed the 102 Great Ideas of the western world, from Angel to World. The set was released with much fanfare, including an honorary gifting of the first two editions to U.S. President Harry S. Truman and Elizabeth II. An internal memo from Encyclopædia Britannica, regarding a release party, reads:\n\n“The projected sequences of events is: (1) Mr. Hutchins kicks off the conference with a discussion of the Great Books movement, and the university’s and Britannica’s interest in the set; (2) Mr. Adler tells in detail of the contents of the set and the significance of the Syntopicon; (3) Cocktails.”\n\nIn addition to being a “special idea” that would set Great Books of the Western World apart, the \"Syntopicon\" serves four other purposes, outlined in its preface. The \"Syntopicon\" can serve as a reference book, as a book to be read, as an “instrument of liberal education,” and as “an instrument of discovery and research.”\n\nAbove all, however, the \"Syntopicon\" was created to unite the western world’s canon. It was created to solve what Adler saw as a fundamental problem, that “different authors say the same thing in different ways, or use the same words to say quite different things.” By cataloging the things the great authors were saying in a more scientific manner, Adler hoped to show the underlying unity that ultimately existed in the collected works.\n\nFor Hutchins, a chief proponent of classical education, the creation of the \"Syntopicon\" held even greater implications. Hutchins felt that the ideas being discussed and cross-listed in the \"Syntopicon\" might be \"powerful enough to save the world from self-destruction.\"\n\nThe \"Syntopicon\" consists of 102 chapters on the 102 Great Ideas. Each chapter is broken down into five distinct sections: the introduction, an outline of topics, references, cross-references, and additional readings. Adler penned all 102 introductions himself, giving a brief essay on the idea and its connection with the western canon. The outline of topics broke each idea down further, into as many as 15 sub-ideas. For instance, the first idea “Angel” is broken down into “Inferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion,” “the philosophical consideration of pure intelligences, spiritual substances, supra-human persons” and seven other subtopics. After this is the references section (for instance, “inferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion” can be found in Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon, Locke, Hegel, Goethe and more). Cross-references follow, where similar ideas are listed. Last is the additional readings, in which one could seek out more on the subject of “Angel.”\n\nThe list of 102 ideas is broken between the two volumes, as follows:\n\nVolume I: Angel, Animal, Aristocracy, Art, Astronomy, Beauty, Being, Cause, Chance, Change, Citizen, Constitution, Courage, Custom and Convention, Definition, Democracy, Desire, Dialectic, Duty, Education, Element, Emotion, Eternity, Evolution, Experience, Family, Fate, Form, God, Good and Evil, Government, Habit, Happiness, History, Honor, Hypothesis, Idea, Immortality, Induction, Infinity, Judgment, Justice, Knowledge, Labor, Language, Law, Liberty, Life and Death, Logic, and Love.\n\nVolume II: Man, Mathematics, Matter, Mechanics, Medicine, Memory and Imagination, Metaphysics, Mind, Monarchy, Nature, Necessity and Contingency, Oligarchy, One and Many, Opinion, Opposition, Philosophy, Physics, Pleasure and Pain, Poetry, Principle, Progress, Prophecy, Prudence, Punishment, Quality, Quantity, Reasoning, Relation, Religion, Revolution, Rhetoric, Same and Other, Science, Sense, Sign and Symbol, Sin, Slavery, Soul, Space, State, Temperance, Theology, Time, Truth, Tyranny and Despotism, Universal and Particular, Virtue and Vice, War and Peace, Wealth, Will, Wisdom, and World.\n\nThe release of the \"Syntopicon\" and the Great Books of the Western World was covered in the \"New York Herald\", \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Time\" magazine, the \"Chicago Tribune\", and local papers across the United States.\n\nFull page ads for \"Time\" magazine appeared in newspapers across the country, saying “What and Why is a Syntopicon?” Time published an article about the new, pivotal piece of reference material, and Adler wrote them back in thanks, saying that “I think the piece is both thoroughly accurate and very lively, which, considering the subject matter, is quite a feat.”\n\n\"Look\" magazine ran a feature on the \"Syntopicon\", displaying behind-the-scene photos of the index’s staff at work. In one picture, editor Joe Roddy is shown weighing the number of entries about love on a scale. “Discussions of love by great authors,” the caption reads, “outweigh sin and eternity.”\n\nDespite the extensive press coverage and cross-country speeches, however, sales of the \"Syntopicon\" and the Great Books of the Western World were slow. Experienced encyclopedia salesmen had to be brought in to move the product, despite Hutchins’ dislike of this solution.\n\nThe \"Syntopicon\"'s list was \"arbitrary\", as even Adler admitted. The press and others also found problems with the \"Syntopicon\", and despite Adler’s predictions (“we predict that, as dictionaries are indispensable in the realm of words, and encyclopaedias in the realm of facts, so the Syntopicon will become indispensable in the realm of ideas” ) the \"Syntopicon\" has fallen into relative obscurity. At the time of its release, \"The New York Times Book Review\" declared: “Its defects are on the surface. One is the implication that great books are concerned only with ideas which can be logically analyzed—whereas many masterpieces of literature live in realms partially or wholly outside the realm of logic. Another is the conception that the chief purpose of reading a book is to crack its shell and reach its kernel—the form itself being unimportant decoration.”\n\nIn a succeeding book, Adler expressed his regret that the civil rights concept of Equality had not been selected. He attempted to rectify the omission with \"Six Great Ideas: Truth–Goodness–Beauty–Liberty–Equality–Justice\" (1981).\n\nAdler attempted another index, in one volume, the \"Propædia\" for the fifteenth edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\". A traditional two-volume alphabetical index has since been produced for the more recent versions of the fifteenth edition, in addition to \"Propædia\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46806415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46806415", "title": "Abbreviation (music)", "text": "Abbreviation (music)\n\nAbbreviations in music are of two kinds, namely, abbreviations of terms related to musical expression, and the true musical abbreviations by the help of which certain passages, chords, etc., may be notated in a shortened form, to the greater convenience of both composer and performer. Abbreviations of the first kind are like most abbreviations in language; they consist for the most part of the initial letter or first syllable of the word employed—as for instance, or for the dynamic markings piano and forte, \"cresc.\" for crescendo, \"Ob.\" for oboe, \"Fag.\" for bassoon (). This article is about abbreviations used in music notation. For abbreviations of terms related to musical expression and music in general, see Glossary of musical terminology.\n\nThe continued repetition of a note or chord is expressed by a stroke or strokes across the stem, or above or below the note if it be a whole note or double whole note. The number of strokes denotes the subdivision of the written note into eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., unless the word tremolo or tremolando is added, in which case the repetition is as rapid as possible, without regard to the exact number of notes played. (When strokes are added to notes shorter than a quarter note, each beam counts as a stroke.) In the first bar of the example below, the half note with the single stroke across the stem in the \"written\" staff becomes 4 eighth notes in the \"played\" staff. Through the use of 2 strokes across the stem in the second bar, the next full note is expressed as a phrase of 16 sixteenth notes.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\new staff { c2:8^\\markup { Written: } <e c g>: | c1:16 | \\time 2/4 f,2:32 | \\time 4/4 f4:8 a:8 c:16 f:16 | b,8:16 d:16 b:16 g:16 a:32 b:32 c:32 d:32 \\bar \"|.\" } \\new staff { c8^\\markup { Played: } c c c <e c g> <e c g> <e c g> <e c g> | c16 c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c | f,32 f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f | f8 f a a c16 c c c f f f f | b, b d d b b g g a32 a a a b b b b c c c c d d d d } »\n</score>\n\nOn bowed instruments the rapid reiteration of a single note is easy, but in piano music an octave or chord becomes necessary to produce a tremolo, the manner of writing and performing of which is seen below.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 2/4 \\new staff { <g g'>4:16 ^\\markup { \\italic tremolo } <e' c g>:16 | \\repeat tremolo 4 { <c e>16^\\markup { \\italic tremolo } g } | s4 } \\new staff { g'32*8/12 g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, g' g, <c e>32*8/12 g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g | <c e>32 g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g <c e> g | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nIn the abbreviation expressed by strokes, as above, the passage to be abbreviated can contain no note of greater length than an eighth note, but it is possible also to divide a long note into quarter notes, by means of dots (sometimes known as \"divisi\" dots) placed over it, as below.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { c2^\\markup { .. } c2^\\markup { .. } | c1^\\markup { ... } | s2 } \\new staff { c4 c c c | c c c c | s2 } »\n</score>\n\nThis is however seldom done, as only a small amount of space is saved. When a long note has to be repeated in the form of triplets or sextuplets, the figure 3 or 6 is usually placed over it in addition to the stroke across the stem, and the note is sometimes, though not necessarily, written dotted.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { c4:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } c4:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } c2:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 6 } } \\bar \"||\" \\time 4/4 \\omit TupletNumber \\tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } } \\tuplet 3/2 { c4.:8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 3 } } } \\tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 6 } } } \\tuplet 6/4 { c4.:16^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic 6 } } } \\bar \"||\" } \\new staff { \\tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c c c c c c c} | \\tuplet 3/2 4 {c8 c c c c c} \\tuplet 6/4 4 {c16 c c c c c c c c c c c} } »\n</score>\n\nThe repetition of a group of two notes is abbreviated by two notes (most often half notes or whole notes) connected by the number of strokes ordinarily used to express eighth notes, sixteenth notes, etc., according to the rate of movement intended, as below. It will be observed that a passage lasting for the value of one half note requires two half notes to express it, on account of the group consisting of two notes.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { \\repeat tremolo 2 { f8 a } \\repeat tremolo 4 { f16 a} | \\repeat tremolo 4 { f8 a } | s4 } \\new staff { f8 a f a f16 a f a f a f a | f8 a f a f a f a | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nAs seen above, half notes are often written with the strokes beaming the notes together (which is unambiguous as white notes with beams are not otherwise used in music), but with quarter notes and shorter the strokes must be separated from the stems to prevent them being misread as a shorter note value.\n\n\\relative c\" « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 2/4 \\new staff { \\repeat tremolo 4 { c32 a } \\repeat tremolo 4 { g64 c } \\repeat tremolo 4 { g64 b } | s4 } \\new staff { c32 a c a c a c a g64 [c g c g c g c] g [b g b g b g b] | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nA group of three, four, or more notes is abbreviated by the repetition of the cross strokes without the notes as many times as the group has to be repeated.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { \\repeat percent 2 { e8[ g c g] } | \\repeat percent 4 { e16 g c g } \\bar \"||\" } \\new staff { e8 g c g e g c g | e16 g c g e g c g e g c g e g c g } »\n</score>\n\nThis can also be written with the notes forming the group are written as a chord, with the necessary number of strokes across the stem. In this case the word \"simili\" or \"segue\" is added, to show that the order of notes in the first group (which must be written out in full) is to be repeated, and to prevent the possibility of mistaking the effect intended for the repetition of the chord as a whole.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { d16 f a f <d f a>2.:16^\\markup { \\italic simili } | s4 } \\new staff { d16 f a f d f a f d f a f d f a f | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nAnother sign of abbreviation of a group consists of an oblique line with two dots, one on each side; this serves to indicate the repetition of a group of any number of notes of any length. This can even apply to a passage composed of several groups, provided such passage is not more than two bars in length.\n\n\\relative c' « { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new staff { \\repeat percent 2 { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } \\bar \"||\" } \\new staff { e16 g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f | e g f e f g a b c g a b c d e f g a g f e d c b a g c b a g a f } »\n</score>\n\nA more usual method of abbreviating the repetition of a passage of the length of the above is to write over it the word \"bis\" (twice), or in some cases \"ter\" (three times), or to enclose it between the dots of an ordinary repeat sign.\n\nPassages intended to be played in octaves are often written as single notes with the words \"coll' ottava\" or \"coll' 8va\" placed above or below them, according as the upper or lower octave is to be added.\n\n« { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 2/4 \\new Staff { c\"8^\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic \"coll' 8\" \\super \\italic \"va\" } } d\" e\" f\" \\bar \"||\" \\clef bass g_\\markup { \\smaller { \\italic \"coll' 8\" \\super \\italic \"va\" } } e c4 \\bar \"||\" s4 } \\new Staff { <c\" c>8 <d\" d> <e\" e> <f\" f> | \\clef bass <g g,> <e e,> <c c,>4 | s4 } »\n</score>\n\nThe word \"8\" (or sometimes \"8 alta\" or \"8 bassa\") written above or below a passage does not add octaves, but merely transposes the passage an octave higher or lower. In clarinet music the word \"chalumeau\" is used to signify that the passage is to be played an octave lower than written.\n\n« { \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f } \\time 4/4 \\new Staff { \\ottava #1 f8 e d c \\ottava #0 b\"^\\markup { \\smaller \\italic loco } a\" g\"4 \\bar \"||\" \\clef bass \\ottava #-1 a,8 b, c, d, \\ottava #0 e_\\markup { \\smaller \\italic loco } f g4 \\bar \"||\" \\clef treble \\ottava #-1 \\set Staff.ottavation = #\"chalumeau\" e8 g c' g f a c' a | g \\ottava #0 e'_\\markup { \\smaller \\italic clar. } g' c\" e\"2 \\bar \"||\" } \\new Staff { f8 e d c b\" a\" g\"4 | \\clef bass a,8 b, c, d, e, f, g,4 | \\clef treble e8 g c' g f a c' a | g e' g' c\" e\"2 } »\n</score>\n\nAll these alterations (which can scarcely be considered abbreviations except that they spare the use of ledger lines) are counteracted, and the passage restored to its usual position, by the ending of the enclosing bracket, the word \"loco\", or in clarinet music \"clarinette\".\n\nIn orchestral music it often happens that certain of the instruments play in unison; when this is the case the parts are sometimes not all written in the score, but the lines belonging to one or more of the instruments are left blank, and the words \"coi violini\" or \"col basso\", etc., are added, to indicate that the instruments in question have to play in unison with the violins or basses, as the case may be, or when two instruments of the same kind, such as first and second violins, have to play in unison, the word \"unisono\" or \"col primo\" is placed instead of the notes in the line belonging to the second. Where two parts are written on one staff in a score the sign \"a 2\" denotes that both play the same notes; and \"a 1\" that the second of the two is resting. The indication \"a 3\" or \"a 4\" at the head of fugues indicates the number of parts or voices in which the fugue is written.\n\nAn abbreviation which is often very troublesome to the conductor occurs in manuscript scores, when a considerable part of the composition is repeated without alteration, and the corresponding number of bars are left vacant, with the remark \"come sopra\" (as above). This is not met with in printed scores.\n\nThere are also abbreviations relating to music analysis, some of which are of great value. In figured bass, for instance, the various chords are expressed by figures, and the several authors in the nineteenth century invented or availed themselves of various methods of shortly expressing the different chords and intervals, particularly using Roman numeral analysis.\n\nGottfried Weber represents an interval by a number with one or two dots before it to express minor or diminished, and one or two after it for major or augmented.\n\nJohann Anton André makes use of a right triangle to express a triad, and a square, for a seventh chord, the inversions being indicated by one, two, or three small vertical lines across their base, and the classification into major, minor, diminished, or augmented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4, placed in the centre.\n"}

So far, the number of inventoried newspaper titles from the period 1830-1950 already exceeds 7200.\n\nThe database shows the most important specifications of each newspaper, such as title, date, and place of publication. Keywords indicate the type of newspaper (with a focus on e.g. trade, sports, or advertising) or the social community at which the newspaper was aimed (e.g. catholic, liberal, or socialist community). Seeing that newspapers were often attached to a certain city or region, the database allows searching on geographical terms.\n\nUsers are able to see detailed information on the exact editions and locations of each newspaper, including the format (paper, microform, or digital format) in which it is preserved in each of the institutions. Links are added for newspapers that are consultable online. It is not possible to search on content of any newspaper article.\n\nThe database was named after Abraham Verhoeven (Antwerp, 1575-1652), who is considered to be the first publisher of newspapers in the Southern Netherlands. His \"Nieuwe Tijdinghen\" (New Tidings) was a substantial contribution to the early beginnings of a daily form of newspaper.\n\nAbraham was developed as a project in 2007 by the Hendrik Conscience Heritage Library in co-operation with a large number of heritage institutions. The catalogue was created to increase general access to historical newspapers, a goldmine of cultural-historical information. Frequent consultation of these newspapers, however, poses considerable risks, seeing that especially those from 1830 to 1950 are often printed on fragile and low-quality paper. The only way to preserve their contents for posterity will be by copying them to microform or digital format. In this way, Abraham plays an important role in the preservation of these vulnerable documents.\n\nAt the end of 2008, the project was taken over by the then newly founded Flanders Heritage Library. Together with various partners from the heritage field, Flanders Heritage Library is further actively updating and enriching the database with new records. In the meantime, Abraham is being used as a helpful tool for digitising projects.\n\n\n"}

The appellant in this case was the mining corporation Alexkor, which had an interest in the diamondiferous parts of the Richtersveld area. An important aspect of the case was the community's assertion that it used the land according to its indigenous customs, an assertion upheld in both the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) and the Constitutional Court, and on the basis whereof the land was returned to the community.\n\nIn defining and determining what is entailed by customary-law ownership of land, the SCA equated it with common-law ownership, while the Constitutional Court found that its content should be ascertained by studying the customs and uses of the community. It was thus decided that the Richtersveld community's claim to the land incorporated a claim to the minerals in the land, and that the community's entitlement to both the land and the minerals should be acknowledged and restored. Incorporated in this was the right of the community to claim compensation for past exploitation of the land by Alexkor and the state. The court's reasoning shows \"how the redefinition of the sources of South African property law affects the protection offered to relationships with land.\"\n\n\n"}

Founded in 2013, the group's main base of operations is in Florida, but has members in other states such as Texas and Montana. The group is part of the alt-right, but is considered extreme even within that movement. \n\nAtomwaffen encourages members to burn the United States flag and Constitution, and to attack the U.S. government and minorities (especially Jews). The group's membership is mostly young, and the Atomwaffen Division has been active on university campuses recruitment postering. The San Antonio, Texas chapter is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\n\nAtomwaffen has engaged in plans to cripple public water systems and destroy parts of the American electric grid. Atomwaffen has also been accused of planning to blow up nuclear plants to cause meltdowns of American nuclear energy sites. The organization aims for a violent overthrow of the United States government by use of terrorism and guerrilla warfare tactics. Since 2017, the organization has been linked to five killings.\n\nThe group announced its creation on the neo-Nazi website \"IronMarch.org\" in October 2015. The website was also the predecessor of Vanguard America and National Action. According to the \"Chicago Maroon\", the independent student newspaper of the University of Chicago, the Atomwaffen Division describe themselves as a \"very fanatical, ideological band of comrades who do both activism and militant training. Hand to hand, arms training, and various other forms of training. As for activism, we spread awareness in the real world through unconventional means.\"\n\nDuring 2016, the group gained attention on university campuses across the country due to its recruitment poster campaigns, urging students to \"Join Your Local Nazis!\" and saying \"The Nazis Are Coming!\" The Atomwaffen Division posted recruiting posters at the University of Chicago, the University of Central Florida, the Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and Boston University.\n\nThis campaign was noted by the Jewish watchdog group the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who noted a wider alt-right focus on university recruitment. An Atomwaffen Division member protested outside the ADL's Houston office with a sign reading \"Mary's Life Mattered\", in reference to Mary Phagan.\n\nAs of early 2018, ProPublica estimated Atomwaffen had 80 members, while the ADL estimated it had 24 to 36 active members.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, \"The Verge\" reported that Discord had banned a number of neo-Nazi and alt-right servers, including that of the Atomwaffen Division, from their private chat platform, for abuse of their Terms of Service. The same article reported that YouTube had shut down the Atomwaffen Division channel, due to the group being linked to five murders.\n\nThe Atomwaffen Division explicitly advocates neo-Nazism, drawing significant influence from James Mason's \"Siege\", a mid-1980s newsletter of the National Socialist Liberation Front later gathered into a book, and follows the ideology of \"Universal Order\", a form of neo-Nazism partially devised by Charles Manson and Joseph Tommasi. \n\nCulturally, the group advocates a revival of Italian Futurism, a pre-World War I avant-garde art movement which glorified \"war – the world's only hygiene – militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.\"\n\nA key source on their beliefs are the 250,000 encrypted chat logs obtained by ProPublica.\n\nSome members of the group were sympathetic towards Salafi-jihadi Islam. The leader of Atomwaffen Division, Brandon Russell, is alleged to have described Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to ISIS and perpetrated the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, as \"a hero.\" A member of Atomwaffen Division, Stephen Billingsley, was photographed at a vigil in San Antonio, Texas for the victims of the Orlando shooting, with a skull mask and a sign saying \"God Hates Fags.\"\n\nSome have tied Atomwaffen to the fascist Satanist group the Order of Nine Angles.\n\nOne 18-year-old member, Devon Arthurs, of Tampa Palms, Florida, converted to Islam and described himself as a \"Salafist National Socialist.\" In May 2017 Arthurs allegedly killed two of his roommates and fellow Atomwaffen Division members in retaliation for ridiculing his conversion. Arthurs was arrested following a hostage situation, during which he told police he shot 22-year-old Jeremy Himmelman and 18-year-old Andrew Oneschuk earlier that day. In 2018, following competency evaluations by two court-appointed experts (a neuropsychologist and a psychologist), Arthurs was ruled incompetent to stand trial. He remains at the Florida State Hospital.\n\nIn May 2017, after Arthurs' arrest, his third roommate and fellow Atomwaffen Division member, a 21-year-old, Brandon Russell, was arrested by the FBI and Tampa Police Department, who found in Russell's garage explosive precursors ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, homemade fuses and an explosive compound hexamethylene triperoxide diamine. HMTD has been used by other groups in improvised explosive devices such as the 2016 New York and New Jersey bombings, and ammonium nitrate and nitromethane were used by Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing. The raid also found thorium and americium, radioactive substances, in Russell's bedroom. Russell, a former student at the University of South Florida and a Florida Army National Guardsman, had a framed photograph of Timothy McVeigh in his bedroom. The raid also discovered various Atomwaffen paraphernalia and other neo-Nazi propaganda.\n\nIn September 2017, Russell pleaded guilty in federal court to possessing an unregistered destructive device and to illegally storing explosives; in January 2018, he was sentenced to five years in prison for those crimes.\n\nIn January 2018, Samuel Woodward was charged in Orange County, California with killing Blaze Bernstein, an openly gay Jewish college student who went missing earlier in the month while visiting his family. Woodward is an avowed neo-Nazi and a member of the group who had attended Atomwaffen Division events and training camps, according to ProPublica. According to chat logs subsequently published by ProPublica, one member wrote of the killing \"I love this,\" and another praised Woodward as a \"one man gay Jew wrecking crew.\" The new logs suggest there are around 20 Atomwaffen cells across the U.S., that some members have taken part in weapons training, and show members praising Timothy McVeigh, responsible for the Oklahoma City bombing, Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof, and Norwegian mass-murderer and white supremacist Anders Breivik. Bernstein's was the fifth killing tied to the Atomwaffen group.\n\nIn August 2017, during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Vasillios Pistolis, a United States Marine who was a member of Atomwaffen, was recorded chanting \"White Lives Matter\" and \"You Will Not Replace Us\" with his fellow torch-bearing protestors on the first day. On the second day he beat up a transgender woman named Emily Gorcenski with a modified version of the Confederate flag which incorporated the neo-Nazi Schwarze Sonne (Black Sun) symbol in the center, even bragging about the beating in private chats under the alias of \"VasillistheGreek\": \"So to sum it up what I did Friday, dropped kicked that tranny that made video crying\", \"Today cracked 3 skulls open with virtually no damage to myself\", and \"I drop kicked Emily gorcenski\". Pistolis had promoted the Unite the Right rally on Twitter under the account @Gopnik_Gestapo, and posted an image of a car running over a left-winger with the caption \"Good Night, Left Side\". He also mocked the death of Heather Heyer, calling her \"a fat cunt who died of a heart attack. She wasn't even in the way of the car\". Although Pistolis denied that he participated in the rally or committed a violent act he was later investigated by the Marine Corps and court-martialed, then later imprisoned, in June 2018 for disobeying orders and making false statements. He was officially separated from the Corps in August.\n\n\n"}

It is governed by a charitable trust. The BTM's main aims are to financially support and promote Brooklands Museum. Principally funds are raised for the Museum through subscriptions to the BTM and by additional fund raising activities throughout the year such as an annual Classic Car Show & Jumble, a series of popular talks and other events The BTM also fund specific projects such as the restoration of the Pratts petrol pagoda which was opened in October 2010 by HRH Prince Michael of Kent, the replacement of the Test Hill railings and the recreation of the iconic Brooklands Scoreboard.\n\nConstruction of Brooklands motor racing circuit began in 1906 after the land owner, Hugh Fortescue Locke-King, visited the Targa Florio and Brescia, Italy and wanted to create a place in England where motor racing could occur away from normal public roads. The track was constructed in less than a year opening in 1907. It flourished as both a motor racing circuit and aviation centre until 1914 and the advent of World War I. Reopening in 1920 Brooklands once again became prominent in motor racing and aviation. In 1939 the circuit was closed once again and did not re open.\n\nAfter many years of industrial neglect, the site now being owned by Vickers (later British Aircraft Corporation and British Aerospace), the \"Brooklands Society\" formed in 1967 with the intention to preserve as much of the remaining track and buildings as possible. Following the sale of the land by British Aerospace a charitable trust was formed in 1987 with the intention of starting a Museum dedicated to the Brooklands site and based on the original 1907 clubhouse. Following negotiations with the new landowners, Gallaghers, the Museum was established on thirty acres surrounding the clubhouse including the Members banking and Test Hill.\n\nTo raise funds and support for the Museum two new groups were formed, principally the \"Friends of Brooklands Museum\" but also a more prestigious entity the \"Brooklands Club\". After initial renovation the Museum opened in 1991 displaying artefacts from both motoring and aviation related to the Brooklands site.\n\nIn 2007 a move was made to amalgamate the support groups for the Museum which resulted in two of them, the Friends of Brooklands Museum and the Brooklands Club joining together to form the \"Brooklands Trust Members\" under the auspices of the \"Brooklands Museum Trust\". The Brooklands Society remain independent from the Museum itself. \n\nThe BTM was officially launched in the Summer of 2008 with its first full season of activity the following year. The first chairman of the new group was Philip Strickland and the vice-chairmen were Robert Hall and Ian Macgregor. The president of the BTM was Sir Stirling Moss and he was welcomed at an inaugural dinner held at Brooklands in December 2009. \n\nIan MacGregor died in December 2010 and Robert Hall retained the vice chair at the 2011 AGM.\n\nPhilip Strickland stood down as the founding Chairman at the 2014 AGM. Neil Bailey replaced him as Chairman and Julian Grimwade joined Robert Hall as joint vice-chairmen.\n\nBy mid 2018 the BTM had around 6,400 memberships worldwide, reaching around 19,000 people through those memberships. It publishes a bi-monthly magazine for Members, the \"Brooklands Bulletin\", which went from a monochrome newsletter to full colour A5 magazine production in January 2009. There is a monthly e-mail newsletter for members only plus a website. The group also run social network pages on Facebook, Instagram, Flickr and Twitter. It organises a series of evening lectures for members at Brooklands Museum featuring speakers from the motoring and aviation fields, which have featured John Surtees and Capt. Eric Winkle Brown, as well as motoring and aviation related trips and events. \n\nThe BTM represent Brooklands Museum at numerous events and shows throughout the year which have included the Le Mans Classic and Goodwood Revival through their \"Outreach\" Team. \n\nTim Morris has been the BTM administrator/Membership Secretary since the inception of the group in 2009 and is based at Brooklands Museum. Due to increased workload he was joined by a second staff member, Jeni Larwood. They remain the only two salaried members of the BTM, all other committee and helpers are volunteers. \n\nAt the 2014 AGM Philip Strickland stood down as the founder Chairman. Neil Bailey is the current Chairman with Robert Hall and Julian Grimwade Vice Chairmen.\n\nIn June 2018 Damon Hill OBE became the second President of the Brooklands Trust Members .\n\n"}

The work was probably commissioned by Casimir II of Poland. Consisting of four books, it describes Polish history.\n\nKadłubek included in his work many legendary and anachronistic events in an attempt to connect Polish history to antiquity, for example battles against Julius Caesar or events from early medieval Poland (for example the story of Princess Wanda). Such practice was not uncommon among chronicles in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe first, second, and third books are composed as a classical dialogue, where the author positions himself as a witness of a conversation.

To compound this confusion the functionality can overlap with that of a parent database. An SQL schema is simply a namespace within a database; things within this namespace are addressed using the member operator dot \"codice_9\". This seems to be a universal among all of the implementations.\n\nA true fully (database, schema, and table) qualified query is exemplified as such: codice_10\n\nBoth a schema and a database can be used to isolate one table, \"foo\", from another like-named table \"foo\". The following is pseudo code:\n\n\nThe problem that arises is that former MySQL users will create multiple databases for one project. In this context, MySQL databases are analogous in function to PostgreSQL-schemas, insomuch as PostgreSQL lacks off-the-shelf cross-database functionality that MySQL has. Conversely, PostgreSQL has applied more of the specification implementing cross-table, cross-schema, and then left room for future cross-database functionality.\n\nMySQL aliases \"schema\" with \"database\" behind the scenes, such that codice_15 and codice_16 are analogs. It can therefore be said that MySQL has implemented cross-database functionality, skipped schema functionality entirely, and provided similar functionality into their implementation of a database. In summary, PostgreSQL fully supports schemas but lacks some functionality MySQL has with databases, while MySQL does not even attempt to support standard schemas.\n\nOracle has its own spin where creating a user is synonymous with creating a schema. Thus a database administrator can create a user called PROJECT and then create a table PROJECT.TABLE. Users can exist without schema objects, but an object is always associated with an owner (though that owner may not have privileges to connect to the database). With the 'shared-everything' Oracle RAC architecture, the same database can be opened by multiple servers concurrently. This is independent of replication, which can also be used, whereby the data is copied for use by different servers. In the Oracle implementation, a 'database' is a set of files which contains the data while the 'instance' is a set of processes (and memory) through which a database is accessed.\n\nInformix supports multiple databases in a server instance like MySQL. It supports the codice_15 syntax as a way to group DDL statements into a single unit creating all objects created as a part of the schema as a single owner. Informix supports a database mode called ANSI mode which supports creating objects with the same name but owned by different users.\n\nPostgreSQL and some other databases have recently added support for foreign schemas, which is the ability to import schemas from other servers as defined in ISO/IEC 9075-9 (published as part of ). This appears like any other schema in the database according to the SQL specification while accessing data stored either in a different database or a different server instance. The import can be made either as an entire foreign schema or merely certain tables belonging to that foreign schema. While support for ISO/IEC 9075-9 bridges the gap between the two competing philosophies surrounding schemas, MySQL and Informix maintain an implicit association between databases while ISO/IEC 9075-9 requires that any such linkages be explicit in nature.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2728830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2728830", "title": "Constable of the Tower", "text": "Constable of the Tower\n\nThe Constable of the Tower is the most senior appointment at the Tower of London. In the Middle Ages a constable was the person in charge of a castle when the owner—the king or a nobleman—was not in residence. The Constable of the Tower had a unique importance as the person in charge of the principal fortress defending the capital city of England.\n\nToday the role of Constable is a ceremonial one and mainly involves taking part in traditional ceremonies within the Tower as well as being part of the community that lives within its perimeter. The Constable is also a trustee of Historic Royal Palaces and of the Royal Armouries. \n\nUnder the \"Queen's Regulations for the Army\", the office of Constable is conferred upon a field marshal or a retired general officer for a five-year term. The Constable appointed in 2016 is General Sir Nick Houghton.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Constable's Installation ceremony, the Lord Chamberlain symbolically hands over the Queen’s House to the Constable. He in turn entrusts it to the Resident Governor, who is responsible for the day-to-day running of Her Majesty’s Palace and Fortress, the Tower of London.\n\nThe office of Constable of the Tower is one of the oldest in England, dating back to within a few years of the Conquest, and has always been one of great honour and dignity. In the past, this appointment has been held by eminent prelates of the Church, prominent politicians and distinguished soldiers. The first Constable, Geoffrey de Mandeville was appointed by William the Conqueror (AD 1066-87) in the 11th century. Formerly, in the absence of the Sovereign, the Constable would have been among the most powerful men in London. Today the Constable retains the right of direct access to the Sovereign. Since 1784 the Constable has always been a senior military officer.\n\nDuring the medieval period the Constable ran the Tower which included building maintenance, soldiers' pay and, as the Royal menagerie was housed in the Tower, supervision of the 'Keeper of the King’s Animals'. He was also ultimately responsible for the prisoners kept there. The first known prisoner was the Norman bishop Ranulf Flambard in 1100, and the London gangsters Ronnie and Reggie Kray were the last official prisoners, for a few days in 1952, for refusing to do their National Service. They were sent to the Tower as it was the barracks of the 1st Battalion Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) to which they had been assigned.\n\nThe Constable’s responsibility for prisoners was made clear in the words with which he was entrusted with them: “You are to guard them securely in the prison of our said tower in such a way that you shall answer for them body for body ... Fail in no part of this on pain of forfeiture of life and limb and all property you hold in our realms.”\n\nUntil the expulsion of the Jews in 1290, the Constable was responsible for the regulation and protection of London's Jewry.\n\nUntil 1899, the Constable also held the office of Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets.\nThe Tower Hamlets was an area of SE Middlesex that urbanised as inner East London and included the area of the eponymous modern borough and most of what is now the London Borough of Hackney. \n\nThis was an unusual arrangement as Lord Lieutenancy powers were usually exercised at county level; they enabled the Constable to raise local forces to supplement the Tower garrison at times of increased tension, or for use in the field.\n\nIn the Middle Ages it was a profitable position; among the Constable’s entitlements were:\n\nEvery ship that came upstream to London had to moor at Tower Wharf to give a portion of its cargo to the Constable, as payment for the protection afforded by the Tower's cannon. These dues included oysters, mussels, cockles, rushes, and wine. The tradition is still maintained today by the Royal Navy, at the annual Ceremony of the Constable's Dues, when one large vessel presents the Constable with a barrel of rum.\n\nSince 1784 the tradition has been for the Constable to be a senior military officer, usually a general officer. Perhaps the most famous Constable was Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who served from 1825 to 1852. During his tenure, the royal menagerie and record office were removed and many buildings were restored to their medieval state. The moat was drained and converted into a parade ground. Yeomen Warders were no longer permitted to buy and sell their places but were to be drawn only from sergeants in the Army. To His Grace's displeasure, tourism at the Tower increased during his Constableship.\n\nEach Constable is now appointed for five years. The new Constable is handed the keys as a symbol of office. On state occasions the Constable has custody of the crown and other royal jewels.\n\nThis is an incomplete list of people who have served as Constable of the Tower of London, a post traditionally combined with that of Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets.\n\n\n"}

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 for its association with the latter White, whose influential decision in \"Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States\", while resulting in the breakup of Standard Oil, weakened the Sherman Antitrust Act by its adoption of the rule of reason.\n\nThe house was built from hand-hewn cypress as a Creole-style raised cottage. The house was built on the banks of Bayou Lafourche facing what is now Louisiana Highway 1. E.D. White, Sr. purchased the property in 1829 from Guillaume Arcement, and around 1834 began remodeling the house to reflect the prevalent Greek revival style of architecture. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\n\nThe main floor includes a central hallway dividing four rooms, reflecting the typical symmetry of Greek Revival architecture. An inverted stairwell at the end of the hall leads to two bedrooms on the second floor. The high ceilings, wide front gallery, and raised brick cellar served to cool the house during the summer.\n\nThe house is owned by the Louisiana State Museum and is operated as a historic house museum known as the E.

{"id": "220066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220066", "title": "Encyclopedia Galactica", "text": "Encyclopedia Galactica\n\nThe Encyclopedia Galactica is a fictional or hypothetical encyclopedia containing all the knowledge accumulated by a galaxy-spanning civilization. The name evokes the exhaustive aspects of the real-life \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\n\"Encyclopedia Galactica\" first appeared in Isaac Asimov's short story \"Foundation\" (\"Astounding Science Fiction\", May 1942), later republished as \"The Encyclopedists\" in the short-story collection \"Foundation\" (1951). Asimov's \"Encyclopedia Galactica\" was a compendium of all knowledge then available in the Galactic Empire, intended to preserve that knowledge in a remote region of the galaxy in the event of a foreseen galactic catastrophe. The \"Encyclopedia\" is later revealed to be an element in an act of misdirection, with its real purpose being to concentrate a group of knowledgeable scientists on a remote, resource-poor planet, with the long-term aim of revitalizing the technologically stagnant and scientifically dormant empire. Originally published in a physical medium, it later becomes computerized and subject to continual change.\n\nAsimov used the \"Encyclopedia Galactica\" as a literary device throughout his \"Foundation\" series, beginning many of the book sections or chapters with a short extract from the \"Encyclopedia\" discussing a key character or event in the story.\n\nTheodore Wein considers the Encyclopedia Galactica as possibly inspired by a reference in H.G. Wells' \"The Shape of Things to Come\" (1933). The future world envisioned by Wells includes an \"Encyclopaedic organization which centres upon Barcelona, with seventeen million active workers\" and which is tasked with creating \"the Fundamental Knowledge System which accumulates, sorts, keeps in order and renders available everything that is known\". As pointed out by Wein, this Wells book was at its most well-known and influential in the late 1930's - coinciding with \"the period of incubation\" when the young Asimov became interested in Science Fiction, reading a lot of it and starting to formulate his own ideas.\n\nVarious authors have invoked the \"Encyclopædia Galactica\" in both science and science fiction. The first may have been author Frank Holby's short story \"The Strange Case of the Missing Hero\" in the July 1942 issue of \"Astounding Science Fiction\" which featured Sebastian Lelong, editor of the \"Encyclopedia\". It was also a common fixture in previous incarnations of the Legion of Super-Heroes comic books, and has appeared in the \"Star Wars\" expanded universe and Superman comics set in the future. The \"Encyclopedia Galactica\" was also mentioned as being a collection of all the knowledge of a galactic Empire in the science fiction short story called \"The Originist\", which was written by American novelist Orson Scott Card in 1989, and took place in Isaac Asimov's fictional \"Foundation\" Universe.\n\nIn the comic science fiction series by Douglas Adams, the \"Galactica\" is frequently contrasted with the apparently more popular \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\":\n\nRobert A. Heinlein mentioned the Encyclopedia in chapter three of \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\" (1987): \"... the computer that led the Lunar Revolution on time line three, code 'Neil Armstrong.' Let's skip the details; it's all in \"Encyclopedia Galacta\" (sic) and other books.\"\n\nIn Arthur C. Clarke's and Gentry Lee's novel \"Rama II\" (1989), Nicole des Jardins says to Richard Wakefield, \"Just think, the sum of everything all human beings know or have ever known might be nothing more than an infinitesimal fraction of the \"Encyclopedia Galactica\".\"\n\nThere was a series of five video documentaries entitled \"Encyclopædia Galactica\" in 1993, with the titles “The Inner Solar System”, “The Outer Solar System”, “Star Trekking”, “Discovery”, and “Astronomy and the Stars”. The videos were produced by York Films of England and distributed by Encyclopædia Britannica (Australia). Other entities associated with the production of the video series were Encyclopædia Britannica Educational Corporation, The Learning Channel, The Discovery Channel Europe, S4C Wales, System TV France and Yleisradio Finland.\n\nThere was an \"Encyclopedia Galactica: from the Fleet Library aboard the Battlestar Galactica\" published in 1978. Aimed at a juvenile audience, this was a tie in to the \"Battlestar Galactica\" television series being broadcast at the time.\n\nThe term has been used in non-fictional contexts as well. One example is its use by Carl Sagan (1934–1996) in his 1980 book \"Cosmos\", and his documentary , to refer to a text where hypothetical extraterrestrial civilizations could store all of their information and knowledge.\n\nWikipedia has been described as an \"Encyclopedia\" \"Galactica\" since early in its history (2005). These comparisons have been to both the Asimov version, and the Adams version, due to its comprehensive coverage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55726", "title": "Gentlemen's agreement", "text": "Gentlemen's agreement\n\nA gentlemen's agreement or gentleman's agreement is an informal and legally non-binding agreement between two or more parties. It is typically oral, though it may be written, or simply understood as part of an unspoken agreement by convention or through mutually beneficial etiquette. The essence of a gentlemen's agreement is that it relies upon the honor of the parties for its fulfillment, rather than being in any way enforceable. It is, therefore, distinct from a legal agreement or contract, which can be enforced if necessary.\n\nThe phrase appears in British Parliamentary records of 1821, and in Massachusetts public records of 1835. The Oxford English Dictionary cites P. G. Wodehouse's 1929 story collection \"Mr Mulliner Speaking\" as the first appearance of the term.\n\nA gentleman's agreement, defined in the early 20th century as \"an agreement between gentlemen looking toward the control of prices,\" was reported by one source to be the loosest form of a \"pool\". These types of agreements have been reported to be found in every type of industry, and are numerous in the steel and iron industries.\n\nA report from the United States House of Representatives detailing their investigation of the United States Steel Corporation asserted that there were two general types of loose associations or consolidations between steel and iron interests in the 1890s, in which the individual concerns retained ownership as well as a large degree of independence: the \"pool\" and the \"gentleman's agreement\". The latter type lacked any formal organization to regulate output or prices, nor did they contain any provisions for forfeiture in the event of an infraction. The efficacy of the agreement relied on members to keep informal pledges.\n\nIn the automotive industry, Japanese manufacturers agreed that no production car would have more than ; this agreement ended in 2005. German manufacturers limit the top speed of high-performance saloons (sedans) and station wagons to . When the Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle exceeded in 1999, fears of a European ban or regulatory crackdown led Japanese and European motorcycle makers to agree to a limit of 300 km/h (186 mph) in late 1999. \"See List of fastest production motorcycles\".\n\nIntense anti-Japanese sentiment developed on the West Coast. US President Theodore Roosevelt did not want to anger Japan by passing legislation to bar Japanese immigration to the US, as had been done for Chinese immigration. Instead, there was an informal \"Gentlemen's Agreement\" (1907–8) between the United States and Japan, whereby Japan made sure there was very little or no movement to the US. The agreements were made by Secretary of State, Elihu Root, and Japan's Foreign Minister, Tadasu Hayashi. The agreement banned emigration of Japanese laborers to the US and rescinded the segregation order of the San Francisco School Board in California, which had humiliated and angered the Japanese. The agreement did not apply to the Territory of Hawaii, which was treated at the time as separate and distinct from the US. The agreements remained effective until 1924, when Congress forbade all immigration from Japan.\n\nGentlemen's agreements have come to regulate international activities such as the coordination of monetary or trade policies. According to Edmund Osmańczyk in the \"Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements\", it is also defined as \"an international term for an agreement made orally rather than in writing, yet fully legally valid\". This type of agreement may allow a nation to avoid the domestic legal requirements to enter into a formal treaty, or it may be useful when a government wants to enter into a secret agreement that is not binding upon the next administration. According to another author, all international agreements are gentlemen's agreements because, short of war, they are \"all\" unenforceable. Osmańczyk pointed out that there is a difference between open gentlemen's agreements and secret diplomatic agreements. In the United States, a prohibition against gentlemen's agreements in commercial relations between states was introduced in 1890, because the secretive nature of such agreements was beyond anyone's control.\n\nIn English contract law, for an agreement to be binding, there must be an intention to create legal relations; but in commercial dealings (i.e. agreements that are not between family members or friends) there is a legal presumption of an \"intention to create legal relations\". However, in the 1925 case of \"Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd\", the House of Lords held that the phrase, \"This arrangement is not ... a formal or legal agreement ... but is only a record of the intention of the parties\" was sufficient to rebut the said presumption.\n\nGentlemen's agreements were a widely used discriminatory tactic reportedly more common than restrictive covenants in preserving the homogeneity of upper-class neighborhoods and suburbs in the United States. The nature of these agreements made them extremely difficult to prove or to track, and were effective long after the United States Supreme Court's rulings in \"Shelley v. Kraemer\" and \"Barrows v. Jackson\". One source states that gentlemen's agreements \"undoubtedly still exist\", but that their use has greatly diminished.\n\nUntil Jackie Robinson was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946, a gentlemen's agreement ensured that African American players were excluded from organized baseball.\n\n"}

It was ratified on 15 November 1959, at an SPD party convention in the town of Bad Godesberg, which is today part of Bonn.\n\nThe Godesberg program represented a fundamental change in the orientation and goals of the SPD. It rejected the goal of replacing capitalism, adopting a commitment to reform capitalism, and adopted a \"people's\" party orientation that appealed to ethical considerations and ejected its class-based orientation. Godesberg rejected nationalization as a major principle of socialism.\n\nThe Godesberg program was also notable because the party abandoned and rejected Marxist theories of materialism and class struggle. In adopting the Godesberg Program, the SPD dropped its hostility to capitalism, which had long been the core of party ideology, and sought to move beyond its old working class base to embrace the full spectrum of potential voters, adopting a political ideology grounded in ethical appeals.\n\nLabor unions had abandoned the old demands for nationalization and instead cooperated increasingly with industry, achieving labor representation on corporate boards and increases in wages and benefits. The SPD, after losing national elections in 1953 and 1957, thus moved toward an American-style image-driven electoral strategy that stressed personalities, specifically Berlin mayor Willy Brandt. As it prepared for elections in 1961, it proved necessary as well in 1960 to drop opposition to rearmament and to accept NATO.\n\nThe Godesberg Program was superseded in 1989 by the Berlin Program, resolved on the 20th of December 1989 at a party congress in Berlin.\n\n\n"}

For example, in 1984, St Kitts and Nevis began its program which offered not only permanent residency but citizenship to foreign nations.\n\nThe issuing of golden visas expanded dramatically during the 21st century with around 25% of all countries issuing such visas as of 2015. Statistics on the issuing of golden visas is scarce but the IMF estimated in 2015 that the vast majority of golden visas are issued to Chinese nationals.\n\nGolden visas require investments of anywhere from $100,000 in Dominica up to £2,000,000 in the U.K.. The most common method for obtaining a golden visa is through the purchase of real estate with a minimum value. \n\"Golden visas\" have been especially popular with Chinese nationals, over 100,000 of whom acquired them during the period from 2007 to 2016.\n\nPortugal's golden visa was introduced during the Great Recession in order to help attract investment into the country's housing market. By 2016 the country had issued 2,788 golden visas of which 80% had gone to Chinese nationals. \n\nSome countries such as Malta and Cyprus also offer citizenship (\"so-called golden passports\") to individuals if they invest a certain sum.\nThe issuing of so called \"golden visas\" has sparked controversy in several countries. A lack of demonstrable economic benefits and security concerns have been among the most common criticisms of golden visas. In 2014 the Canadian government suspended their golden visa program (although, as of 2017, Quebec maintains their golden visa program). The golden visas has been criticized by members of the European Parliament for disfavoring the concept of citizenship and in 2014 the European Parliament approved a non-binding resolution that an EU passport should not have a \"price tag.\"\n\n"}

It is located at its central axis, behind the Gate of Supreme Harmony. Built above three levels of marble stone base, and surrounded by bronze incense burners, the Hall of Supreme Harmony is one of the largest wooden structures within China. It was the location where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties hosted their enthronement and wedding ceremonies. The name of the Hall was changed several times throughout the past few centuries, from its initial Fengtian Dian (奉天殿), later to Huangji Dian (皇极殿) in 1562 and to the current one by the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty in 1645.\n\nTogether with the Hall of Central Harmony and Hall of Preserving Harmony, the three halls constitute the heart of the Outer Court of the Forbidden City.\n\nThe Hall of Supreme Harmony rises some 30 meters above the level of the surrounding square. It is the ceremonial center of imperial power, and the largest surviving wooden structure in China. It is eleven bays wide - of which the main room being nine bays wide - and five bays deep, the numbers nine and five being symbolically connected to the majesty of the Emperor. The six pillars nearest the imperial throne are covered with gold, and the entire area is decorated with a dragon motif. The Dragon Throne, in particular, has five dragons coiled around the back and handrests. The screen behind it features sets of nine dragons, again reflecting the \"nine-five\" symbolism. The Hall of Supreme Harmony features an exquisite throne made of red sandalwood, and formerly used by the emperors of the Qing dynasty.\n\nSet into the ceiling directly above the throne is an intricate caisson decorated with a coiled dragon, from the mouth of which issues a chandelier-like set of metal balls, called the \"Xuanyuan Mirror\", a reference to the Yellow Emperor, a mythological Chinese ruler. According to legend, the metal balls will fall and strike dead any usurper to the throne.\n\nIn the Ming dynasty, the emperors held court here to discuss affairs of state. During the Qing dynasty, emperors held court far more frequently. As a result, the location was changed to the Inner Court, and the Hall of Supreme Harmony was only used for ceremonial purposes, such as enthronements, investitures, and imperial weddings.\n\nThe original hall was built in 1406 during the Ming dynasty, destroyed seven times by fires during the Qing dynasty, and rebuilt for the last time in 1695–1697. After a reconstruction in the 16th century, the dimensions of the hall was reduced from around 95m by 48m to its present measurements, 64m by 37m; inability to find sufficiently large logs was cited as the cause for this change.\n\n"}

The author is unknown, however, it has been accepted that it was written and rewritten by several different authors from different time periods in history with the aim to improvise the tale to fit the society at that certain periods of time.\n\nThe most memorable chapter in the work concerns a duel between Hang Tuah and his closest friend, Hang Jebat. Hang Tuah was falsely accused of adultery with one of his king's maids by his jealous rivals. Upon hearing the accusation, the king ordered Hang Tuah killed, without a further investigation of his alleged offense. Hang Tuah was secretly saved, however, by his executioner, the Bendahara.\n\nHang Jebat was aware that Hang Tuah was being unjustly punished and in a show of support and deep loyalty for his friend, revolted against the sultan. The sultan's forces were unable to suppress Hang Jebat.\n\nThe sultan later came to realize that Hang Tuah was innocent, and immediately regretted sentencing Hang Tuah to death. The Bendahara then told the sultan that Hang Tuah was still alive, and that only Hang Tuah could suppress Hang Jebat's rebellion. Hang Tuah was immediately recalled and given amnesty. After seven days of fighting, Hang Tuah managed to kill Hang Jebat.\n\nHowever, according to the Malay Annals, it was Hang Kasturi that fought with Hang Tuah instead of Hang Jebat.\n\nMalay culture holds the Hang Tuah legends in extremely high regard. In fact, one of the hottest debates in Malay literature centers on the duel between Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat. Hang Tuah is a symbol of absolute loyalty to a ruler while Hang Jebat symbolizes freedom and justice. Hence, there is the question of who is right.\n\nThough it is generally perceived that there were five friends, there is doubt that Hang Lekir and Hang Lekiu are indeed two different persons. In the Jawi script, the letter \"ﺭ\" (ra) and the letter \"ﻭ\" (wow) look similar and those were part of the nouns \"Leki-r\" and \"Leki-u\". Due to the similarity, the differentiation of Lekir and Lekiu might be due to mistranslation. Many historians and literature experts disagree however, and point out that the five friends are a Malay version of the five warriors of Lord Krishna from the Mahabharata.\n\nApart from that, Hikayat Hang Tuah is highly critical of the Javanese and deals with the rivalry between the Malay Sultanate of Malacca and the Javanese Majapahit Empire. In the literary work, many of the crooks and the villains were from Majapahit or Java. The king of Majapahit is depicted as an indecisive person and Majapahit's grand vizier, Gajah Mada, as sly, cunning and unsympathetic.\n\nThe text is believed dated since 1700, the manuscript was dated in 1849. The Hikayat Hang Tuah was first published in 1908, edited by Sulaiman bin Muhammed Nur and William Shellabear.\n\n\"Hikayat Hang Tuah\" was listed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme International Register in 2001.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "901041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=901041", "title": "Hossbach Memorandum", "text": "Hossbach Memorandum\n\nThe Hossbach Memorandum was the summary of a meeting on 5 November 1937 between German dictator Adolf Hitler and his military and foreign policy leadership in which Hitler's future expansionist policies were outlined. The meeting marked a turning point in Hitler's foreign policies, which then began to radicalize.\n\nAccording to the memorandum, Hitler did not want war in 1939 with Britain and France. He wanted small wars of plunder to help support Germany's struggling economy. It was named for the keeper of the minutes of the meeting, Hitler's military adjutant, Colonel Count Friedrich Hossbach. Also attending the meeting were the Reich Foreign Minister, Baron Konstantin von Neurath; the Reich War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg; the Army Commander, General Werner von Fritsch; the Kriegsmarine Commander, Admiral Erich Raeder; and the Luftwaffe Commander, Hermann Göring.\n\nThe conference of 5 November 1937 had been called in response to complaints from Admiral Raeder that the navy (\"Kriegsmarine\") was receiving insufficient allocations of steel and other raw materials and that its entire building programme was thus in danger of collapse. Neither the air force (\"Luftwaffe\") nor the army (\"Wehrmacht\") wanted to see any reductions of their steel allocations. As the conference had been called in response to resolve the dispute, Hitler took the opportunity to provide a summary of his assessment of foreign policy.\n\nHe stated that if he dies, the contents of the conference were to be regarded as his \"political testament\". In Hitler's view, the German economy had reached such a state of crisis that the only way of stopping a drastic fall in living standards in Germany was to embark on a policy of aggression sooner, rather than later, to provide sufficient \"Lebensraum\" by seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia. Moreover, Hitler announced that it was imperative to act at some time within the next five or six years before \"two hate-inspired antagonists\", Britain and France, closed the gap in the arms race in which, Hitler noted, Germany was already falling behind.\n\nA striking change in the Hossbach Memorandum is Hitler's new evaluation of Britain: from a prospective ally in 1928 in the \"Zweites Buch\" to a \"hate-inspired antagonist\" in 1937 that was unwilling and unable to accept a strong Germany. The change marked a total reversal of Hitler's view of Britain.\n\nGerman historian Klaus Hildebrand has argued that the memorandum marked the beginning of an \"ambivalent course\" towards Britain. Likewise, the late Andreas Hillgruber contended that Hitler was embarking on expansion \"without Britain\": preferably \"with Britain\" but, if necessary, \"against Britain\". \n\nThe first part of the document minuted Hitler's wish that Germany for autarky, as he reasoned that reliance on others makes a state weak. That has been labelled by some historians as a way of preparing Germany for conflict by ensuring that it was not economically reliant on states with which it could soon be at war. The memorandum's suggestion that certain types of autarky were not possible can thus be considered to be reasons for regarding the war as something of a necessity.\n\nAutarky:\nAchievement only possible under strict National Socialist leadership of the State, which is assumed. Accepting its achievement as possible, the following could be stated as results: \n\nIndeed, the economic arguments appear to all but guarantee a war of fears for food supplies being reliant upon foreign trade in a world that was dominated by British-policed sea trade lanes:\n\n'There was a pronounced military weakness in those states which depended for their existence on foreign trade. As our foreign trade was carried on over the sea routes dominated by Britain, it was more a question of security of transport than one of foreign exchange, which revealed, in time of war, the full weakness of our food situation. The only remedy, and one which might appear to us as visionary, lay in the acquisition of greater living space – a quest which has at all times been the origin of the formation of states and of the migration of peoples'.\n\nThe second part of the document detailed three 'contingencies' that Hitler would take if certain situations prevailed in Europe, purportedly to ensure the security of the \"Reich\". Beyond that, Hitler claimed that two “hate-inspired antagonists\" (Britain and France) were blocking German foreign policy goals at every turn and that sometime in the next five years or so, Germany would have to achieve autarky by seizing Eastern Europe to prepare for a possible war with the British and the French.\n\nAfter the conference, three of the attendees (Blomberg, Fritsch and Neurath) all argued that the foreign policy Hitler had outlined was too risky, as Germany needed more time to rearm. Also, they stated that the 'contingencies' that Hitler described as the prerequisite for war were too unlikely to occur such as the apparent certainty expressed in the document of the Spanish Civil War leading to a Franco-Italian war in the Mediterranean or that France was on the verge of civil war. Moreover, it was argued that any German aggression in Eastern Europe was bound to trigger a war with France because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called \"cordon sanitaire\", and if that a Franco-German war broke out, Britain was almost certain to intervene to prevent France's defeat. Thus, any German attack on the states of Eastern Europe like Czechoslovakia was likely to lead to war with the British and the French before Germany was fully rearmed and ready for war with the other great powers. As such, Fritsch, Blomberg and Neurath advised Hitler to wait until Germany had more time to rearm before pursuing a high-risk strategy of pursuing localized wars that was likely to trigger a general war before Germany was ready for such a war (all of those present at the conference had no moral objections to Hitler's strategy, but they were divided only on timing) By February 1938, Neurath, Fritsch and Blomberg had been removed from their positions. Some historians, such as Sir John Wheeler-Bennett and William L. Shirer, believed that Blomberg, Fritsch and Neurath were removed because of their opposition to the plans expressed in the Hossbach memorandum.\n\nThe accuracy of the memorandum has been questioned, as the minutes were drawn up five days after the event by Hossbach from notes that he took at the meeting and also from memory. Also, Hitler did not review the minutes of the meeting, instead and insisted, as he commonly did, that he was too busy to bother with such small details. The British historian AJP Taylor contended that the manuscript that was used by the prosecution in the Nuremberg Trials appears to be a shortened version of the original, as it had passed through the US Army before the trial. Taylor drew attention to one thing that the memorandum can be used to prove; 'Goering, Raeder and Neurath had sat by and approved of Hitler's aggressive plans'. However, that did not necessarily mean that Hitler laid down his plans for the domination of Europe, as there was no active decision to start a war made in the memorandum, only a decision about when war would be practical. However, Hitler mentioned his wish for increased armaments.\n\nTaylor attempted to discredit the document by using the fact that the future annexations described in the 'contingencies' were unlike those that occurred in 1939. However, opposing historians, such as Taylor's archrival, Hugh Trevor-Roper, have pointed out that the memorandum still demonstrated an intention for adding Austria, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania and Poland to the \"Reich\". Taylor also stipulated that the meeting was most likely a piece of internal politics, and he pointed out that Hitler could have been trying to encourage the gathering's members to put pressure on Reich Minister of Economics and President of the \"Reichsbank\", Hjalmar Schacht, to release more funding for rearmament. In fact, Schacht soon resigned in protest at the pre-eminence of rearmament in Nazi economics. Contending historians have also pointed out that rearmament is an integral part of a preparation for conflict. In response, Taylor argued that Hitler's policy was a bluff (he wished to rearm Germany to frighten and intimidate other states) to allow him to achieve his foreign policy goals without going to war.\n\nIn addition, Taylor argued that most of the 'contingencies' that Hitler listed as the prerequisite for war, such as an outbreak of civil war in France or the Spanish Civil War that led to a war between Italy and France in the Mediterranean, did not occur. Trevor-Roper countered that criticism by arguing that Hitler expressed an intention to go to war sooner rather than later and that it was Hitler's intentions in foreign policy in late 1937, as opposed to his precise plans later in history, that really mattered.\n\nIt is often used by intentionalist historians such as Gerhard Weinberg, Andreas Hillgruber and Richard Overy to prove that Hitler planned to start a general European war, which became the Second World War, as part of a longtime master plan. However, functionalist historians such as Timothy Mason, Hans Mommsen and Ian Kershaw argue that the document shows no such plans but the memorandum was an improvised \"ad hoc\" response by Hitler to the growing crisis in the German economy in the late 1930s.\n\nAJP Taylor dismissed the memorandum as evidence of Hitler's intent, pointing out that the document had already been edited by US lawyers during the Nuremberg Trials, that most of the people who attended the meeting were dismissed soon afterwards and that the actual memorandum itself was filed away and forgotten. Instead, Taylor believes that the meeting was merely an attempt by Hitler to drum up support from the military.\n\n\n"}

In more detail, Bacon enumerated several specific such barriers to science which are part of human nature, coming into this category:\n\n\nBacon said that the Idols of the Tribe \"take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit, or from its preoccupation, or from its narrowness, or from its restless motion, or from an infusion of the affections, or from the incompetency of the senses, or from the mode of impression\".\n\n\n"}

It consists of a formal requirements specification for a generic electronic records management system, accompanied by testing documentation and related information. Published in 2008 by the European Commission, it is intended for use across the European Union, but can be used elsewhere. MoReq2 is generally considered a de facto standard in Europe but it does not have any formal status as a standard.\n\nThe MoReq2 specification is intended for users and suppliers of electronic records management systems and services, and educators. Its main intended usages are to serve as a basis for invitations to tender (also known as requests for proposal) and as a framework to guide development of new electronic records management systems. It can also be used to provide a basis for auditing existing electronic records management systems or services, and as a resource for academic or commercial trainers.\n\nAll the components of MoReq2, as well as translations and Chapters Zero (see below), are free to download from the official MoReq website. They are also available from several other websites. The requirements specification is also available in paper form from the European Commission as .\n\nThe original MoReq was first conceived in the late 1990s by the DLM Forum (a European not-for-profit body), following the development and publication of US DoD 5015.2 by the United States Department of Defense. MoReq was intended to serve the same function as 5015.2, namely to describe a good electronic records management system; but whereas 5015.2 was designed specifically for the US defence community, MoReq was designed from the outset to be useful across the European Union and in any sector or industry. 5015.2 and MoReq therefore differ because the former is a standard that defines the mandatory behaviours of a system, whereas MoReq provides guidelines that define the capabilities of a good generic system – not all of which need be mandatory in a specific instance.\n\nDevelopment of the first version of MoReq was funded by the European Commission, and took place during 2000. MoReq was developed by a team of consultants supported by and Editorial Board of international experts. The resulting specification, frequently referred to (informally) as MoReq1, was published in 2001.\n\nMoReq1 was received enthusiastically, being the subject of about a dozen translations and adaptations. However, its success was not accompanied by any form of governance or development; and there was no MoReq1 compliance testing programme. This prompted the DLM Forum to initiate the development of a major update, which was to become known as MoReq2.\n\nFollowing the production of a scoping study report, the European Commission funded development of MoReq2. The development was once again performed by consultants, this time supported by panels of volunteer reviewers as well as by an Editorial Board of international experts. The panels were drawn from:\n\n\nThe volunteer panellists were drawn from 35 countries, and over 100 contributed actively to the review process.\n\nIn March 2010, the DLM Forum signed a contract to develop a new version of MoReq, to be known as MoReq2010; this was published in mid-2011.\n\nA compliance testing scheme was launched by the DLM Forum in Summer 2008. This scheme allows suppliers of electronic records management systems to submit their products for formal compliance testing. Suppliers can choose any testing centre accredited by the DLM Forum, and the results are applicable across Europe. Compliance testing requires that the core MoReq2 requirements are met; at the option of the supplier, requirements of any combination of 13 the optional modules. The first software product which has been MoReq2-certified is (Fabasoft Folio). It is at this time (June 2014) the only one worldwide.\n\nMoReq2 is designed specifically to be an evolutionary upgrade of MoReq1. In addition to specifying functional requirements for a good, generic, electronic records management system it includes:\nIn addition the MoReq2 structure allows for countries to develop country-specific, language-specific, or region-specific “Chapters Zero” that take account of linguistic differences, national and regional legislation, national standards etc.\n\nThe DLM Forum has established a MoReq Governance Board to guide the future development of MoReq.

De facto and de jure, Dovzhenko Centre is the state enterprise, the National Film Fund. It is the only Member of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) in Ukraine.\n\nThe need to create a state film archive arose upon Ukraine's independence. Before 1991 all the negative prints of all films produced in Ukraine were sent to be stored at the \"All-Union State Film Fund of USSR\" (Gosfilmofond). After declaration of Ukrainian independence all negative prints of the new films remained to be stored at the studies which produced them.\n\nNational Oleksandr Dovzhenko Centre was created on September 10, 1994 under the Decree of the President of Ukraine «On events to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Oleksandr Dovzhenko» and the Decree of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine from November 1, 1994 «On creation of the National Centre of Oleksandr Dovzhenko in Kyiv» as a state enterprise. In 1999 National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Centre was merged with the Kyiv Film Copying factory according to the order № 161 of the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine.\n\nSince 2006, the Dovzhenko Centre is a Member of the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF). \nDovzhenko Centre is subordinate to the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine and the State Film Agency of Ukraine.\n\nThe Dovzhenko Centre embraces the only state film copying laboratory in Ukraine, which employs highly qualified professionals with immense experience. Our company has 60 years of experience in handling film prints, which we are proud of. Here the first color films in the Soviet Union Grunya Kurnakova and Mikado Palace were made, as well as panoramic and widescreen positive prints for many countries in Europe, Asia and Africa were printed.\n\nAlready in independent Ukraine, such Ukrainian films as Mamay (by Oles Sanin), A Prayer for Hetman Mazepa (by Yurii Ilienko), Shtolnya (by Lyubomyr Levytskyi), Effect of Presence (by Leonid Pavlovskyi), At the River (by Eva Neuman) and others were edited and printed at the Centre.\n\nThe oldest film in Dovzhenko Centre's funds dates back to 1910. The oldest feature film produced in Soviet Ukraine was made in 1922.\n\nDovzhenko Centre is the only state enterprise in Ukraine responsible for preservation, restoration, research and increase of the National Ukrainian Film Fund. It carries out researches in the field of cinematography, publishing specialized photo albums, booklets, books and articles on the history of cinema, as well as film magazines. One of the main aims of the Centre is to promote Ukrainian cinema. \nAccording to the Law on Cinematography, all the negative prints of Ukrainian films created on public funds (including coproduction) are to be stored at Dovzhenko Centre.\n\nDuring 2007-2010 Dovzhenko Centre funded restoration of the films by Oleksandr Dovzhenko, Ivan Mykolaychuk, Yurii Illienko, which were subsequently released on DVD. Due to the format of gift sets, these collections were not on sale and remained inaccessible to the public. \nSince 2011 Dovzhenko Center has initiated a program to promote Ukrainian cinema: every two month KOLO DZIGI performances silent film screenings accompanied by live contemporary music are held, several times a year retrospectives of Ukrainian cinema classics are organized, etc.\n\n\n"}

The standard is designed to simplify parallel programming of heterogeneous CPU/GPU systems.\n\nAs in OpenMP, the programmer can annotate C, C++ and Fortran source code to identify the areas that should be accelerated using compiler directives and additional functions. Like OpenMP 4.0 and newer, OpenACC can target both the CPU and GPU architectures and launch computational code on them.\n\nOpenACC members have worked as members of the OpenMP standard group to merge into OpenMP specification to create a common specification which extends OpenMP to support accelerators in a future release of OpenMP. These efforts resulted in a technical report for comment and discussion timed to include the annual Supercomputing Conference (November 2012, Salt Lake City) and to address non-Nvidia accelerator support with input from hardware vendors who participate in OpenMP.\n\nAt ISC’12 OpenACC was demonstrated to work on Nvidia, AMD and Intel accelerators, without performance data.\n\nIn November 12, 2012, at the SC12 conference, a draft of the OpenACC version 2.0 specification was presented. New suggested capabilities include new controls over data movement (such as better handling of unstructured data and improvements in support for non-contiguous memory), and support for explicit function calls and separate compilation (allowing the creation and reuse of libraries of accelerated code). OpenACC 2.0 was officially released in June 2013.\n\nVersion 2.5 of the specification was released on October 2015. The latest version of specification, version 2.6, was released on November 2017.\n\nSupport of OpenACC is available in commercial compilers from PGI (from version 12.6), and (for Cray hardware only) Cray.\n\nOpenUH is an Open64 based open source OpenACC compiler supporting C and FORTRAN, developed by HPCTools group from University of Houston.\n\nOpenARC is an open source C compiler developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to support all features in the OpenACC 1.0 specification. An experimental open source compiler, accULL, is developed by the University of La Laguna (C language only).\n\nIPMACC is an open source C compiler developed by University of Victoria that translates OpenACC to CUDA, OpenCL, and ISPC. Currently, only following directives are supported: \"data\", \"kernels\", \"loop\", and \"cache\".\n\nGCC support for OpenACC was slow in coming. A GPU-targeting implementation from Samsung was announced in September 2013; this translated OpenACC 1.1-annotated code to OpenCL. The announcement of a \"real\" implementation followed two months later, this time from NVIDIA and based on OpenACC 2.0. This sparked some controversy, as the implementation would only target NVIDIA's own PTX assembly language, for which no open source assembler or runtime was available. Experimental support for OpenACC/PTX did end up in GCC as of version 5.1. GCC6 and GCC7 release series include a much improved implementation of the OpenACC 2.0a specification.\n\nIn a way similar to OpenMP 3.x on homogeneous system or the earlier OpenHMPP, the primary mode of programming in OpenACC is directives. The specifications also include a runtime library defining several support functions. To exploit them, user should include \"openacc.h\" in C or \"openacc_lib.h\" in Fortran; and then call \"acc_init()\" function.\n\nOpenACC defines an extensive list of pragmas (directives), for example:\n\nBoth are used to define parallel computation kernels to be executed on the accelerator, using distinct semantics\nIs the main directive to define and copy data to and from the accelerator.\nIs used to define the type of parallelism in a codice_1 or codice_2 region.\n\nThere are some runtime API functions defined too: codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7,\ncodice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16.\n\nOpenACC generally takes care of work organisation for the target device however this can be overridden through the use of gangs and workers. A gang consists of workers and operates over a number of processing elements (as with a workgroup in OpenCL).\n\n\n"}

Found at operabase.com, it was created in 1996 by English software engineer and opera lover Mike Gibb. Initially a hobby site, it became his full-time occupation after three years. \"Opera\" magazine describes the Operabase website as \"the most comprehensive source of data on operatic activity\".\n\nBy its tenth anniversary, in 2006, the site received \"about 10,000 visitors a day to the public site, who look at over four million pages a month between them. Of these, fewer than half use English, 17% use German, 12% Italian, 10% French, 9% Spanish.\" In autumn of that year the British magazine \"Opera Now\" reported that \"Operabase has taken on the Herculean task of making [the site] available to every European Union citizen in their own language - not only the 21 (as at January 2007) official languages of the EU, but Catalan, Icelandic and Norwegian as well.\" As of November 2012, the free public area of the site is available in 22 languages, and includes 37,000 performances, 40,000 artists, 700 opera companies, festivals and theatres, and the contact details and rosters of 400 artist managers.\nSeven years after the public site was launched, a professional site followed and within three years, \"200 opera houses from the Met to La Scala\" were subscribers. The initial service offering for the 750 euro annual subscription fee had increased artist information and an opera casting tool. The casting tool was used for researching singers for a given role, but was particularly valued for finding replacement singers when there were emergency cancellations. The tool could not only put forward the names of all of the singers who had sung that role, but the artist schedules could be used to find if they were available, and the artists management and contact information could be used to make contact.\n\nThe professional services now also include a global database of opera productions available to rent or buy.\n\nThe database is now operated by Gibb and Muriel Denzler, who provide services to opera professionals for a fee, although the site is searchable by any web user at no charge.\n\nAs has been noted by Gibb and Denzler in an article on the website of Opera Europa (the European opera service organization similar to those which exist in the US and Canada, OPERA America and Opera.ca) they provide specialized services to opera professionals, with the site including \"casting tools, artist records, management details, productions information\". But they emphasize that \"the site was originally created for the general public, who still provide 96% of its users\".\n\nIn autumn 2010, Operabase produced a set of statistics for the opera world to mark the 250,000th performance on file. These statistics were presented at the third European Opera Forum, organised by Opera Europa in London in March 2011. In autumn 2013, the statistics were updated to show the 2012/13 season figures.\n\nThe Operabase rankings of the most performed operas formed the basis of a set of music questions in an edition of the BBC's \"University Challenge\", broadcast in July 2014. Competitors were asked to identify three operas in the Operabase list from sound clips of Maria Callas.\n\nIn the five seasons 2008/09 to 2012/13, 2415 different works from 1161 different composers were played. The most popular composers were:\n\nMore than 600 of the composers played in this period were still alive.

{"id": "783023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=783023", "title": "Orange roughy", "text": "Orange roughy\n\nThe orange roughy (\"Hoplostethus atlanticus\"), also known as the red roughy, slimehead and deep sea perch, is a relatively large deep-sea fish belonging to the slimehead family (Trachichthyidae). The UK Marine Conservation Society has categorized orange roughy as \"vulnerable to exploitation\". It is found in , deep (bathypelagic, ) waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Iceland to Morocco; and from Walvis Bay, Namibia, to off Durban, South Africa), Indo-Pacific (off New Zealand and Australia), and in the eastern Pacific off Chile.\nThe orange roughy is notable for its extraordinary lifespan, living for up to 149 years. It is important to commercial deep-trawl fisheries. The fish is a bright, brick-red color; fading to a yellowish-orange after death.\n\nLike other slimeheads, orange roughy is slow-growing and late to mature, resulting in a very low resilience which makes them extremely susceptible to overfishing. Many stocks (especially those off New Zealand and Australia, which were first exploited in the late 1970s) became severely depleted within 3–20 years, but several have subsequently recovered (see Fisheries below).\n\nThe orange roughy is not a vertically slender fish. Its rounded head is riddled with muciferous canals (part of the lateral line system), as is typical of slimeheads. The single dorsal fin contains four to six spines and 15 to 19 soft rays; the anal fin contains three spines and 10 to 12 soft rays. The 19 to 25 ventral scutes (modified scales) form a hard, bony median ridge between the pelvic fins and anus. The pectoral fins contain 15-18 soft rays each; the pelvic fins are thoracic and contain one spine and six soft rays; the caudal fin is forked. The interior of the mouth and gill cavity is a bluish black; the mouth itself is large and strongly oblique. The scales are ctenoid and adherent. The lateral line is uninterrupted, with 28 to 32 scales whose spinules or 'ctenii' largely obscure the lateral line's pores. The eyes are large.\n\nThe orange roughy is the largest known slimehead species at a maximum standard length (a measurement which excludes the tail fin) of and a maximum weight of . The average commercial catch size is commonly between in length, again, varying by area.\n\nOrange roughy are generally sluggish and demersal; they form aggregations with a natural population density of up to 2.5 fish per m, now reduced to about 1.0 per m. These aggregations form in and around geologic structures, such as undersea canyons and seamounts, where water movement and mixing is high, ensuring dense prey concentrations. The aggregations are not necessarily for spawning or feeding; the fish are thought to cycle through metabolic phases (active or feeding and inactive or resting) and seek areas with ideal hydrologic conditions to congregate during each phase. They lose almost all pigmentation while inactive, when they are very approachable. Predators include large, deep-roving sharks, cutthroat eels, merluccid hakes, and snake mackerels.\n\nWhen active, juveniles feed primarily on zooplankton such as mysid shrimp, euphausiids, mesopelagic and benthopelagic fish, amphipods, and other crustaceans; mature adults consume smaller fish, predominantly of the Chaetodontidae and Myctophidae families, and squid which make up to 20% of their diet. The diet of the orange roughy is depth-related, with adult diets inversely related to that of juveniles. For example, juvenile consumption of crustaceans is lowest at but increases with depth while crustaceans in the adult diet peaks at and decreases with depth. The consumption of fish is the opposite, juvenile consumption decreases with depth while adult consumption increases. This inverse feeding pattern may be an example of resource-partitioning to avoid intraspecific competition for the available food at depths where prey is less abundant. The orange roughy's metabolic phases are thought to be related to seasonal variations in prey concentrations. The inactive phase conserves energy during lean periods. Orange roughy can live up to 149 years.\n\nOrange roughy are oceanodromous, pelagic spawners: that is, they migrate several hundred kilometers between localized spawning and feeding areas each year and form large spawning aggregations (possibly segregated according to sex) wherein the fish release large, spherical eggs in diameter, made buoyant by an orange-red oil globule) and sperm \"en masse\" directly into the water. The fertilized eggs, which are said to be , (and later larvae) are planktonic, rising to around to develop, with the young fish eventually descending to deeper waters as they mature. Orange roughy are also synchronous, shedding sperm and eggs at the same time. The time between fertilization and hatching is thought to be 10 to 20 days; fecundity is low, with each female producing only 22,000 eggs per kg of body weight, less than 10% of the average for other species of fish. Females rarely produce more than 90,000 eggs in one lifetime. Spawning may last up to three weeks and starts around June or July. Orange roughy are very slow-growing and do not begin to breed until they are at least 20 years old, when they are around in length.\n\nThe maturation age used in stock assessments ranges from 23–40 years, which limits population growth/recovery, because each new generation takes so long to start spawning.\n\nThe maximum published age of 149 years was determined via radiometric dating of trace isotopes found in an orange roughy's otolith (ear bone). Similarly, counting by the growth rings of orange roughy otoliths has given a maximum age of 125 to 156 years. The validity of these results is questioned by commercial fishers as some state the former method is controversial and the latter method is known to underestimate age in older specimens. The issue has yet to be resolved definitively, but carries important implications relating to the orange roughy's conservation status.\n\nThe flesh is firm with a mild flavour; it is sold skinned and filleted, fresh or frozen. \"Orange roughy\" was renamed from the less gastronomically-appealing \"slime head\" through a US National Marine Fisheries Service program during the late 1970s, which identified (then) underused species that should be renamed to make them more marketable.\nHistorically, the United States has been the largest consumer of orange roughy, however, in recent years, the market for orange roughy in China has increased significantly. In 2014, the US imported around 1,455 tonnes (4.4 million lb) (mainly fillets) from New Zealand, China, Peru and Indonesia. China, in 2015, imported at least 4,000 tonnes (8.8 million lb) (mainly whole fish).\n\nA number of major food retailers have established seafood sustainability policies to reassure customers that they are stocking sustainable seafood. These policies often involve partnering with Non-Governmental Organizations to define criteria for seafood that may be stocked. In addition, a number of ecolabels exist to help retailers and consumers identify seafood that has been independently assessed against a robust, scientific standard. One of the best known such programmes is that of the Marine Stewardship Council.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added orange roughy (deep sea perch) to its seafood red list, which contains fish generally sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\n\nA 2003 joint report by the TRAFFIC Oceania and World Wildlife Foundation Endangered Seas Program argues, \"probably no such thing [exists] as an economically viable deep-water fishery that is also sustainable”. However, others have argued that deepwater fisheries can be managed sustainably provided it is recognized that sustainable yields are low and catches are set accordingly.\n\nDue to its longevity, the orange roughy accumulates large amounts of mercury in its tissues,[3] having a range of 0.30-0.86 ppm compared with an average mercury level of 0.086 ppm for other edible fish. Based on average consumption and the recommendations of a National Marine Fisheries Service study, in 1976, the FDA set the maximum safe mercury level for fish at 1 ppm. Regular consumption of orange roughy can have adverse effects on health. Compared to most edible fish, orange roughy are a very poor source of omega-3 fatty acids, averaging less than 3.5 g/kg.\n\nAnnual global catches of orange roughy began in 1979 and increased significantly to a high of over 90,000 tonnes in the late 1980s. These high catch levels quickly decreased as stocks were fished down. For many stocks, the lack of understanding of the biological characteristics meant that they were overfished. Due to its longevity, late maturation, and relatively low fecundity, orange roughy stocks tend to recover slower than most other species.\n\nA number of orange roughy stocks live outside the jurisdiction of any particular nation, making it more challenging to limit overall catches. The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) and the South Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement have orange roughy stocks which are managed within their jurisdiction. These organizations have made progress on collecting better information on total orange roughy catches and also setting catch limits for fisheries on the high seas. For example, SPRFMO limited orange roughy catches and effort from 2007.\n\nOrange roughy is fished almost exclusively by bottom trawling. This fishing method has been heavily criticized by environmentalists for its destructive nature. This, combined with heavy commercial demand, has focused criticism from both environmentalists and media.[12]\n\nNew Zealand currently operates the largest orange roughy fisheries in the world, with a total catch of over 8,500 tonnes in the 2014 calendar year. This accounts for 95% of the total estimated global catch of orange roughy. Exports of orange roughy provided an estimated revenue to New Zealand of NZ$53 million (US$ 37M) in 2015.\n\nFisheries in New Zealand are managed through the Quota Management System (QMS). Under this system, individuals or companies own quota shares for a stock of a particular species or species group. For each stock, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is set which maintains the stock at or above a level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield or will move the stock towards that level. Orange roughy has been managed within the QMS since 1986.\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries is responsible for the implementation of the QMS and its enabling legislation, the Fisheries Act 1996.\n\nThe fishery was initiated in the mid-1970s, however full exploitation did not begin until 1979. There was no regulation of these early catches and records indicate that they were very high. As for many fisheries, fisheries management settings allow for a ‘fishing down’ period where the biomass is reduced to a level that will provide the maximum sustainable yield. For example, a fishery with a hypothetical unfished biomass of 100,000 tonnes will be allowed to be fished down to a biomass of 40,000 tonnes (assuming that this is the biomass that provides for the maximum sustainable yield) over a number of years. The rate of this ‘fish down’ can vary depending on the objectives of the fishery, but catches would then be more strictly controlled to maintain the biomass at around 40,000 tonnes.\n\nFor the New Zealand orange roughy fisheries, productivity parameters and resulting estimates of unfished biomass were incorrectly estimated in the first decade of the fishery. Catch limits exceeded recommended estimates of sustainable yields for a subsequent decade and catches were estimated to have exceeded those catch limits due to burst nets, escape windows in nets, and lost gear.\nCatch limits were reduced in the mid-1990s, although they were increased again following indications that stocks had begun to rebuild. This was later found not to be the case and a number of fisheries were closed completely or had catch limits reduced to 1 tonne to allow the stocks to rebuild.\n\nIn one New Zealand fishery, the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was reduced in 2008 from 1,470 tonnes to 914 tonnes, however this reduction was challenged in court. In February 2008, the High Court overturned the new quota, ruling the Minister of Fisheries did not have the legal power to set quotas for ORH1. This was due to strict interpretation of the Fisheries Act which required an accurate estimation of the biomass that could support the maximum sustainable yield. As a result of this decision, the Fisheries Act 1996 was amended to allow TACs to be set based on the best available information in the absence of an estimate of the biomass that could support the maximum sustainable yield.\n\nThe New Zealand fishing industry contracted a pre-assessment of selected orange roughy fisheries against the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Fisheries Standard in 2009. Following the pre-assessment, the industry representative body (Deepwater Group Ltd) put four orange roughy fisheries into Fishery Improvement Plans (FIPs) to deliver improvements in the fisheries that would enable them to meet the certification requirements of the MSC. These FIPs are public and have been monitored by the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership.\n\nIn 2014, Bayesian model-based stock assessments were completed for four of New Zealand’s main orange roughy stocks, one of which had been closed to fishing since 2000. The stock assessments used data collected by research surveys carried out by research organizations and the fishing industry. A key factor was the use new acoustic technology, developed by the fishing industry, in recent surveys. The multi-frequency acoustic optical system (AOS) enables scientists to differentiate the types of fish acoustically ‘seen’ during the survey and work on slopes that previously made effective surveying impossible in some areas. The AOS also has the potential to allow scientists to see in real-time video, what is being measured by the survey. Other research-derived data were also critical to the success of the stock assessments, notably age-frequencies from improved ageing methods.\n\nThe 2014 stock assessments, which were subject to a robust peer review process, indicated that three of the stocks had recovered enough to sustain increased catches. The TACs for these stocks were subsequently increased. The fourth stock was estimated to be at a low stock status and the TAC was reduced by over 40% to allow the stock to rebuild.\n\nIn addition, an industry sponsored Management Strategy Evaluation was completed which provided an estimate of the biomass that could support the maximum sustainable yield (≈25-27% of the unfished biomass). Based on this output, the fishing industry agreed to aim to maintain the orange rough stocks within a management target range of 30-50% of the unfished biomass. Further to this, a Harvest Control Rule was agreed that would define what catch limits should be given an estimate of stock status. Catch limits for those fisheries are currently consistent with the outputs of the agreed Harvest Control Rule.\nIn May 2014, three orange roughy fisheries entered full assessment against the Marine Stewardship Council Fisheries Standard.\n\nThe Australian orange roughy fishery was not discovered until the 1970s, but by 2008, the biomass was estimated to be down to 10% of the unfished level. It was the first commercially sought fish to appear on Australia's endangered species list because of overfishing. A number of Australian orange roughy fisheries have since been re-opened.\n\n\n\n\n"}

O'Neill was one of the leaders of the Irish Rebellion which had been launched the previous day. O'Neill's Proclamation set out a justification of the uprising. He claimed to have been given a commission signed and sealed on 1 October by the King of Ireland Charles I that commanded him to lead Irish Catholics in defence of the Kingdom of Ireland against Protestants who sympathised with Charles' opponents in the Parliament of England. \n\nFollowing the trial and execution of the Viceroy Thomas Wentworth in May 1641, Ireland was in a state of turmoil. There was growing tension between Catholics and Protestants (particularly those of a Puritan tendency) with the former generally sympathetic to King Charles while the latter supported the English Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters in the dispute that would shortly lead to the outbreak of the English Civil War. This formed part of the wider War of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nOn 23 October a major uprising broke out in Ulster organised by leading members of the Gaelic aristocracy. The rebels attacked Protestant plantation settlements as well as native Irish Protestants and took garrison towns held by the Irish Army. Irish government authorities in Dublin struggled to contain the insurgency with the limited number of troops they had at their disposal. A last-minute warning saved Dublin Castle from a surprise attack, although O'Neill was clearly unaware of the failure of the Dublin plot when he issued his proclamation.\n\nAfter seizing several key strategic points in Ulster over the previous twenty-four hours, Sir Phelim made his Proclamation in Dungannon, a town which had symbolic importance as the traditional capital of the O'Neill dynasty. The text read:\n\nIn support of his actions, Sir Phelim claimed to have a document from King Charles commissioning him. The Commission was supposedly signed under the Great Seal of Scotland. By declaring their loyalty to the Crown and defence of the Catholic religion, O'Neill and his followers adopted a political stance which was taken up by the subsequent Irish Confederation which governed rebel-controlled territory in the name of the King from 1642 until 1649. The Proclamation encouraged many Catholics to believe they could lawfully join the rising with the King's blessing, while Protestants were left demoralised.\n\nSir Phelim's second and more trenchant proclamation was made \"from our camp at Newry\" on 4 November 1641:\n\nHe also published the actual royal commission that gave authority for his earlier proclamation. It was subtly different, in that it empowered him to arrest and seize property from all of Charles's English Protestant subjects living in Ireland, but exempted his Irish and Scottish subjects. He was ordered to:\n\nPart of the commission in the original spelling:\n\nUntil the late nineteenth century historians generally accepted that the commission was genuine, or at the very least Charles had secretly encouraged the Irish Catholics to launch a rising. Since then, for a variety of reasons, it has been considered to be a forgery produced by O'Neill and his associates without the knowledge of the King. They may well have acquired a copy of the Great Seal of Scotland when they captured the garrison town of Charlemont on 23 October.\n\nThe historian David Stevenson notes that it would be unlikely that the commission would have been addressed to Sir Phelim O'Neill. Had it been genuine it would almost certainly have been issued to more senior Irish Royalists such as the Earl of Ormond or the leading Catholic noble of Ulster the Earl of Antrim. It is also unlikely to have been issued at Edinburgh as Sir Phelim claimed. However, King Charles was in Edinburgh on 1 October, dealing with Scottish political matters.\n\nForgery or not, King Charles publicly proclaimed all the Irish rebels as traitors on 1 January 1642.\n\nThat the Commission was genuine was widely accepted in England and Scotland by the King's opponents and even some of his own supporters. It seemed to tie in with earlier rumours of an Army Plot which had suggested that Charles might bring over the New Irish Army, made up largely of Ulster Catholics, to impose his will on England and Scotland. Anger at the King's alleged links with the insurgents grew - particularly as horror stories of atrocities committed, such as the Portadown Massacre, began to filter across the Irish Sea. Tensions arising from news of the Irish rebellion was a factor in the English push to Civil War in early 1642.\n\nThe Scottish authorities despatched an Army which quickly retook much of Ulster from the insurgents. Once the English Civil War broke out in October 1642, Charles' emissaries began negotiations with the Irish rebels for their support, which seemed to present further evidence to his opponents of his links with the Catholic Ulster leaders. Many of these later dealings were exposed when Charles private letters were captured during the Battle of Naseby (1645) and published as \"The King's Cabinet Opened\".\n\nWhen Phelim O'Neill was captured in 1653 following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, he was put on trial for his life. The authorities offered to spare him if he would repeat his earlier claims that Charles had ordered the Catholics to rise in 1641. O'Neill now refused to implicate the King, who had been executed four years earlier, and was put to death himself. Nonetheless the English Republicans continued to use O'Neill's earlier claims of the King's involvement to justify their decision to commit regicide.\n\n"}

It is a stand-alone sequel to the 1994 film \"Richie Rich\", starring David Gallagher as the title character. Its plot is similar to \"It's a Wonderful Life\", placing Richie Rich in the role of George Bailey and Reggie Van Dough in the role of Mr. Potter.\n\nIt's Christmas Eve and Richie Rich, the world's richest kid, is all excited to spend the day with his friends. While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \"big pie\" from it, and is given a \"pig sty\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes.\n\nDuring tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage. While getting ready, Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days, in a band called Root Canal. When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using the remote invented by Keanbean that Cadbury used earlier. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process. Richie and Cadbury end up in an accident in which the sleigh falls and literally explodes along with the presents, while Cadbury hurts his ankle badly. Richie runs off to fetch help, but once he enters the city, he sees that the situation has changed dramatically. Reggie is cooking up rumors about him, and all the people have turned against him. \n\nDevastated, Richie goes into Keanbean's laboratory and squats in front of the wishing machine. While fretting over his ill luck, he accidentally wishes that he was never born. The machine at once grants his wish, following which he is transported to another world in which he was never born and hence nobody recognizes him. Reggie has taken over as Richard and Regina's son, and is now the richest kid in the world. He bosses around everyone. Roads and buildings are named after him. This world is very sad, and hunger and misery are seen all over. This makes Richie realize that things would not be better if he was not born, and hence decides to go back to the world in which he is Richie Rich. \n\nThough his parents do not recognize him anymore, he is happy that his dog, Dollar, does. He takes Dollar with him, only to enrage Reggie, who is his current owner. Reggie orders policemen to search for Richie, who is falsely called the \"dognapper\", and also announces a reward for catching him. After outsmarting various policemen who try but fail to catch him, Richie finds Cadbury, who is still part of Root Canal, and Keanbean, who runs his own laboratory called \"Keanbean's World of Wonders\". Richie questions Keanbean about the wishing machine, which he says, requires a \"Pegliasaurus\" wishing bone in order to be complete. Along with his friends who decide to help him, Richie goes to the city museum to retrieve the bone from the dinosaur skeleton. After passing through laser detection systems successfully, they get it, using the fishing rod invented by Keanbean. Before they get out of the museum, Richie and his friends spot Reggie's parents, who are now working as night guards there. \n\nOnce they reach the lab, they get the machine to work properly. However, before Richie could wish himself back, Reggie arrives there with the policemen. Richie, Cadbury, Keanbean, and Richie's friends are put in jail, while Reggie takes the machine home. At home, Reggie wishes that he needs to fly, and then when Irona, his robotic servant maid, accidentally turns off the machine, he tries to make a wish again. When it does not work the second time, he leaves the room in a huff, and retires. In jail, Richie and his friends are bailed out by Root Canal. They all rush to Reggie's house, and while he is still sleeping, Richie tries to wish himself back. However, they find that the machine is no longer working, as Reggie had kicked it in anger earlier. While Keanbean is fixing it, Reggie wakes up and comes flying in, only to be attacked by Richie and his friends. They defeat him and everyone quits working for him, with Sgt. Mooney refusing to work for someone who would cancel Christmas. After that, the machine starts working again, and Richie wishes himself back as Richie Rich. \n\nRichie sets right all the things that had gone wrong since his vanishing act, and is now much more grateful to be alive. As everyone is glad to have him back, they gather around the Christmas tree and sing.\n\nReggie is caught red-handed with his actions against Richie by his parents, and Reggie's parents make him apologize for all the trouble he caused to Richie, admitting that he was the one who took control of the sleigh and ruined the event. Richie realizes that it wasn't his fault and he made that wish for nothing. They forgive each other.\n\n\nThe Langham Huntington Hotel and Spa, in Pasadena, California, was used for exterior scenes of the sprawling Rich Family Mansion. The interior lobby and vault of the disused (currency exchange) Valuta Bank building, in downtown Los Angeles, was used for the scene in which Richie traps the pursuing Rich security men (this same bank was also used for the bank-robbery scene in \"Spider-Man 2\"). The background music in some scenes such as when the wishbone was taken out of the wishing machine by Dollar, and the characters standing in front of the Professor's shop for the first time was used in Digimon, \"\" and \"Casper Meets Wendy\", obviously because the music was done by Saban. Colonial Street at Universal City, previously used in \"The Munsters\", \"Leave it to Beaver\", and \"The 'Burbs\", is also featured.\n"}

Gauguin depicts himself in the upper right, sucking his thumb and grasping the hand of the fleshy nude woman, a Polynesian or African, who seems to recoil in fear. \n\nIt is considered as among his most successful reliefs, but when first exhibited in 1891 at the Salon des XX in Brussels it was panned by hostile critics. It was exhibited again in 1906 during a major Gauguin retrospective; that exhibition led to a reappraisal of his wood carvings, which became major influences on artists such as Matisse, the Fauves, Brancusi, and Picasso. \"Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses\" is one of three similarly themed artworks that Gauguin prepared in 1889 for the Salon; the other two, possibly pendants to this panel, are the paintings \"\" and \"Life and Death\". The latter shows a white Eve and dark-skinned mummy against an ominous dark background.\n\nGauguin was a pleasure seeker and found European morals constraining; his relocation to Polynesia seemingly released him from all that, but brought deep feelings of guilt and exploitation. He was free of Christian norms and boundaries and felt closer to nature. The title is somewhat ironic and probably stems from the same dark, bitter humour that led him to title his home the \"House of Pleasure\". In fact the work's subject matter is bleak and its mood turbulent. It represents an exploration of corruption, lust, voyeurism and male sexual power. \n\nArt critic Albert Aurier in 1891 questioned the meaning of the work, in which \"all lasciviousness, all the struggles of mind and flesh, and all the pain of sensual delight seem to writhe and gnash their teeth\". The work is a reflection of later 19th century colonial guilt, which the artist conflates with his own, probably deserved, feelings of sexual guilt and decadence. \n\nGauguin includes a rather infantile self-portrait, a number of female nudes, and various flowers. A fox sits on the lower right, gazing out at the viewer, to whom he appears to be hostile, as if \"guarding the scene of seduction\". Gauguin had employed the symbolism of the fox in earlier works, and it is commonly assumed that he is invoking the fox as the symbol of perversity it represents in Indian culture.\n\nA number of other works by Gauguin have the same title phrase, always printed within the picture space. There is an 1894 watercolor, an 1898 woodcut, another bas-relief completed between 1901 and 1902, and a number of sketches. \n\nGauguin conceived his 1890 relief \"Soyez mystérieuses\" (\"Be mysterious\") as a companion piece. It is calmer and more harmonious than \"Soyez amoureuses\". Comparing the two panels, Aurier asked, \"how are we to describe this other carving ... which by contrast celebrates the pure joys of esotericism? Are they disturbing symbols of mystery, or fantastic shadows in the forests of enigma?\"\n\nVincent van Gogh described the relief in a letter to his brother Theo, mentioning that Gauguin had spent a number of months working on it. It had been sent to Theo in Paris, who claimed that \"Vincent would love it.\" \n\nThe work was acquired by the \"Galerie Goupil\" (\"Boussod et Valadon\") of Paris in 1889, where it remained until 1893. It passed into the private collection of Émile Schuffenecker that year, and remained in the possession of the Schuffenecker family until 1949. It was included in the posthumous auction of the estate of Margaret Thompson Biddle in 1957. \n\n"}

It ran through 5 English editions by 1684. At least two German editions were also printed.\n\nThe book provides a recipe for trifle, involving cream but no custard, a gooseberry fool, hot chocolate, and cheesecakes. Woolley's mince pies still contain meat as well as dried fruits. Ingredients include pumpkins and molasses from the New World.\n\nThe book contains the first known recipe for Sussex pond pudding.\n\nWoolley had already published two books, \"The Ladies Directory\" in 1661, and \"The Cooks Guide\" in 1664. She was probably the first person to make her living by writing books on household management.\n\nRichard Lowndes brought out Woolley's \"The Queen-Like Closet\" in 1670. The title is a reference to \"W.M.\"'s 1655 book \"The Queens Closet Opened\". The book is dedicated to Woolley's friend Mrs. Grace Buzby, daughter of Sir Henry Cary. Page 1 of the book, however, contradicts the title page by naming the book \"The Ladies New Closet. OR RATHER Rich Cabinet.\"\n\nThe book consists almost entirely of numbered recipes, prefaced only by Woolley's letter \"To all Ladies, Gentlewomen, and to all other of the Female Sex who do delight in, or be desirous of good Accomplishments.\" and a one-page address \"Ladies, I do here present you\" in verse.\n\nAfter the recipes are bills of fare (pages 353 to 369) for different times of the year, including \"for extraordinary Feasts in the Summer\", \"for Winter Season\", \"for Lesser Feasts\", \"for Fish Days & Fasting Days in Ember week, or in Lent\", \"without feasting\", \"in Winter in Great Houses\".\n\nWoolley then describes (pages 378 to 383) the duties of each \"office\", including the cook, the \"Maid under such a Cook\", the butler, the carver, and other servants, and then \"the Gentlewomen who have the Charge of the Sweet-Meats, and such like Repasts\". Part 1 of the book describes the making of many such \"Sweet-Meats\".\n\nThe book ends with separate alphabetical indexes to parts one and two.\n\nThe book has no illustrations other than the frontispiece, which has six kitchen scenes, including a three-legged pot over an open fire, cordials being distilled, a bread oven, and pots and roasts on a spit over a fire, topped by a title medallion. It is inscribed \"Printed for Rich. Lownes\".\n\nThe 293 recipes in Part 1 are not grouped explicitly, but nos. 1 to 36 are for medicinal cordials and waters, such as \"To get away the Signs of the Small Pox\".\n\nThe following recipes are a mixture, with cakes, creams and puddings, medicines, preserves and wines in no discernible order. No. 58, a trifle, is made with boiled cream, rosewater, mace, and some rennet to help it set. No. 109 is a gooseberry fool made with gooseberries, water, sugar, egg yolks, cream, and nutmeg. Recipe 101, \"To make Collops of Bacon in Sweet-meats\" calls for Marchpane Paste, sugar, cinnamon, and ginger, sliced into escalopes as if it were bacon. The foods described are the sweet-meats which Woolley considered that her \"Gentlewomen\" readers would \"have the Charge of\".\n\nRecipes involving meat appear with nos. 138 and 139, with \"To make Christal Jelly\" using knuckle of veal and calves feet, and \"To make China-Broth\" using \"china\", hartshorn, a \"Red Cock cut in pieces and bruised\", raisins and pearl barley.\n\nRecipe 142 is \"To make Chaculato\", a hot chocolate drink made with claret, chocolate, egg yolk and sugar.\n\nPart 2 is headed \"The Second Part of the Queen-Like Closet; Having an Addition of what hath already been treated of, and directing a very true & excellent way for all manner of Cookery, both Fish, Flesh, & Pastry.\" It contains 288 recipes, and is ascribed to Hannah Wolley, alias Chaloner, and published by \"R.

More meat dishes follow from no. 18, a chicken pie, with recipes for brawn, pasties, and an elaborate \"Olio\" with a \"fricasy\" of calves head, oysters, anchovies, pigeons, bacon, sweetbreads, and veal.\n\nRecipe 102 is for \"Minced Pies\", the filling inside the pastry being made with veal and suet in equal amounts, with dried fruits (raisins, currants, prunes, and dates), spices, verjuice and sugar.\n\nRecipes 113 to 121 are for fish dishes, starting with \"a Fricasie of Oisters\".\n\nRecipe 132 is for \"Pumpion-Pie\", the pumpkin being fried with beaten egg and then baked in slices in a pie cruist with dried fruits, butter, sack, and \"some sharp apples\".\n\nRecipes 144 to 157 are for meat or fish pies. Recipe 261 is for a \"Haggus Pudding\".\n\nRecipe 285 is for \"Vin de Molosso, or Treacle Wine\", calling for \"Molossoes\" boiled with spices and rosemary, then brewed \"as you do Beer\".\n\nFive English editions are recorded:\n\n\nAt least two editions of a German translation were published as \"Frauenzimmers Zeitvertreib\".\n\n\nThe historian Wendy Wall describes Woolley as \"a domestic female celebrity who acted as the Martha Stewart of the seventeenth century.\" Wall argues that Woolley's cookery books including \"The Ladies Directory in Choice Experiments\" (1662) and \"The Cook's Guide\" (1664) as well as \"The Queen-Like Closet\" and its supplement are part of a rags-to-riches tale in which \"domestic expertise\" offered social mobility.\n\nThe essayist Charles Lamb wrote that he found a copy of the \"Queen-Like Closet\" in a bookstall: \"I lit upon a ragged duodecimo, which had been the strange delight of my infancy, and which I had lost sight of for more than forty years ... being an abstract of receipts in cookery, confectionery, cosmetics, needlework, morality, and all such branches of what were then considered as female accomplishments.\"\n\nKate Colquhoun notes that Woolley \"addressed servants for the first time\" in her books, focussing on practicality and economy. She argues that Woolley succeeded best by recognising that people \"wanted to offer upmarket, modern dishes on a constrained budget.\" She brought fashionable ingredients like anchovies, capers and wine into her simplified dishes, with frugal advice on reusing leftovers. Colquhoun however criticises her organisation:\n\nBut, Colquhoun concludes, Woolley was \"a fine, solid cook\" who was prepared to roast woodcock \"The French Way\" however much she disliked the show of \"some rare whimsical French cook\", using bacon over the bird's breast and serving it on toast. And her bills of fare were \"carefully detailed\" with \"a buttered apple pie, an almond custard or a syllabub – the dessert of the age.\"\n\n"}

René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, the creators of the series, wrote the story and directed the film themselves; with co-direction by Pierre Watrin and the screenplay co-written by Pierre Tchernia, a friend of Goscinny and Uderzo. The movie was directed, produced and animated at Goscinny and Uderzo's own animation studio, Studios Idéfix and is the only Asterix animated film that has used the Xerography Process.. At the time the film received polarized reviews since its tone is more cartoony and frequently breaks the fourth wall. Nowadays its reception is more favorable with it often being cited as one of the best \"Astérix\" films, even reaching the status of a cult classic.\n\nIt is the only Asterix movie to date (animated or live-action) to be based on an original screenplay rather than on material from any of the comic book stories. Later, however, it was adapted into a comic book as well by Albert Uderzo's brother, Marcel Uderzo, as an illustrated text story book and a series of twelve books for young readers.\n\nFollowing constant defeats by the rebel village of Gaul, the Roman senate begins to suggest that they might be gods due to their apparent invincibility. Julius Caesar, openly disdainful of the suggestion, decides to test the village and meets with their chieftain, Vitalstatistix. Caesar declares that the Gauls undertake a challenge, inspired by the Twelve Labours of Hercules - the village's best warriors must undertake a set of twelve new tasks, in which he will hand over the Roman Empire to them if they succeed in each one, whereas failing just one of his tasks will result in the Gauls surrendering to him. In agreement, the village assign Asterix and Obelix to the task, with Caesar assigning Caius Tiddlus, a Roman man renowned for his honesty, to act as their guide to the tasks and the challenge's referee.\n\nIn their first set of challenges, Asterix defeats Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games, by beating him in a race, and Cilindric the German in a fight by outsmarting his opponent, while Obelix defeats Verses the Persian, by managing to throw a javelin further than him. In their next challenge, the pair find themselves crossing a lake that is home to beautiful Sirens, who reside in the centre on the \"Isle of Pleasure\". Although the Gauls nearly succumb to the women, Obelix comes to his senses when he learns there are no wild boars for him to hunt and eat, allowing the pair to accomplish the challenge. After surviving the hypnotic gaze of Iris the Egyptian in the fifth task, by Asterix making him hypnotises himself, Obelix attempts the sixth task of finishing meals prepared by Belgian chef Mannekenpix, exhausting his kitchen of food.\n\nFollowing their seventh task of enduring \"Cave of the Beast\", the pair attempt the eighth task of getting a permit document from a multi-storey bureaucratic building. After finding it impossible because of the clinically unhelpful people who direct them elsewhere, Asterix beats them at their own game with an imaginary permit, making the staff victims to their own behaviour, and causing the Prefect to unwittingly hand over what the Gauls came for. The pair continue to complete further challenges - they cross a ravine filled with crocodiles by beating them up rather than using an invisible tightrope; answer a riddle by Old Man of the Mountain, conducted in the form of a washing detergent advertisement; and endure a night on a plain haunted by ghosts, by complaining about the noise.\n\nAsterix and Obelix eventually find themselves in Rome, alongside their fellow villagers, for their final task. Brought to the Circus Maximus, the Gauls fight against gladiators, whom they beat, and defeat various animals sent against them by turning the arena into a modern-day circus. Having succeeded in every task, Caesar agrees that they are gods, giving the Gauls control of the Roman Empire, while retiring to live a quiet life with Cleopatra. As a reward for his service, Caius Tiddlus retires to the Isle of Pleasure. As the village celebrates their success, Asterix answers Obelix's question of them really conquering Rome by pointing out that everything that happened to them was a mere cartoon, in which everything is possible. Obelix takes advantage of this and teleports himself and his wild boar meat to the Isle of Pleasure, to enjoy himself.\n\n\n\nIn 1976 Albert Uderzo's brother Marcel Uderzo created a comic book adaptation of the film. This rare album has been translated in various languages, but is unavailable in the regular series. The English translation, only published as part of the once off comic book annual Asterix Annual 1980, was based on the dialogue of the English version of the film and was titled \"Asterix Conquers Rome\". There is also an illustrated book of the film containing the story in text. The story book is more regularly published and more widely translated than the very rare comic book. In addition there are also twelve rare illustrated text story books for young readers, one for each of the twelve tasks.\n\nWhile Caesar is addressing the other senators, Brutus is playing with a knife. This eventually irritates Caesar, leading him to declare, \"Brutus, stop playing about with that knife! You'll end up hurting somebody!\" This is a nod to Brutus' Assassination of Julius Caesar.\n"}

The list has been compiled once roughly every 10 years starting in 1984, typically assembled by polling a combination of Canadian critics and filmmakers. The list has been published in 1993, 2004, and 2015.\n\nThe list is compiled once every decade. The list was started in 1984 because Canadian film was taking off, and was made by polling critics, professors, fans and festival staff. According to Piers Handling, a TIFF director, the idea of the Top 10 was to introduce the public to Canadian film, and around 100 people were polled. TIFF did not provide the poll-takers with a list of films to choose from.\n\nIn 2015, the polling method was changed, as those who responded were divided into two groups, filmmakers and critics. Filmmakers made up 40% of the respondents. There were 200 participants.\n\nThe lists have been compiled as follows:\n\nThe 2015 list reads:\nThe 2004 list reads:\nThe 1993 list reads: \nThe 1984 list reads:\nTIFF organizers were surprised with the results of the 1984 poll, which provided recognition for what they felt were underappreciated directors such as Claude Jutra, Don Shebib and Gilles Carle. Wayne Clarkson, testifying before the Parliament of Canada, remarked on the 1984 list's oldest film being \"Nobody Waved Goodbye\" (1964), asking \"How is it that some of this country's most acclaimed films came in the brief 20-year period between 1964 and 1984? That's a very interesting phenomenon for us.\"\n\nAccording to encyclopedist Gene Walz, the revisions in 1993 \"forced people to rethink their stereotyped notions about Canadian film.\" The 1993 list was noted for the addition of the first female director, Patricia Rozema, and \"Mon oncle Antoine\" being ranked first for a second time, despite the popularity of \"Jesus of Montreal\" and \"The Decline of the American Empire\".\n\nAmong the films that dropped off the list after 1993 were \"Nobody Waved Goodbye\" and \"The Grey Fox\". Critic Norman Wilner said this was unsurprising, describing the two films as \"very much products of their time, and they haven’t aged well.\"\n\nThe 2015 poll saw major changes, including in the number one spot, prompting essayist Steve Gravestock to comment, \"This is likely the first time that a film by an indigenous filmmaker has topped a poll of national cinema.\" \"The Nunatsiaq News\" heralded the choice as a sign \"\" \"has stood the test of time.\" However, Eric Moreault, writing for \"La Presse\", dismissed \"Atanarjuat\"'s first-place finish as nonsensical, noting \"Mon oncle Antoine\" topped all previous versions.\n\nJohn Semley of \"The Globe and Mail\" commented that the 2015 list \"seems a little heavy on recent movies,\" but was remarkable for its diversity. The inclusion of more recent films led to the question of whether Canadian cinema was becoming more creative, or if critics were biased to more popular films. Moreault objected to what he saw as too few Quebeckers participating in the vote, saying \"Incendies\" (2010) or \"Mommy\" (2014) could be included.\n\nPeter Knegt of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation called the 2015 list \"worthy\" compared the alternative list produced by data journalism website The 10 and 3, weighing votes from the Internet Movie Database. That list named \"Room\" (2015) as the best Canadian film, followed by \"Incendies\" and \"A Christmas Story\" (1983).\n\n"}

Their 16th volume is an alphabetical index of more than 50,000 titles. Perhaps 10% are alternate titles and original foreign titles, so 45,000 review reprints is a realistic estimate for the first 15 volumes.\n\nThe eight additional bi-annual volumes (for 1981–1996) have at least 15,000 additional reprinted film reviews, making an estimated total of 60,000 or more film reviews in the 24-volume series.
