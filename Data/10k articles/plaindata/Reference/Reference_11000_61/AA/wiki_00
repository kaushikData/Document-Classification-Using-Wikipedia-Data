It was enacted on 15 September 1821.\n\nThe events of the Peninsular War—in particular the removal of Ferdinand VII from the Spanish throne—inspired and facilitated a series of revolts in El Salvador and Nicaragua aimed at winning for Central America greater political autonomy. Though quickly suppressed, these uprisings formed part of the general political upheaval in the Spanish world that led to the Spanish Constitution of 1812. Between 1810 and 1814, the Captaincy General of Guatemala elected seven representatives to the new Cádiz Cortes, and formed locally elected provincial governing councils.\n\nHowever, shortly after his restoration to power in 1814, Ferdinand repudiated the 1812 constitution, dissolved the Cortes, and suppressed liberalism in peninsular Spain, which provoked renewed unrest in the Spanish Americas. The brief restoration of the constitution during the Liberal Triennium beginning in 1820 allowed the Central American provinces to reestablish their elected councils, which then became focal points for constitutionalist and separatist sentiments. In 1821 the provincial council of Guatemala began to openly discuss a declaration of independence from Spain.\n\nIn September the discussion turned toward an outright declaration of independence from Spain, and a document announcing the act was drawn up and debated. The 15 September council meeting at which independence was finally declared was chaired by Gabino Gaínza, and the text of the Act itself was written by Honduran intellectual and politician José Cecilio del Valle and signed by representatives of the various Central American provinces, including José Matías Delgado, José Lorenzo de Romaña and José Domingo Diéguez. The meeting was held at the National Palace in Guatemala City, the site of which is now Centennial Park.\n\nThe Province of San Salvador (El Salvador) accepted the decision of the Guatemalan Council on 21 September, and the Act was seconded by the provincial councils of Comayagua (Honduras) on 28 September and of Nicaragua and Costa Rica on 11 October. However, the other provinces were reluctant to accept the primacy of Guatemala in a new Central American state, and the form of the new polity that would succeed the Captaincy General was not at all clear.\n\nThe Act consists of an introduction, eighteen articles, and a collection of thirteen signatures.\n\nThe introduction asserts that, after consultation with the municipal councils of other cities in the Captaincy General, the provincial council of Guatemala has agreed that there is a general public desire for independence from Spain. In response to this desire, the council has gathered together in the halls of the National Palace together with other public figures to seriously weigh the matter. Hearing the calls for independence from the streets outside the Palace, the council and the individuals gathered have determined the following articles:\n\nThe general will of the people of Guatemala is for independence from the Spanish government and the formation of a congress, which is hereby proclaimed to the same Guatemalan people.\n\nMessages will be dispatched to the provinces so that they may elect deputies or representatives to come to the capital, where they will constitute a congress that will determine the form of the new state's independent government and the fundamental law by which it will be governed.\n\nTo facilitate the appointment of deputies to the congress, they are to be chosen by the same electoral bodies that previously appointed deputies to the Spanish Cortes.\n\nDeputies to the Congress are to be allocated in proportion to the provinces' populations, with one deputy for every fifteen thousand citizens, including as citizens those residents of African origin.\n\nThe provincial electoral bodies are to determine the proper number of deputies for their provinces on the basis of the latest census.\n\nThe deputies thus elected should gather in Guatemala City to form a congress on 1 March 1822 (the following year).\n\nUntil the meeting of the congress, the existing authorities should continue to enforce the laws under the Spanish Constitution of 1812.\n\nUntil the meeting of the congress, the Lord Political Chief Gabino Gaínza will continue to lead the political and military government, together with a provisional advisory council.\n\nThe advisory council will consult with the Lord Political Chief in all matters of economics and government.\n\nThe Catholic Church will continue to be the state religion of Guatemala, with the personal safety and property of its ministers guaranteed.\n\nMessages will be dispatched to the leaders of religious communities to enjoin their cooperation in urging the public to preserve peace and concord during the political transition.\n\nThe municipal council of Guatemala City will take active steps to ensure order and tranquility in the capital region.\n\nThe Lord Political Chief will publish a manifesto announcing the decisions of the ruling council and requesting an oath of loyalty from the people to the new American government that is being established.\n\nThe same oath will recognize the leaders of the new government in their respective roles and authorities.\n\nThe Lord Political Chief, together with the municipal council, will solemnly mark the day upon which the people will proclaim their independence and loyalty to the new state.\n\nThe municipal council has authorized the minting of a medal to commemorate 15 September 1821, on which they declared their independence.\n\nBeing printed, this Act will be circulated among the various provincial councils, deputies and authorities for the harmonization of their sentiments with those of the people and this council.\n\nOn a day to be chosen by the Lord Political Chief, there will be a solemn Mass of Thanksgiving to be followed by three days of celebrations.\n\nArticle 2 of the Act of Independence provided for the formation of a congress to \"decide the point of absolute general independence and fix, in case of agreement, the form of government and the fundamental law of governance\" for the new state. This constituent assembly was meant to meet the following March, but the opportunity never came. Instead, on 29 October 1821 the president of the provisional governing council of newly independent Mexico, Agustín de Iturbide, sent a letter to Gabino Gaínza (now the president of the interim government of Central America) and the council of delegates representing the provinces of Chiapas, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica with a proposal that Central America join the Mexican Empire under the terms of the Three Guarantees of the Treaty of Córdoba.\n\nThe various provincial and municipal governments of Guatemala were consulted and votes taken, with the five provinces excepting El Salvador voting in favor and with El Salvador opposing. On 5 January 1822, Gaínza sent a letter to Iturbide accepting Central America's annexation, and all the territories of Central America were incorporated into the Mexican Empire. They would remain united with Mexico for less than two years before seceding to form the Federal Republic of Central America as the Mexican Empire fell.\n\n"}

It functions as a system for organizing a closed legal brief. The CRuPAC format is a \"closed\" format that is frequently used in responsive legal pleadings, where the issue has already been properly framed and identified by the movant (often through use of the related IRAC methodology). Some authors have suggested dropping the \"P\" section of CRuPAC, which results in only four sections: Conclusion, Rule, Application and Conclusion\n\nThe CRuPAC starts by stating the conclusion that the author wishes the reader (or judge) to reach.\n\nThe rules section of a CRuPAC follows the conclusion. The rule section of a CRuPAC is the statement of the rules that govern the particular question. Rules may include statutes, constitutions, the Rules of Civil Procedure, the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Rules of Evidence, etc. The pertinent rule may also be included in Restatements of the Law, or the common law as derived from court case precedent. Which rules are applicable depends entirely on the question being addressed.\n\nThe \"P\" in CRuPAC stands for \"proof\", although many attorneys sometimes refer to this as the \"precedent\" section. In the proof section, the author uses case law to prove how the rule operates and to give examples of how the rule is used.\n\nThe application section of a CRuPAC applies the rules developed in the rules section to the specific facts of the issue at hand. It is generally improper to introduce new rules in the Application section. If the rules developed in the rules section include common law decisions, then the most efficient way of applying those rules to the facts is by the method compare and contrast, in which the facts of the cases cited as precedent are compared to the facts in the current litigation.\n\nThe (second) conclusion section of a CRuPAC restates the introductory conclusion. It is important that the (second) conclusion not merely copy the introduction verbatim; but rather, that the second conclusion restate the introduction in a compelling manner. It is never proper to introduce new argument or rules in the conclusion. By using two conclusion sections, the CRUPAC applies the maxim: \"Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, then tell 'em what you told 'em.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1288948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1288948", "title": "Capability Maturity Model Integration", "text": "Capability Maturity Model Integration\n\nCapability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process level improvement training and appraisal program. Administered by the CMMI Institute, a subsidiary of ISACA, it was developed at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). It is required by many United States Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. Government contracts, especially in software development. CMU claims CMMI can be used to guide process improvement across a project, division, or an entire organization. CMMI defines the following maturity levels for processes: Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, and Optimizing. Version 2.0 was published in 2018 (Version 1.3 was published in 2010, and is the reference model for the remaining information in this wiki article). CMMI is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by CMU.\n\nOriginally CMMI addresses three areas of interest:\n\n\nIn version 2.0 these three areas (that previously had a separate model each) were merged into a single model (see below for details).\n\nCMMI was developed by a group from industry, government, and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at CMU. CMMI models provide guidance for developing or improving processes that meet the business goals of an organization. A CMMI model may also be used as a framework for appraising the process maturity of the organization. By January 2013, the entire CMMI product suite was transferred from the SEI to the CMMI Institute, a newly created organization at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nCMMI originated in software engineering but has been highly generalized over the years to embrace other areas of interest, such as the development of hardware products, the delivery of all kinds of services, and the acquisition of products and services. The word \"software\" does not appear in definitions of CMMI. This generalization of improvement concepts makes CMMI extremely abstract. It is not as specific to software engineering as its predecessor, the Software CMM (CMM, see below).\n\nIt is important to realize that CMMI is a model and not a standard. In other words, for each area of practice it specifies a general intent and different levels of maturity in abstract terms; it does not provide a prescription how to achieve those levels. It does provide detailed abstract information and examples which serve as guidelines to understanding and implementations, but the particular way of implementing is up to the organization.\n\nCMMI was developed by the CMMI project, which aimed to improve the usability of maturity models by integrating many different models into one framework. The project consisted of members of industry, government and the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI). The main sponsors included the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the National Defense Industrial Association.\n\nCMMI is the successor of the capability maturity model (CMM) or Software CMM. The CMM was developed from 1987 until 1997. In 2002, version 1.1 was released, version 1.2 followed in August 2006, and version 1.3 in November 2010. Some major changes in CMMI V1.3 are the support of agile software development, improvements to high maturity practices and alignment of the representation (staged and continuous).\n\nAccording to the Software Engineering Institute (SEI, 2008), CMMI helps \"integrate traditionally separate organizational functions, set process improvement goals and priorities, provide guidance for quality processes, and provide a point of reference for appraising current processes.\"\n\nIn March 2016, the CMMI Institute was acquired by ISACA.\n\nIn March 2018 CMMI 2.0 was introduced, not free for the first time in CMMI history: the cheapest option was 1-week access to the online version at US$150.00.\n\nIn version 1.3 CMMI existed in two representations: continuous and staged. The continuous representation is designed to allow the user to focus on the specific processes that are considered important for the organization's immediate business objectives, or those to which the organization assigns a high degree of risks. The staged representation is designed to provide a standard sequence of improvements, and can serve as a basis for comparing the maturity of different projects and organizations. The staged representation also provides for an easy migration from the SW-CMM to CMMI.\n\nIn version 2.0 the above representation separation was cancelled and there is now only one cohesive model.\n\nThe model is divided into 4 categories, 9 capabilities and 20 process areas (with initialisms in parenthesis, and highest maturity levels attainable in square brackets):\n\n\nDepending on the areas of interest (acquisition, services, development) used, the process areas it contains will vary. Process areas are the areas that will be covered by the organization's processes. The table below lists the seventeen CMMI core process areas that are present for all CMMI areas of interest in version 1.3.\n\nThe process areas below and their maturity levels are listed for the CMMI for services model:\n\nMaturity Level 2 - Managed\n\nMaturity Level 3 - Defined\n\nMaturity Level 4 - Quantitatively Managed\n\nMaturity Level 5 - Optimizing\n\nCMMI best practices are published in documents called models, each of which addresses a different area of interest. Version 1.3 provides models for three areas of interest: development, acquisition, and services.\n\nIn version 2.0 DEV, ACQ and SVC were merged into a single model where each process area potentially has a specific reference to one or more of these three aspects. Trying to keep up with the industry the model also has explicit reference to agile aspects in some process areas.\n\nAn organization cannot be certified in CMMI; instead, an organization is \"appraised\". Depending on the type of appraisal, the organization can be awarded a maturity level rating (1-5) or a capability level achievement profile.\n\nMany organizations find value in measuring their progress by conducting an appraisal. Appraisals are typically conducted for one or more of the following reasons:\n\nAppraisals of organizations using a CMMI model must conform to the requirements defined in the Appraisal Requirements for CMMI (ARC) document. There are three classes of appraisals, A, B and C, which focus on identifying improvement opportunities and comparing the organization’s processes to CMMI best practices. Of these, class A appraisal is the most formal and is the only one that can result in a level rating. Appraisal teams use a CMMI model and ARC-conformant appraisal method to guide their evaluation of the organization and their reporting of conclusions. The appraisal results can then be used (e.g., by a process group) to plan improvements for the organization.\n\nThe Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI) is an appraisal method that meets all of the ARC requirements. Results of a SCAMPI appraisal may be published (if the appraised organization approves) on the CMMI Web site of the SEI: Published SCAMPI Appraisal Results. SCAMPI also supports the conduct of ISO/IEC 15504, also known as SPICE (Software Process Improvement and Capability Determination), assessments etc.\n\nThis approach promotes that members of the EPG and PATs be trained in the CMMI, that an informal (SCAMPI C) appraisal be performed, and that process areas be prioritized for improvement. More modern approaches, that involve the deployment of commercially available, CMMI-compliant processes, can significantly reduce the time to achieve compliance. SEI has maintained statistics on the \"time to move up\" for organizations adopting the earlier Software CMM as well as CMMI. These statistics indicate that, since 1987, the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 23 months, and from Level 2 to Level 3 is an additional 20 months. Since the release of the CMMI, the median times to move from Level 1 to Level 2 is 5 months, with median movement to Level 3 another 21 months. These statistics are updated and published every six months in a maturity profile.\n\nThe Software Engineering Institute’s (SEI) team software process methodology and the use of CMMI models can be used to raise the maturity level. A new product called Accelerated Improvement Method (AIM) combines the use of CMMI and the TSP.\n\nTo address user security concerns, two unofficial security guides are available. \"Considering the Case for Security Content in CMMI for Services\" has one process area, Security Management. \"Security by Design with CMMI for Development, Version 1.3\" has the following process areas:\n\n\nWhile they do not affect maturity or capability levels, these process areas can be reported in appraisal results.\n\nThe SEI published that 60 organizations measured increases of performance in the categories of cost, schedule, productivity, quality and customer satisfaction. The median increase in performance varied between 14% (customer satisfaction) and 62% (productivity). However, the CMMI model mostly deals with \"what\" processes should be implemented, and not so much with \"how\" they can be implemented. These results do not guarantee that applying CMMI will increase performance in every organization. A small company with few resources may be less likely to benefit from CMMI; this view is supported by the process maturity profile (page 10). Of the small organizations (<25 employees), 70.5% are assessed at level 2: Managed, while 52.8% of the organizations with 1,001–2,000 employees are rated at the highest level (5: Optimizing).\n\nTurner & Jain (2002) argue that although it is obvious there are large differences between CMMI and agile software development, both approaches have much in common. They believe neither way is the 'right' way to develop software, but that there are phases in a project where one of the two is better suited. They suggest one should combine the different fragments of the methods into a new hybrid method. Sutherland et al. (2007) assert that a combination of Scrum and CMMI brings more adaptability and predictability than either one alone. David J. Anderson (2005) gives hints on how to interpret CMMI in an agile manner.\n\nCMMI Roadmaps, which are a goal-driven approach to selecting and deploying relevant process areas from the CMMI-DEV model, can provide guidance and focus for effective CMMI adoption. There are several CMMI roadmaps for the continuous representation, each with a specific set of improvement goals. Examples are the CMMI Project Roadmap, CMMI Product and Product Integration Roadmaps and the CMMI Process and Measurements Roadmaps. These roadmaps combine the strengths of both the staged and the continuous representations.\nThe combination of the project management technique earned value management (EVM) with CMMI has been described (Solomon, 2002). To conclude with a similar use of CMMI, Extreme Programming (XP), a software engineering method, has been evaluated with CMM/CMMI (Nawrocki et al., 2002). For example, the XP requirements management approach, which relies on oral communication, was evaluated as not compliant with CMMI.\n\nCMMI can be appraised using two different approaches: staged and continuous. The staged approach yields appraisal results as one of five \"maturity levels.\" The continuous approach yields one of four \"capability levels.\" The differences in these approaches are felt only in the appraisal; the best practices are equivalent and result in equivalent process improvement results.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It alleged the \"entire business model\" of ConsumerLab.com \"represents an egregious form of consumer fraud and deception.\" CRN requested the FTC to require ConsumerLab.com to disclose all test results, identify the labs that perform its tests, and change its company name to avoid implying that it does its own testing. On 15 March 2005, the FTC \"staff is not recommending agency action at this time\" and no subsequent action has occurred.\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Dr. Cooperman spoke at a House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform hearing on the Regulation of Dietary Supplements. In his statement, he said the most common problem identified from their tests were \"lack of ingredient in a supplement or a very poor quality ingredient in a supplement\" (i.e., potency) and \"contamination with lead and other heavy metals and pesticides\" (i.e., adulteration).\n\nConsumerLab.com filed suit against CRN alleging CRN's publication of its complaint letter to FTC was defamation, infliction of intentional harm, and six other causes.

The dispute was eventually settled and dismissed.\n\nOn 26 May 2010, he issued a panel statement on \"Dietary Supplements: What Seniors Need To Know\" hearing at the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging.

{"id": "2223246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2223246", "title": "El Vacilón de la Mañana", "text": "El Vacilón de la Mañana\n\nEl Vacilón de la Mañana is a Spanish language weekday morning radio show. The show originates from WSKQ-FM in New York City, a Spanish radio station branded as \"Mega 97.9\", and it is syndicated live to a number of different markets in the US such as Providence, Rhode Island; Miami and Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Hartford, Connecticut; and Puerto Rico.7\n\nThe word \"vacilón\" is not directly translatable into English; it derives from the Spanish verb \"vacilar\" (to vacillate), but in colloquial Spanish can also mean to \"check someone out\" or to \"have fun.\" Thus, the show's name roughly translates in English to \"The Morning Tease.\"\n\nDuring the first two weeks of January 2007, new airings of this program were discontinued, and only pre-recorded programs were aired, coinciding with Luis Jiménez's departure from the program. He has signed a contract with the Univision Radio network, but is prevented by previous non-competitive agreements to air any new program in New York City during El Vacilón's allotted time slot until 2008. Most of the program's crew has chosen to remain contracted to La Mega.\n\nAs of mid January 2007, Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS) owned WSKQ (La Mega 97.9 FM) brought two new hosts to the show, Dominican-born Juan Carlos Alonso (who sounds just like Luis Jiménez), and Puerto Rican Frankie Jay (who also sounds like Moonshadow) which are now replacing Luis Jiménez and Moonshadow. Juan Carlos Alonso was relocated from another SBS station in Orlando, Florida and Frankie Jay was relocated from another SBS station in Puerto Rico. Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay voice resemblance to the former hosts have sparked a number of accusations of trying to imitate the former Vacilón hosts Luis Jiménez and Moonshadow (the main reason SBS brought them to NY).\n\nDuring 2007 Luis Jiménez and SBS were involved in a legal fight because SBS claims Luis Jiménez was cashing in on the name of the morning show through the release of his DVD movie \"El Vacilón the Movie\" which was released on January 30, 2007. Luis Jiménez filed a counter-lawsuit accusing SBS of trying to fool the audience by having Juan Carlos and Frankie Jay imitate the voices and style of Luis Jiménez and Moonshadow, and also accuses his former team members of betrayal and stealing his intellectual property by using characters such as Dr. Hector Tilla and Madam Melo. In early January 2008 Spanish Broadcasting System officially won the legal fight.\n\nSince February 21, 2007, Luis Jiménez started producing his own show \"The Luis Jiménez Show\" and it is being broadcast in several cities in the US, such as Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, among others through different Univision Radio stations. It is expected to expand into more cities during this year as Univision Radio introduces the show to new markets, but it is not expected to make it into NYC until 2008. Only two of the members of the old \"Vacilón de la Mañana\" have followed Luis Jiménez to his new show. These are \"Yun Yun\" and \"Sonny Flow\", the latter one being \"DJ Chucky\" who just became part of \"The Luis Jiménez Show\" crew. Alma, who is Luis's producer, is also part of the new show in Univision Radio.\n\nMoonshadow has come back to \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" and together with Juan Carlos and Franky Jay had been able to stay ahead of the \"Luis Jiménez Show\" (3.9 to 2.0 in the ratings). Although when \"The Luis Jiménez Show\" made it to NYC early in 2008.\nUpon his departure from \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" Luis Jiménez also took the morning show's website with him. For the entire year of 2007 the domain name \"www.elvacilon.com\" belonged to his producer Maria Alma and therefore SBS and WSKQ La Mega 97.9 FM were unable to use the website address for the show. A new website for \"El Vacilón\" was created www.elvacilon.org.In early 2008, after the lawsuit the domain name \"elvacilon dot com\" was returned to SBS and is run on the web servers of Spanish Broadcasting System(SBS)\n\nAn equally named program was broadcast by another SBS affiliate station in Miami: WXDJ-FM (El Zol 95.7), a fact that raised confusion among some listeners in both markets until March 2003. The hosts of \"El Vacilón Miami\" were Enrique Santos (a former police officer turned funny man) and \"The Professor\" Joe Ferrero, both of Cuban-American descent. Early producer of the show Alberto Sardinas also joined the team at the time.\n\nThe two jokesters achieved national and international notoriety when on June 18, 2003 they prank-called Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, which brought them plenty of press. They later used the same technique to prank-call Cuba's then-President Fidel Castro, the more notorious and more better known of the pranks. The team was fined by the FCC when an anonymous source filed a complaint with said government agency (as a result of the latter prank). The duo took to the streets of Miami and collected in pennies the entire amount of the fee and then some. Luckily, the radio station's legal eagles resolved the issue regarding the fine and all of the money collected was then donated to a local charity. They later used the same technique to crank call. In the history of radio broadcast this was the first time that a morning show had prank-called the leaders of two countries.\n\nDespite of the huge success of El Vacilón Miami, hosted by Enrique and Joe, it all came to a halt on March 5, 2007 when the hosts, fed up with the string of unfulfilled promises by Spanish Broadcasting Systems (SBS) and other issues, decided to walk out on air. They trashed the company for four hours of broadcast until they were eventually pulled off the air by management. The morning show was replaced with pre-recorded bits soon after. One week later, the only one of the show's main producers, Miguel Reyes alias Mikey Machete, was let go by the company. Reyes hosted the Saturday morning \"Best Of\" show which he also produced and achieved the number one spot in ratings for a Saturday morning show in the Tropical market. While SBS refused to give details on Mr. Reyes’ firing, it appeared to be the result of the fall out following the early departure of the show's two hosts.\n\nEnrique Santos and Joe Ferrero were signed to Univision's WRTO, Miami, La Kalle 98.3 FM for the time being. Luis Jiménez's and his morning show were being syndicated in various markets. Univision Radio returned both shows to their respective cities to take on SBS directly on early 2008. Mike Reyes, former producer for Enrique Santos & Joe Ferrero, return to radio also in early 2008 at the end of his non compete\n\nFrom March 22, 2007 to March 1, 2008, \"El Zol 95 FM\" was broadcasting New York's \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" which was also being syndicated in Puerto Rico. Since March 3, 2008, El Zol started El Vacilón de Miami with Neo Encendido and Los Pichy Boys (Alejandro González and Maikel Rodriguez) from 6 to 10 pm. The latter show was replaced in less than a year by Al Fuentes, former P.D. of various radio stations and Pio Ferro, V.P of Programming of SBS. Soon after that, Pio Ferro's employment was terminated and that morning show had become a one-man show.\n\n\"The Enrique and Joe Show\" (with sidekick and producer Mikey Machete) on Miami's La Kalle 98.3 FM, in less than a years time, once again became the #1 rated Tropical (bi-lingual) morning show in South Florida with ratings numbers reaching double digits. In May 2009, the dynamic duo of Miami radio split up and two shows were created. In the morning \"The Enrique Santos Show\", followed by \"Joe Ferrero y La Animalada\" (originally hosted for 5 months by Mikey Machete and Albertico Rodriguez) on La Kalle 98.3FM.\nIn early spring 2010, changes started to take place in both radio stations and by mid-year, Enrique Santos was the only one from the original morning crew to be retained on 98.3's morning show as Univision restructured the station to fit Arbitron's new ratings methodology. The station, now re-branded as MIX 98.3, assumed a more bilingual style programing.\n\nJoe Ferrero was let go by Univision Radio on June 4, 2010 along with (Mike Reyes) Mikey Machete. In October 2010 Joe Ferrero consequently took over \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" on Spanish Broadcasting System's (WXDJ) El Zol 95.7 FM with new co-host Albertito Rodriguez as his sidekick and female co-host Betzy Vazquez. Mikey (Mike Reyes) Machete is currently the Promotions & Marketing director for ESPN Deportes Radio in Miami.\n\nAs of August 22, 2012, Joe Ferrero is no longer at SBS Miami. He was let go for no apparent reason and is currently the Operations Manager and morning show host at the all new 105.5 FM stations out of the Florida Keys. Some of the infamous duo's classic crank calls can still be heard on www.Marikonson.com\nIn 2015, Ferrero became a morning host on WMGE (Mega 94.9) in the Miami/Frt Lauderdale market until 2016, when Joe Ferrero was let go from the station \"for no apparent reason\" as per the statement he released via his Instagram account.\n\n\"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" (roughly translated as the \"Morning Party\") has various key elements: prank calls, musical parodies, comedy sketches, humorous commentary about straight and odd news, and open telephone lines.\n\nThe program's key player is Luis Jiménez (born on March 26, 1970 in San Juan, Puerto Rico), who has been its main host for more than twelve years. Jiménez co-hosts the broadcast with Raymond Broussard (born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on December 20, 1953, of Cajun and Puerto Rican descent) and who uses the stage name \"Moonshadow\".\n\nLuis Jiménez started his radio career in his hometown of Caguas, Puerto Rico as a teenager, working as a part-time disc-jockey in various local radio stations. He later moved to Orlando, Florida, achieving some recognition there as a morning radio host after holding various odd jobs. He was referred to La Mega's management as a suitable candidate for hosting a Spanish-language radio show in New York City and moved there in 1993. The program's first airing occurred on August 9.\n\nJiménez modeled his show after \"El Bufeo Matutino\" (\"The Morning Goof\"), a successful radio program in Puerto Rico that lasted twenty-two years in its various inceptions, and always had Moonshadow as its main producer and host. Luis Jiménez co-hosted the show with longtime friend Junior Hernandez. Hernandez suffered from asthma, and died of a heart attack. Fans streamed to the station to pay tribute to Hernandez the Thursday night after his death; the popular radio personality was only 34 years old. After Broussard's move to New York City in 1997, and after the death of Hernandez's in 1998, the program had a succession of co-hosts, with Moonshadow joining the show for good in 2000. Moonshadow can claim poetic justice about the fact that WZNT-FM, also known as Z-93, (Puerto Rico's main salsa radio station), which was the same radio station who fired him for being too controversial, now airs \"El Vacilón de la Mañana\" to Puerto Rico in direct Internet audio feed from La Mega every morning after a management change (SBS currently owns both stations). The first audio feed to Puerto Rico occurred on February 9, 2004. The program has since gone into syndication by ABC Networks in a few Latino markets within the United States; the first syndicated airing to Orlando, Florida and other Latino markets occurred on January 9, 2006.\nWhile Moonshadow has gone on record in numerous times about modeling his original show after Howard Stern's (with a very strong dose of Puerto Rican cultural elements), Jiménez's numerous original contributions give the show a unique pan-Latino flavor (its largest audience appears to be the Dominican and Puerto Rican community in New York City). The result \"out-Sterned\" Stern's show, and El Vacilón's audienceship ratings surpassed Stern's for three years, until Stern's departure to satellite radio in 2005.\n\nJiménez and Moonshadow do not act alone: besides a sizeable audience participation, the show's announcers and assistant producers (called the \"Mequetrefes\", or Whippersnappers) are key to the success of the show. This ragtag group feature a female traffic announcer (Carolina Cadillo, born in Newark, New Jersey, of Peruvian and Nicaraguan descent), a rather peculiar news announcer (Francis Méndez, born in Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic), the show's main audio producer (DJ Chucky), its call screeners and production assistants (Tony Sánchez, Bocachula, El Papichulo, etc.), and the like. The show's executive producer, María Eugenia Alma, appears sporadically in the show, particularly as female singer and occasional phone call prankster.\n\nEach member of the team is known for a perceived self-avowed defect or particularity: Luis Jiménez claims to have undersized genitalia and hypospadias, Moonshadow has an inguinal hernia but reportedly has the fastest tongue in American radio history; Francis Méndez is allegedly a former cocaine addict who now suffers from erectile dysfunction as a result, Carolina Cadillo is a proud nymphomaniac who speaks Spanish with a noticeable English accent (Spanish is her second language) and who has virtually no buttocks, and so on.\n\nPrank calls are usually presented in a section called \"¡Caíste!\" (You Fell for It!), in which unwitting people are called to their homes or job places and are provoked with touchy subjects for the prank victims (generally, they are taunted with intimate subjects). These prank calls are made by request from friends or family of the victims. The most famous prank call victim on the show's history was a Dominican building superintendent given the moniker Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo by Jiménez, who played the part of a viciously irate jealous husband. Manolo's enraged, expletive-laden response has become the most copied and broadcast anecdote in the show's history. Manolo's son Israel, who coordinated the phone call, was in turn pranked in another memorable call.\n\nAfter the deportation of the section's producer, Rubén Ithier, also known as \"Rubén El Moreno\", back to his country of origin, the Dominican Republic in late 2004, this section went into limbo for close to a year and a half. Prank reruns were (and are still) played on the section's regularly slotted time.\n\nDuring the hiatus, the current cast tried to pull some pranks of their own with mixed success, including repeated \"Manolo Cabeza 'e Huevo\" pranks, perhaps the most successful after Ithier's departure.\n\nThe cast resumed production of regularly scheduled \"¡Caíste!\" pranks in early 2006.\n\nIn a similar sidenote, the Miami programme is also known for its share of pranks. Its notoriety came with the \"¡Caiste!\" jokes made to Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro (The former being pranked before the latter) while using pre-existing tape conversations (for the former, it was with a conversation between Castro and then-Mexican President Vicente Fox, while for the latter, the snippets of the prank which was done on Chávez was used). Both pranks had Joe Ferrero pretending to be a sergeant in some army. Needless to say, while the reaction of the former victim was absolute silence, Castro replied after Ferrero tripped up his (Castro's) words (\"¿Estás conforme con toda la mierda que has hecho en la isla, asesino?\" [\"Are you conformed with all the shit that you did on the island, murderer?\"]) with a slightly peeved response: \"¿En qué caí, comemierda? ¿En qué caí, maricón? ¿En qué caí, mari-cón-són?\" (\"What did I fall in, shiteater? What did I fall in, queer? What did I fall in, you gay-fer?\"). However, the FCC complained and slapped a fine to the two disc jockeys (Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero); both chose not to pay, relying instead on a penny-drive. Its (the programme's) second-funniest joke is one that is called \"¡Píntame!\" (Paint me!), in which the two prank call a painter by asking him \"¿Usted es el pintor?\" (\"Are you the Painter?\"), whereupon by using his response (which was always \"¡Sí, yo soy el pintor!\" (\"Yes, I'm the painter!\") they played a sample of Elvis Crespo's song \"Píntame\" (the first line of the song, to be exact: \"'Píntame', le dije yo al pintor\"; \"'Paint me', I told the painter\"), thus aggravating the man and angering him even further, thus launching a tirade of Dominican insults. Another famous prank made by the 2 DJs was their \"Gonzalo Créo\" saga; the first joke of which, \"La vieja puta\" (\"The Old Bitch\"), revolved around Santos prank calling a Cuban man by making said Cuban believe that he was in a telephoned confession booth, whereupon the Cuban said that he was being stalked by the grandmother of a friend of his. When one of Santos's associates is heard, the Cuban is outraged, and hangs up on him, whereupon, we hear Santos saying that he didn't get a chance to ask for the Cuban's money; the rest of the prank (although it is funny) revolves around then trying to get the Cuban's money. More of the \"Gonzalo Créo\" jokes occurred, including \"El Dolor del Vecino\" (The Neighbor's Pain), using the same premise of pretense of a telephoned confession booth, which involves a man struggling with his apparent bisexuality and \"Domingo Y Pancho\" which involves them prank calling a man who is sexually aroused by a woman who is helping him with physical therapy for an illness of the nerves. A lot of the prank calls made by Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero (During and after \"El Vacilón\" including the Enrique & Joe Show) have now been made available at www.Marikonson.com\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission considers the use of prank calls to be a violation of FCC policy, which prohibits recording unsolicited phone calls for broadcast, and fined WSKQ a penalty of $16,000 for a 2007 prank call, unless all parties agree with the recording being made public.\n\nLuis Jiménez (and occasionally Moonshadow, who used to play all the comedic characters in his previous shows but has a more laid-back role on this one) play various characters in fifteen-minute segments on the show (usually three a day). Among them: \"Cornelio Toro\", a naive store-owner whose wife has made a habit of being unfaithful to him with every man she comes in contact with while Toro fails to recognize it every time, even though he immediately knows when someone else is being cheated on (the name is a play on Spanish words: Cornelio sounds very much like \"cuernudo\", a cuckold, while Toro, or bull, evokes the bull's \"cuernos\", or horns, the sign of the deceived man in Latin American culture); \"Jonathan Buford Rodriguez\", better known as \"El Chulo\", a gigolo who preys on geriatric women; \"El Chef Pipí\", a parody on Cuban chef and Univision television personality José Hernández, better known as Chef Pepin, being Chef Pipí's main trait his questionable masculinity; \"Rebeca Larica\", a hyperventilating, gum-chewing woman who craves for male attention (played by Moonshadow); \"Dr. Héctor Tilla\", a self-proclaimed medical doctor with very rude manners and a long history of malpractice lawsuits; \"Paca Garmentí\" and \"Silvia Penacho Chafrías\"; two civic-minded single women (they are set apart, in the movie at least, by their hairstyle: Paca, played by Luis, has short black hair in braids, while Silvia, played by Moonshadow, has red hair styled similarly to the Wendy's girl), both over 60 years old, who love to bicker with each other (both names are plays on Spanish words: \"\"Pa' cagarme en tí\" is the informal way of saying \"En tí me' cago\"\", which means \"I shit on you\", while Silvia's name, whilst parts of it are normal, The clang comes with the word \"chocha fría\", which means something to the effect of \"cold pussy\"); \"Madam Melo\" (originally called \"Mamá Melo\"), a hyperkinetic Dominican santería practitioner (both names are plays on sexual references: \"Madam Melo\" is a play on \"mandamelo\", which means \"Fuck me\", whilst \"Mamá Melo\" is a play on the insult \"mamamelo\", which means \"Suck it (my dick) for me\"); \"Goyito\" and \"Memin\", two schoolkids (Memin being a straight arrow, while Goyito is a perennial foul-mouthed prankster) and \"Federico \"Pedrito\" Rivera Rodriguez\", better known as \"Findingo\", a chronic marijuana smoker with a strong speech impairment.\n\nSome of the ideas behind these characters are not entirely original: \"Cornelio Toro\" is the updated version of \"Toribio Tauro\", a similar television character played by Puerto Rican comedic actor Adrián García on Puerto Rican television (and provided with an accent closely resembling that of \"Don Pulula\", one of José Miguel Agrelot's characters); \"El Chulo\" evolved from a real human being who was a production assistant for one of Puerto Rico's radio morning shows who had a liking for geriatric women (and became famously made fun of by being called \"El Chupaviejas\" by the show's hosts), and \"Dr. Hector Tilla\" was another one of Moonshadow's creations while in the toilet. \"Goyito\" and \"Memin\" were originally created by Moonshadow after \"Pellín\" and \"Pillín\", two animated characters from a Puerto Rican public service announcement, while \"Findingo's\" name was taken from a similarly named (although completely different) comedic character played by the Puerto Rican actor, René Rubiella; the original character shared a low intelligence quotient with the newer one, besides the name. The parody on Chef Pepin was rumored to be hated by the parodied celebrity because of its homoerotic undertones, but this was dispelled recently when Chef Pepín himself was invited to participate in a racy sketch along its comedic counterpart, the result being a hilarious interaction between the two characters which Chef Pepín clearly enjoyed.\n\nSpecial mention has to be made about a real \"character\" who happens to be a regular caller to the show, and as of October 2005 has joined the cast on a part-time basis. \"Metadona\" is a real-life reformed robber, born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, who had a chronic drug addiction before rehabilitation. There are strong doubts about him being completely drug-free, but he vows to have abandoned his criminal past for good. His slow delivery (evoking a chronically drug-induced state) and daring stories about botched robberies and juvenile pranks entitled him to the alias, which is the Spanish word for methadone. He has a habit of loudly opening a beer can for breakfast every time he calls.\n\n\"El Vacilón\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s musical parodies have recently become the show's bread and butter. Popular Latino songs are typically parodied in the show, generally changing the lyrics to sexually suggestive, humorous lyrics. Some original compositions are featured as well, and generally along the same subject matter. A few program guests, mainly reggaeton artists, have parodied their own regular songs in the show (and therefore have contributed with their own material). A few English-language songs are also parodied, but mostly fragments of them.\n\nNewer songs are introduced in a weekly section called \"El Joyón Musical\" (\"joyón\" can be an augmentative for either the word \"joya\" (jewel), or \"joyo\" (an alternate spelling for hole, and Puerto Rican vulgar slang for anus)). The songs are then placed in heavy rotation as filler between sections (and, in the Puerto Rico broadcast of the show, to cover local New York radio spots that are irrelevant to the Puerto Rican market).\n\nSome listeners have complained these musical parodies take more show time than warranted. The authors of most of these parodies, DJ Chucky who is now part of \"The Luis Jiménez Show\" and Gerpis Correa, also known as \"Shino/Aguakate\".\n\nThe Miami \"Vacilón\" did their share of musical parodies, until the hosts Enrique and Joe left to Univision Radio. None of the new hosts capitalized on that aspect of the show, mostly for lack of production and talent. Both Enrique Santos and Joe Ferrero continued to produce phenomenal parodies which dealt with political satire, current events, making fun of people, and even the City of Hialeah (Second largest city in South Florida, mostly Cuban). The parody sung, written and performed by Enrique Santos, \"Sweet Home Hialeah\", has been one of their most famous, locally. The video was shot on location in the City of Hialeah and has almost become its emblem. The lyrics were sung to \"Sweet Home Alabama\" but with a twist. (See YouTube)\n\nStraight news are read and humorously discussed in the section called \"Hablando Plepla\" (\"Talking Crap\"; \"Plepla\" is a euphemism for feces, with less of a profane connotation than the more commonly used \"caca\", or \"shit\").\n\nThe same is done for odd news in the section called \"Noticias Locas\" (Crazy News). Most are taken from the Odd News segment of Yahoo! News.\n\nFrancis Méndez reads regular news at the top of the hour (not the same as Hablando Plepla), but injecting humorous slang phrases to the headlines. This goes in sharp contrast to the serious, almost dead-panned delivery of the show's sports announcer, Cuban-born Renato Murphy, as well as that of Cadillo's traffic report. The result is almost as odd as the \"Noticias Locas\" segment itself.\n\nLines are opened in a segment of the show for listeners to call in and tell their anecdotes, which are generally mishaps or sexual situations. Although many subject names are suggested, all calls wind up discussing the aforementioned situations. From Monday to Thursday, subjects are rotated, but the last two hours of Friday's show are devoted to randomly take calls on previous subjects, in the section called \"Lo Que Sobró de la Semana\" (What's Left of This Week).\n\nListeners' calls tend to have a somewhat stringent quality control:\n\n\n\n"}

Frankweiler (1995 film)\n\nFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler is a 1995 American made-for-television comedy-drama film based on E.L. Konigsburg's novel of the same name. The story is about a girl and her brother who run away from home to live in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and discover what they think is a lost treasure. The children, Claudia and Jamie, are transfixed with the treasure and won't leave without knowing what its secret is. Lauren Bacall stars in the title role.\n\nThe book was previously adapted into a 1973 feature film starring Ingrid Bergman, later released on home video as \"The Hideaways\".\n\nClaudia is the middle child of a busy family.

Claudia becomes determined to solve the mystery of \"The Angel.\" Claudia and Jamie spend most of their time in searching and researching new things about the statue.\n\nThe following day, the two notice a small mark at the base of the piece. After some research, they find that the mark was one that Michelangelo made on numerous works. Claudia disguises herself as an adult in order to make an appointment with a museum worker to inform them of their discovery. Contrary to her hopes, the official informs her that they knew of the mark but are unsure if it is authentic.\n\nJamie, homesick after a week away, catches a cold. Refusing to go home before they solve the mystery, Claudia suggests that they visit the statue's previous owner, Mrs. Frankweiler. She refuses to tell them directly, but does permit them to attempt to discover the answer for themselves. After leading them to a room lined from floor to ceiling with filing cabinets, she informs them that they have one hour to search for the truth. After 54 minutes of fruitless effort, Claudia uncovers the correct file. It contains a sketch of the sculpture from one of Michelangelo's notebooks, proving that he is, indeed, the creator. Finally appeased, the siblings permit Mrs. Frankweiler to drive them home.\n\nThe film lacks the narrative of Mrs. Frankweiler present in the book which causes it to lose much of the book's humor and wisdom. For the majority of the film, the script stays true to the action in the book. However, Claudia's posing as an adult and Jamie's cold are not present in the novel. \"TV Guide\" asserts that these changes may differ from the book but bring added drama to the film.\n\nTV Guide granted the film three and a half stars out of four. It declared that the film was a \"somewhat dry, but still thoroughly entertaining adaptation of an excellent story.\" They also write that the film \"celebrates the magic and beauty of art, the fun of an adventure, and most of all, a child's need to feel important.\" Their final word on the matter proclaim that \"the performances and production are first rate. The children are variously brilliant, bratty and excitable, and Lauren Bacall is appropriately dignified as Mrs. Frankweiler.\"\n\nJ. Dillard writes that the movie is carried by its casting of Lauren Bacall in the title role and that the film \"never rises above the level of the TV Movie.\" However, he does say that it \"should be entertaining \" for its preteen target audience.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "100796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100796", "title": "Guinness World Records", "text": "Guinness World Records\n\nGuinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 2000 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous United States editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The brainchild of Sir Hugh Beaver, the book was co-founded by brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter in Fleet Street, London in August 1954.\n\nThe book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2019 edition, it is now in its 64th year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \"Guinness World Records\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.\n\nOn 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse (it is the plover). That evening at Castlebridge House, he realized that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful.\n\nBeaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee Christopher Chataway recommended University friends Norris and Ross McWhirter, who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became \"The Guinness Book of Records\" in August 1954. A thousand copies were printed and given away.\n\nAfter the founding of \"The Guinness Book of Records\" at 107 Fleet Street, London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British best seller lists by Christmas. The following year, it launched in the US, and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, \"Guinness World Records\" has gone on to become a record breaker in its own right; with sales of more than 100 million copies in 100 different countries and 37 languages, \"Guinness World Records\" is the world's best selling copyrighted book ever.\n\nBecause the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the TV series \"Record Breakers\", based upon the book, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. Ross McWhirter was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1975. Following Ross' assassination, the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called \"Norris on the Spot\".\n\nGuinness Superlatives (later Guinness World Records) Limited was formed in 1954 to publish the first book. Sterling Publishing owned the rights to the \"Guinness\" book in the US for decades. The group was owned by Guinness PLC and subsequently Diageo until 2001, when it was purchased by Gullane Entertainment. Gullane was itself purchased by HIT Entertainment in 2002. In 2006, Apax Partners purchased HiT and subsequently sold Guinness World Records in early 2008 to the Jim Pattison Group, the parent company of Ripley Entertainment, which is licensed to operate Guinness World Records' Attractions. With offices in New York City and Tokyo, Guinness World Records' global headquarters remain in London, while its museum attractions are based at Ripley headquarters in Orlando, Florida, US.\n\nRecent editions have focused on record feats by person competitors. Competitions range from obvious ones such as Olympic weightlifting to the longest egg tossing distances, or for longest time spent playing \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" or the number of hot dogs that can be consumed in three minutes. Besides records about competitions, it contains such facts such as the heaviest tumour, the most poisonous fungus, the longest-running soap opera and the most valuable life-insurance policy, among others. Many records also relate to the youngest people to have achieved something, such as the youngest person to visit all nations of the world (Maurizio Giuliano).\n\nEach edition contains a selection of the records from the Guinness World Records database, as well as select new records, with the criteria for inclusion changing from year to year.\n\nThe retirement of Norris McWhirter from his consulting role in 1995 and the subsequent decision by Diageo Plc to sell The Guinness Book of Records brand have shifted the focus of the books from text-oriented to illustrated reference. A selection of records are curated for the book from the full archive but all existing Guinness World Records titles can be accessed by creating a login on the company's website. Applications made by individuals for existing record categories are free of charge. There is an administration fee of $5 to propose a new record title.\n\nA number of spin-off books and television series have also been produced.\n\n\"Guinness World Records\" bestowed the record of \"Person with the most records\" on Ashrita Furman of Queens, NY in April 2009. At that time, he held 100 records.\n\nIn 2005, Guinness designated 9 November as \"International Guinness World Records Day\" to encourage breaking of world records. In 2006, an estimated 100,000 people participated in over 10 countries. Guinness reported 2,244 new records in 12 months, which was a 173% increase over the previous year. In February 2008, NBC aired \"The Top 100 Guinness World Records of All Time\" and Guinness World Records made the complete list available on their website.\nFor many records, Guinness World Records is the effective authority on the exact requirements for them and with whom records reside, the company providing adjudicators to events to determine the veracity of record attempts. The list of records which the Guinness World Records covers is not fixed; records may be added and also removed for various reasons. The public are invited to submit applications for records, which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record. The company also provides corporate services for companies to \"harness the power of record-breaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses.\"\n\nGuinness World Records states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons, such as those related to the killing or harming of animals.\n\nSeveral world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons, including concerns for the well being of potential record breakers. For example, following publication of a \"heaviest fish\" record, many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy, and therefore such entries were removed. The Guinness Book also dropped records within their \"eating and drinking records\" section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential litigation. These changes included the removal of all spirit, wine, and beer drinking records, along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees. Other records, such as sword swallowing and rally driving (on public roads), were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels.\n\nThere have been instances of closed records being reopened. For example, the sword swallowing record was listed as closed in the 1990 Guinness Book of World Records, but the \"Guinness World Records Primetime\" TV show, which started in 1998, accepted three sword swallowing challenges (and so did the 2007 edition of the \"Guinness World Records\" onwards). Similarly, the speed beer drinking records which were dropped from the book in 1991, reappeared 17 years later in the 2008 edition, but were moved from the \"Human Achievements\" section of the older book to the \"Modern Society\" section of the newer edition.\n\n, it is required in the guidelines of all \"large food\" type records that the item be fully edible, and distributed to the public for consumption, to prevent food wastage.\n\nChain letters are also not allowed: \"Guinness World Records does not accept any records relating to chain letters, sent by post or e-mail. \n\nFor some potential categories, \"Guinness World Records\" has declined to list some records that are too difficult or impossible to determine. For example, its website states: \"We do not accept any claims for beauty as it is not objectively measurable.\"\n\nOn 10 December 2010, \"Guinness World Records\" stopped its new \"dreadlock\" category after investigation of its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, determining it was impossible to judge this record accurately.\n\n\"Guinness World Records\" website publishes selected records and is not supposed to be used for the record verification purposes, as it explains: \"There are more than 40,000 current records in our database and we try our best to feature as many as possible online. We currently include over 15,000 records online which we update every week, so make sure to check the site regularly!\" The book printed annually contains only 4,000 records. The only way to verify a record is to contact Guinness, and the average response time is twelve weeks.\n\nIn 1976, a \"Guinness Book of World Records\" museum opened in the Empire State Building. Speed shooter Bob Munden then went on tour promoting \"The Guinness Book of World Records\" by performing his record fast draws with a standard weight single-action revolver from a western movie type holster. His fastest time for a draw was 0.02 seconds. Among exhibits were life-size statues of the world's tallest man (Robert Wadlow) and world's largest earth worm, an X-ray photo of a sword swallower, repeated lightning strike victim Roy Sullivan's hat complete with lightning holes and a pair of gem-studded golf shoes on sale for $6500. The museum closed in 1995.\n\nIn more recent years, the Guinness company has permitted the franchising of small museums with displays based on the book, all currently () located in towns popular with tourists: Tokyo, Copenhagen, San Antonio.\nThere were once Guinness World Records museums and exhibitions at the London Trocadero, Bangalore, San Francisco, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Las Vegas, Nevada. The Orlando museum, which closed in 2002, was branded \"The Guinness Records Experience\"; the Hollywood, Niagara Falls, Copenhagen, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee museums also previously featured this branding.\n\nGuinness World Records has commissioned various television series documenting world record breaking attempts, including:\n\nSpecials:\n\nWith the popularity of reality television, Guinness World Records began to market itself as the originator of the television genre, with slogans such as \"we wrote the book on Reality TV\".\n\nIn 2008, Guinness World Records released its gamer's edition, a branch that keeps records for popular video game high scores, code, and feats in association with Twin Galaxies. The Gamer's Edition contains 258 pages, over 1236 video game related world records and four interviews including one with Twin Galaxies founder Walter Day. The most recent edition is the \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, 2019,\" which was released September 6, 2018.\n\nThe \"Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums\" was published from 2003 to 2006, based on two earlier, separate HiT publications, \"British Hit Singles\" and \"British Hit Albums\", which began in 1977. It was effectively replaced (in singles part) by the \"Virgin Book of British Hit Singles\" from 2007 onward.\n\nA video game, \"\", was developed by TT Fusion and released for Nintendo DS, Wii and iOS in November 2008.\n\nIn 2012, Warner Bros. announced the development of a live-action film version of \"Guinness World Records\" with Daniel Chun as scriptwriter. The film version will apparently use the heroic achievements of record holders as the basis for a narrative that should have global appeal.\n"}

The practice of hana aloha was performed by a kahuna (priest) who conducted a ceremony to gain the desired effect. An infatuated person may request a hana aloha in order to instill a lust into a desired victim, or a shy person may request a ceremony that simply brings the desired person in closer proximity. Conversely a person who felt that they were afflicted by love-inducing magic could request a \"pale hana aloha\" ceremony in order to ward off the unwanted love. Some kahuna would only conduct a hana aloha ceremony if the love was one that was spiritually pure. One test used to determine this was to stir a bowl of water and place two flowers, particularly those of the ko'oloa'ula (\"Abutilon menziesii\") in the turbulent liquid. If the flowers quickly met and floated together then the love was ordained, but if the flowers avoided each other the ceremony was not to be conducted. \n\nThe ceremony invariably uses sugarcane as an essential element, and specific varieties of sugarcane were applied to different ends. The names of the canes themselves hinted at their particular use, utilizing the Hawaiian wit that constantly played puns of the multiple meanings of words. The \"papa'a cane\", a particularly dark cane, literally means burnt and refers to the slightly burnt flavor of the molasses of this variety. Papa'a can also mean \"tight, walled, secure,\" and therefore was used in the hana aloha that aimed to make a secure, long term relationship. \"Manulele\", referring to a flying bird, was applied to a distant love. The \"Pilimai\" variety, literally meaning \"come this way,\" was used to cause intense but short lived affairs. Other cane varieties associated with the hana aloha are the \"Lahi\" and \"Kea\" varieties. The counter action to the hana aloha magic utilized the \"Laukona\" sugarcane variety in a ceremony called pale hana aloha. \n\nWhile the hana aloha ceremony focused on prayer it would at times be accompanied by a \"magic potion,\" to be drunk either by the infatuated person or his/hers object of desire.\n"}

It was created by a group of scholars and practitioners with the support of Cultural Heritage Administration of the Republic of Korea. It is the ongoing project to build up an extensive inventory of ICH in Korea. The ultimate goal is to enhance the significance of traditional cultures and cultural diversities.\n\nThe ICHPEDIA project in Korea started with a movement to create a new paradigm for safeguarding of ICH in the national and international arenas. With the awareness that there are conflicts and difference between Korea’s current policies and laws regarding ICH protection and UNESCO’s 2003 Convention, the project started with a new understanding of ICH and a new methodology of collecting data. ICHPEDIA is the online encyclopedia of intangible cultural heritage established on the basis of survey data. Its immediate goal is to create an exclusive record of Korea’s ICH using internet surveys and taking a wiki-model based on the Web 2.0 platform. This project entails some innovations such as the utilization of a bottom-up approach, the collective intelligence, and community’s active involvement. In order to compile exclusive lists of ICH, first, the online survey is used. Second, a wiki-model for collecting data and a new network system is set up. Third, the online-based networks have certain merits, including the ability to surpass barriers of time and space, as well as various divisions and partitions in the society. ICHPEDIA removes the walls between specialists and ordinary people, central organizations and regional ones, and between government and citizens. The ultimate goal of ICHPEDIA project is to increase cooperation among stakeholders for safeguarding ICH in Korea.\n\nICH has recently drawn international attention because of its immeasurable contributions to the enhancement of human creativity and cultural diversity. However, ICH of each country has been disappearing rapidly as modernization and industrialization processes within each country were intensified. In particular, ICH is not easy to preserve and protect from destruction due to its immaterial and formless nature. It exists in people’s memory, ideas, and everyday practices. UNESCO has strenuously made efforts to establish safeguarding measures of ICH throughout the world due to distinctive characteristics of ICH. UNESCO’s initiatives signify its view of ICH as the common cultural heritages of humanity. As part of such initiatives, UNESCO announced the Convention for the safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. The Convention specifies safeguarding measures additionally proclaimed by the directives of ICH and related guidelines. Of the safeguarding methods, inventories are very important ways in which the intangible heritage community members can raise awareness of their cultural heritage. According to UNESCO, the process of inventorying ICH enhances the self-respect of heritage bearers and their respective communities and enriches human creativity. The Convention encourages the involvement of state parties in creating inventories of ICH existing in their territories and providing regular updates of any existing inventories. Updating of inventories is an ongoing process that can never be fully completed. The Convention allows some flexibility for the state parties in utilizing their own methods in inventory-making.\n\nSince the 1960s the Korean government has made efforts to protect and preserve the at the national level. Both legal and administrative measures have been undertaken affecting national treasures containing both tangible and intangible cultural heritages. The government’s imperative to safeguard the national treasures was/is acknowledged being exemplary and draws international attention. However, since the Convention in 2003 and its operational directives have been ratified by many member states, Korea has fallen into confusion. There are some conflicts and differences between the Korea’s existing system and the UNESCO’s new one regarding the safeguarding measures. It is necessary to carefully consider the differences and distinctions between the two systems. Although Korea had an existing, mature system of protection and preservation of cultural heritages, it is now facing a change in its existing system. The UNESCO’s initiatives have caused Korea to take stock in the safeguarding ICH.\n\n\n\n"}

It includes several recipes including \"iddarika\" thought to refer to idli, although there is disagreement about that.

The ingredients and cooking methods are given detail, and even the types of utensils and ovens needed are mentioned. King Mangarasa III belonged to the Chengalvu dynasty, and was under the suzerainty of Hoysala kings The first chapter describes thirty five breads, sweets and snacks, now mostly obsolete.

The remaining three chapters include recipes for 20 dishes with eggplant, 16 dishes with jackfruit and 25e dishes made with raw bananas (plantains) and banana flowers. The last chapter contains recipes using bamboo shoots and myrobalan. Even though it was composed during the rule of a Jain ruler, some of the vegetarian ingredients mentioned, such as onions, are regarded inappropriate for strict Jains.\n\nIn the chapter, Pishtakadhyaya, food items made with flour like rotti, mandige, garige, dose, iddali have been mentioned.

In practice, they have tended to relate either to the ecclesiastical administration of the diocese (in its several geographical incarnations), or to the broader history of the county. \n\nA precursor body was the Lincolnshire Record Society, founded in January 1889, and modelled on other county-based record societies including the Oxford Historical Society (founded 1884) and Somerset Record Society (founded 1886). The society published an edition of the chronicle of Louth Park Abbey in 1891, but this was to prove its only publication, and shortly afterwards it faded from view.\n\nThe Lincoln Record Society was established in October 1910. The principal initiator was Canon C. W. Foster (1866–1935), who since 1906 had served as secretary of the diocesan Records Committee. Foster became the first general editor of the new society, as well as its secretary and, from 1918, its treasurer, running it largely single-handedly until his death in 1935. He personally edited 12 of its volumes. He was succeeded as general editor and secretary by Kathleen Major (1906–2000), who held both posts until 1956, when she resigned the secretaryship on her appointment as Principal of St Hilda's College, Oxford: she remained general editor until 1975 (serving her final year jointly with Dorothy Owen). Subsequent general editors have been Dorothy Owen, 1975–95; Professor David Smith, 1995–2002; and Nicholas Bennett, 2002–date. \n\nProminent supporters (albeit at a distance) over several decades included the historians Frank Stenton and his wife Doris. Frank Stenton edited a volume of medieval charters of five Lincolnshire Gilbertine monasteries, published as the society's 18th volume in 1922, and later served as its President from 1942 to 1967; while Doris Stenton edited a volume of early 13th-century Lincolnshire Assize Rolls, published as the 22nd volume in 1926, and continued to maintain close contact with the society.\n\nIn 1912, in order to meet the interests of genealogists, the society established a Parish Register Section, with a separate subscription, for publishing Lincolnshire parish registers. Nine volumes of registers were published (seven of them edited by Canon Foster); but the series had to be abandoned as printing costs rose in the 1920s.\n\nThe Society's first two publications, agreed in November 1910, were an edition of early 17th-century Lincolnshire church notes compiled by the antiquary Gervase Holles, edited by R. E. G. Cole; and a calendar of the acts of Bishop Thomas Cooper (1571–84), edited by Foster. The two volumes appeared in 1911 and 1912 respectively. \n\nA particularly important series comprised the ten volumes of \"Registrum Antiquissimum\", an edition of the medieval charters of Lincoln Cathedral, with two additional volumes of facsimiles. The first four volumes, published between 1931 and 1937, were edited by Canon Foster (the last being completed and seen through the press after his death by Kathleen Major); and the final six, plus the two facsimile volumes, published between 1937 and 1973, by Kathleen Major.\n\nRecent volumes, which illustrate the range of subject-matter addressed, have included:\n\nThe society's 100th volume, published to commemorate its centenary in 2010, was a history of the society itself by Nicholas Bennett.\n\nAll volumes have been issued in a uniform cream binding. Most have been issued in standard octavo format, but a small number, containing facsimile material, have appeared in a larger folio format: these have included the two facsimile volumes of \"Registrum Antiquissimum\" (LRS vols 42 and 68); a facsimile edition of extracts from the minute-books of the Spalding Gentlemen’s Society, 1712–1755 (LRS vol. 73); a volume of town plans of Lincoln (LRS vol. 92); another of maps of the Witham Fens (LRS vol. 96); and another based on an album of photographs of the construction of the Bourne to Saxby railway, 1890–93 (LRS vol. 98).\n\nThe nine volumes of the Parish Register Section, which were not included in the society's main numbered series, were published between 1913 and 1925.\n\nIn 2016, the society inaugurated a separate series of \"Occasional Publications\". The first (and to date only) volume in this series is \"Steep, Strait and High: ancient houses of central Lincoln\" (2016) by Christopher Johnson and Stanley Jones, which forms the final volume in a series of architectural and historical surveys of the historic buildings of Lincoln, originally undertaken by the Survey of Ancient Houses sponsored by the Lincoln Civic Trust, and continued by the Survey of Lincoln.\n\nThe society offers research grants, for sums ranging from £500 to £5,000 (with a possibility of renewal), for projects falling within its areas of interest.\n\n"}

The court concluded that he may not. While no one disputed the GIS maps were public record, Skinner argued they were protected by federal copyright law. In the decision, the court held that \"Skinner has no authority to assert copyright protection in the GIS maps, which are public records.\" In support of this, the Court held that the \"Florida public records law ... overrides a governmental agency's ability to claim a copyright in its work unless the legislature has expressly authorized a public records exemption.\" Additionally, the Court confirmed \"Florida's Constitution and its statutes do not permit public records to be copyrighted unless the legislature specifically states they can be.\"\n\nThis was a Florida District Court of Appeal decision, but the Florida Supreme Court declined to hear the case and ordered the Skinner (as Collier County Property Appraiser) to pay Microdecisions' attorney's fees.

{"id": "1417867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1417867", "title": "Political rehabilitation", "text": "Political rehabilitation\n\nPolitical rehabilitation is the process by which a member of a political organization or government who has fallen into disgrace is restored to public life. The term is usually applied to leaders or other prominent individuals who regain their prominence after a period in which they have no influence or standing. Historically, the concept is usually associated with Communist states and parties where, as a result of shifting political lines often as part of a power struggle, leading members of the Communist Party find themselves on the losing side of a political conflict and out of favour, often to the point of being denounced or even imprisoned. \n\nThese individuals may be rehabilitated either as a result of capitulating to the dominant political line and renouncing their former beliefs or allegiances to disgraced leaders, or they may be rehabilitated as a result of a change in the political leadership of the party, either a change in personnel or a change in political line, so that the views or associations which caused the individual, or group of individuals, to fall into disgrace are viewed more sympathetically. \n\nWell known figures who have been rehabilitated include Deng Xiaoping who fell into disgrace during the Cultural Revolution for being a \"third roader\" but was rehabilitated subsequently and became paramount leader of the People's Republic of China; and Russia's last Tsar, Nicholas II, and his family, who were all shot dead by Bolshevik revolutionaries in July, 1918, but were rehabilitated by the Russian Supreme Court on 1 October 2008.\n\nRehabilitation () was carried out at many stages in the History of the People's Republic of China, but most significantly after the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that marked the Chinese economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping. Rehabilitation committees ( \"Píngfǎn Wěiyuánhuì\") considered appeals from both the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China as well as from petitions—often in the form of big-character posters—by ordinary citizens. Reformer Hu Yaobang led a series of rehabilitations from 1978 to 1981 of people persecuted by the Gang of Four during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976).\n\nIn the context of the former Soviet Union, and the Post-Soviet states, rehabilitation (, transliterated in English as \"reabilitatsiya\" or academically rendered as \"reabilitacija\") was the restoration of a person who was criminally prosecuted without due basis, to the state of acquittal. \n\nMass amnesty of the victims of Soviet repressions started after the death of Joseph Stalin. Initially, in 1953, this did not entail any form of exoneration. This release became coupled with rehabilitations after Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalinism in his 1956 speech \"On the Personality Cult and its Consequences\". Several entire nationality groups that had been deported to Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia during population transfer were rehabilitated in the late 1950s. \n\nBoth the modern Russian Federation and Ukraine have enacted laws \"On the Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repressions\", which provide the basis for the continued post-Stalinist rehabilitation of victims.\n\n\n \n"}

Others in the bar had slipped LSD and other drugs into his beer without him knowing, and there was only a small amount of alcohol he had been drinking so he was not responsible for his intoxication which led to the violent actions.\n\nThis case set a key precedent in Scots law for automatism, namely that since this case, if someone has been under the effect of drugs that they themselves did not voluntarily know they were taking or were under the influence of and commit a violent act, it may be a defence for them in court if they can prove or give evidence that their intoxication was not self-induced.\n\nLater cases suggested that the Scottish precedent established in \"Ross\" would be followed in England as well.\n\n"}

Inspired by the organizational structure used in traditional shopping mall directories, online shopping directories organize ecommerce sites by their category and subcategory of goods sold. Without the constraints related to shopping at a physical mall (e.g. distance, location, hours of operation, access to transportation), an online shopping directory serves to aggregate all ecommerce sites in one centralized location in order to help a user decide where to shop online.\n\nA shopping directory is different from a comparison shopping website (which is also referred to as a comparison shopping engine or a price comparison shopping site). While comparison shopping websites present product listings, by category, so a user can compare pricing on same and/or similar products, a shopping directory does not provide product comparison, review or sale. Examples of comparison shopping websites include: Google Shopping, Shopping.com, Shopzilla, TheFind.com\n\nA shopping directory is different from an online marketplace. Marketplaces sell products and/or services that are aggregated from various ecommerce sellers but sold under the branding and infrastructure of the named marketplace itself. Examples of online marketplaces include: Amazon, Etsy and Ebay.\n\nA specialized form of a shopping directory is a coupon, daily deal and/or promotional savings site. Coupon sites provide a niche web directory centered on deal aggregation by listing only ecommerce sites that offer additional savings to the user. Coupon sites are very popular with users but often are viewed negatively by merchants. Examples of coupon sites include: Retailmenot, Coupons.com, Groupon\n\nFree directories such as the Open Directory Project, often updated by volunteers, lost their prominence and relevancy in today's search-driven internet. Before the increased popularity of the Google search engine, shopping directories, such as that found at the Yahoo! Directory or the Paypal Shopping Directory, played a prominent role in users' online shopping habits and behavior. As Google gained dominance, users adapted their shopping search behavior to the new system. Most search engines took over the role traditionally filled by shopping directories.\n\nRecently, criticisms have emerged over the limits of using search engines such as Google and Bing for use in the ecommerce cycle. The dominance of the SEO structure in search makes competition fierce among merchants as they struggle for positioning on the Google search results pages.\n\nNew methodologies for shopping directories are emerging as startups look to bridge the gap between ecommerce and search . As ecommerce continues to grow, startup companies are reinvisioning the shopping directory to make it more relevant to the growing needs of online shoppers.\n\n"}

{"id": "26681002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26681002", "title": "Text annotation", "text": "Text annotation\n\nText Annotation is the practice and the result of adding a note or gloss to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and editing, commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text. Text annotations are sometimes referred to as marginalia, though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.\n\nThis article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also Web annotation.\n\nText annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in Talmudic commentaries and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.\n\nWith the rise of the printing press and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text. Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or textual footnotes or endnotes rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.\n\nComputer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, learning, social reading, writing and editing, and other practices. Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and storage that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.\n\nText annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article \"From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation,\" scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)\"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks,\" which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)\"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers,\" which involves sharing of annotations; (3)\"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators,\" which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)\"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages,\" for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function. Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, motivation, and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support memory and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.\n\nEducational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and communication. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports comprehension and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.\n\nOther areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for collaborative learning, both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products. In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of critical reading and stance-taking necessary for effective argumentative writing.\n\nWhile shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, \"since the 1920s, literacy theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy.\" Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.\n\nMore recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at Carnegie Mellon University. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.\n\nSimilarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, critical thinking, and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.\n\nA meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them English, sport psychology, and hypermedia. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, metacognition, and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.\n\nText annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text. In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called \"queries\"). Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks. Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.\n\nMuch research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of computer-supported cooperative work.\n\nResearch in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.\n\nThe structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a \"body\", an \"anchor\", and a \"marker\". The body of an annotation includes reader-generated symbols and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.\n\nIT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:\nAnnotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions. Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as \"anchored discussion\".\n\nIT-based annotation systems include standalone and client-server systems. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of libraries, patent offices, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce taxonomies of annotation forms. Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in Palo Alto and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995 at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).\n\nAnnotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Writer and Microsoft Word. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as Adobe Acrobat, which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.\n\nTim Berners-Lee had already implemented the concept of directly editing web documents in 1990 in WorldWideWeb, the first web browser, but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability. An early version of NCSA Mosaic in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability, though it was quickly removed. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, WebDAV, was then reintroduced as an extension.\n\nA different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document. This approach was pioneered by Stet, the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the GNU General Public License. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The co-ment system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using Django/Python on the server side and various AJAX libraries such as JQuery on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nSince 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project has offered the free, open web annotation service Hypothes.is. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a LMS or CMS. Both webpages and PDFs can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, HyLighter supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on NLP tasks as Named-entity recognition, relationship extraction or normalization. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via supervised learning.\n\nSpecialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal PLoS ONE, published by the Public Library of Science, has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.\n\n\n"}

It is located along Jackson Square, adjacent to St. Louis Cathedral.\n\nThe original Cabildo was destroyed in the Great New Orleans Fire (1788). The Cabildo was rebuilt between 1795–99 as the home of the Spanish municipal government in New Orleans, in 1821 Spanish coat of arms removed from the façade pediment and replaced with the extant American eagle with cannonballs by the Italian sculptor Pietro Cardelli and the third floor with mansard roof was later added in 1994 after a fire, in French style. The building took its name from the governing body who met there—the \"Illustrious Cabildo,\" or city council. The Cabildo was the site of the Louisiana Purchase transfer ceremonies late in 1803, and continued to be used by the New Orleans city council until the mid-1850s.\n\nThe building's main hall, the Sala Capitular (\"Meeting Room\"), was originally utilized as a courtroom. The Spanish used the courtroom from 1799 to 1803, and from 1803 to 1812 it was used by the Louisiana territorial superior court. During the years between 1868 and 1910, the Cabildo was the seat of the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Sala Capitular was the site of several landmark court cases, including \"Plessy v. Ferguson\".\n\nIn 1895 the building was in a state of decay and proposed for demolition; artist William Woodward led a successful campaign to have the historic building preserved and restored. In 1911 (the state's highest court having vacated), the Cabildo became the home of the Louisiana State Museum. The museum displays exhibits about the history of Louisiana from its settlement up through the Reconstruction Era, and about the heritage of the ethnic groups who have lived in the state.\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\n\nThe Cabildo was extensively damaged by a fire on May 11, 1988, which destroyed the cupola and the entire third floor, but it was restored and reopened to the public in 1994.\n\nIn 2005, the Cabildo survived Hurricane Katrina, the eye of which passed 30 miles (48 km) east of downtown, with relatively minor damage. Days after the storm struck, the Louisiana State Police used the business offices of the Cabildo to set up what was called Troop N. From the Cabildo, state troopers patrolled the city's streets along with police agencies from New Mexico and New York.\n\n\n"}

Published in London in 1864, the full title of the first edition reads: \"The English and Australian Cookery Book: Cookery for the Many, as well as the Upper Ten Thousand - by an Australian Aristologist\". The unnamed author was in fact a Tasmanian named Edward Abbott,\n\nAbbott was the son of a Canadian-born military officer, posted from NSW to Hobart in 1815 to become deputy judge advocate. Abbott junior rose from the position of clerk in his father’s office to become a key player in the colony as wealthy grazier, coroner and parliamentarian. He lost much of his wealth, and years of his prime, to an epic legal battle with colonial authorities over a rescinded land grant. Eccentric, he is said to have been the first person to try to raise thylacine cubs, his writing suggests he was something of an early Australian nationalist. While proselytising the science, art and etiquette of fine dining — or “aristology” as he called it — he had a quick temper and at one time assaulted the premier of the day with his umbrella, apparently in a rage related to his ongoing legal wrangle with the government. Shortly before his death in 1869, Abbott sent his will to son Frederick, one of his four children, along with an apology of sorts. “I leave but little, I tried to speculate in wheat, flour and oats — but failed owing to the rascality of commission agents,” he explained. However Abbott did manage to leave the legacy of his cookbook - it is much more than a collection of recipes. Within its green and gold cover, illustrated with a stylised globe depicting the opposite nature of the seasons between hemispheres, are near 300 pages crammed with wit and wisdom, as well as wickedly good recipes.\n\nIn 1970, a selection of material from Abbott's original version was republished under the title The Colonial Cook Book: the Recipes of a By-gone Australia, edited by Alison Burt. Although now out of print, this abridged edition may be found in specialist second-hand booksellers or in larger institutional libraries in Australia.\n\nIn his gastronomic history of Australia, Michael Symons often refers to Abbott's cookery book, devoting a chapter to its contents. He viewed it as a positive first step in the emerging Australian culinary tradition and lamented that the book did not have more than one edition.\n\nAn exact facsimile was published in Tasmania in 2014 to mark the sesquicentenary (150 years) of Abbott's original publication. This slipcased edition includes a Companion Volume in contrasting gilt foil cover with authoritative essays by Professor Barbara Santich, Food Studies, Adelaide University (\"Bold Palates\"); seminal Australian culinary history author Michael Symons (\"One Continuous Picnic\") and the world authority on Edward Abbott, Tony Marshall - as well as interpretive recipes by Sally Wise (\"A Year in a Bottle\") and cocktails by historian Sebastian Reaburn.\n\nWhile many reference Abbott's cookery book as the first Australian cookbook, few until now have analysed its contents in detail.\n\n\n"}

Nixon felt he needed the support of Rockefeller to secure the Republican Party nomination. Nixon feared that Rockefeller, who had recently written an indictment of the Republican Party, would refuse to support him unless the party platform was changed. Nixon and Rockefeller met at Rockefeller's Fifth Avenue apartment in New York City where, over the course of four hours (and with other participants joining by phone) they agreed to this fourteen-point compact of security and economic issues. The compact called for increased defense spending on U.S. nuclear capability as well as the establishment of a flexible response force to deal with armed conflicts. In addition, the document supports planks to the party platform that stimulate economic growth, \"remove the last vestiges of segregation or discrimination,\" and provide government funding for education. While the compromise might not have profoundly changed the party's platform, it strained Nixon's relations with the party's conservative members who disagreed with Rockefeller's more liberal views (See Rockefeller Republicans).\n\nFrom Steven Hess, who worked with Richard Nixon:\n\n\"The platform committee met at the Blackstone Hotel, Chicago, a week before the convention convened. On July 22, 10:30 pm, we are gathered in the suite of Charles Percy, the committee chairman, waiting for the final draft to be typed so that the committee can give its approval in the morning. The phone rings and from Percy's response this is no ordinary call. Nixon has flown secretly to New York to meet with arch foe Nelson Rockefeller in his Fifth Avenue apartment. They are now telling Percy what they wish to have in the platform. There are three phone connections in the suite: Percy is on one; Rod Perkins, Rockefeller's representative is on the second; I am one of the people rotating on the third. The call lasts nearly four hours, except for when the hotel switchboard operator pulls the plugs at midnight and goes home, causing a 15 minute interruption. This is \"The Compact of Fifth Avenue,\" so named by headline writers. The committee's reaction is explosive: We will not be dictated to, and especially not by Rockefeller. Their revolt lasts 36 hours. Eisenhower is furious over new wording in the defense plank, which we quietly delete. Nixon rushes to Chicago to calm the delegates, also raising questions about his political smarts.\" \n\nThe Vice President and I met today at my home in New York City.\n\nThe meeting took place at the Vice President's request.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to discuss the platform of the Republican party. During the course of the meeting we discussed our views with Chairman Percy and other members of the platform committee by telephone.\n\nThe Vice President and I reached agreement on the following specific and basic positions on foreign policy and national defense:\n\n1. The growing vigor and aggressiveness of communism demands new and profound effort and action in all areas of American Life.\n\n2. The vital need of our foreign policy is new political creativity—leading and inspiring the formation, in all great regions of the free world, of confederations, large enough and strong enough to meet modern problems and challenges. We should promptly lead toward the formation of such confederations in the North Atlantic community and in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n3. In the field of disarmament we shall\n4. In national defense, the swiftness of the technological revolution—and the warning signs of Soviet aggressiveness—makes clear that new efforts are necessary, for the facts of our survival in the Nineteen Fifties give no assurance of such survival, in the same military posture, in the Nineteen Sixties.\n\n5. The two imperatives of national security in the Nineteen Sixties are:\n\n6. The United States can afford and must provide the increased expenditures to implement fully this necessary program for strengthening our defense posture. There must be no price ceiling on America's security.\n\nThe Vice President and I also reached agreement on the following specific positions on domestic affairs:\n\n1. Our government must be reorganized—especially in supporting the President in the crucial decision-making process—to cope effectively with modern problems and challenges. Specifically, this calls for:\n\n2. The rate of our economic growth must, as promptly as possible, be accelerated by policies and programs stimulating our free enterprise system—to allow us to meet the demands of national defense and the growing social needs and a higher standard of living for our growing population. As the Vice President pointed out in a speech in 1958, the achievement of a 5 per cent rate of growth would produce an additional $10,000,000,000 of tax reserve in 1962.\n\n3. Our farm programs must be realistically reoriented by:\n\n4. Our program for civil rights must assure aggressive action to remove the remaining vestiges of segregation or discrimination in all areas of national life—voting and housing, schools and jobs. It will express support for the objectives of the sit-in demonstrators and will commend the action of those business men who have abandoned the practice of refusing to serve food at their lunch counters to their Negro customers and will urge all others to follow their example.\n\n5. Our program for health insurance for the aged shall provide insurance on a sound fiscal basis through a contributory system under which beneficiaries have the option of purchasing private health insurance.\n\n6. Our program for labor, while reaffirming our efforts to support and strengthen the processes of free collective bargaining, shall provide for improved procedures for the resolution of disputes endangering the national welfare.\n\n7. Our program for educational needs [sic] by calling for prompt and substantial grant aid for school construction primarily on the basis of financial needs, under an equalization formula, and with matching funds by the states—including these further measures for higher education: grants-in-aid for such buildings as classrooms and laboratories, an expanded loan program for dormitories, expanded student loan and graduate fellowship programs and inauguration of a program of federal scholarships for the most able undergraduates.\n\nThese constitute the basic positions for which I have been fighting.\n\nIf they are embodied in the Republican Party platform, as adopted by the convention, they will constitute a platform that I can support with pride and vigor.\n\n\"Governor Rockefeller and I have been in consultation with the Platform Committee since its sessions began. By yesterday, it was apparent that there was a general agreement among members of the committee and between the Governor and myself regarding the basic philosophy to be followed as we go into the 1960 campaign.\n\nWhatever differences that existed between Governor Rockefeller and myself were matters more of specifics than of principle. I felt it in the best interests of both our country and the Republican party at this critical time in history that it be made clear that we stood firmly together on these important issues.\n\nTherefore, I called Governor Rockefeller and arranged a private meeting last night. The text of the statement released by the Governor defines our area of agreement and provides a guide to our thinking for the consideration of the Platform Committee.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19920422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19920422", "title": "Volkstum", "text": "Volkstum\n\nThe Volkstum (lit. \"folkdom\" or \"folklore\", though the meaning is wider than the common usage of folklore) is the entire utterances of a \"Volk\" or ethnic minority over its lifetime, expressing a \"Volkscharakter\" this unit had in common. It was the defining idea of the Völkisch movement.\n\nThe term was coined by German nationalists in the context of Germany's \"Freedom Wars\", in marked and conscious opposition to the ideals of the French Revolution such as universal human rights. This sense of the word is now criticised in academia, though it is still in use in the protection of ethnic minorities and is a legal standard in Austria.\n\nIn the Age of Enlightenment the adjective \"volkstümlich\" usually meant the cultural achievements of uneducated Germans as well as popular culture. The \"Volksdichtung\" (People's Poetry) was 'high' literature, the culture of distinction, and partly devalued the elite education and partly idealised it. The concept was not yet tied to a certain nation, and attributed some of its characteristics to non-German culture.\n\nJustus Möser (1720–1794), Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744–1803), Johann Georg Hamann (1730–1788) and other German Romantics gradually increased the concept by their actions into an unspoiled, organic, person liable closed and eternal \"People's character\" (\"Volkscharakter\") and charged against the monarchies then dominating Germany. Möser already bordered on being the \"Vater der Volkskunde\" (Father of Ethnology) the \"Deutschtum\" against the cosmopolitanism of the Enlightenment and against the French Revolution.\n\nFriedrich Ludwig Jahn (\"Deutsches Volksthum\" 1810) is considered the inventor of the noun \"Volkstum\". He translated the foreign word Nation and thus moved it into an \"unerring something\" in every \"Volk\". For him and for Ernst Moritz Arndt (1769–1860) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814), German \"Volkstum\" was a revolutionary source not only against the foreign domination of Napoleonic France, but also against dynasties and the church, with the word Enlightenment becoming less and less used. For all three thinkers, the idea of a uniform anti-Enlightenment position with an opposed Volkstum was already linked with Antisemitism. Arndt wrote in \"Der Rhein, Deutschlands Strom, aber nicht Deutschlands Grenze\" 1813: \n\nHe strictly rejected Jewish emancipation, whilst seeing it as every man's natural right and goal, and in particular of the German people to the whole human race was living. He then summarised the concept as exclusive to those on the inside, not as being outside and expansive.\n\nThe founding of the German Reich in 1871, as a \"\"Kleindeutsche Lösung\" under Prussian domination, only fulfilled part of the German nationalists' objectives, wishing and struggling as they did for the unification of all German speakers in a single nation state.\n\nThe more \"Volkstum\" concept was now part of a nationalist ideology and political propaganda. It often served as a patriotic or visionary binding-agent to cover over or overcome the real contradictions inside and outside the German empire: for example, by providing a \"Volkstumskampf\"\", it summoned a corporate-agrarian \"Volksgemeinschaft\" or ideal community as the key features of \"Volkstum\", though these did not actually exist. It was the term of choice for every figure wishing to turn to an irrational feeling and definition of unity, against both enemies inside and outside the \"Reich\".\n\nWhile the Brothers Grimm had not yet distinguished between \"Gemeinschaft\" (community) and \"Gesellschaft\" (society), Ferdinand Tönnies (1855–1936) noted in his 1887 work \"Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft\" that the two were mutually exclusive - he defined \"community\" as a form of mutual affirmation of the people in themselves as in their resources, their respective communities (such as their family) but as an understood purpose - as opposed to its mutual form as \"society\" in which the individual himself was a purpose, with a 'community' (e.g. a corporation) watching over his means. 'Community' would in his terms be felt by children as \"the permanent and genuine\" against the \"temporary and apparent cohabitation\" of 'society'. This was directed against the Marxism of social democracy, whose \"scientific\" reasoned ideal of the classless society was felt by Tönnies to be unworkable. He was very sceptical about a concept such as \"Volksgemeinschaft\" - in the political sphere, he held that the ancient \"polis\", or the medieval Hanseatic city as its most pronounced form, little more than which could be expected by modern people.\n\nUnderscored by the context of Wilhelmine militarism and imperialism on the eve of the First World War, however, Heinrich Claß (chairman of the Alldeutscher Verband) in contrast defined Volkstum as national assertiveness and \"Menschlichkeit\" (humanity): \n\nHe also took the \"German disease\" to be the German Jewish minority, who for him embodied all the moral values and ethnic roots of \"corrosive\" internationalism.\n\nDuring the war the \"\"Deutsche Volkstum\" and \"Deutschtum\", particularly in universities, again became popular, in the sense of chauvinism. In \"Deutschen Reden in schwerer Zeit\" (German Speeches in a black time), 35 Berlin professors spoke out against much degeneration and foreigners, calling the World War a \"Reinigungsbad\"\" and the \"fountain cellar of a new culture\". Gustav Röthen, for example, saw it as the mass killings of the \"sacred flame, faithful to the world-historical mission of the German people against barbarism and sub-culture\".\n\nUnder National Socialism Volkstum was aggressively interpreted. Adolf Hitler, in \"Mein Kampf\", put Volkstum alongside race, \"because the Volkstum, better than Race, lies not just in the speech, but in the blood.\"\n\nAfter the \"Machtergreifung\", various university and non-university groups oriented towards völkisch and volkstum-politics were linked to cross-disciplinary \"research communities\", into which \"Volk history\" and \"Ostforschung\" were integrated, closely connected to the Nazi state and party. Their specialist disciplines became programmes with more state backing and funding than ever before. The concept of an \"ethnic Volkstum\" was divided into \"Volksgenossen\" (Volk comrades) and \"Volksfeinde\" (Volk enemies), so that the Volkstum concept was revised and became more strongly oriented towards racist and warlike solutions.\n\nAbove all, the Prussian archivist Albert Brackmann advocated and led the Gleichschaltung of the Nordostdeutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (Northeast German Research Foundation), which centrally directed research on East German history and controlled numerous projects on the issues of border demarcation and population policy. The young historians of Königsberg supported the \"Ostpolitik\" (Eastern Policy) of the NSDAP, for no academic elite had emerged within the party itself. After 1937 the Norddeutsche and Ostdeutsche Forschungsgemeinschafts combined as a single large state-funded research organization. The impact of Volkstum historians was decisive in the use of their expertise in the Nazi ethnic policies in the conquered areas of eastern Europe from 1939 onwards. They drafted numerous maps and statistics, serving Nazi planning as the basis of its settlement and population policy in Poland, the Baltic states, Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nThe Nazis during the war made repeated efforts to propagate Volkstum (\"racial consciousness\"), pamphlets were issued that enjoined all German women to avoid sexual relations with all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their blood.\n\nThe policy of \"Eindeutschung\" propagated and legitimated by the Volkstum historians, which made so-called German installations as ethnically and culturally, also favoured the Holocaust, even if they did not conceive it and were not directly involved in it.\n\nAfter 1945 the concept was first used in its political sense in Germany as an expression of nationalist ideology and avoided by neutral words like \"Bevölkerung\" (population). Bertolt Brecht formulated it as: \"The Volk is not tümlich.\" In the DDR the term \"Volk\" – without \"-tum\" – expressed the supposed conformity of the population with the SED and the state in such word combinations as Volksdemokratie, Volkspolizei and Volksarmee. By contrast a later opposition slogan was \"Wir sind das Volk\".\n\nIn Austria the concept was equally needed, but in a multi-ethnic monarchy. Thus in the 1976 National Minorities Act the term \"Volksgruppe\" served approximately as a synonym for national minority, according to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities of the Council of Europe. Section 6 in the German Federal Expellee Law also used the expression. The legislature of Switzerland explained Volkstum, at the time of ratification of the Framework Convention, as \"inspired by the desire [...] to together preserve what relates to their common identity, including their culture, their traditions, their religion or their language\". In accordance with this legislation Volkstum is primarily used to mean an expression of the self-perception of a population group. In its popular sense (close to the usual English sense of folklore), the term appears occasionally in Germany as describing regional traditions (the Volkstum of the Danube Swabians, Sorbs, Frisians, etc.).\n\n"}
