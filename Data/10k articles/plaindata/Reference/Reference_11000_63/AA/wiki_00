{"id": "8758450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8758450", "title": "Art Institute of Chicago", "text": "Art Institute of Chicago\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, founded in 1879 and located in Chicago's Grant Park, is one of the oldest and largest art museums in the United States. Recognized for its curatorial efforts and popularity among visitors, the museum hosts approximately 1.5 million guests annually. Its collection, stewarded by 11 curatorial departments, is encyclopedic, and includes iconic works such as Georges Seurat's \"A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\", Pablo Picasso's \"The Old Guitarist\", Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks\", and Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\". Its permanent collection of nearly 300,000 works of art is augmented by more than 30 special exhibitions mounted yearly that illuminate aspects of the collection and present cutting-edge curatorial and scientific research.\n\nAs a research institution, the Art Institute also has a conservation and conservation science department, five conservation laboratories, and one of the largest art history and architecture libraries in the country—the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries.\n\nThe growth of the collection has warranted several additions to the museum's original 1893 building, which was constructed for the World's Columbian Exposition of the same year. The most recent expansion, the Modern Wing designed by Renzo Piano, opened in 2009 and increased the museum's footprint to nearly one million square feet, making it the second-largest art museum in the United States, after the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Art Institute is associated with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, a leading art school, making it one of the few remaining unified arts institutions in the United States.\n\nIn 1866, a group of 35 artists founded the Chicago Academy of Design in a studio on Dearborn Street, with the intent to run a free school with its own art gallery. The organization was modeled after European art academies, such as the Royal Academy, with Academicians and Associate Academicians. The Academy's charter was granted in March 1867.\n\nClasses started in 1868, meeting every day at a cost of $10 per month. The Academy's success enabled it to build a new home for the school, a five-story stone building on 66 West Adams Street, which opened on November 22, 1870.\n\nWhen the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the building in 1871 the Academy was thrown into debt. Attempts to continue despite the loss by using rented facilities failed. By 1878 the Academy was $10,000 in debt. Members tried to rescue the ailing institution by making deals with local businessmen, before some finally abandoned it in 1879 to found a new organization, named the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. When the Chicago Academy of Design went bankrupt the same year, the new Chicago Academy of Fine Arts bought its assets at auction.\n\nIn 1882, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts changed its name to the current Art Institute of Chicago and elected as its first president the banker and philanthropist Charles L. Hutchinson, who \"is arguably the single most important individual to have shaped the direction and fortunes of the Art Institute of Chicago\" Hutchinson was a director of many prominent Chicago organizations, including the University of Chicago, and would transform the Art Institute into a world-class museum during his presidency, which he held until his death in 1924. Also in 1882, the organization purchased a lot on the southwest corner of Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street for $45,000. The existing commercial building on that property was used for the organization's headquarters, and a new addition was constructed behind it to provide gallery space and to house the school's facilities. By January 1885 the trustees recognized the need to provide additional space for the organization's growing collection, and to this end purchased the vacant lot directly south on Michigan Avenue. The commercial building was demolished, and the noted architect John Wellborn Root was hired by Hutchinson to design a building that would create an \"impressive presence\" on Michigan Avenue, and these facilities opened to great fanfare in 1887.\n\nWith the announcement of the World's Columbian Exposition to be held in 1892–93, the Art Institute pressed for a building on the lakefront to be constructed for the fair, but to be used by the Institute afterwards. The city agreed, and the building was completed in time for the second year of the fair. Construction costs were met by selling the Michigan/Van Buren property. On October 31, 1893 the Institute moved into the new building. For the opening reception on December 8, 1893, Theodore Thomas and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performed. From the 1900s (decade) to the 1960s the school offered with the Logan Family (members of the board) the Logan Medal of the Arts, an award which became one of the most distinguished awards presented to artists in the US.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1970 the Institute was a key site in the battle to gain art and documentary photography a place in galleries, under curator Hugh Edwards and his assistants.\n\nAs Director of the museum starting in the early 1980s, James N. Wood conducted a major expansion of its collection and oversaw a major renovation and expansion project for its facilities. As \"one of the most respected museum leaders in the country\", as described by \"The New York Times\", Wood created major exhibitions of works by Paul Gauguin, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh that set records for attendance at the museum. He retired from the museum in 2004.\n\nIn 2006, the Art Institute began construction of \"The Modern Wing\", an addition situated on the southwest corner of Columbus and Monroe. The project, designed by Pritzker Prize winning architect Renzo Piano, was completed and officially opened to the public on May 16, 2009. The building makes the Art Institute the second-largest art museum in the United States. The building houses the museum's world-renowned collections of 20th- and 21st-century art, specifically modern European painting and sculpture, contemporary art, architecture and design, and photography. In 2014, travel review website and forum, Tripadvisor, reviewed millions of travelers' surveys and named the Art Institute the world's best museum. It has remained a top three museum through 2016.\n\nIn April 2015, it was announced that the museum received perhaps the largest gift of art in its history. Collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson donated a \"collection [that] is among the world's greatest groups of postwar Pop art ever assembled.\" The donation includes works by Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, Jeff Koons, Charles Ray, Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman, Roy Lichtenstein and Gerhard Richter. The museum agreed to keep the donated work on display for at least 50 years.\n\nIn June 2018, the museum received a $70 million donation, the largest announced monetary donation in its history.\n\nThe collection of the Art Institute of Chicago encompasses more than 5,000 years of human expression from cultures around the world and contains more than 300,000 works of art in 11 curatorial departments. The museum holds works of art ranging from early Japanese prints to the art of the Byzantine Empire to contemporary American art. It is principally known for one of the United States' finest collection of paintings produced in Western culture.\n\nThe Art Institute's African Art and Indian Art of the Americas collections are on display across two galleries in the south end of the Michigan Avenue building. The African collection includes more than 400 works that span the continent, highlighting ceramics, garments, masks, and jewelry.\n\nThe Amerindian collection includes Native North American art and Mesoamerican and Andean works. From pottery to textiles, the collection brings together a wide array of objects that seek to illustrate the thematic and aesthetic focuses of art spanning the Americas.\n\nThe Art Institute's American Art collection contains some of the best-known works in the American canon, including Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks\", Grant Wood's \"American Gothic\", and Mary Cassatt's \"The Child's Bath\". The collection ranges from colonial silver to modern and contemporary paintings.\n\n\"Nighthawks\" was originally purchased by the museum in 1942 for $3,000; its acquisition \"launched\" the painting into \"immense popular recognition.\" Considered an \"icon of American culture\", \"Nighthawks\" is perhaps Hopper's most famous painting, as well as one of the most recognizable images in American art. \"American Gothic\" has been in the museum's collection since 1930 and was only just recently loaned outside of North America for the first time in 2016. Wood's painting depicts what has been called \"the most famous couple in the world,\" a dour, rural-American, father and daughter. It was entered into a contest at the Art Institute in 1930, and although not a favorite of some, it won a medal and was acquired by the museum.\n\nThe Art Institute's ancient collection spans nearly 4,000 years of art and history, showcasing Greek, Etruscan, Roman, and Egyptian sculpture, mosaics, pottery, jewelry, glass, and bronze as well as a robust and well-maintained collection of ancient coins. There are around 5,000 works in the collection, offering a comprehensive survey of the ancient and medieval Mediterranean world, beginning with the third millennium B.C. and extending to the Byzantine Empire. The collection also holds the mummy and mummy case of Paankhenamun.\n\nThe Department of Architecture and Design holds more than 140,000 works, from models to drawings from the 1870s to the present day. The collection covers landscape architecture, structural engineering, and industrial design, including the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Le Corbusier.\n\nThe Art Institute's Asian collection spans nearly 5,000 years, including significant works and objects from China, Korea, Japan, India, southeast Asia, and the Near and Middle East. There are 35,000 objects in the collection, showcasing bronzes, ceramics, and jades as well as textiles, screens, woodcuts, and sculptures. One gallery in particular attempts to mimic the quiet and meditative way in which Japanese screens are traditionally viewed.\n\nThe Art Institute's collection of European decorative arts includes some 25,000 objects of furniture, ceramics, metalwork, glass, enamel, and ivory from 1100 A.D. to the present day. The department contains the 1,544 objects in the Arthur Rubloff Paperweight Collection and the 68 Thorne Miniature Rooms–a collection of miniaturized interiors of a 1:12 scale showcasing American, European, and Asian architectural and furniture styles from the Middle Ages to the 1930s (when the rooms were constructed). Both the paperweights and the Thorne Rooms are located on the ground floor of the museum.\n\nThe museum is most famous for its collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist paintings, widely regarded as one of the finest collections outside of France. Highlights include more than 30 paintings by Claude Monet, including six of his \"Haystacks\" and a number of \"Water Lilies\". Also in the collection are important works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir such as \"Two Sisters (On the Terrace),\" and Gustave Caillebotte's \"Paris Street; Rainy Day.\" Post-Impressionist works include Paul Cézanne's \"The Basket of Apples\", and \"Madame Cézanne in a Yellow Chair.\" \"At the Moulin Rouge\" by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is another highlight. The pointillist masterpiece, which also inspired a musical and was famously featured in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", Georges Seurat's \"Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte—1884,\" is prominently displayed. Additionally, Henri Matisse's \"Bathers by a River\", is an important example of his work. Highlights of non-French paintings of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection include Vincent van Gogh's \"Bedroom in Arles\" and \",1887\".\n\nIn the mid-1930's the Art Institute received a gift of over one hundred works of art from Annie Swan Coburn (\"Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn Memorial Collection\"). The \"Coburn Renoirs\" became the core of the Art Institute's Impressionist painting collection.\n\nThe collection also includes the Medieval and Renaissance Art, Arms, and Armor holdings and three centuries of Old Masters works.\n\nThe museum's collection of modern and contemporary art was significantly augmented when collectors Stefan Edlie and Gael Neeson gifted 40 master works to the department in 2015. Pablo Picasso's \"Old Guitarist\", Henri Matisse's \"Bathers by a River\", Constantin Brâncuși's \"Golden Bird\", and René Magritte's \"Time Transfixed\" are highlights of the modern galleries, located on the third floor of the Modern Wing. The contemporary installation, located on the second floor, contains works by Andy Warhol, Cindy Sherman, Cy Twombly, Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns, and other significant modern and contemporary artists.\n\nThe Art Institute didn't officially establish a photography collection until 1949, when Georgia O'Keeffe donated a significant portion of the Alfred Stieglitz collection to the museum. Since then, the museum's collection has grown to approximately 20,000 works spanning the history of the artform from its inception in 1839 to the present.\n\nThe print and drawings collection began with a donation by Elizabeth S. Stickney of 460 works in 1887, and was organized into its own department of the museum in 1911. Their holdings have subsequently grown to 11,500 drawings and 60,000 prints, ranging from 15th-century works to contemporary. The collection contains a strong group of the works of Albrecht Dürer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Francisco Goya, and James McNeill Whistler. Because works on paper are sensitive to light and degrade quickly, the works are on display infrequently in order to keep them in good condition for as long as possible.\n\nThe Department of Textiles has more than 13,000 textiles and 66,000 sample swatches in total, covering an array of cultures from 300 B.C. to the present. From English needlework to Japanese garments to American quilts, the collection presents a diverse group of objects, including contemporary works and fiber art.\n\n \nThe current building at 111 South Michigan Avenue is the third address for the Art Institute. It was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition as the World's Congress Auxiliary Building with the intent that the Art Institute occupy the space after the fair closed.\n\nThe Art Institute's famous western entrance on Michigan Avenue is guarded by two bronze lion statues created by Edward Kemeys. The lions were unveiled on May 10, 1894, each weighing more than two tons. The sculptor gave them unofficial names: the south lion is \"stands in an attitude of defiance,\" and the north lion is \"on the prowl.\" When a Chicago sports team plays in the championships of their respective league (i.e. the Super Bowl or Stanley Cup Finals, not the entire playoffs), the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. Evergreen wreaths are placed around their necks during the Christmas season.\n\nThe east entrance of the museum is marked by the stone arch entrance to the old Chicago Stock Exchange. Designed by Louis Sullivan in 1894, the Exchange was torn down in 1972, but salvaged portions of the original trading room were brought to the Art Institute and reconstructed.\n\nThe Art Institute building has the unusual property of straddling open-air railroad tracks. Two stories of gallery space connect the east and west buildings while the Metra Electric and South Shore lines operate below. The lower level of gallery space was formerly the windowless Gunsaulus hall, but is now home to the Alsdorf Galleries showcasing Indian, Southeast Asian and Himalayan Art. During renovation, windows facing north toward Millennium Park were added. The gallery space was designed by Renzo Piano in conjunction with his design of the Modern Wing and features the same window screening used there to protect the art from direct sunlight. The upper level formerly held the modern European galleries, but was renovated in 2008 and now features the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist galleries.\n\nLocated on the ground floor of the museum is the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries. The Libraries' collections cover all periods of art, but is most known for its extensive collection of 18th to 20th century architecture. It serves the museum staff, college and university students, and is also open to the general public. The Friends of the Libraries, a support group for the Libraries, offers events and special tours for its members.\n\nOn May 16, 2009, the Art Institute opened the Modern Wing, the largest expansion in the museum's history. The addition, designed by Renzo Piano, makes the Art Institute the second-largest museum in the US. The architect of record in the City of Chicago for this building was Interactive Design. The Modern Wing is home to the museum's collection of early 20th-century European art, including Pablo Picasso's \"The Old Guitarist\", Henri Matisse's \"Bathers by a River\", and René Magritte's \"Time Transfixed.\" The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection of Surrealist art includes the largest public display of Joseph Cornell's works (37 boxes and collages). The Wing also houses contemporary art from after 1960; new photography, video media, architecture and design galleries including original renderings by Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Bruce Goff; temporary exhibition space; shops and classrooms; a cafe and a restaurant, \"Terzo Piano\", that overlooks Millennium Park from its terrace. In addition, the Nichols Bridgeway connects a sculpture garden on the roof of the new wing with the adjacent Millennium Park to the north and a courtyard designed by Gustafson Guthrie Nichol.\nIn 2009, the Modern Wing won at the Chicago Innovation Awards.\n\nNote that other notable works are in the collection but the following examples are ones in the public domain and for which pictures are available. In 2018, as it redesigned its website, the Art Institute released 52,438 of its public domain works, under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licence.\n\nDuring 2009, attendance was around 2 million—up 33 percent from 2008—in addition to a total of approximately 100,000 museum memberships. Despite a 25 percent boost in museum admission fees, the Modern Wing was a major catalyst for a rise in visitor traffic.\n\nAs of 2011, the Art Institute continues to rebuild its $783 million endowment since the recession. In June 2008, its endowment was $827 million. As of 2012, the museum is rated A1 by Moody's, its fifth-highest grade, in part reflecting the museum's pension and retirement liabilities; Standard & Poor's rates the museum A+, fifth-best. In October 2012, the Art Institute sold about $100 million of taxable and tax-exempt bonds partly to shore up unfunded pension obligations.\n\nThe $294 million extension in 2009 was the culmination of a $385 million fundraising campaign—roughly $300 million for design and construction and $85 million for the endowment. Around $370 million were raised primarily from private patrons in Chicago. In 2011, the Art Institute received a $10 million gift from the Jaharis Family Foundation to renovate and expand galleries devoted to Greek, Roman and Byzantine art, as well as to support acquisitions and special exhibitions of that art.\n\nIn 1990, the Art Institute of Chicago sold 11 works at auction, including paintings by Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Maurice Utrillo and Edgar Degas, to raise the $12 million purchase price of a bronze sculpture, \"Golden Bird\", by Constantin Brâncuși. At the time, the sculpture was owned by the Arts Club of Chicago, which was selling it to buy a new gallery for its other works. In 2005, the museum sold two paintings by Marc Chagall and Auguste Renoir at Sotheby's. In 2011, it auctioned two Picassos (\"Sur l'impériale traversant la Seine\" (1901) and \"Verre et pipe\" (1919)), Henri Matisse's \"Femme au fauteuil\" (1919), and Georges Braque's \"Nature morte à la guitare (rideaux rouge)\" (1938) at Christie's in London.\n\n\nIn 2002, the Art Institute of Chicago filed suit alleging fraud by a small Dallas firm called Integral Investment Management, along with related parties. The museum, which put $43 million of its endowment into funds run by the defendants, claimed that it faced losses of up to 90% on the investments after they soured.\n\nIn 2010, the year after the opening of its massive Modern Wing, the Art Institute of Chicago sued the engineering firm Ove Arup for $10 million over what it said were flaws in the concrete floors and air-circulation systems. The suit was settled out of court.\n\nFilm director John Hughes included a sequence in the Art Institute in the 1986 film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", which is set in Chicago. Hughes had first visited the Institute as a \"refuge\" while in high school. Hughes' commentary on the sequence was used as a reference point by journalist Hadley Freeman in a discussion of the Republican Presidential primary candidates in 2011.\n\n"}

Most registration programs use the unique serial numbers which are permanently affixed to most bicycles during manufacture.\n\nBicycle registration programs generally aim to reduce the prevalence of bike theft. Bicycle theft is one of the major factors that slow the development of utility cycling since it discourages people from investing in a bicycle.\n\nBicycle registration may be a public service provided by local, state or national government, or be provided by an independent organization.\n\nSome registration programs are exclusively designed for spreading the word after a bike has been stolen, while others focus on registering bikes before they are stolen.\n\nBike registration is intended to provide: \n\nBikes are stolen in large numbers in many parts of the world.\n\nGlobally the number is estimated at 1.5 million bikes reported stolen annually; perhaps another 2 to 3 million go unreported annually.\n\nAt many schools and universities, all bikes brought onto campus are routinely required to be registered by their owners and to display prominently their annual school provided registration decal.\n\nSome states in the USA, such as California, have laws which allow cities and municipalities to require registration of bikes. The registration period typically is in excess of one year. Building on existing law, California has passed a bill in 2014 that will allow cities, counties or regional park districts to impose an annual vehicle registration surcharge of up to $5 to pay for local bike lanes and trails, valid until Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nSeveral commercial and peer based bike registries exist for the purpose of theft deterrence and to improve the probability of recovery in the event of loss. The registration period typically is from 1 year to unlimited. Some commercial and peer-to-peer registries are typically preventative in nature and are performed prior to loss, while other registries perform their service only after a theft occurs.\n\nThe bike owner generally supplies detailed bike information to the registrar such as: manufacturer, model, frame style, frame material, wheel diameter, serial number, color, frame size, and accessory details. Contact information pertaining to the owner are also included in the registration process.\n\nThe registrar will typically provide a decal or decal kit to the bike owner such that their bike can be easily identified as being registered. Decals at academic institutions usually have their color/design changed on an annual basis and are typically fairly large such that they can be easily seen at a distance. Decals issued by municipalities are typically of a design similar to academic decals, but not changed annually.\n\nDecals provided by commercial and peer based registries are typically smaller than academic/municipal decals and use a more aggressive adhesive and/or construction such that they will remain on the bike in the event of a theft and will be able to assist in recovery and return effort. Some registrars engrave a registration number on the bottom bracket or other part.\n\nRFID (Radio-frequency identification) has been widely used for identification of such things as livestock, pets and industrial commodities. There is a trend by some registrars to use RFID, in conjunction with decal identification, as a means of rapidly determining bike ownership by law enforcement agencies.\n\nFees can vary. Most peer based registries are free or charge a very nominal fee. School and university bike registration fees range from $2 to $5 for a single-year registration. Fees for commercial registrars range typically range from $10 to $25 for multi-year registration, though Bike Index provides free registration forever. For RFID there can be a surcharge of $15 onto the base registration fee.\n\nAccess to school, university and municipality registry databases is typically limited to the law enforcement agency in charge of the registration program; commercial registrars make their registration information available to law enforcement agencies upon request; and peer-to-peer registries make their stolen bike information publicly available via the Internet.\n\n\n\n"}

The manuscript was probably written at St Augustine's, Canterbury, and has generally been dated to the mid-tenth century, though recent work suggests the 930s specifically. The manuscript contains three Latin-Old English glossaries.\n\nThe \"First Cleopatra Glossary\" (folios 5r-75v) is alphabeticised by first letter, drawing on a wide range of sources, including a glossary more or less identical to the \"Third Cleopatra Glossary\", material related to the \"Corpus Glossary\", and a glossed text of Isidore of Seville's \"Etymologiae\". Some of these sources are among the earliest glosses in English, but the Cleopatra reviser (or his source) often revised them. The glossary only gets as far as P: the compilation or copying seems never to have been completed.\n\nThe \"Second Cleopatra Glossary\" (folios 76r-91v) contains a shorter glossary, organised by subject. A closely related glossary is found in the first three subject lists of the Brussels Glossary (Brussels, Royal Library, 1928-30).\n\nThe \"Third Cleopatra Glossary\" (folios 92r-117v) contains glosses to Aldhelm's \"Prosa de virginitate\" and \"Carmen de virginitate\", with the lemmata in the same order as they appear in the text. It was presumably, therefore, based on a copy of Aldhelm's texts which had interlinear glosses. This glossary or one like it was influential, influencing Byrhtferth of Ramsey and at least one Anglo-Saxon medical text. Kittlick's linguistic investigation showed that some, at least, of the glosses in the \"Third Cleopatra Glossary\" are in the Anglian dialect of Old English, with later overlays from West Saxon and Kentish (probably in that order). The glossary--though not necessarily all its entries--must have originated in the eighth century.\n\nAbout two thirds of the material in the \"Cleopatra Glossaries\" also occurs in the later \"Harley Glossary\".\n"}

{"id": "41554548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41554548", "title": "Fine Prints of the Year", "text": "Fine Prints of the Year\n\nFine Prints of the Year was an annual series of books that reported and discussed the etchings, engravings, woodcuts and lithographs published each year between 1923 and 1938 by major artists of the period. All volumes reproduced in monochrome on high quality glossy paper a selection of about 100 limited edition prints published during the preceding year. The series provides an important record of the work of artists in the last years of the etching revival and during the collapse of the market for prints.\n\nThe first volume of \"Fine Prints of the Year\" was published in London in 1924 by Halton and Truscott Smith as a review of the prints issued during the year up to October, 1923. The volume reproduced 150 etchings, drypoints, lithographs or woodcuts by major British and American printmakers of the day such as Stanley Anderson, Frank Benson, Edmund Blampied, Frank Brangwyn, Gerald Brockhurst, F.L. Griggs, Childe Hassam, James McBey, Henry Rushbury, Frank Short and William Walcot as well as the work of many artists whose work is less well known. Some copies of volume two, for the year 1924, contained as a frontispiece an unsigned, original etching by Frank Brangwyn. From the third volume \"Fine Prints of the Year\" was also published in the USA by Minton, Balch and Company of New York.\n\nThe first 13 volumes, from 1923 to 1935, contained an introductory essay by Malcolm Salaman, an art critic and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, now the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers. From 1936 to 1938 the introduction was provided by Campbell Dodgson, who was Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum. From 1926 to 1930 each volume contained a short introduction to American prints by Helen Fagg; from 1931 to 1934 the introduction was written by Susan A. Hutchinson.\n\nFrom the second volume, published in 1924, the series also published a directory of the publishers of prints and a directory of the name and address of the etchers, engravers and lithographers then working in Great Britain, France, the United States of America and elsewhere with the titles, dimensions, publishers and sometimes with the prices of the prints designed or released by each artist during the previous year. This constitutes an important record of the work of many artists which, until the print boom ended in around 1930, were seen as an investment and were the subject of substantial trading and inflated prices. For example, an etching entitled \"Mersea, Sunset\" by James McBey, whose work was highly sought after in the 1920s, was issued to subscribers in an edition of 76 artist's proofs in 1926 at a price of 10 guineas. A proof of this print from the edition of 76 was sold at auction at Sotheby's in December of the same year for just under 105 guineas, a ten times higher price.\n\nThe Wall Street Crash in the USA and the worldwide Great Depression greatly diminished the market for prints, but many artists continued to design plates, though fewer in number, in smaller editions and at lower prices, as the volumes of \"Fine Prints of the Year\" between 1930 and 1938 show. For example, the artist Edmund Blampied issued 76 etchings between 1920 and 1929, typically in editions of 100 proofs, but in the following decade only published 23 etchings, some in editions of less than 50 proofs.\n\n\"Fine Prints of the Year\" continued as a record of the work of etchers and engravers until the sixteenth and last annual volume for 1938, just before the start of the Second World War in Europe brought about rationing of paper and presumably put an end to the series. The 16 volumes published in the series reproduced over 1,700 prints and remains an important visual and factual record of the work of etchers and engravers, many of whom were once well known and whose prints commanded high prices.\n\n"}
{"id": "3869329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3869329", "title": "Help! (film)", "text": "Help! (film)\n\nHelp! is a 1965 British musical comedy-adventure film directed by Richard Lester, starring the Beatles–John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—and featuring Leo McKern, Eleanor Bron, Victor Spinetti, John Bluthal, Roy Kinnear and Patrick Cargill. The second film starring The Beatles following Lester's \"A Hard Day's Night\", \"Help!\" sees Ringo as the human sacrifice for an evil cult and the band must protect him. The soundtrack was released as an album, also called \"Help!\".\n\nThe film had its Royal World Premiere at the London Pavilion Theatre in the West End of London on 29 July 1965 in the presence of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon and the Earl of Snowdon. While not reviewed at the time with the same high level of admiration as their first film, the film is regarded a half century later as being influential, including in the subsequent development of music videos.\n\nAn eastern cult (a parody of the Thuggee cult) is about to sacrifice a woman to the goddess Kaili. Just as she is about to be killed, the high priestess of the cult, Ahme, notices that she is not wearing the sacrificial ring. Ringo Starr, drummer of the Beatles, has the ring and is wearing it; it was secretly sent to him by the victim in a fan letter. Determined to retrieve the ring and sacrifice the woman, the great Swami Clang, Ahme, and several cult members including Bhuta, leave for London. After several failed attempts to steal the ring, they confront the Beatles in an Indian restaurant. Ringo learns that if he does not return the ring soon, he will become the next sacrifice. Ringo then discovers that the ring is stuck on his finger.\n\nThe Beatles go to a jeweller to remove the ring, but the tools he uses all break. They then go to a mad scientist, Foot, and his assistant Algernon. In a lab full of American-made equipment, they attempt to expand the ring's molecules so it can slide off Ringo's finger. But the machines only manage to remove all his other rings. Astonished that his equipment has no effect on the ring, Foot decides that he, too, must have it. While they bumble with trying to get a laser together, Ahme crashes the lab and holds the scientists at gunpoint while she lets the Beatles escape.\n\nBack home, Ahme tells the group that her sister's time has passed and she is now out of danger and Ringo is now the sacrificial victim. She prepares a special solution intended to shrink Ringo's finger so she can get the ring off. But then Clang and his henchmen crash the house, causing Ahme to drop the syringe on Paul's leg. While a shrunken Paul hides in an ashtray, the cult attack the other Beatles and pour red paint on Ringo (as part of the sacrifice). Foot and Algernon come in, shoots a warning shot with his Webley and scares the cult away, Ahme in tow. Paul unshrinks and John subsequently starts to swing a lamp at Foot who tries to shoot him, but his gun misfires. Blaming this on the fact that the gun is British made, Foot retreats. The boys are left to sort things out.\n\nThe band flees to the Austrian Alps for refuge but both thugs and Foot follow in pursuit. The Beatles practise skiing, then participate in a game of curling. Foot and Algernon booby-trap one of the curling stones with a bomb; George sees the \"fiendish thingy\" and tells everyone to run. The bomb eventually goes off after a delay, creating a big hole in the ice from which a Channel swimmer (Mal Evans) emerges and asks directions to the White Cliffs of Dover. The boys ski down a slope fleeing from Clang, directed by Ahme, who then misdirects Clang to the take-off ramp for a Ski jumping contest. Clang is the winner, and is forced to the winners' platform to receive a gold medal.\n\nThe group escapes back to England and they ask for \"protection\" from Scotland Yard; and get it in the form of a cowardly Inspector (Cargill). After being attacked while recording in the middle of Salisbury Plain surrounded by the British Army, they hide in \"A Well Known Palace\" (Buckingham Palace) until they are almost captured by Foot.\n\nWhile on a walk with the police, the group step into a small pub, where Clang is disguised as a barman. After being served beer, Ringo cannot pick his glass up from the table, so George tips it over, unknowingly opening a trapdoor to the cellar that Clang set up, into which Ringo drops. Inside the cellar is a door with a broken knob, a broken ladder and a tiger. They go summon the Inspector who tells them to sing the \"Ode to Joy\" from Beethoven's 9th Symphony to the tiger in order to tame it; everyone inside and outside the pub joins in.\n\nThe Beatles put out in the press that they're going to the Bahamas to throw the cult off their scent, but Ringo wants to go there anyway. The Beatles arrive, followed by Scotland Yard officers, Foot and Clang. After Ringo is nearly captured, the other Beatles pose as him in order to lure the cult members, who are then arrested by the Bahamas Police. Despite their best efforts, Ringo is captured by Foot, who takes him on to a ship intending to cut off his finger to get the ring.\n\nAhme rescues Ringo from Foot by exchanging him for a vial of the \"distilled essence of certain orchids\". The two try to escape the ship by jumping into the water; however, Ringo cannot swim. They are captured by the cult and tied down on the beach where they are surrounded by two battalions of Kukhri Rifles. Clang begins the ceremony to sacrifice Ringo, with cult members prepared to attack the rest of the Beatles and police when they come to the rescue.\n\nRingo and Ahme manage to untie themselves, and the ring slips off his finger as he tries to wave to his band mates to warn them away. He puts the ring on Clang's hand, and Ahme declares Clang as the next sacrifice. A final brawl ensues between the Beatles, the cult, and the police. Clang manages to get the ring off himself and gives it to Foot and Algernon. They, however, leave the ring in the sand in favour of the shrinking solution. The ring ends up on the greedy Bhuta's finger and he becomes the target for sacrifice to the put-upon Clang's obvious glee; meanwhile, the Channel swimmer reappears on the beach and once again asks for directions to the White Cliffs of Dover. The movie ends with a dedication to \"Elias Howe, who, in 1846, invented the sewing machine\".\n\nThe credits feature the characters acting up in front of the camera, with the jewel of the ring being placed in front of the lens. The music playing during the credits is the Overture of \"The Barber of Seville\" by Gioachino Rossini, with The Beatles adding their own laughing and comments.\n\nThe Beatles said the film was inspired by the Marx Brothers classic \"Duck Soup\"; it was also directly satirical of the James Bond series of films. At the time of the original release of \"Help!\", its distributor, United Artists, also held the rights to the Bond series.\n\nThe humour of the film is strongly influenced by the abstract humour of \"The Goon Show\", in which the director had personal and direct experience in the conversion of the radio format to television, and personal working experience with Peter Sellers in particular. Beatles recording producer George Martin had also produced records for the \"Goon Show\" team. McCartney has always said that the Beatles style of humour was taken from the \"Goon Show\". Many of the film's concepts are derived from \"Goon Show\"s, such as the presence of wild animals, music, fourth wall-breaking jokes and abstractions such as the closing statement that concludes the film.\n\nThe original working title for the film was \"Eight Arms to Hold You\". This title was printed on the single \"Ticket to Ride\" as an upcoming movie. Because of this, the phrase has been used as a title for an album by Veruca Salt and for songs by The Goonies and by The Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.\n\nAccording to interviews conducted with Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr for \"The Beatles Anthology\", director Richard Lester was given a larger budget for this film than he had for \"A Hard Day's Night\", thanks to the commercial success of the latter. Thus, this feature film was in colour and was shot on several exotic foreign locations. It was also given a more extensive musical score than \"A Hard Day's Night\", provided by a full orchestra, and including pieces of well known classical music: Wagner's \"Lohengrin\", Act III Overture, Tchaikovsky's \"1812 Overture\", Beethoven's \"Ninth Symphony\" (\"Ode to Joy\"), and, during the end credits and with their own comic vocal interpretation, Rossini's \"Barber of Seville\" overture. The original title for the film – only changed to \"Help!\" very near to its release – was \"Eight Arms To Hold You.\"\n\n\"Help!\" was shot in London, Salisbury Plain, the Austrian Alps, New Providence Island and Paradise Island in the Bahamas and Twickenham Film Studios, beginning in the Bahamas on 23 February 1965. Starr commented in \"The Beatles Anthology\" that they were in the Bahamas for the hot weather scenes, and therefore had to wear light clothing even though it was rather cold. Tony Bramwell, the assistant to Beatles manager Brian Epstein, stated in his book \"A Magical Mystery Tour\" that Epstein chose the Bahamas for tax reasons. According to \"The Beatles Anthology\", during the restaurant sequence filmed in early April, George began to discover Indian-style music, which would be a key element in future songs such as \"Norwegian Wood\". Filming finished on 14 April at Ailsa Avenue in Twickenham.\n\nThe ski scenes were shot at Obertauern, a small village in Austria. One reason this location was chosen was that the stars of the movie were less likely to be recognized there than at one of the larger resorts with many British tourists. The Beatles were in Obertauern for about two weeks in March 1965 along with a film crew of around 60 people. Locals served as ski stunt doubles for the Beatles who stayed at the hotel \"Edelweiss\". Most of the crew were based in the hotel \"Marieta\", where one night the Beatles gave an impromptu concert on the occasion of a director's assistant's birthday. This was the only time they ever played on stage in Austria.\n\nThe Beatles did not particularly enjoy the filming of the movie, nor were they pleased with the end product. In 1970, John Lennon said they felt like extras in their own movie.\n\nTen years later Lennon was more charitable:\n\nA contributing factor was exhaustion attributable to their busy schedule of writing, recording and touring. Afterward they were hesitant to begin another film project, and indeed \"Help!\" was their last full-length scripted theatrical film. Their obligation for a third film to United Artists was met by the 1970 documentary film \"Let It Be\". The 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\" did not meet contractual obligations because it did not star the Beatles, and their only live appearance was featured for less than two minutes at the film's conclusion.\n\nThe Beatles later said the film was shot in a \"haze of marijuana\". According to Starr's interviews in \"The Beatles Anthology\", during the Austrian Alps film shooting, he and McCartney ran off over the hill from the \"curling\" scene set to smoke a joint.\nIn the \"Beatles Anthology Director's Cut\", Harrison admitted that they were smoking marijuana on the plane ride all the way to the Bahamas.\n\nMcCartney also shared some of his memories of when they were filming \"Help!\":\n\nThe photographer Michael Peto was commissioned in 1965 to take still photographs during the making of the film; these became known for their candid and expressive quality. During the digitisation of the Michael Peto Collection, which is held by Archive Services, University of Dundee, in 2002, 500 previously unpublished photographs of the Beatles taken during the making of \"Help!\" were reported to have been uncovered. \"Now These Days are Gone\", a limited edition volume of Peto's photographs focusing on the Beatles images was produced in 2006 with deluxe editions of the book signed by Richard Lester. An exhibition of the photographs to mark the book's launch was held at Hoopers Gallery, Clerkenwell, in January 2006. Another exhibition of the photographs was held at the University of Dundee in 2007 as part of the University's 40th anniversary celebrations, with the exhibition then moving to the National Conservation Centre, Liverpool. In 2011 the photographs were exhibited in Dundee, as part of the Scottish Beatles Weekend, and at the Proud Gallery, Camden.\n\nThe songs played during the film are:\n\n\nThe seven main songs formed the first side of the British release of the \"Help!\" album. The second side consisted of other new Beatles songs recorded at the same time or shortly afterwards. The US album, released by Capitol Records, includes the 7 movie tracks along with instrumental soundtrack songs orchestrated by Ken Thorne. In addition, the US soundtrack leads off with a hidden track stylized as a satirical \"James Bond Theme\" before the title track, \"Help!\". Early pressings of the US version of the album \"1962-1966\" include this hidden track banded as \"Help!\", and later pressings, when the UK catalogue was made the official and only catalogue of Beatles albums, omit it.\n\nCritical opinion at the time of release was generally positive, but many critics feel that this big budget effort was not as strong as \"A Hard Day's Night\". Leslie Halliwell describes it as an \n\nAllmovie's Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr. describes it as \n\nIn a contemporary review in \"The New York Times\" their critic Bosley Crowther was not impressed: \n\nA novelisation entitled \"The Beatles in Help!\" was written by Al Hine and published by Dell in 1965.\n\nA sequence featuring Frankie Howerd and Wendy Richard was filmed but left out of final editing owing to its length. However, the sequence was left in the film novelisation.\n\nLike \"A Hard Day's Night\", \"Help!\" was originally distributed theatrically by United Artists – the company handled distribution from 1965 to the end of 1980. In January 1981, rights to the movie reverted from UA to producer Walter Shenson, and the movie was withdrawn from circulation.\n\n\"Help!\" was released several times in different video formats by MPI Home Video and The Criterion Collection. A version was released in February 1987 in VHS and Beta through MPI, along with a reissue of \"A Hard Day's Night\" the very same day, and was followed by a special-edition release on 31 October 1995. MPI also issued a CLV laserdisc in 1995 and two releases on DVD, the first as a single DVD release on 12 November 1997 and the second as part of \"The Beatles DVD Collector's Set\" on 8 August 2000.\n\nLaserDisc releases include a Criterion CAV laserdisc and a Voyager CLV laserdisc in 1987, each of which had three pressings. The first pressings had no UPC on the gatefold covers while the other two had the UPC either as a sticker or printed directly on the jacket.\n\nThe film's transfer on the CAV laserdiscs was done correctly so that no blending of frames occurs and thus movements are not blurry. The supplemental section, which, with few exceptions, has never been available on any other home video release, contains the following:\n\nIn June 2007, a version of \"Help!\", sub-titled in Korean, became available on Amazon.com. However, by July 2007, all home video versions of the film were pulled from the market because of rights issues involving Apple Corps – now the full rights holders to the film. The rights issues were eventually resolved and Apple Corps/EMI/Capitol released a new double DVD version with a fully restored image and newly remixed in 2.0 stereo and 5.1 surround sound of the film. This came in standard 2xDVD packaging and 2xDVD deluxe edition box set on 30 October 2007 in the UK and 6 November 2007 in America. This latest release contains new featurettes, three trailers (one of which is in Spanish), and the aforementioned radio ads carried over from the Criterion LaserDisc issue. The film was released on Blu-ray format in June 2013 by Universal Music, now the owners of EMI/Capitol Records, using the 2007 restoration.\n\n"}
{"id": "52637072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52637072", "title": "In Spring (1929 film)", "text": "In Spring (1929 film)\n\nIn Spring (, ) is a 1929 Soviet Ukraine silent experimental documentary directed by Mikhail Kaufman. It was the first independent work of the cinematographer, made in accordance with the ideas of the avant-garde manifesto Kinoks and was Kaufman's directorial debut.\n\nAccording to some Russian media, at the end of the 20th century the film was considered lost; a copy was discovered in 2005 at an archive in Amsterdam.\n\nA discord between Michael Kaufman and Dziga Vertov foreshadowed the creation of the film \"In Spring\". Between the filmmaker brothers there were creative differences even when working on the picture Man with a Movie Camera. According to Kaufman, the film itself had a lot of chaos, and footage assembly was carried out without \"a clearly worked out plan\". The spat led to Mikhail deciding to create his own film on the basis of stylistic and technical methods that have been used by him in previous films:\nBy composition, the picture \"In Spring\" was divided into five nominal parts (\"At the Turn\", \"Spring Vexation\", \"Life\", \"National Holidays\", \"Spring is Coming\"), but the director did not conduct a special \"organization of material for the film\"; at the heart of the work was only observation of the progress of life. At the same time, as noted by Nikolai Ushakov, author of the book \"Three Cinematographers\", Kaufman sometimes had to take on the role of a tamer: to get closer to a bird which is filmed and to get its trust, he \"accustomed it to a movie camera\".\n\nThe beginning of the film shows the gradual progression from winter to spring. The snowman, which in the first frame looks strong and monolithic, suddenly reduces in size; streams are flowing on roads, thawed ice is melting on the roofs. Citizens open windows, remove winter insulation, wash the glass and bring warm blankets to the balcony. On the streets there are mobile cisterns and carts with kvass with ice cream.\n\nNext part of the picture presents an industrial landscape which is a continuous movement of mechanisms, gears and trolleys. One of the shops lays out the newspaper \"Socialist emulation Bulletin\" for the year 1929. Then the camera transports the viewer to the city parks and gardens. On the trunk of a tree a snail is moving, in the branches birds build nests, bees swarm around flowers, buds bloom directly before the eyes. Citizens, freed from winter clothing walk in pairs or singly; young mothers wheel open strollers through the streets.\n\nMay Days. A demonstration with flags, sport competitions, a football match at a packed stadium. Daredevil-bicyclist rides on a street while playing the harmonica; girls are dancing.\n\nThe film, released in 1930, received a positive response, and became a subject of special film studies research. The French film theorist Georges Sadoul declared Kaufman's directorial debut film as \"the best picture of 1929\". During the discussion which took place in Kiev after the premiere of \"In Spring\", the writer and critic Leonid Pervomayskiy noted that in the film are present \"both Kaufman the artist and Kaufman the poet\" and described the author's montage as \"brilliant\". According to writer Oleksandr Korniychuk, creator of the picture was able to \"brilliantly organize scattered pieces united by a common idea\".\n\nReviewers did not do without comparing aesthetic positions of Vertov and Kaufman. Nikolai Ushakov when comparing their style noted that \"Kaufman exceeds Vertov in deciphering reality because the director 'partially abstracts' what is shot by the cinematographer\". At the same time the film historian Lev Roshal described the film as \"one of the most beautiful, lyrically delicate and plastically perfect documentaries\", gave credit to Dziga as the mentor brother: \"The pupil has learned a lot. <...> It was Kaufman's victory but Vertov could also be proud of it.\"\n\nThe creators of \"Modern History of Russian Cinema\", establishing the genre of \"In Spring\" as a cinema poem, have separately identified \"a generic trait\", which defines not only the Kaufman film, but also other documentary films of the 1920s - \"a vividly pronounced beginning of an auteur\".\n\nIn his last interview published in the journal \"New World\", Mikhail Kaufman said that during the work he also wanted to show a destructive force and \"biology of spring\", and the change in the consciousness that comes along with the melting snow. To the director it was important to \"avoid head-on proselytism\": the spectator observing together with the author the short-term transformation of everything living has to feel the symbolism of individual shots and sequences by himself.\n\nSpecial emphasis during montage was given to the rhythm: he took charge of the \"natural processes\", and the traffic and movement of citizens on the streets. Kaufman combined \"gustatory, olfactory and auditory sensations\" of nature when demonstrating the \"lyricism of spring\": flowers in his film directly before the eyes fill with vitality and chestnuts \"communicate\" with each other. At some point the viewer changes from the passive observer to an active participant of the on-screen action: in particular during the scene where water splashes charge from the screen - under the wheels of the car - right into the cinema hall. The same proximity effect to observed events is visible in the episode with the train:\n"}

It is part of the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nDespite its popularity with museum-goers and frequent misrepresentation as a national treasure, it in fact is only designated as a significant antiquity, having less rarity and value than required for categorization as a national treasure under the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act. For example, the Jadeite Cabbage has been called the \"most famous masterpiece\" of the entire National Palace Museum, and along with the Meat-shaped Stone and the Mao Gong Ding, is today called one of the Three Treasures of the National Palace Museum, a redesignation from several less accessible, infrequently-displayed works. It has also been chosen by the public as the most important item in the museum's entire collection.\n\nThe Jadeite Cabbage is a small sculpture. Measuring only and is thick, it is \"hardly larger than a human hand\".\n\nThe ruffled semi-translucent appearance of the leaves is due to the combination of various natural colors of the jade to recreate the color variations of a real cabbage. The figure was carved from a single piece of half-white, half-green jadeite which contained numerous imperfections such as cracks and discolored blotches. These flaws were incorporated into the sculpture and became the veins in the cabbage's stalks and leaves.\n\nThe sculpture has been considered an allegory of female virtue with the white stalk symbolizing purity, the leaves denoting fertility and abundance and locust and katydid representing children. However, further studies have proven that this interpretation is incorrect with regard to the katydid. There is a poem about an insect \"zhongsi\" in the Book of Poetry. This insect has been used metaphorically as an auspicious symbol for having many children and grandchildren in Chinese culture. Based on the interpretations of this poem and entomological analyses, this \"zhongsi\" is very likely a migratory locust. The locust on the Jadeite Cabbage is too small to be positively identified as a migratory locust. However, this \"katydid\" is definitely a Chinese bush cricket (scientific name: Gampsocleis gratiosa ) which is not the \"zhongsi\" of the Book of Poetry. In fact, the Chinese bush cricket is a singing insect artificially raised and used during the Qing Dynasty to entertain guests at the palace banquet. Consequently, this insect cannot be used as a fertility symbol.\n\nThe sculptor of the Jadeite Cabbage is unknown. It was first displayed in the Forbidden City's Yonghe Palace, the residence of the Qing Empire's Guangxu Emperor's Consort Jin who probably received it as part of her dowry for her wedding to Guangxu, in 1889. Following the fall of the Qing Empire in the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the sculpture became part of the collection of the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City. Along with a core of that collection, the piece survived the Second Sino-Japanese War (World War II) and the Chinese Civil War and was eventually relocated to Taiwan's National Palace Museum.\n\n"}

A six time world champion, he held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times for a combined total of 10 years, three months and nine days (3,749 days) – longer than anyone else in history. Thesz is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. Among his many accomplishments in the sport, he is credited with inventing a number of professional wrestling moves and holds such as the belly-to-back waistlock suplex (later known as the German suplex due to its association with Karl Gotch), the Lou Thesz press, stepover toehold facelock (STF), and the original powerbomb.\n\nBorn in Banat, Michigan in 1916, Thesz's family moved to St. Louis when he was a young boy. His working-class immigrant parents Martin, a shoemaker of Hungarian and German descent, and Katherine Schultz, also of German descent, hailed from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Beginning in Thesz's early youth, his father personally gave him a tough and thorough education in Greco-Roman wrestling, which provided the fundamentals for his later success. While in high school, he was a successful freestyle wrestling competitor on his school team; as he recalled many years later, he and a friend once \"worked\" a dramatic match against each other at a tournament, and were amused when nobody could see how much they were faking. As a teenager, he also trained in amateur wrestling with wrestler Ad Santel. Thesz made his professional wrestling debut in 1932, at the age of 16. He soon met Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis, the biggest wrestling star of the 1920s and renowned for his catch wrestling expertise, who taught a young Lou the art of \"hooking\" (the ability to stretch your opponent with painful holds), and the two formed a lasting friendship. By 1937, Thesz had become one of the biggest stars in the St. Louis territory, and on December 29 he defeated Everett Marshall for the American Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship, the first of many world heavyweight titles, which also made Thesz became the youngest world heavyweight champion in history, at the age of 21. Thesz dropped the title to Steve \"Crusher\" Casey in Boston six weeks later. He won the National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship in 1939, once again defeating Marshall, and again in 1948, defeating Bill Longson.\n\nIn 1948, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) was formed, the purpose being to create one world champion for all the various wrestling territories throughout North America. Orville Brown, the reigning Midwest World Heavyweight Championship holder, was named the first champion. Thesz, at the time, was head of a promotional combine that included fellow wrestling champions Longson, Bobby Managoff, Canadian promoter Frank Tunney and Eddie Quinn, who promoted in the St. Louis territory where NWA promoter Sam Muchnick was running opposition. Quinn and Muchnick ended their promotional war, and Thesz' promotion was absorbed into the NWA. Part of the deal was a title unification match between Brown and Thesz, who held the National Wrestling Association's World Heavyweight Championship. Unfortunately, just weeks before the scheduled bout, Brown was involved in an automobile accident that ended his career, and he was forced to vacate the championship and the NWA awarded the title to the No. 1 contender, Thesz. Thesz was chosen for his skill as a \"hooker\" to prevent double crosses by would-be shooters who would deviate from the planned finish for personal glory.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1956, Thesz set out to unify all the existing world titles into the National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Championship. In 1952, he defeated Baron Michele Leone in Los Angeles for the California World Heavyweight title and became the closest any wrestler had been to being undisputed world heavyweight wrestling champion since Danno O'Mahony in 1936. Thesz finally dropped the title to Whipper Billy Watson in 1956, and took several months off to recuperate from an ankle injury. He regained the title from Watson seven months later.\n1957 was an important year for Thesz; on June 14, the first taint to Thesz' claim of undisputed champion occurred in a match with gymnast-turned-wrestling star, Edouard Carpentier. The match was tied at two falls apiece when Thesz claimed a legitimate back injury and forfeit the last fall, thus Carpentier was declared the winner; however, the NWA chose not to recognize the title change, deciding a championship could not change hands due to injury. Despite the NWA's decision, there were some promotions who continued to recognize Carpentier's claim to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. That same year, Thesz became the first wrestler to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Japan, wrestling Rikidōzan in a series of 60-minute draws. Their bouts popularized professional wrestling in Japan, gaining the sport mainstream acceptance. Realizing he could make more money in the land of the rising sun, Thesz petitioned to the NWA promoters to regularly defend the championship belt in Japan, but his request was turned down, and Thesz asked to drop the title to his own hand picked champion, Dick Hutton, rather than Thesz's real-life rival and the more popular choice, Buddy Rogers. Thesz would embark on a tour of Europe and Japan, billing himself as the NWA International Heavyweight Champion; this title is still recognized as a part of All Japan Pro Wrestling's Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn 1963, Thesz came out of semi-retirement to win his sixth world heavyweight championship from Buddy Rogers at the age of 46. He would hold the title until 1966 when, at the age of 49 when he lost it to Gene Kiniski.\n\nThesz wrestled on a part-time basis over the next 13 years, winning his last major title in 1978, in Mexico, becoming the inaugural Universal Wrestling Alliance Heavyweight Champion at the age of 62, before dropping the championship to El Canek a year later. Thesz officially retired in 1979, after a match with Luke Graham, but he remained retired for the most part, before wrestling his last match on December 26, 1990 in Hamamatsu, Japan at the age of 74, against his protégé, Masahiro Chono. This makes him one of the only male professional wrestlers, along with Abdullah The Butcher, to wrestle in seven different decades.\n\nThesz was married three times. His first marriage to Evelyn Katherine Ernst in March 22, 1937. Thesz was convalescing from a severe knee injury suffered in 1939 and from 1941 to 1944 and worked as a dog breeder and trainer for Dogs for Defense and later as a supervisor for the Todd Houston Shipyard. He divorced his first wife in 1944 and at the shipyard, Thesz met his second wife, Fredda Huddleston Winter, with whom he fathered three children: Jeff Thesz, Robert Thesz and Patrick Thesz. Thesz was drafted into the army in 1944 despite a legitimate injury to his knee and multiple medical deferments. He was placed into medic training and eventually teaching hand-to-hand combat defense for medics and was discharged in 1946. Thesz's second marriage came to an end in 1975. He married Charlie Catherine Thesz and remained with her for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter retiring, Thesz became a promoter, manager, color commentator, trainer and occasionally, a guest referee for important matches. Some of the better-known matches he refereed include the following:\n\nIn 1992, Thesz became the president of the Cauliflower Alley Club (CAC), an organization recognizing and supporting retired wrestlers and actors who enjoyed an association with wrestling. He served as CAC's president until 2000. He became a trainer for the Union of Wrestling Force International, and lent the promotion one of his old NWA championship belts, which they recognized as their own world title. As an announcer, Thesz was the color commentator for International World Class Championship Wrestling's weekly television show. In 1999, his name was given to the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame for professional wrestling stars with a successful amateur background at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Waterloo, Iowa, where he was an inaugural inductee. In October 1997, Thesz was honored by a ceremony at World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) as being both the youngest and oldest world heavyweight champion at ages 21 and 50, respectively (technically, Verne Gagne holds the record for oldest champ, when he held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1980 at age 54, which was tied by WWF owner Vince McMahon in 1999; Thesz has since been supplanted as the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion by former champion Tim Storm (who was born on May 1, 1965), who won the title at age 51 by defeating Jax Dane on October 21, 2016).\n\nThesz lived in Virginia Beach, Virginia for much of his later life. He wrote an autobiography, \"Hooker\". Undergoing triple bypass surgery for an aortic valve replacement on April 9, 2002, he died due to complications weeks later on April 28 in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThesz who would train Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba to model themselves like Thesz. There has never been another true undisputed world heavyweight champion since Thesz accomplished this feat by unifying all the major titles between the late 1940s and early 1950s. Thesz is strongly considered by many to be the greatest professional wrestler of the 20th Century. Upon Thesz' passing, he was described as a \"God\" in Japan and the \"Babe Ruth\" of professional wrestling in America and \"perhaps the last pure wrestler to ever exist\". In Japan, Thesz was called \"Tetsujin\" which means \"Ironman\" in respect for his speed, conditioning and vast array of amazing wrestling techniques. For a brief period, Thesz also trained Japanese Jumbo Tsuruta who would begin using some of the moves that Thesz innovated during his matches starting in the 1980s.\n\nThesz was the first wrestler to ever hold the NWA International Heavyweight Championship, which became a part of what is now the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship under All Japan Pro Wrestling. Thesz was also the first UWA World Heavyweight Champion for the now defunct Universal Wrestling Association in Mexico, where he won the title after defeating Mil Máscaras on July 26, 1976. Thesz was the first ever TWWA World Heavyweight Champion for the now defunct International Wrestling Enterprise as well. Thesz and \"The Outlaw\" (Dory Funk Sr.) were the first ever NWA Pacific Coast (Vancouver) Tag Team Champions.\n\nIn 1999, a large group of professional wrestling experts, analysts and historians named Thesz the most influential NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time. In 2002, Thesz was named the second greatest professional wrestler of all time behind Ric Flair in the magazine article \"100 Wrestlers of All Time\" by John Molinaro, edited by Dave Meltzer and Jeff Marek. Former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jack Brisco named Thesz his all-time favorite professional wrestler by saying that \"Lou Thesz was my idol. He was a great wrestler, a great example, a class man\". The WWE tag team known as The Vaudevillains have named Thesz as one of their influences. WWE wrestler Cesaro named Thesz his \"dream\" tag team partner and said, \"He [Thesz] personifies wrestling. He represents everything that I think it should be. He's a class act, and he was a workhorse for the company, while at the same time being a student of the game. He was completely legit. I would have loved a chance to go one-on-one with him or to work alongside him\".\n\nThesz is an inaugural member of several professional wrestling halls of fame, including the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame, NWA Hall of Fame, WCW Hall of Fame, and the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame which is subsequently named after both one of his trainers along with Thesz himself. On April 2, 2016, Thesz was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as an inaugural member of the \"Legacy\" wing.\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n"}

Their gold working however was well-known and respected which made Nencatacoa an important deity and protector.\n\nNencatacoa was represented in the form of a forest animal, made of gold and covered with a mantle. Nencatacoa looked most like a fox or a bear, because as Pedro Simón noted, \"an animal in that shape would appear multiple times\".\n\nHe was the protector god of the weavers, an industry that was very important among the Muisca, who used a great variety of materials but mostly cotton and fique.\n\nNencatacoa was also the protector of artists and painters who realized their beautiful creations on the cloths, the ceramics, gold metallurgy, sculptures and petroglyphs with different anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and ideogramatic figures.\n\nMoreover, Nencatacoa was the god of festivities, drunkenness and dance. Traditions tell us that he partied with the people without caring about anything else. The Muisca drank \"chicha\", a type of alcoholic drink based on the fermentation and cooking of maize.

His brother Sergei Tretyakov was also a famous patron of art and a philanthropist.\n\nTretyakov was taught at home. In the first half of 1850 he inherited his father's business and built up a profitable trade in flax, linen processing and the sale of textiles.\n\nTogether with other Moscow businessmen he acted as the founder of the Moscow merchant bank (becoming one of its heads), the Moscow commercial and industrial company, some other large firms. He amassed a considerable fortune (4.4 million rubles), consisting of real estate (5 houses in Moscow), securities, money and bills.\n\nTretyakov started to collect art in 1854 at the age of 22; his first purchase was 10 canvases by Old Dutch masters. He laid down for himself the aim of creating a Russian National Gallery. In his collection Tretyakov included the most valuable and remarkable products, first of all the contemporaries, from 1870 - mainly members of the society of circulating art exhibitions (\"Tovarishchestvo peredvizhnyh hudozhestvennyh vystavok\" or Peredvizhniki, Передвижники in Russian). He bought paintings at exhibitions and directly from artists' studios, sometimes he bought the whole series: in 1874 he acquired V.V. Vereschagin's \"Turkestan series\" (13 pictures, 133 figures and 81 studies), in 1880 - his \"Indian series\" (78 studies). In his collection there were over 80 studies by Alexander Ivanov. In 1885 Tretyakov bought 102 studies by V.D. Polenov painted by the artist during journeys across Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Palestine. He got also acquired Vasnetsov’s collection of the sketches made during work above lists in the Kiev St Volodymyr's Cathedral. Tretyakov had the fullest collection of such artists as: V.G. Perov, I.N. Kramskoi, Ilya Repin, Vasily Surikov, I.I. Levitan, and Valentin Serov. Aspiring to show the beginnings and development of the domestic school of art , Tretyakov began to acquire pictures by masters of the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries and landmarks of Old Russian painting. He also conceived the creation of a \"Russian pantheon\" - a portrait gallery of famous Russians. He commissioned especially for it portraits of figures of domestic culture from leading masters of this genre - N.N. Ge, Kramskoi, N.V. Nevrev, Perov, Repin.\n\nIn 1870-80 Tretyakov also began to collect illustrations (471 by 1893), since 1890 he formed a collection of icons. During his lifetime they were not included in an exhibition, being kept in the owner's study. He also collected sculpture, however this part of his collection was small (9 sculptures by 1893).\n\nAt first the gallery was located in Tretyakov’s house in Lavrushenski pereulok. But as his collection expanded he decided to reconstruct his house for his collection. In 1870-1880 the house was repeatedly reconstructed by the architect Kaminski.\n\nTretyakov wanted to transfer the gallery to the city as discreetly as possible, without any noise; he didn’t want to be in the center of general attention and an object of gratitude. But it was not possible to do it and he was very dissatisfied.\n\nFrom 1881 his gallery became popular (by 1885 it was visited by about 30 thousand people). In 1892 Tretyakov inherited a collection of Western European painting from his brother and placed it in two halls of the western school. The collection in Tretyakov’s gallery was equal in importance with the largest museums in Russia at that time, and became one of sights of Moscow. In August 1892 Tretyakov donated his collection and a private residence to Moscow. By then in the collection there were 1287 picturesque and 518 graphic products of Russian school, 75 pictures and 8 figures of the West-European school, 15 sculptures and collections of icons. \n\nOn August 15, 1893 the official opening of a museum under the name \"Pavel and Sergey Tretyakov City art gallery\" (nowadays Tretyakov Gallery) took place. By 1890 it was visited by up to 150 thousand people annually. Tretyakov continued to fill up his collection, for example, in 1894 he donated a gallery of 30 pictures, 12 figures and a marble statue “The Christian martyrs“ works by M.M. Antokolski. He was engaged in studying the collection, and from 1893 issued its catalogue.\n\nApart from engaging in collecting, Tretyakov was active in charity. Charity for him was as natural as the creation of a national gallery.\n\nTretyakov consisted the honorary member of the Society of fans of applied arts and the Musical society from the date of their basis, granted the solid sums, supporting all educational undertakings. He took part in set of charitable certificates, all donations in the help to families of victims the soldier during the Crimean and Russo-Turkish War. Tretyakov's grants were established in commercial schools - by Moscow and Alexandrovskoe. He never refused in the monetary help to artists and the other applicants, carefully cared of monetary business of painters who without fear entrusted to him their savings. Pavel Mikhailovich repeatedly lent money to the kind counselor and adviser I.N. Kramskoi, V.G. Khudyakov, K.A. Trutovski, M.K. Klodt and much helped disinterestedly to others. Brothers - Pavel and Sergey Tretyakov - based in Moscow Arnoldo-Tretyakov School for deaf-mutes. Guardianship above the school, beginning in 1860th, proceeded during P.M. Tretyakov's life and after his death.\n\nIn his will Tretyakov provided large sums for school of deaf-mutes. For pupils of school Tretyakov bought the big stone house with a garden. 150 boys and girls lived in this house. Here they were brought up to 16 year old and left receiving profession in this school. Tretyakov selected the best teachers, got acquainted with the methods of studying.\n\nPavel Tretyakov bequeathed half of his estate to charitable purposes: on the device of a shelter for widows, juvenile children and unmarried daughters of died artists, and also on financing of gallery.\n\nHe died in 1898. He was buried in Danilov Cemetery, but in 1948 his remains were transferred to Novodevichy Cemetery.\n\nA minor planet 3925 Tret'yakov, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova in 1977 is named after Pavel Tretyakov and his brother Sergei Mikhailovich Tretyakov (1824–1892).\n\nHis daughter Vera married the pianist and composer Alexander Siloti.\n"}

{"id": "26281232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26281232", "title": "Picturesque America", "text": "Picturesque America\n\nPicturesque America was a two-volume set of books describing and illustrating the scenery of America, which grew out of an earlier series in \"Appleton's Journal\". It was published by D. Appleton and Company of New York in 1872 and 1874 and edited by the romantic poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878), who also edited the New York Evening Post. The layout and concept was similar to that of \"Picturesque Europe\". The work's essays, together with its nine hundred wood engravings and fifty steel engravings, are considered to have had a profound influence on the growth of tourism and the historic preservation movement in the United States.\n\nThe preface described \"the design of this publication to present full descriptions and elaborate pictorial delineations of the scenery characteristic of all the different parts of our country. The wealth of material for this purpose is almost boundless.\"\n\nThis two-volume set and others of the same genre, achieved great popularity in the nineteenth century. Their illustrations provided a tour of nineteenth century America, unspoilt and pastoral, its centres of commerce, ports, architecture and natural treasures. In a modern (2001) treatment of the work, Sue Rainey, who is a historian of American graphic arts and has a particular interest in the artists who drew landscapes and cityscapes for periodical and book illustrations, wrote \"As the first publication to celebrate the entire continental nation, it enabled Americans, after the trauma of the Civil War, to construct a national self-image based on reconciliation between North and South and incorporation of the West.\" (p. xiii) The volumes display both steel and wood engravings based on the paintings of some of the best American landscape painters of the nineteenth century, primarily Harry Fenn and his friend Douglas Woodward, but also including John Frederick Kensett, William Stanley Haseltine, James David Smillie, John William Casilear, Thomas Moran, A. C. Warren, David Johnson, Granville Perkins, Felix Octavius Carr Darley, Albert Fitch Bellows, James McDougal Hart, Casimir Clayton Griswold (1834-1918), Worthington Whittredge, Charles G. Rosenberg (1818 - 1879), William Ludwell Sheppard (1833-1912), Homer Dodge Martin, Alfred Rudolph Waud, William Hart, Robert Swain Gifford, Jules Tavernier, William Hamilton Gibson, and Thomas Cole.\n\nEngravers included Robert Hinshelwood (1812-1885), Edward Paxman Brandard (1819-1898), Samuel Valentine Hunt (1803-1893), William Wellstood (1819-1900), William Chapin (1802-1888), Henry Bryan Hall (1808-1884).\nRobert Hinshelwood was born in Edinburgh in 1812 and emigrated to America in 1835 where he became renowned for his landscapes, etchings and engravings. His meticulous attention to detail was appreciated by publishing houses such as Appleton’s and Harper's, and also by the Continental Bank Note Company who employed him to produce plates for the printing of currency. He died in New York.\n\n\n\nThis ambitious work was published and delivered as a subscription; semi-monthly parts were sent out to subscribers. Once complete, the subscription would be bound into volumes. A variety of bindings were available, from cloth-bound with leather corners at the low end to full Morocco leather bindings with elaborate tooling. The stately, bound two volume set was proudly displayed in parlors of subscriber homes as a show of status.\nNowadays, the publication frequently appears in antiquarian book collections; sometimes in pristine collection, but more frequently in poor condition. Lower-quality examples are frequently disassembled, their engravings removed and sold separately.\n\n\n"}

An absurdist metatheatrical play about the relationship among authors, their characters, and theatre practitioners, it premiered at the Teatro Valle in Rome to a mixed reception, with shouts from the audience of \"\"Manicomio\"!\" (\"Madhouse!\") and \"\"Incommensurabile\"!\" (\"Incommensurable!\"), a reaction to the play's illogical progression. Reception improved at subsequent performances, especially after Pirandello provided for the play's third edition, published in 1925, a foreword clarifying its structure and ideas.\n\nThe play had its American premiere in 1922 on Broadway at the Princess Theatre and was performed for over a year off-Broadway at the Martinique Theatre beginning in 1963.\n\nAn acting company prepares to rehearse the play \"The Rules of the Game\" by Luigi Pirandello. As the rehearsal is about to begin, they are unexpectedly interrupted by the arrival of six strange people. The Director of the play, furious at the interruption, demands an explanation. The Father explains that they are unfinished characters in search of an author to finish their story. The Director initially believes them to be mad, but as they begin to argue among themselves and reveal details of their story, he begins to listen. The Father and The Mother had one child together (The Son), but they have separated and Mother has had three children by another man - The Stepdaughter, The Boy and The Child (a girl). The Father attempted to buy sex from The Stepdaughter, claiming he did not recognize her after so many years, but The Stepdaughter is convinced he knew who she was the entire time. The Mother walked in on The Father and The Stepdaughter shortly after The Father's proposal and informs The Stepdaughter that he is her ex-husband; they both express their disgust and outrage. While The Director is not an author, he agrees to load it their story despite disbelief among the jeering actors.\n\nAfter a 20-minute break, The Characters and The Company return to the stage to perform some of the story so far. They begin to perform the scene between The Stepdaughter and The Father in Madame Pace's shop, which the Director decides to call Scene I. The Characters are very particular about the setting, wanting everything to be as realistic as possible. The Director asks The Actors to observe the scene because he intends for them to perform it later. This sparks the first argument between The Director and The Characters over the acting of the play because The Characters had assumed that they would be performing it, seeing as they are The Characters already. The Director continues the play, but The Stepdaughter has more problems with the accuracy of the setting, saying she doesn't recognize the scene. Just as The Director is about to begin the scene once more, he realizes that Madame Pace is not with them. The Actors watch in disbelief as The Father lures her to the stage by hanging their coats and hats on racks, and Madame Pace follows, \"attracted by the very articles of her trade\".\n\nThe scene begins between Madame Pace and The Stepdaughter, with Madame Pace exhorting The Stepdaughter, telling her she must work as a prostitute to save The Mother's job. The Mother protests at having to watch the scene, but she is restrained. After The Father and The Stepdaughter act half of the scene, The Director stops them so that The Actors may perform what they have just done. The Characters break into laughter as The Actors try to imitate them. The Actors continue but The Stepdaughter cannot contain her laughter as The Actors use the wrong tones of voice and gestures. The Father begins another argument with The Director over the realism of The Actors compared to The Characters themselves. The Director allows The Characters to perform the rest of the scene and decides to have the rehearsals later.\n\nThis time, The Stepdaughter explains the rest of the scene during an argument with The Director over the truth on stage. The scene culminates in an embrace between The Father and The Stepdaughter, which is realistically interrupted by the distressed Mother. The line between reality and acting is blurred as the scene closes with The Director pleased with the first act.\n\nThe final act of the play begins in the garden. It is revealed that there was much arguing among the family members as The Father sent for The Mother, The Stepdaughter, The Child, The Boy, and The Son to come back and stay with him. The Son reveals that he hates the family for sending him away and does not consider The Stepdaughter or the others a part of his family. The scene ends with The Child drowning in a fountain, The Boy committing suicide with a revolver, and The Stepdaughter running out of the theater, leaving The Son, The Mother, and The Father on stage. The play ends with The Director confused over whether it was real or not, concluding that in either case he lost a whole day over it.\n\nThe play was staged in 1921 by the \"Compagnia di Dario Niccodemi\" at the Valle theatre in Rome to mixed results. The public split into supporters and adversaries. The author, who was present at the presentation with his daughter Lietta, was forced to leave the theatre through a side exit in order to avoid the crowd of opponents. However, the play was a great success when presented in Milan.\n\n\n\n\n\"Spoofs of, or references to, the play include:\"\n\n\n (In original Italian; Pirandello's revised version)\n"}

{"id": "4011202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4011202", "title": "Tenebrae (film)", "text": "Tenebrae (film)\n\nTenebrae (, also known as Tenebre) is a 1982 Italian \"giallo\" film written and directed by Dario Argento. The film stars Anthony Franciosa as American author Peter Neal, who – while in Rome promoting his latest murder-mystery novel – becomes embroiled in the search for a serial killer who may have been inspired to kill by his novel. John Saxon and Daria Nicolodi co-star as Neal's agent and assistant, while Giuliano Gemma and Carola Stagnaro appear as detectives investigating the murders. John Steiner, Veronica Lario and Mirella D'Angelo also feature in minor roles. The film has been described as exploring themes of dualism and sexual aberration, and has strong metafictional elements; some commentators consider \"Tenebrae\" to be a direct reaction by Argento to criticism of his previous work, most especially his depictions of murders of beautiful women.\n\nAfter Argento had experimented with pure supernatural horror with 1977's \"Suspiria\" and 1980's \"Inferno\", \"Tenebrae\" represented the filmmaker's return to the \"giallo\" horror subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s. Argento was inspired by a series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticize him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work. The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento, who channelled the experience into the writing of \"Tenebrae\". The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980, and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted \"to kill for nothing\".\n\nShot on location in Rome and at Elios Studios, \"Tenebrae\" utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realize his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli, Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police shows at the time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with sharp angles and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided \"Tenebrae\"s music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.\n\n\"Tenebrae\" was a modest success in Italy; it reached theatres with little controversy after Argento made cuts to one of the most violent scenes. However, in the United Kingdom, it was added to the infamous list of \"video nasties\" and banned from sale until 1999. The film's theatrical distribution in the United States was delayed until 1984, when it was released in a heavily censored version under the title Unsane. In its cut form, \"Tenebrae\" received a mostly negative critical reception, but the original, fully restored version later became widely available for reappraisal; it is considered by some to be one of Argento's best thrillers. The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh has said that it is \"in many respects ... the finest film that Argento has ever made\".\n\nPeter Neal, an American writer of violent horror novels, visits Italy to promote his latest work, \"Tenebrae\". He is joined in Rome by his assistant Anne, and his literary agent Bullmer. Unbeknownst to Neal, his embittered fiancée Jane has vandalized his suitcase in JFK and followed him to Rome. Hours before Neal's arrival, young shoplifter Elsa is killed with a razor by an unseen assailant. Detective Giermani and Inspector Altieri question Neal because Elsa's mouth had been stuffed with pages of \"Tenebrae\". Neal receives an anonymous letter, deemed by Giermani a prelude to an impending killing spree. \n\nThe film is punctuated hereafter by visions tormenting an unseen man. Implied to be flashbacks, they showcase a young woman flirting with several male youths in a beach. One of them slaps her and is then chased and held down by the others while she kicks and orally rapes him with red high-heeled shoes. Later, unequivocally POV shot flashbacks show him stabbing her to death in revenge. \n\nMore killings and letters ensue in the present, confirming Giermani's prediction. Lesbian journalist and Neal acquaintance Tilde is murdered at her home, along with her lover Marion. Maria, the daughter of Neal's landlord, is axed to death after stumbling into the killer's lair. TV book reviewer Christiano Berti shows an intense fixation on Neal's work, as well as a bigoted prudishness much like that of the killer's letters. Following this hunch, and the fact that Maria's body was found in Berti's district, Neal and his assistant Gianni spy on Berti, who is burning pictures and files identifying him as the killer. Gianni sees Berti telling someone \"I killed them all!\" and having his head split by an axe, but is unable to see the murderer. He finds Neal knocked unconscious on the lawn and they flee the scene. \n\nNeal has sex with Anne that night, a first in their six-year acquaintance. After Neal leaves Bullmer's office the next morning, his fiancée Jane comes out of an adjacent room and is revealed to be Bullmer's lover. Giermani calls Neal to the Berti crime scene after finding dossiers proving Berti's obsession with him, but is unaware of the burnt evidence. He thus believes the killer is still at large, and is comforted by Neal's intention to leave Rome. Jane receives a gift of red shoes like those prevalent in the seaside flashbacks. Bullmer is stabbed to death in a public square while waiting for Jane, who witnesses the aftermath and flees. Neal's plane leaves for Paris that evening. \n\nMeanwhile, Gianni is haunted by the significance of what he witnessed in Berti's house. He returns there and realizes that Berti's self-incriminating last words imply \"two\" murderers. Before Gianni can share this detail with anyone, he is garrotted to death in his car. A distraught Jane calls Anne to her place, and waits in her kitchen holding a pistol. An axe shatters the window and hacks off her forearm. Blood sprays over the walls and Jane falls to the floor, where several blows finish her off. Inspector Altieri enters and is also killed, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Giermani and Anne arrive soon afterwards. Held at gunpoint by Giermani, Neal tacitly confesses to killing Berti and everyone after him, then slits his throat. \n\nGiermani reports the incident from the car radio and comforts Anne. A final explanation takes form. The teenage murder flashbacks were Neal's. Berti's sadistic murder spree had unlocked a repressed memory in Neal, namely his murder of the girl who had humiliated him as a youth in Rhode Island. The memory inflamed Neal's previously suppressed bloodlust, driving him insane. It also fueled his plan to eliminate Jane and Bullmer, whose affair he knew of, by maintaining a semblance that the original killer had murdered Berti and was still active. Whether Berti destroyed his murder files at Neal's secret behest, or spontaneously, is left to speculation.\n\nGiermani returns inside and is murdered by Neal, who had faked his own death. Neal waits for Anne to return; when she opens the door, she accidentally knocks over a metal sculpture that impales and kills Neal. The horror-stricken Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly.\n\nAccording to the film historian and critic Bill Warren, \"Tenebrae\" is a typical example of the \"giallo\" film genre: \"visually extremely stylish, with imaginative, sometimes stunning cinematography\", it presents \"mysterious, gruesome murders, often in picturesque locations; at the end, the identity of the murderer is disclosed in a scene destined to terrify and surprise.\" These narrative and visual strategies had been introduced years before Argento made his first thriller, 1970's \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\"—most critics point to Mario Bava's \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" (1963) as the original \"giallo\".\n\nBy the time Argento made \"Tenebrae\", he had become the acknowledged master of the genre, to the point where he felt confident enough to be openly self-referential to his own past, referencing the \"reckless driving humor\" from \"The Cat o' Nine Tails\" (1971) and the hero from \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\". The scene in which Veronica Lario's character, Jane, returns home directly references \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\" with its large sculpture in the entrance hallway.\n\nWarren and Alan Jones cite a scene where a character is killed in a public square as evoking the work of Alfred Hitchcock; Rostock agrees that the editing of the sequence is in a Hitchcockian vein, while the lighting is more influenced by Michelangelo Antonioni. The film critic and author Maitland McDonagh argues that Argento's influences for \"Tenebrae\" were far broader than just his own films or previous Italian thrillers. She refers to the strong narrative in the film as an example of \"the most paranoid excesses of \"film noir\".\" McDonagh suggests that Fritz Lang's \"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt\" (1956) (\"in which a man convicted of murder on false evidence ... is in fact guilty of the murder\") and Roy William Neill's \"Black Angel\" (1946) (\"in which a man who tries to clear a murder suspect does so at the cost of learning that he himself is the killer\") both use such a similar plot twist to \"Tenebrae\" that Argento may have used them as partial models for his story.\n\nKim Newman and Alan Jones suggest that the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious influences on \"Tenebrae\", and there are many references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel \"The Sign of Four\" (1890): \"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?\" A variation of this quote is delivered many times in \"Tenebrae\". Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (1901–1902). Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.\n\nCritics have identified various major themes in \"Tenebrae\". In interviews conducted during the film's production, the usually somewhat reticent Argento offered his candid views on the thematic content of the film. As biographer Maitland McDonagh noted in \"Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento\", \"... Argento has never been more articulate and/or analytical than he was on the subject of \"Tenebrae\".\" Film scholar William Hope considers the film to be devoid of classical narrative progression, and states that the characters \"lack a narrative function or purpose, existing only to be killed in a spectacular fashion, their death hardly moving the narrative on at all. Traditional cause and effect are seemingly forgotten or actively ignored\". According to James Gracey, author of a book about Argento's work, with \"Tenebrae\" Argento \"explores some of his most reoccurring themes and preoccupations, such as Freudian psychology, sexual deviancy, repressed trauma, voyeurism, audience spectatorship and the fetishisation of violence and death.\" Water is often associated visually with Neal; in almost all his scenes his appearance is followed or accompanied by a shot of water. Later, this device is used repeatedly as a clue to the ultimate killer's identity – Neal himself.\n\nAccording to Argento expert Thomas Rostock, \"Tenebrae\" is filled with rhyming imagery that relates to the film's exploration of \"the dual nature of [the] two active murderers\" using doubles, inversions, reflections and \"re-reflections\". Every major character has at least one double, and the theme extends to objects, locations, actions and events – major and minor. The doubling or mirroring of incidents and objects includes telephone booths, aircraft, homeless men, otherwise-meaningless public brawls in the background, car accidents, typewriters (literally side-by-side), keys, handkerchief, hands caught in doors and the characters themselves. Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in frame with their doppelgängers – one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri. McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani: \"Giermani ... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator ... the detective/writer and the writer/detective each belittles his other half, as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away.\" McDonagh also observes that, in what is arguably the film's most potent shock, Neal at one point really does make Giermani \"go away\", virtually replacing him on screen \"in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous.\" Earlier, Neal killed a woman who – to his and the audience's surprise – was not Anne, but Altieri. \"Tenebrae\" itself is split almost exactly into two parts. The first half belongs to the murders of Berti; the second to those of Neal. The two are set up as mirrors of one another. Berti's killings with a razor are clinical, with \"lingering sexualized aggressiveness\", whereas Neal's (with an axe) are crimes of passion committed for personal reasons or out of necessity; they are swift and to the point.\n\nKevin Lyon observes, \"The plot revolves around the audacious and quite unexpected transference of guilt from the maniacal killer (about whom we learn very little, itself unusual for Argento) to the eminently likeable hero, surely the film's boldest stroke.\" While noting that the device is \"striking\", McDonagh comments that this transmission of guilt occurs between two dark doubles who are severely \"warped\" individuals. She suggests that \"Neal and Berti ... act as mirrors to one another, each twisting the reflection into a warped parody of the other.\" Berti's obsession with Neal's fiction compels him to commit murder in homage to the writer, while Neal seems to think that his own violent acts are simply part of some kind of \"elaborate fiction\". When the bloody Neal is confronted by Giermani immediately after having killed numerous people, Neal screams at him, \"It was like a book ... a book!\"\n\nThe moment in which the first half of the movie transitions into the second is punctuated by the rising score and camera pan to an ostensibly meaningless point of reflected light on an ornament. According to Rostock, the meaning behind this movement is clear: it marks the spot when Berti's spree ends and Neal's rampage begins. Argento uses the shift in focus to comment on the shaping of the film itself, until that moment a typical, \"clichéd and remote\" \"giallo\". Neal, previously passive, begins to control what happens in his own story, which is more personal with \"weight and meaning\". According to Rostock, this structure allows Argento equal scope to play with the narrative while commenting upon it, all without having to deviate from the advancement of plot. According to Kim Newman, the use of a sculpture as a weapon makes literal one of the themes of the film: \"art that kills people\". Rostock concurs, saying that as the film is a commentary on art, the only weapon that can end the narrative is art itself.\n\nAccording to Gracey, a number of critics have compared Argento with the character of Peter Neal, speculating that he serves as an alter-ego for the director. Gracey refers to \"Tenebrae\" as a \"reflexive commentary on [the director's] earlier work.\" The director himself saw the film in the same light, claiming it was a reaction to accusations that \"[he] was a misogynist ... a criminal ... a murderer.\" Argento resolved to include all of these aspects of his previous films into \"Tenebrae\". A scene in which a woman criticizes the lead character's books as \"sexist\", featuring \"women as victims, cipers, male heroes [and] macho bullshit\" echoes criticisms of Argento's own work. Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene \"essentially autobiographical\", and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side, to \"let it speak\". With \"Tenebrae\" in particular, he felt he was making a joke or playing a game with his critics, creating a front or mystique about himself. Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and sending up this perception. Newman agrees that Argento used \"Tenebrae\" to address his own public image, the notion that someone who creates art as \"sick and twisted\" as his, must himself be sick and twisted. With \"Tenebrae\"s reveal that the author is the killer, Newman argues that Argento is saying, \"What if I were?\"\n\nAs in many of Argento's films, which tend to eroticize the murder of beautiful women, gender, sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film. The fictional novel within the film is described as being \"about human perversion and its effects on society\". Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as \"filthy, slimy perverts\". The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion. His \"moral crusade\" is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in \"Freudian flashbacks\". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks \"expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful woman in his youth.\" McDonagh also notes that \"Tenebrae\" expands on the themes of sexuality and transvestitism found in Argento's earlier films, \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\", \"The Cat o' Nine Tails\", \"Four Flies on Grey Velvet\" (1972), and \"Deep Red\" (1975), but believes that \"Tenebrae\"s \"overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other \"gialli\".\" She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it \"the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect\", and further notes that \"\"Tenebrae\" is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature.\" Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's \"preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle\".\n\nMcDonagh noted that two sexually charged flashbacks are key to understanding \"Tenebrae\". These distinct but strongly related memory fragments are introduced repeatedly throughout the film, usually immediately following a murder sequence. Although the flashbacks are never fully explained, the first reveals a beautiful young woman's sexual humiliation (though oral rape) of a teenage boy, presumed to be Peter Neal. The young woman is mostly topless during this first sequence, and she humiliates the young man by jamming the heel of one of her shiny red shoes into his mouth while he is held down by a group of gleeful boys on a pale-white beach. The second flashback shows the vicious revenge-murder of the woman some time later. McDonagh notes that all of the fetishistic imagery of these flashbacks, combined with the sadistic details of the murder sequences in the main narrative, \"set the parameters of \"Tenebrae\"s fetishistic and fetishicized visual vocabulary, couched in terms both ritualistic and orgiastically out of control ... Peter Neal indulges in sins of the flesh and \"Tenebrae\" revels in them, inviting the spectator to join in; in fact, it dares the viewer not to do so.\"\n\nThe protagonists in Argento's \"giallo\" films almost always suffer from vision impairment of some kind. It is these characters' chronic inability to find the missing pieces of a puzzle the puzzle being the solution of a murder or series of murders) that generally provides much of the films' narrative thrust. Most obviously is the blind Franco Arno (Karl Malden) in \"The Cat o' Nine Tails\", who must use his heightened aural sense in combination with visual clues supplied to him by his niece to solve a mystery. In \"The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\", Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) witnesses a murder attempt but admits to the police that something seems to be \"missing\"; as the film's surprise ending makes clear, he did not \"miss\" anything, but simply misinterpreted what happened in front of his eyes. In \"Deep Red\", Marcus (David Hemmings) has a similar problem in both seeing and \"not\" seeing the murderer at the scene of the crime, and does not realize his mistake until it is almost too late. This recurring theme, according to Douglas E. Winter, creates \"a world of danger and deception, where seeing is not believing\".\n\nFlanagan observes that in \"Tenebrae\", Argento offers two characters who suffer from impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning to the scene of the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.\n\nIn an interview that appeared in \"Cinefantastique\", Argento noted that the film was intended as near-science fiction, taking place \"about five or more years in the future ... \"Tenebrae\" occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people with the result that the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants to remember ... It isn't exactly my \"Blade Runner\", of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. If you watch the film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent.\" Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an atomic bomb blast. Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept \"isn't apparent at all\" and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film. The film critic and author Kim Newman countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes, and Newman cites the on-screen use a videophone as an attempt by Argento to place \"Tenebrae\" in the near future.\n\nWhile rejecting this thematic concern as unrealized by Argento, McDonagh noted that the result of the director's experiment is a strange \"architectural landscape\" that becomes the \"key element in differentiating \"Tenebrae\" from Argento's earlier \"gialli\".\" Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual \"hyper-realism\" results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, \"... I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen\", she notes that the film's \"fictive space couldn't be less 'real'\", with its \"vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages.\" The EUR district of Rome, where much of \"Tenebrae\" was filmed, was built in preparation for the 1942 World's Fair, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.\n\nAfter completing \"Inferno\" (1980), the second in his planned \"Three Mothers\" trilogy of supernatural horror films, Argento was expected to move straight into production of its concluding chapter. The first in the trilogy, \"Suspiria\" (1977), had turned the director into what Alan Jones called \"a horror superstar\", but \"Inferno\" had proven a difficult follow-up. Argento had become unwell while writing the film, and his ill health continued into filming. In addition, Argento's relationship with \"Inferno\"s co-producer 20th Century Fox had soured the director on \"Hollywood politics\", so when \"Inferno\" was not well-received upon release, Argento put the \"Three Mothers\" trilogy on hold. \"Inferno\" also flopped commercially. According to James Gracey, Argento – under pressure and feeling \"the need to once again defy expectations\" – returned to the \"giallo\" genre and began work on \"Tenebrae\". Argento later stated that he wanted to \"put on film a gory roller-coaster ride packed with fast and furious murders\" and that he \"shouldn't resist what [his] hardcore audience wanted\". He added that he had also become irritated that in the years since his last \"giallo\" so many other directors had made films derivative of – and inferior to – his own genre-defining works.\n\nArgento said that \"Tenebrae\" was directly influenced by two distressing incidents that occurred 1980. On a break from filmmaking after \"Suspiria\"s surprise success, Argento was spending time in Los Angeles, where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly, to talk about \"Suspiria\"s influence on him. According to Argento, the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent, eventually menacing. The fan claimed that he wanted \"to harm Argento in a way that reflected how much the director's work had affected him\", and that because the director had \"ruined his life\", he in turn wanted to ruin Argento's. Although no violence came of the threat, Argento said he found the experience understandably terrifying, and felt unable to write. At the advice of his producers, Argento fled to the coastal city of Santa Monica, where he felt safe enough to resume writing. However, after a few weeks the fan found Argento and resumed his calls, issuing more threats. The director decided to return to Italy. Argento felt the escalating nature of the fan's threats were \"symptomatic of that city of broken dreams\" with its \"celebrity stalkers and senseless crime\". The second incident occurred during Argento's stay at The Beverly Hilton, where a Japanese tourist was shot dead in the hotel lobby. Later hearing of a drive-by shooting outside a local cinema, Argento reflected on the senselessness of the killings: \"To kill for nothing, that is the true horror of today ... when that gesture has no meaning whatsoever it's completely repugnant, and that's the sort of atmosphere I wanted to put across in \"Tenebrae\".\"\n\nArgento reportedly offered the lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but eventually it went to Anthony Franciosa. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as he was capable of bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, it would have been more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of \"Suspiria\". Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in \"Tenebrae\". By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrow—which ultimately went to Veronica Lario. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the woman on the beach in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock states that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play the woman on the beach.\nWhen the American actress who had been hired to play Anne dropped out just before the start of principal photography, Argento convinced Nicolodi to take on this larger role. Nicolodi found Anne to have a different personality than her own, and much preferred the characters she had played for Argento previously, who she said had much more personality than Anne. She said the role required little energy or imagination, but liked the novelty of playing neither killer nor victim. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that Nicolodi had very little character to play, as written. Newman added that this lack of character stretched to all the Italians in the film, and that only the American characters had discernible personalities. Nicolodi later claimed that although filming began well enough, Argento became angry when she and Franciosa bonded over playwright Tennessee Williams and their experience in theatre, leading the director to make sure their shared scenes \"were an ordeal to endure\". The charged atmosphere culminated with Argento reportedly telling Franciosa, \"leave my woman alone!\" Nicolodi said she channelled her frustrations with the situation into her character's last scene in the film, where Anne stands in the rain and screams repeatedly, continuing over the film's end credits. She had been directed to scream only a little, but knowing it was the last day of filming and her last scene to complete, Nicolodi screamed loudly and for a long time, much to Argento's and the crew's surprise. Nicolodi said the scene was her \"cathartic release from the whole nightmare\".\n\nAlthough \"Tenebrae\" was an Italian production, most of the cast spoke their dialogue in English to increase the film's chances of success in United States. For domestic audiences, the film was dubbed into Italian. The English-language dub retained Franciosa's, Saxon's and Steiner's natural voices. However, Nicolodi's voice was dubbed by Theresa Russell, Giuliano Gemma's was dubbed by David Graham, and most of the female voices were dubbed by Adrienne Posta. Michele Soavi – frequent Argento collaborator, second assistant director on \"Tenebrae\" and later a noted director in his own right – acted alongside Robin's in the second flashback scene. Another of Argento's collaborators, Fulvio Mingozzi cameoed as a hotel porter. In common with several other Argento films, close-ups of the killer's gloved hands were Argento's own. In the film's Italian-language dub, Argento also provided the opening voice-over, reading aloud descriptions of murderous actions from Neal's fictitious novel, \"Tenebrae\".\n\nFilming began on 3 May 1982 and took ten weeks shot mostly on location in Rome. Kim Newman described the Rome of \"Tenebrae\" as unlike the one usually shown on television and in films, with none of the usual historical landmarks. Newman and Alan Jones agreed that this was a deliberate choice made by Argento, as some of his previous films had utilized so much of recognisable Italy. Argento himself said he had wanted to show Italy was not just a museum piece; Newman said it was Argento's way of saying, \"Rome is a vibrant city. It is modern.\" Most of \"Tenebrae\"s location shooting was carried out in Rome's EUR business and residential district. The first flashback scene was filmed at the Capocotta beach, south of the city near Ostia. The shoplifting scene near the beginning of \"Tenebrae\" was filmed on location at department store La Rinascente, off Piazza Fiume. Bullmer's death in a public square was shot at a shopping precinct called \"Le Terrazze\" in Rome's Casal Palocco residential neighbourhood. The scene in which Neal's landlord's daughter is killed was filmed outside the home of architect – and friend of Argento – Sandro Petti, switching to studio shots for her initial entrance into the house and back to Petti's house for the confrontation with the killer. The scene at the beginning of the film where Neal boards his flight to Rome was filmed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\nGiuseppe Bassan – a frequent Argento collaborator – was the film's production designer. The surroundings are given a bleached, \"merciless\" look, made from marble and stone façades, shiny metallic sculptures, with steel, water and glass surfaces. Some of the homes – specifically those of the lesbian couple and the first killer – are \"cold, austere, brutalist\" slabs of granite, and many of the interior shots feature plain white backgrounds, with characters' wearing pale-coloured clothes against them – better, Newman felt, to contrast the blood once the violence started. The studio-set scenes were filmed at Elios Studios in Rome, unlike Argento's previous films in the city, which he had filmed at Incir De Paolis. He was not able to use Elios, as the director Michelangelo Antonioni, of whom he was a huge fan, was using the studio to film \"Identification of a Woman\" (1982) at the time. The design and creation of \"Tenebrae\"s special effects were supervised by Giovanni Corridori, who – with his brother Tonino – had a near-monopoly on special effects in the Italian film industry at the time. The scene in which Jane is hacked to death after having her arm cut off was filmed about eight times. Argento was not satisfied with any of the takes he had, which used a type of bicycle pump to spray fake blood from the \"wound\" across the white wall, so the director had Corridori place an explosive squib in the prosthetic arm – a solution which apparently satisfied Argento.\n\nMuch of \"Tenebrae\" takes place during daytime, or in harshly over-lit interiors. Except for the finale and some night scenes, the entire movie is shot with clear, cold light permeating the surroundings. The lighting and camerawork used in Andrzej Żuławski's \"Possession\" (1981) was an influence on the film's look. Although \"tenebr(a)e\" means \"darkness\" or \"shadows\" in Latin, Argento ordered cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to use as much bright light as possible. The director intended that the film be set in the near future and wanted the lighting to help create a \"cold, stark and semi-futuristic look\". Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the \"realistic manner of lighting\" used in television police shows. The director explained that he was adopting \"a modern style of photography, deliberately breaking with the legacy of German Expressionism. Today's light is the light of neon, headlights, and omnipresent flashes ... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and, more than that, reassuring.\" Argento filmed half-empty streets and shops where he could, in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city. Tovoli used Kodak 5247 film stock (125 ASA speed rating) for daylight scenes, and Kodak 5293 (250 ASA) for night shoots. Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled overexposure of the negative during filming, for the benefit of under-developing in the lab and less colour loss. The ultimate aim was for the images to be \"crystal clear\", and the night scenes to be awash with light.\n\nFilm scholar Richard Dyer highlights several intelligent devices used by Argento in the editing of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by \"shots of pills and the sound of running water.\" Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts in the latter part of the film are among cinema's \"most brutal and stylized\", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism. Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of \"Tenebrae\" make it as much an example of art cinema as anything else. The initial murders are shot in a \"clipped montage style\", which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene. Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.\n\n Gracey refers to the film's cinematography as \"nothing short of astounding\", and cites a particular example as highlighting Argento's \"passion for technical prowess and breathtaking visuals\". Influenced by the penultimate shot in Antonioni's \"The Passenger\" (1975), on which Tovoli had also been the cinematographer, one of \"Tenebrae\"s main setpieces is the murder of the lesbian couple. To introduce the scene, Argento and Tovoli employed the use of a Louma crane to film a several minutes-long tracking shot. Owing to its extreme length, the tracking shot ended up being the most difficult and complex part of the production to complete. It required a maze of scaffolding to be built around the outside of the home. Argento captured all the footage he needed in two takes, but insisted on filming ten more. The scene, which lasts for two-and-a-half minutes on-screen, took three days to shoot. It marked the first time the Louma crane had been used in an Italian production; the crane itself had to be imported from France. According to Gracey, the camera performs \"aerial gymnastics\", scaling the victims' house in \"one seamless take, navigating walls, roofs, and peering in through windows, in a set piece that effortlessly exposes the penetrability of a seemingly secure home\". Newman and Jones said that although this type of crane shot became commonplace later, at the time it was \"truly ground-breaking\" in the way the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up the building – not quite from the killer's viewpoint. Patrick McAllister of \"Scifilm\" said the sequence should be considered \"one of the most memorable moments in cinema\". According to McAllister, \"Tenebrae\"s distributor begged Argento to cut the shot down because it was \"meaningless\". Newman and Jones agreed that the shot added nothing to the film's plot, but called it \"meaninglessly brilliant\".\n\nSome European publicity materials for the film, including posters and lobby card sets, advertised the film as \"Tenebre\", and the 1999 Anchor Bay DVD release uses that same title. However, on the print itself, during the opening credits, the title is clearly \"Tenebrae\". In addition, the title of Neal's latest book in the film is shown in closeup as being \"Tenebrae\". In a lengthy interview with Argento conducted by Martin Coxhead that appeared in two issues of \"Fangoria\" in 1983 and 1984, the title was always referred to as \"Tenebrae\". Early on in production, the film was referred to as \"Under the Eyes of the Assassin\", which was later used as one of the poster taglines. In Japan, the film was released as \"Shadows\", and in the United States it was titled \"Unsane\" in its initial – heavily edited – incarnation.\n\nThe Italian rock band Goblin had provided the scores for two of Argento's previous films, \"Deep Red\" (1975) and \"Suspiria\" (1977), but the director had employed English composer Keith Emerson for his foray outside of the \"giallo\" subgenre, 1980's \"Inferno\". Goblin had disbanded that year, but in 1982 Argento asked three of the band's former members – Claudio Simonetti, Fabio Pignatelli and Massimo Morante – to work on \"Tenebrae\". Owing to their history together, Simonetti felt it appropriate that Argento's return to \"giallo\" films should utilize the core members of Goblin. The resulting synth-driven score was credited to \"Simonetti-Pignatelli-Morante\", as Goblin's former drummer owned the rights to use the band's name.\n\n\"Tenebrae\"s score is very different to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for \"Tenebrae\". Simonetti described the score as an electronica/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So it would not be difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3–4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Vocoder Plus and Minimoog synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the Oberheim DMX drum machine, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Roland MC-4 music sequencer. Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.\n\nWhile the soundtrack is not as well regarded as Goblin's earlier scores for \"Deep Red\", \"Suspiria\", or \"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978), Tim Lucas felt it \"... so fused to the fabric of the picture that \"Tenebrae\" might be termed ... a \"giallo musicale\"; that is, a \"giallo\" in which the soundtrack transcends mere accompaniment to occupy the same plane as the action and characters.\" Writers David Kerekes and David Slater were also favorable to the score; writing that the film \"bristles with arresting imagery and a cracking musical score from ex-members of Goblin\". Simonetti felt the score was good, but that it was only a \"medium\"-level success. However, it did enjoy a second wave of popularity being remixed in clubs. The album has had multiple reissues in numerous countries since its original release in 1982 on the Italian Cinevox label.\n\n\"Tenebrae\" had a wide theatrical release throughout Italy and mainland Europe, something the director very much needed after having suffered major distribution problems with his previous film, \"Inferno\". Released on 28 October 1982, \"Tenebrae\" saw modest success at the box office in Italy and Europe, but it did not perform as well as some of Argento's previous films. In Italy, \"Tenebrae\" had been released with a VM18 rating, meaning it could not be seen legally by persons under the age of eighteen. Argento had desired a VM14 rating, both to attract a younger audience and to increase the film's chances of commercial success. \"Tenebrae\" features scenes of female homosexuality; attitudes towards homosexuality in Italy were fairly conservative at the time, and Argento said he wanted to \"recount this subject freely and in an open manner, without interference or being ashamed\". The VM18 rating upset him, as he believed it was a result of the sexual diversity on display rather than the film's violence.\nOne of the film's most excessively violent scenes features the death of Neal's ex-wife, Jane (played by Veronica Lario). This scene was one which suffered the most from cuts when the film was first released in Italy. The original scene featured Jane's arm being cut off at the elbow; blood sprays from the wound onto white walls until the character falls to the floor. After a back-and-forth between Argento and Italian censors (at the time a panel of judges), the scene was first trimmed from showing an \"immense\" spray to a small one, then a smaller one still. The scene was cut to almost nothing in the 1990s, when Lario married future Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to Alan Jones, Berlusconi \"did not want the public seeing [Lario] so explicitly murdered, even if it was in a film by his country's premier horror expert\". For a few years, it was impossible to see the film in Italy legally, as prints were withdrawn altogether. A later DVD release did become available, with the scene restored.\n\nAveraging a murder every ten minutes, \"Tenebrae\" ranks as one of Argento's bloodiest films. In the United Kingdom, the film was shorn of five seconds of \"sexualized violence\" by the British Board of Film Classification prior to its theatrical release, on 19 May 1983. The advertising campaign for \"Tenebrae\" featured posters and a soundtrack sleeve depicting a woman with her throat cut, blood dripping from the wound. According to Jones, who worked for \"Tenebrae\"s distributor at the time, in the UK the posters had to be recalled after the London Underground refused to run them. New posters were issued that replaced the image of the wound and blood with a red ribbon. A similar change was made to the soundtrack sleeve.\n\nIn the United States the film remained unseen until 1984, when Bedford Entertainment briefly released a heavily edited version under the title \"Unsane\". It was approximately ten minutes shorter than the European release and was missing nearly all of the film's violence, which effectively rendered the numerous horror sequences incomprehensible. In addition, certain scenes that established the characters and their relationships were excised, making the film's narrative difficult to follow. This version of \"Tenebrae\" received nearly unanimously negative reviews.\n\n\"Tenebrae\" has been released on home media in many different versions in numerous territories. In 1983, when the VHS edition was released in the United Kingdom, it was short by about four seconds. However, the film soon found itself included in a list of thirty-nine so-called \"video nasties\" that were successfully prosecuted and banned from sale in UK video stores under the Video Recordings Act 1984. Deemed harmful to audiences, \"video nasties\" were strongly criticized for their violent content by the press, social commentators and various religious organizations. Speculating in 2011, Thomas Rostock said that the higher-than-usual murder count for an Argento film was partially responsible, while James Gracey believed it was perhaps \"the highly sexualized presentation of its violent content\". He went on to say, \"Of all the titles placed on the video nasty list, \"Tenebrae\" is perhaps the most misunderstood and undeserving of the grimy status it gained through its association with the whole debacle.\" Kim Newman agreed that \"Tenebrae\"s reputation as a \"video nasty\" was unwarranted, saying that none of the on-screen deaths are as gory or lingering as those in Argento's previous films. He also believed \"Tenebrae\" would eventually be remembered on its own merits, rather than as part of the \"video nasties\" list. Nevertheless, the ban lasted until 1999, when \"Tenebrae\" was legally released on videotape with one second of footage removed in addition to the previously censored five. In 2003, the BBFC reclassified the film and passed it without any cuts. In Germany, the release was strongly cut, and reportedly seized by the authorities.\n\nThe film has since been released on DVD in the US, mostly uncut save for approximately twenty seconds of extraneous material. \"Tenebrae\" received an initial DVD release in March 1999 from Anchor Bay Entertainment, with a re-release in May 2008. The Anchor Bay release, though presented as \"uncut\" was not the fully restored version of the film. A DVD German release by Raptor was also missing about one-and-a-half seconds of material. In June 2011, Arrow Films issued a special edition on DVD, but although the image quality was far better than in previous DVD releases, this version was \"heavily lambasted\" for carrying a transfer of the film that had visible noise and \"distorted audio\". In 2013, Arrow released a Blu-ray edition that corrected the audio and video problems. Additional corrections were made to the transfer and released by Synapse Films in 2016, as a steelbook edition limited to 3000 copies. The Arrow & Synapse DVD and Blu-ray releases are \"completely uncut\".\n\n\"Tenebrae\" has come to be considered one of Argento's best films by many fans and critics, with some calling it his last great film. AllMovie refers to the film as \"one of Dario Argento's best thrillers\". In her 1994 book on the director, \"Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento,\" Maitland McDonagh maintains that \"Tenebrae\" is \"in many respects ... the finest film that Argento has ever made.\" Richard Dyer, writing for the \"Directory of World Cinema: Italy\", describes the film as a \"tease\", one which is \"perhaps the apotheosis of one of the core pleasures of detective fiction: being outwitted, wrong-footed, led up the garden path\". Dyer believes that the degree of lighting used in the film is unsurpassed. Ed Gonzalez of \"Slant Magazine\" said that \"Tenebrae\" \"is a riveting defense of auteur theory, ripe with self-reflexive discourse and various moral conflicts. It's both a riveting horror film and an architect's worst nightmare.\" Keith Phipps of \"The A.V. Club\" noted \"... Argento makes some points about the intersection of art, reality, and personality, but the director's stunning trademark setpieces, presented here in a fully restored version, provide the real reason to watch.\" Almar Haflidason, in a review for BBC Online, opined, \"Sadistically beautiful and viciously exciting, welcome to true terror with Dario Argento's shockingly relentless \"Tenebrae\".\" Tim Lucas in \"Video Watchdog\" said, \"Though it is in some ways as artificial and deliberate as a De Palma thriller, \"Tenebrae\" contains more likeable characters, believable relationships, and more emphasis on the erotic than can be found in any other Argento film.\" Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict wrote, \"\"Tenebre\" is a straight-up \"giallo\" in the old-school tradition. It may have been filmed in 1982, but it comes straight out of the '70s tradition. We've got all the usual suspects, including a writer for a main character, lots of killer-cam point of view, some crazily over the top kills, and approximately seventy-two twists before all is revealed ... For fans of Argento's earlier \"giallo\", this is a must-see.\"\n\nNot all of the recent critical reaction to \"Tenebrae\" has been positive. Geoff Andrew of \"Time Out\" thought that the film was \"unpleasant even by contemporary horror standards\". John Kenneth Muir, author of \"Horror Films of the 1980s\", considers the film to be far inferior to \"Suspiria\", but acknowledges that it was so \"unremittingly gory\" that it justified its US title of \"Unsane\". John Wiley Martin, although evaluating the film as a \"technically mesmeric\" one, felt that thematically it was a \"disappointingly retrograde step\" for Argento. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com called it a \"gory but not particularly effective Argento horror flick\", while Dennis Schwartz of \"Ozus' World Movie Reviews\" dismissed it as \"trash\". Gary Johnson, editor of \"Images\", complained, \"Not much of \"Tenebre\" makes much sense. The plot becomes little more than an excuse for Argento to stage the murder sequences. And these are some of the bloodiest murders of Argento's career.\" In 2004, Tim Lucas re-evaluated the film and found that some of his earlier enthusiasm had dimmed considerably, noting that, \"\"Tenebre\" is beginning to suffer from the cheap 16 mm-like softness of Luciano Tovoli's cinematography, its sometimes over-storyboarded violence (the first two murders in particular look stilted), the many bewildering lapses in logic ... and the overdone performances of many of its female actors\".\n\nComing at the tail end of the \"giallo\" cycle, \"Tenebrae\" does not appear to have been as influential as Argento's earlier films. Douglas E. Winter, however, has commented that \"Tenebrae\"s Louma crane sequence has been stylistically influential, pointing to its use in Brian De Palma's \"The Untouchables\" (1987). In addition, towards the end of the film, with Neal supposedly dead, the camera faces Detective Giermani directly. When he stoops to pick up some evidence from the floor, Neal is revealed to be stood behind him, their silhouettes having perfectly matched in the shot. Alan Jones cited \"Tenebrae\" as the first film to use this specific type of camera blocking, and believes it to have been copied and referenced deliberately by later filmmakers. One such example, discussed as an unacknowledged \"steal\" from \"Tenebrae\", is De Palma's \"surprise reveal\" of John Lithgow standing behind a victim in \"Raising Cain\" (1992). Robert Zemeckis's \"What Lies Beneath\" (2000) also contains a similar moment, although Zemeckis has denied a familiarity with Italian movies.\n\nThe final death scene in \"Tenebrae\" – where Neal is accidentally impaled by a sculpture – is directly referenced in Kenneth Branagh's Hitchcockian murder mystery \"Dead Again\" (1991). Kim Newman maintains that Branagh's film imitates the sequence so entirely – with Derek Jacobi being pierced by the sculpture – that Branagh must have included the reference deliberately. The subsequent moment, where Nicolodi screams repeatedly in the rain, was cited by Asia Argento (Nicolodi's daughter with Dario Argento) as the moment that inspired her to become an actress.\n\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n"}
