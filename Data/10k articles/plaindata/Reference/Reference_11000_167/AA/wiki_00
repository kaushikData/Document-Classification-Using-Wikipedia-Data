{"id": "461203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=461203", "title": "Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography", "text": "Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography\n\nAppletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography is a six-volume collection of biographies of notable people involved in the history of the New World. Published between 1887 and 1889, its unsigned articles were widely accepted as authoritative for several decades. Later the encyclopedia became notorious for including dozens of biographies of people who had never existed. The apostrophe in the title is correctly placed and indicates that more than one person, i.e. a company, authored the work.\n\nThe \"Cyclopædia\" included the names of over 20,000 native and adopted citizens of the United States, including living persons. Also included were the names of several thousand citizens of all the other countries of North and South America. The aim was to embrace all noteworthy persons of the New World. The work also contained the names of nearly 1,000 people of foreign birth who were closely identified with American history. The \"Cyclopædia\" was illustrated with about sixty full-page portraits supplemented by some 1,500 smaller vignette portraits accompanied by facsimile autographs, and also several hundred views of birthplaces, residences, monuments, and tombs famous in history.\n\nNone of the articles are signed either with names or with initials. The clue to authorship is obtained, when obtained at all, through a list of contributors and their contributions arranged alphabetically as to contributors. One reviewer found this a rather inconvenient method, complaining that the finding of the author of a particular sketch often involved a voyage of discovery through the entire list. These lists are searched in vain, however, for the authors of many sketches, including the one of President Grover Cleveland.\n\n\"Appletons' Cyclopædia\" is notorious for including an estimated 200 biographies of fictitious persons.\nThe first to discover these fictions was John Hendley Barnhart, in 1919, who identified and reprinted, with commentary, 14 biographical sketches of supposed European botanists who had come to the New World to study in Latin America. By 1939, 47 fictitious biographies had been discovered, though only the letters H and V had been systematically investigated. The status of fictions in \"Appletons' Cyclopædia\" was assessed by Margaret Castle Schindler, of Goucher College, in 1937. According to Schindler\nThe writer (or writers) of these articles must have had some scientific training, for most of the creations were scientists, and sufficient linguistic knowledge to have invented or adapted titles in six languages. He was certainly familiar with the history and geography of South America. Most of the places visited by his characters are real places, and most of the historical events in which they participated are genuine. However, he sometimes made mistakes by which his fraudulent work can be detected.\n\nSome, such as Huet de Navarre, were about a real person but in most details were fictional.\nGeorge Zorn identifies the author of \"phantom Jesuit\" articles as William Christian Tenner, and identifies 42 fictitious subjects of this genre. Dobson suggests Hermann Ritter, who appears as the source of “Articles on South and Central Americans” beginning with volume 3, as a likely author of the fictitious articles. Dobson notes that the first two volumes, where Juan G. Puron appears in this role, are practically free of problem articles, although Barnhart identifies the article on “Dávila, Nepomuceno” as suspicious, but not fictitious beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n\nContributors to \"Appletons' Cyclopædia\" were free to suggest new subjects and were paid according to the length of the article. Articles were only checked for form by the editorial staff. While conceding that \"Appletons' Cyclopædia\" was a \"valuable and authoritative work,\" and that her results should not reflect on the many authentic articles, Schindler noted that articles on Latin American subjects should be used cautiously until verified against other sources.\n\n\"Appletons' Cyclopædia\" incorporated an earlier work by Francis Samuel Drake called \"Dictionary of American Biography\" (not to be confused with a more modern and comprehensive work of the same name). The original of this work was issued in 1872, and along with the original material, Drake's latest corrections, and all the materials that he had gathered for a new edition, were used in the \"Cyclopædia\". The original work had 10,000 biographies.\n\nThe first edition of the \"Cyclopædia\" was published between 1887 and 1889 by D. Appleton and Company of New York City. The general editors were James Grant Wilson and John Fiske; the managing editor from 1886 to 1888 was Rossiter Johnson. A seventh volume, containing an appendix and supplementary lists, and thematic indexes to the whole work, was issued in 1901.\n\nThe \"Cyclopædia\" was republished, uncorrected, by the Gale Research Company in 1968.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38751", "title": "ArXiv", "text": "ArXiv\n\narXiv (pronounced \"archive\") is a repository of electronic preprints (known as e-prints) approved for publication after moderation, that consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, electrical engineering, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv repository. Begun on August 14, 1991, arXiv.org passed the half-million-article milestone on October 3, 2008, and had hit a million by the end of 2014. By October 2016 the submission rate had grown to more than 10,000 per month.\n\narXiv was made possible by the low-bandwidth TeX file format, which allowed scientific papers to be easily transmitted over the Internet and rendered client-side. Around 1990, Joanne Cohn began emailing physics preprints to colleagues as TeX files, but the number of papers being sent soon filled mailboxes to capacity. Paul Ginsparg recognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a central repository mailbox stored at the Los Alamos National Laboratory which could be accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon added: FTP in 1991, Gopher in 1992, and the World Wide Web in 1993. The term e-print was quickly adopted to describe the articles.\n\nIt began as a physics archive, called the LANL preprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology and, most recently, statistics. Its original domain name was xxx.lanl.gov. Due to LANL's lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology, in 2001 Ginsparg changed institutions to Cornell University and changed the name of the repository to arXiv.org. It is now hosted principally by Cornell, with eight mirrors around the world.\n\nIts existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in scientific publishing known as open access. Mathematicians and scientists regularly upload their papers to arXiv.org for worldwide access and sometimes for reviews before they are published in peer-reviewed journals. Ginsparg was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.\n\nThe annual budget for arXiv is approximately $826,000 for 2013 to 2017, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, the Simons Foundation (in both gift and challenge grant forms) and annual fee income from member institutions. This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution. Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers from $1,000 to $4,400. Cornell's goal is to raise at least $504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions.\n\nIn September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development. Ginsparg was quoted in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" as saying it \"was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence\". However, Ginsparg remains on the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board and on the arXiv Physics Advisory Committee.\n\nAlthough arXiv is not peer reviewed, a collection of moderators for each area review the submissions; they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic, or reject submissions that are not scientific papers. The lists of moderators for many sections of arXiv are publicly available, but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.\n\nAdditionally, an \"endorsement\" system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines. Under the system, for categories that use it, an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area. New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all. However, the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry.\n\nA majority of the e-prints are also submitted to journals for publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal. A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture, including the Poincaré conjecture as a particular case, uploaded by Grigori Perelman in November 2002. Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: \"If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there let them go and read about it\". Despite this non-traditional method of publication, other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the Fields Medal and Clay Mathematics Millennium Prizes to Perelman, both of which he refused.\n\nPapers can be submitted in any of several formats, including LaTeX, and PDF printed from a word processor other than TeX or LaTeX. The submission is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large. arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.\n\nThe standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations. These include the University of California, Davis's \"front\", a web portal that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arXiv.org, and is referred to by some mathematicians as (the) Front. A similar function used to be offered by eprintweb.org, launched in September 2006 by the Institute of Physics, and was switched off on June 30, 2014. Carnegie Mellon provides Table, a search engine for tables extracted from arXiv publications. Google Scholar and Live Search Academic (now defunct) can also be used to search for items in arXiv. A full text and author search engine for arXiv is provided by Scientillion. Finally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or RSS feeds of all submissions in them.\n\nFiles on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses:\n\nWhile arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as Fermat's Last Theorem using only high-school mathematics, they are \"surprisingly rare\". arXiv generally re-classifies these works, e.g. in \"General mathematics\", rather than deleting them; however, some authors have voiced concern over the lack of transparency\nin the arXiv screening process.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "761349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=761349", "title": "Bulldog Drummond", "text": "Bulldog Drummond\n\nHugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond is a British fictional character, created by H. C. McNeile and published under his pen name \"Sapper\". Following McNeile's death in 1937, the novels were continued by Gerard Fairlie. Drummond is a World War I veteran who, fed up with his sedate lifestyle, advertises looking for excitement, and becomes a gentleman adventurer. The character has appeared in novels, short stories, on the stage, in films, on radio and television, and in graphic novels.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful one-off appearance as a policeman in \"The Strand Magazine\", the character was reworked by McNeile into a gentleman adventurer for his 1920 novel \"Bulldog Drummond\". McNeile went on to write ten Drummond novels, four short stories, four stage plays and a screenplay before his death in 1937. The stories were continued by his friend Gerard Fairlie between 1938 and 1954.\n\nDrummond is a First World War veteran, brutalised by his experiences in the trenches and bored with his post-war lifestyle. He publishes an advertisement looking for adventure, and soon finds himself embroiled in a series of exploits, many of which involve Carl Peterson—who becomes his nemesis—and Peterson's mistress, the femme fatale Irma. After his first adventure Drummond marries his client, Phyllis Benton; in later episodes she becomes involved in Drummond's exploits, often as the victim of kidnapping by Drummond's enemies.\n\nIn 1921 an adaptation of the first novel was staged in London, with Gerald du Maurier playing the role of Drummond; the play was further adapted and resulted in the 1922 silent film \"Bulldog Drummond\", with Carlyle Blackwell in the lead role. Several other Drummond films have followed, either based on McNeile's stories or with unique storylines.\n\nThe Bulldog Drummond stories of H. C. McNeile follow Captain Hugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond, DSO, MC. Drummond is a member of \"the Breed\", a class of Englishman who were patriotic, loyal and \"physically and morally intrepid\". Drummond is a wealthy gentleman, formerly an officer in the fictional \"Royal Loamshire Regiment\", who, after the First World War, spends his new-found leisure time looking for adventure. McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in \"The Strand Magazine\", but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel \"Bull-dog Drummond\", which was a thriller. The character was an amalgam of McNeile's friend Gerard Fairlie, and his idea of an English gentleman, although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie's claim to be a model for the character, noting that \"he was still at school when Sapper created his ... hero\". Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nDrummond's wartime experience had given him a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—\"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling\"—and the ability to incapacitate others—\"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second\". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.\n\nDrummond is characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an \"apparently brainless hunk of a man\", He is six feet tall, weighs around 14 stone, and has a \"cheerful type of ugliness which inspires immediate confidence in its owner\". Throughout his exploits, Drummond is joined by several of his ex-army friends and colleagues, including Algy Longworth (who would appear in many of the films, as Drummond's sidekick), MC; Toby Sinclair, VC; Peter Darrell and Ted Jerningham. Dummond's ex-batman from his military days, James Denny, runs Drummond's flat on Half-Moon Street in Mayfair, London, along with Mrs Denny. (Denny appeared as Drummond's sidekick in the radio series, a version of the character named \"Tenny\" appeared in the films) Drummond is a gentleman with a private income; he is also construed as \"a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact the war\", although the character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an \"unspeakable public school bully\".\n\nThe novel \"Bulldog Drummond\" begins when Drummond places an advertisement in a newspaper looking for adventure to lift the ennui of his life in post-war London. The response comes from Phyllis Benton, who is concerned for the health and well-being of her father, over whom Henry Lakington and Carl Peterson have a hold. At the end of the novel Drummond and Phyllis marry, and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books, in contrast to the films, which generally portray Drummond as unmarried. Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels: she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories, including \"The Black Gang\" and \"The Female of the Species\".\n\nIn the matter of his personal tastes, Drummond is a member of the fictional Junior Sports Club, a gentleman's club on St. James's Square, London. His preferred drink is beer although he also enjoys drinking martinis and is knowledgeable about wines. Drummond owns both a Rolls-Royce and a Bentley.\n\nAlthough Drummond's actions are intended to maintain the conservative status quo of Britain, academic Hans Bertens considers that instead, he comes across as \"a murderous exponent of a fierce competitive individualism\".\n\nThe first four books deal with Drummond against Carl Peterson, who becomes Drummond's arch-enemy. Peterson is also a master of disguise and uses several aliases. Peterson is killed in the fourth book, \"The Final Count\", although Fairlie brings him back for his final novel, \"The Return of the Black Gang\". Drummond forms a grudging respect for Peterson, and offers an honourable duel to the death at the end of \"The Third Round\", instead of the usual summary justice that normally befalls members of Peterson's gang. The writer Richard Usborne sees the mass-murdering terrorist Peterson as \"quite a sympathetic character. Almost, in fact, a hero\", and wrote that \"authors ... fall in love with their big villains ... Sapper came to love Carl Peterson dearly, and so did Drummond\".\n\nThe title of the fifth Bulldog Dummond book, \"The Female of the Species\" refers to Rudyard Kipling's line \"the female of the species is more deadly than the male\". Irma is described by Jonathon Green as \"the slinky epitome of a twenties 'vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, \"a true \"femme fatale\"\". After Carl Peterson's death in \"The Final Count\", Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife—whom he had met in \"Bulldog Drummond\"—with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie.\n\nAll were published through Hodder & Stoughton.\n\nDrummond has also appeared in other works. In 1983 Jack Smithers wrote the spoof \"Combined Forces\", and in 1990 Kim Newman—under the name Jack Yeovil—wrote the short story \"Pitbull Brittan\", which features Drummond.\n\nThese short stories are all by McNeile.\n\nMcNeile and Gerald du Maurier adapted the first novel, \"Bulldog Drummond\" for the stage, where it was shown at Wyndham's Theatre during the 1921–22 season. du Maurier played the title role in a run of 428 performances. Du Maurier again played the role on 8 November 1932 in a special charity performance at the Royal Adelphi Theatre attended by King George VI. The play also ran in New York during the same season, with A. E. Matthews as Drummond. McNeile also wrote \"The Way Out\", which was staged at the Comedy Theatre, London in January 1930 with Ian Hunter as Drummond. A third Drummond play, \"Bulldog Drummond Hits Out\", was co-written by McNeile and Fairlie. It went on a tour of the UK in 1937 with Henry Edwards as Drummond, and opened on 21 December 1937 at the Savoy Theatre, London, where it had a short run. Fairlie later turned the storyline into the novel \"Bulldog Drummond on Dartmoor\", published in 1938.\n\nIn 1974 the play \"Bullshot Crummond\", by Ron House, was staged with Alan Shearman as Crummond. The play was subsequently made into the 1983 film \"Bullshot\".\n\nIn 1933 Alfred Hitchcock was set to direct a Bulldog Drummond film with a screenplay by Charles Bennett entitled \"Bulldog Drummond's Baby\". The rights to the character of Drummond were then held by British International Pictures who would not sell the rights to use the character's for Bennett's screenplay. Bennett and Hitchcock turned the film into \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" without Drummond.\n\nA \"Bulldog Drummond\" radio series ran on the Mutual Broadcasting System from 13 April 1941 to 12 January 1949. An attempt was made at a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. Drummond was initially portrayed by George Coulouris, before being taken over by Santos Ortega and Ned Wever after 1942; Cedric Hardwicke took over in 1954.\n\nA 30-minute episode of \"Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents\" featured Drummond in \"The Ludlow Affair\", first broadcast on UK television on 16 December 1956. Drummond was played by Robert Beatty; he was aided by Kelly, played by Michael Ripper. A 1973 BBC documentary \"Omnibus\", \"The British Hero\", featured Christopher Cazenove playing Drummond, as well as a number of other such heroic characters, including Richard Hannay, Beau Geste and James Bond.\n\nDrummond has also appeared in two graphic novels. In 2004 Moonstone Books released a \"Bulldog Drummond\" comic book written by William Messner-Loebs and illustrated by Brett Barkley, while in \"\", written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin O'Neill, a thinly disguised, elderly version of Drummond, called \"Hugo Drummond\", is one of the three Secret Service agents tasked to hunt down the heroes of the piece.\n\nThe Drummond series proved popular with contemporary audiences, with \"Bulldog Drummond\" selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copy benchmark for \"best-sellers\". At his peak in the 1920s, McNeile was the highest-paid short-story writer in the world, and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around £10,000 a year; the \"Daily Mirror\" estimated that during his writing career he had earned £85,000.\n\nWhen reviewing \"Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back\" for \"The New York Times\", the critic observed that \"if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond\"; for the novel \"Bulldog Drummond at Bay\", the reviewer considered that \"as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate\". In the British market, \"The Times Literary Supplement\" also characterised McNeile as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.\n\nThroughout the Drummond stories, much of the language used by McNeile's characters relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by the academic Joan DelFattore to be \"intensely conservative by modern standards\"; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers, such as Agatha Christie, \"exhibit the inevitable xenophobia and anti-semitism of the period, McNeile's go far beyond the 'polite' norms\". J.D. Bourn considers his language to be \"rather distasteful\", while the academic Michael Denning observed that \"Drummond is a bundle of chauvinisms, hating Jews, Germans, and most other foreigners\". The academic Ion Trewin comments that for the readers of the 1920s and '30s, McNeile was seen at the time as \"simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen\".\n\nDrummond later became a model for other literary characters created in the 1940s and '50s: W. E. Johns used McNeile's work as a model for his character Biggles, while Ian Fleming stated that James Bond was \"Sapper from the waist up and Mickey Spillane below\".\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "100509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100509", "title": "Dymaxion house", "text": "Dymaxion house\n\nThe Dymaxion House was developed by inventor and architect Buckminster Fuller to address several perceived shortcomings with existing homebuilding techniques. Fuller designed several versions of the house at different times — all of them factory manufactured kits, assembled on site, intended to be suitable for any site or environment and to use resources efficiently. A key design consideration of the design was ease of shipment and assembly.\n\nAs he did when naming many of his inventions, Fuller combined the words dynamic, maximum, and tension to arrive at the term \"Dymaxion\".\n\nThe Dymaxion House was completed in 1930 after two years of development, and redesigned in 1945. Buckminster Fuller wanted to mass-produce a bathroom and a house. His first \"Dymaxion\" design was based on the design of a grain bin. During World War II, the U.S. Army commissioned Fuller to send these housing units to the Persian Gulf. In 1945, science-fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein placed an order for one to be delivered to Los Angeles, but the order was never filled.\n\nThe Siberian grain-silo house was the first system in which Fuller noted the \"urban dust dome\" effect: many installations have reported that a dome induces a local vertical heat-driven vortex that sucks cooler air downward into a dome, if the dome is vented properly - a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents. Fuller adapted the later units of the grain-silo house to use this effect.\n\nThe final design of the Dymaxion house used a central vertical stainless-steel strut on a single foundation. Structures similar to the spokes of a bicycle-wheel hung down from this supporting the roof, while beams radiating out supported the floor. Wedge-shaped fans of sheet metal aluminum formed the roof, ceiling and floor. Each structure was assembled at ground level and then winched up the strut. The Dymaxion house represented the first conscious effort to build an autonomous building in the 20th century.\n\nIt was a prototype proposed to use a packaging toilet, water storage and a convection-driven ventilator built into the roof. It was designed for the stormy areas of the world: temperate oceanic islands, and the Great Plains of North America, South America and Eurasia. In most modern houses, laundry, showers and commodes are the major water uses, with drinking, cooking and dish-washing consuming less than 20 liters per day. The Dymaxion house was intended to reduce water use by a greywater system, a packaging commode, and a \"fogger\" to replace showers. The fogger was based on efficient compressed-air and water degreasers, but with much smaller water particles to make it comfortable.\n\n Two Dymaxion houses were prototyped – one indoor (the \"Barwise\" house) and one outdoor (the \"Danbury\" house). No Dymaxion house built according to Fuller's intentions was ever constructed and lived in. The only two prototypes of the round, aluminum house were bought by investor William Graham, together with assorted unused prototyping elements as salvage after the venture failed. In 1948, Graham constructed a hybridized version of the Dymaxion House as his family's home; the Grahams lived there into the 1970s. Graham built the round house on his lake front property, disabling the ventilator and other interior features. It was inhabited for about 30 years, although as an extension to an existing ranch house, rather than a standalone structure as intended by Fuller. In 1990, the Graham family donated this house, and all the component prototyping parts, to The Henry Ford Museum. A painstaking process was used to conserve as many original component parts and systems as possible and restore the rest using original documentation from the Fuller prototyping process. It was installed indoors in the Henry Ford Museum in 2001 with a full exhibit.\n\nSince there was no evidence of the crucial internal rain-gutter system, some elements of the rain collecting system were omitted from the restored exhibit. The roof was designed to wick water inside and drip into the rain-gutter and then to the cistern, rather than have a difficult-to-fit, perfectly waterproof roof.\n\nThere was to be a waterless packaging toilet that deftly shrink-wrapped the waste for pickup for later composting. During the prototyping process, the idea for the packaging toilet was quickly replaced by a conventional septic system because the packaging plastic was not available. Other features worked as advertised, notably the heating, and the passive air conditioning system, based on the \"dome effect.\"\nThe inhabitants of the much-modified version of the house said that the bathroom\nwas a particular delight. The bathroom consisted of two connected stamped copper bubbles, built as four nesting pieces. The bottom piece is fully plated in tin/antimony alloy and the top half is painted. Each bubble had a drain. No area had a radius of less than four inches (10 cm), to aid cleaning. The commode, shower, bathtub and sink were molded into the structural shell in one piece. One bubble contained a step-up ergonomic bathtub and shower, high enough to wash children without stooping, but just two steps (16 inches / 40 cm) up. The oval tub had the controls mounted on the inside left of the entrance to the oval tub. The other bubble was the bathroom proper with commode and sink. The ventilation for the bathroom was a large silent fan under the main sink, which kept odors away from people's noses. All lighting was totally enclosed. To prevent fogging, the mirror faced into the medicine chest, which was ventilated by the fan. A plastic version of the bathroom was available intermittently until the 1980s.\n\nThe large wrap-around windows and lightweight structures were popular with the children, who crawled on the windowsill, and twanged the bicycle-wheel-style main struts.\n\nCriticisms of the Dymaxion Houses include its supposed inflexible design which completely disregarded local site and architectural idiom, and its use of energy-intensive materials such as aluminum, rather than low-energy materials, such as adobe or tile. Fuller chose aluminium for its light weight, great strength, and long-term durability, arguably factors that compensate for the initial production cost. Aluminum was also a logical choice if the homes were to be built in aircraft factories, which, since World War II had ended, had substantial excess capacity.\n\nThe Wichita House was a project Fuller accepted during World War II as an attempt to produce cost-effective dwellings for everyone. The project continued to develop the technological concept of the Dymaxion House, now incorporating a round floor plan instead of a hexagonal one. The reactions to the prototype were extraordinarily positive; nevertheless it was not produced industrially. Fuller, a consummate perfectionist, felt he could improve the design and was dissatisfied with the prototype. He refused to begin production rather than allowing the \"unfinished\" design to be used.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22063724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22063724", "title": "Epistulae (Pliny)", "text": "Epistulae (Pliny)\n\nThe Epistulae are a series of personal missives by Pliny the Younger directed to his friends and associates. These letters are a unique testimony of Roman administrative history and everyday life in the 1st century. The style is very different from that in the \"Panegyricus\", and some commentators maintain that Pliny initiated a new genre: the letter written for publication. This genre offers a different type of record than the more usual history; one that dispenses with objectivity but is no less valuable for it. Especially noteworthy among the letters are two in which he describes the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in August 79 during which his uncle Pliny the Elder died (\"Epistulae\" VI.16, VI.20), and one in which he asks the Emperor for instructions regarding official policy concerning Christians (\"Epistulae\" X.96). \nThe \"Epistulae\" are usually treated as two halves: those in Books 1 to 9, which Pliny prepared for publication, and those in Book 10, all of which were written to or by the Emperor Trajan during Pliny's governorship of Bithynia-Pontus. This final book was, significantly, not intended for publication.\nOther major literary figures of the late 1st century AD appear in the collection as friends or acquaintances of Pliny's, e. g. the poet Martial, the historian Tacitus and the biographer Suetonius. However, arguably the most famous literary figure to appear in Pliny's letters is his uncle. His nephew provides details of how his uncle worked tirelessly to finish his magnum opus, the \"Historia Naturalis\" (\"Natural History\"). Since Pliny the Younger was heir to his uncle's estate, he inherited his uncle's large library, and benefited from the acquisition.\n\nAs already mentioned above, highlights of these books include Pliny's description of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the death of his uncle and mentor, Pliny the Elder. The first letter (1.1), directed to Gaius Septicius Clarus, is also notable for giving Pliny's reasons for collecting his letters. Those that give details of Pliny's life at his country villas are important documents in the history of garden design. They are the world's oldest sources of the information on how gardens were used in the ancient world and the considerations that went into their design.\n\nThe content of this section of the letters evolves over time. Pliny's career as a young man is very fully described in the earlier letters, which include tributes to notable figures such as Marcus Valerius Martialis, Pliny's protégé (3.21). Advice is offered to friends, references are given, political support is discussed and Pliny comments on many other aspects of Roman life, using established literary style. However, by the last two books the subject matter is more contemplative.\n\nChronologically, it is suggested that Books 1 to 3 were written between 97 and 102, Books 4 to 7 were composed between 103 and 107 and Books 8 and 9 cover 108 and 109. These books were probably intermittently published between 99 and 109.\n\nIn his letter Pliny relates the first warning of the eruption:\n\nPliny then goes on to describe his uncle's failed attempt to study further the eruption and to save the lives of refugees, using the fleet under his command. Pliny's two letters regarding the eruption were written to the historian Tacitus, a close friend, who had requested from Pliny a detailed account of his uncle's death for inclusion in his own historical work.\n\nVulcanologist call the type of eruption that Pliny described \"Plinian\".\n\nThe letters of Book 10 are addressed to or from the Emperor Trajan in their entirety, and it is generally assumed that we have received them verbatim. As such, they offer a unique insight into the administrative functions of a Roman province of the time, as well as the machinations of the Roman system of patronage and wider cultural mores of Rome itself. In addition, the corruption and apathy that occurred at various levels of the provincial system can be seen clearly. The letters also contain the earliest external account of Christian worship, and reasons for the execution of Christians.\n\nThe letter regarding Christians deserves mention because its contents were, in the view of many historians, to become the standard policy toward Christians for the rest of the pagan era. Taken together, Pliny's letter and Trajan's response constituted a severe policy toward Christians. Although Christians were not to be sought out, they were to be executed if brought before a magistrate by a reputable means of accusation (no anonymous charges were permitted) and they were sometimes given the opportunity to recant.\n\nTrajan's replies to Pliny's queries and requests were also collected for publication, making the anthology even more valuable. The letters thus allow us a glimpse of the personalities of both Pliny and Trajan.\n\nThe \"editio princeps\" of the \"Epistulae\", edited by L. Carbo and published in Venice in 1471, was based on one of the manuscripts in the nine-book tradition. In May 1502, after five editions of Pliny's nine books had been published, Hieronymus Avantius of Verona brought out an incomplete and corrupt version of book 10, containing numerous errors and misspellings and omitting the first 26 letters. The first complete edition which included book 10 was prepared by Aldus Manutius, who used a surviving 5th-century manuscript found at the abbey of Saint-Victor (six leaves of which survives as the Pierpont Morgan Library manuscript M.462), and published in Venice in 1508. The best modern edition of the \"Epistulae\" is considered to be Sir Roger Mynors' Oxford edition, published in 1963.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25423712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25423712", "title": "Hekatompedon temple", "text": "Hekatompedon temple\n\nThe Hekatompedon or Hekatompedos (, from , \"hundred\", and πούς, \"foot\"), also known as \"Ur-Parthenon\" and \"H–Architektur\", was an ancient Greek temple on the Acropolis of Athens built from limestone in the Archaic period, and was placed in the position of the present Parthenon.\n\nThe name of the temple was found in inscriptions and means “100 feet long” (ca. 30 m), although its length reached 46 m.\n\nThe temple was built around 570–550 BC. It was demolished by the Athenians in 490 BC after the victory over the Persians at Marathon to build a larger temple known as the \"Older Parthenon\". The latter was destroyed in 480 BC by the returning Persians and finally replaced by the present Parthenon. The existence of the Hekatompedon is witnessed by historical documents. Its foundations have disappeared, but architectural and sculptural elements found in the southern part of the Mycenaean wall of Acropolis have been assigned by scholars to this temple.\n\nAs with many other archaeological findings on the Acropolis, the initial descriptions of Hekatompedon in the late 19th century were based only on architectural and sculptural fragments. In that context, Hekatompedon was known as \"H-Architektur\" in descriptions and cataloguing, next to other buildings such as \"A–\", \"B–Architektur\" etc.\n\nThe description of the temple as well as its presumed location have changed since the first descriptions by Wilhelm Dörpfeld. Dörpfeld had assigned all fragments to the neighbouring Old Temple of Athena that stood between the still standing Erechtheum and Parthenon. Theodor Wiegand hypothesized in 1904 that \"H–Architektur\" was a non-\"peripteros\" temple located on the site of the Old Temple of Athena, and was in fact an earlier stage of the Old Temple that was later expanded with a peristasis. Moreover, he identified \"H–Architektur\" as the \"Hekatompedon\" mentioned in ancient inscriptions. However, in 1922 Ernst Buschor proposed that \"H–Architektur\" was actually located south, on the site of the still standing Parthenon and named it \"Ur-Parthenon\", German for \"original Parthenon\". In 1936 Walter-Herwig Schuchhardt's extensive research on the surviving fragments and sculptures proved that the pediments of the temple must have been larger than earlier presumed. As a result, he reconstructed a \"peripteros\" temple instead of the previous reconstructions that included a distyle or tristyle \"in antis\" temple.\n\nFurther research by William Bell Dinsmoor, Immo Beyer, and others, as well as historical correlations between the surviving fragments and the destruction of the Acropolis by the Persians in 480 BC have lead to the current hypothesis that Hekatompedon was a hexastyle peripteral doric temple with a 46-metre long crepidoma and that was located on the site of Parthenon.\n\nOne of the pediments (perhaps the West pediment) contained \"two lions tearing apart a bull\" in the centre, \"Herakles fights against Triton\" on the left and the Three-Bodied (Triple-Bodied) Daemon with the symbols of the three elements of nature in his hands on the right. The three bodies of the winged monster hold a wave, a flame and a bird and have intertwined snake tails, symbolizing the four natural elements, i.e. water, fire, air and earth, respectively. It represents either Nereus or Typhon. Overall the meaning of the whole pediment is mysterious. Some scholars believe that it means the dominance of the human wisdom over humidity: the lions are earth animals, whereas the bull represent humidity. In addition, both Triton and Nereus were sea creatures defeated by Herakles on its way to the Hesperides garden, which earned him immortality.\nThe East pediment, also known as the Lioness pediment, contained in the centre \"two symmetrically placed lions killing a calf\" (only one has been recovered) and two \"snakes\" on the side corners. The meaning of this scene is again unknown. The lioness has both female (breast) and male (mane) details, probably arising from the lack of knowledge of the Greek artists on these animals, which no longer populated Greece in the 6th century BC.\nOther surviving sculptures include four horses and two panthers carved in relief, both from metopes of the temple, and a very fragmentary gorgon from the central acroteryon.\n\nThe style of the sculptures is typical of the early Archaic period. The overall narrative scenes of the pediments and metopes is half narrative, including human or semi-human figures, half animal, including animals placed in a symmetrical or repetitive fashion. This reminds of the illustrations of contemporary Greek pottery. Humans were characterized by the archaic smile. The human and animal bodies are carved with lack of confidence, compared to the sculptures of the temple of Athena Polias constructed in the Acropolis, half a century later.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4599312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4599312", "title": "Immigration", "text": "Immigration\n\nImmigration is the international movement of people into a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there, especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens, or to take up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker.\n\nAs for economic effects, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. Research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent. Development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction.\n\nThe academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the United States that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate. Research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first- and second-generation immigrants.\n\nResearch has found extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign born and minority populations in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media and politics in the United States and Europe.\n\nThe term \"immigration\" was coined in the 17th century, referring to non-warlike population movements between the emerging nation states. \n\nWhen people cross national borders during their migration, they are called migrants or immigrants (from Latin: \"migrare\", wanderer) from the perspective of the country which they enter. From the perspective of the country which they leave, they are called emigrant or outmigrant. Sociology designates immigration usually as migration (as well as emigration accordingly outward migration).\n\n, the number of international migrants has reached 244 million worldwide, which reflects a 41% increase since 2000. One third of the world's international migrants are living in just 20 countries. The largest number of international migrants live in the United States, with 19% of the world's total. Germany and Russia host 12 million migrants each, taking the second and third place in countries with the most migrants worldwide. Saudi Arabia hosts 10 million migrants, followed by the United Kingdom (9 million) and the United Arab Emirates (8 million).\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, Asia added more international migrants than any other major area in the world, gaining 26 million. Europe added the second largest with about 20 million. In most parts of the world, migration occurs between countries that are located within the same major area.\n\nIn 2015, the number of international migrants below the age of 20 reached 37 million, while 177 million are between the ages of 20 and 64. International migrants living in Africa were the youngest, with a median age of 29, followed by Asia (35 years), and Latin America/Caribbean (36 years), while migrants were older in Northern America (42 years), Europe (43 years), and Oceania (44 years).\n\nNearly half (43%) of all international migrants originate in Asia, and Europe was the birthplace of the second largest number of migrants (25%), followed by Latin America (15%). India has the largest diaspora in the world (16 million people), followed by Mexico (12 million) and Russia (11 million).\n\nA 2012 survey by Gallup found that given the opportunity, 640 million adults would migrate to another country, with 23% of these would-be immigrant choosing the United States as their desired future residence, while 7% of respondents, representing 45 million people, would choose the United Kingdom. The other top desired destination countries (those where an estimated 69 million or more adults would like to go) were Canada, France, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Germany and Spain.\n\nOne theory of immigration distinguishes between push and pull factors.\n\nPush factors refer primarily to the motive for immigration from the country of origin. In the case of economic migration (usually labor migration), differentials in wage rates are common. If the value of wages in the new country surpasses the value of wages in one's native country, he or she may choose to migrate, as long as the costs are not too high. Particularly in the 19th century, economic expansion of the US increased immigrant flow, and nearly 15% of the population was foreign born, thus making up a significant amount of the labor force.\n\nAs transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. Travel across the Atlantic used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days. When the opportunity cost is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher. Escape from poverty (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional push factor, and the availability of jobs is the related pull factor. Natural disasters can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. Research shows that for middle-income countries, higher temperatures increase emigration rates to urban areas and to other countries. For low-income countries, higher temperatures reduce emigration.\n\nEmigration and immigration are sometimes mandatory in a contract of employment: religious missionaries and employees of transnational corporations, international non-governmental organizations, and the diplomatic service expect, by definition, to work \"overseas\". They are often referred to as \"expatriates\", and their conditions of employment are typically equal to or better than those applying in the host country (for similar work).\n\nNon-economic push factors include persecution (religious and otherwise), frequent abuse, bullying, oppression, ethnic cleansing, genocide, risks to civilians during war, and social marginalization. Political motives traditionally motivate refugee flows; for instance, people may emigrate in order to escape a dictatorship.\n\nSome migration is for personal reasons, based on a relationship (e.g. to be with family or a partner), such as in family reunification or transnational marriage (especially in the instance of a gender imbalance). Recent research has found gender, age, and cross-cultural differences in the ownership of the idea to immigrate. In a few cases, an individual may wish to immigrate to a new country in a form of transferred patriotism. Evasion of criminal justice (e.g., avoiding arrest) is a personal motivation. This type of emigration and immigration is not normally legal, if a crime is internationally recognized, although criminals may disguise their identities or find other loopholes to evade detection. For example, there have been reports of war criminals disguising themselves as victims of war or conflict and then pursuing asylum in a different country.\n\nBarriers to immigration come not only in legal form or political form; natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful. Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar: their family, friends, support network, and culture. They also need to liquidate their assets, and they incur the expense of moving. When they arrive in a new country, this is often with many uncertainties including finding work, where to live, new laws, new cultural norms, language or accent issues, possible racism, and other exclusionary behavior towards them and their family.\n\nThe politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other issues, such as national security and terrorism, especially in western Europe, with the presence of Islam as a new major religion. Those with security concerns cite the 2005 French riots and point to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy as examples of the value conflicts arising from immigration of Muslims in Western Europe. Because of all these associations, immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations.\n\nStudies have suggested that some special interest groups lobby for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when impacting other groups. A 2010 European study suggested that \"employers are more likely to be pro-immigration than employees, provided that immigrants are thought to compete with employees who are already in the country. Or else, when immigrants are thought to compete with employers rather than employees, employers are more likely to be anti-immigration than employees.\" A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that \"representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts.\"\n\nAnother contributing factor may be lobbying by earlier immigrants. The Chairman for the US Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform—which lobby for more permissive rules for immigrants, as well as special arrangements just for Irish people—has stated that \"the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get—'as will every other ethnic group in the country.\n\nImmigrants are motivated to leave their former countries of citizenship, or habitual residence, for a variety of reasons, including a lack of local access to resources, a desire for economic prosperity, to find or engage in paid work, to better their standard of living, family reunification, retirement, climate or environmentally induced migration, exile, escape from prejudice, conflict or natural disaster, or simply the wish to change one's quality of life. Commuters, tourists and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition of immigration or migration, seasonal labour immigration is sometimes included.\n\nThe term economic migrant refers to someone who has travelled from one region to another region for the purposes of seeking employment and an improvement in quality of life and access to resources. An economic migrant is distinct from someone who is a refugee fleeing persecution.\n\nMany countries have immigration and visa restrictions that prohibit a person entering the country for the purposes of gaining work without a valid work visa. As a violation of a State's immigration laws a person who is declared to be an economic migrant can be refused entry into a country.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that remittances totaled $420 billion in 2009, of which $317 billion went to developing countries.\n\nTreatment of migrants in host countries, both by governments, employers, and original population, is a topic of continual debate and criticism, and the violation of migrant human rights is an ongoing crisis. The United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, has been ratified by 48 states, most of which are heavy exporters of cheap labor. Major migrant-receiving countries and regions – including Western Europe, North America, Pacific Asia, Australia, and the Gulf States – have not ratified the Convention, even though they are host to the majority of international migrant workers. Although freedom of movement is often recognized as a civil right in many documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the freedom only applies to movement within national borders and the ability to return to one's home state.\n\nSome proponents of immigration argue that the freedom of movement both within and between countries is a basic human right, and that the restrictive immigration policies, typical of nation-states, violate this human right of freedom of movement. Such arguments are common among anti-state ideologies like anarchism and libertarianism. As philosopher and Open borders activist Jacob Appel has written, \"Treating human beings differently, simply because they were born on the opposite side of a national boundary, is hard to justify under any mainstream philosophical, religious or ethical theory.\"\n\nWhere immigration is permitted, it is typically selective. , family reunification accounted for approximately two-thirds of legal immigration to the US every year. Ethnic selection, such as the White Australia policy, has generally disappeared, but priority is usually given to the educated, skilled, and wealthy. Less privileged individuals, including the mass of poor people in low-income countries, cannot avail themselves of the legal and protected immigration opportunities offered by wealthy states. This inequality has also been criticized as conflicting with the principle of equal opportunities. The fact that the door is closed for the unskilled, while at the same time many developed countries have a huge demand for unskilled labor, is a major factor in illegal immigration. The contradictory nature of this policy—which specifically disadvantages the unskilled immigrants while exploiting their labor—has also been criticized on ethical grounds.\n\nImmigration policies which selectively grant freedom of movement to targeted individuals are intended to produce a net economic gain for the host country. They can also mean net loss for a poor donor country through the loss of the educated minority—a \"brain drain\". This can exacerbate the global inequality in standards of living that provided the motivation for the individual to migrate in the first place. One example of competition for skilled labour is active recruitment of health workers from developing countries by developed countries. There may however also be a \"brain gain\" to emigration, as migration opportunities lead to greater investments in education in developing countries. Overall, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries.\n\nA survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the view that high-skilled immigration makes the average American better off. A survey of the same economists also shows support behind the notion that low-skilled immigration, while creating winners and losers, makes the average American better off. A survey of European economists shows a consensus that freer movement of people to live and work across borders within Europe makes the average European better off, and strong support behind the notion that it has not made low-skilled Europeans worse off. According to David Card, Christian Dustmann, and Ian Preston, \"most existing studies of the economic impacts of immigration suggest these impacts are small, and on average benefit the native population\". In a survey of the existing literature, Örn B Bodvarsson and Hendrik Van den Berg write, \"a comparison of the evidence from all the studies... makes it clear that, with very few exceptions, there is no strong statistical support for the view held by many members of the public, mainly that immigration has an adverse effect on native-born workers in the destination country.\"\n\nWhereas the impact on the average native tends to be small and positive, studies show more mixed results for low-skilled natives, but whether the effects are positive or negative, they tend to be small either way. Immigrants may often do types of work that natives are largely unwilling to do, contributing to greater economic prosperity for the economy as a whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity. Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment. According to a 2017 survey of the existing economic literature, studies on high-skilled migrants \"rarely find adverse wage and employment consequences, and longer time horizons tend to show greater gains\".\n\nCompetition from immigrants in a particular profession may aggravate underemployment in that profession, but increase wages for other natives; for instance, a 2017 study in \"Science\" found that \"the influx of foreign-born computer scientists since the early 1990s... increased the size of the US IT sector... benefited consumers via lower prices and more efficient products... raised overall worker incomes by 0.2 to 0.3% but decreased wages of U.S. computer scientists by 2.6 to 5.1%.\" \n\nResearch also suggests that diversity and immigration have a net positive effect on productivity and economic prosperity. Immigration has also been associated with reductions in offshoring. A study by Harvard economist Nathan Nunn, Yale economist Nancy Qian and LSE economist Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1920) contributed to \"higher incomes, higher productivity, more innovation, and more industrialization\" in the short-run and \"higher incomes, less poverty, less unemployment, higher rates of urbanization, and greater educational attainment\" in the long-run for the United States. Research also shows that migration to Latin America during the Age of Mass Migration had a positive impact on long-run economic development.\n\nStudies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world GDP, with estimates of gains ranging between 67–147.3% in the scenarios where billions of workers move from developing to developed countries. Research also finds that migration leads to greater trade in goods and services, and increases in financial flows between the sending and receiving countries. Using 130 years of data on historical migrations to the United States, one study finds \"that a doubling of the number of residents with ancestry from a given foreign country relative to the mean increases by 4.2 percentage points the probability that at least one local firm invests in that country, and increases by 31% the number of employees at domestic recipients of FDI from that country. The size of these effects increases with the ethnic diversity of the local population, the geographic distance to the origin country, and the ethno-linguistic fractionalization of the origin country.\" A 2017 study found that \"immigrants' genetic diversity is significantly positively correlated with measures of U.S. counties' economic development [during the Age of Mass Migration]. There exists also a significant positive relationship between immigrants' genetic diversity in 1870 and contemporaneous measures of U.S. counties' average income.\"\n\nSome research suggests that immigration can offset some of the adverse effects of automation on native labor outcomes. By increasing overall demand, immigrants could push natives out of low-skilled manual labor into better paying occupations. A 2018 study in the \"American Economic Review\" found that the Bracero program (which allowed almost half a million Mexican workers to do seasonal farm labor in the United States) did not have any adverse impact on the labor market outcomes of American-born farm workers.\n\nA 2016 paper by University of Southern Denmark and University of Copenhagen economists found that the 1924 immigration restrictions enacted in the United States impaired the economy.\n\nOverall immigration has not had much effect on native wage inequality but low-skill immigration has been linked to greater income inequality in the native population. Greater openness to low-skilled immigration in wealthy countries would drastically reduce global income inequality.\n\nA 2011 literature review of the economic impacts of immigration found that the net fiscal impact of migrants varies across studies but that the most credible analyses typically find small and positive fiscal effects on average. According to the authors, \"the net social impact of an immigrant over his or her lifetime depends substantially and in predictable ways on the immigrant's age at arrival, education, reason for migration, and similar\". According to a 2007 literature review by the Congressional Budget Office, \"Over the past two decades, most efforts to estimate the fiscal impact of immigration in the United States have concluded that, in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use.\"\n\nA 2018 study found that inflows of asylum seekers into Western Europe from 1985 to 2015 had a net positive fiscal impact. Research has shown that EU immigrants made a net positive fiscal contribution to Denmark and the United Kingdom. A 2017 study found that when Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants to the United Kingdom gained permission to acquire welfare benefits in 2014 that it had no discernible impact on the immigrants' use of welfare benefits. A paper by a group of French economists found that over the period 1980-2015, \"international migration had a positive impact on the economic and fiscal performance of OECD countries.\"\n\nA 2017 survey of leading economists found that 34% of economists agreed with the statement \"The influx of refugees into Germany beginning in the summer of 2015 will generate net economic benefits for German citizens over the succeeding decade\", whereas 38% were uncertain and 6% disagreed. Studies of refugees' impact on native welfare are scant but the existing literature shows mixed results (negative, positive and no significant effects on native welfare). According to economist Michael Clemens, \"when economists have studied past influxes of refugees and migrants they have found the labor market effects, while varied, are very limited, and can in fact be positive.\" A 2018 study in the \"Economic Journal\" found that Vietnamese refugees to the United States had a positive impact on American exports, as exports to Vietnam grew most in US states with larger Vietnamese populations. A 2018 study in the journal \"Science Advances\" found that asylum seekers entering Western Europe in the period 1985-2015 had a positive macroeconomic and fiscal impact.\n\nA 2017 paper by Evans and Fitzgerald found that refugees to the United States pay \"$21,000 more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their first 20 years in the U.S.\" An internal study by the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration, which was suppressed and not shown to the public, found that refugees to the United States brought in $63 billion more in government revenues than they cost the government. According to University of California, Davis, labor economist Giovanni Peri, the existing literature suggests that there are no economic reasons why the American labor market could not easily absorb 100,000 Syrian refugees in a year. A 2017 paper looking at the long-term impact of refugees on the American labor market over the period 1980–2010 found \"that there is no adverse long-run impact of refugees on the U.S. labor market.\"\n\nRefugees integrate more slowly into host countries' labor markets than labor migrants, in part due to the loss and depreciation of human capital and credentials during the asylum procedure. Refugees tend to do worse in economic terms than natives, even when they have the same skills and language proficiencies of natives. For instance, a 2013 study of Germans in West-Germany who had been displaced from Eastern Europe during and after World War II showed that the forced German migrants did far worse economically than their native West-German counterparts decades later. Second-generation forced German migrants also did worse in economic terms than their native counterparts. A study of refugees to the United States found that \"refugees that enter the U.S. before age 14 graduate high school and enter college at the same rate as natives. Refugees that enter as older teenagers have lower attainment with much of the difference attributable to language barriers and because many in this group are not accompanied by a parent to the U.S.\" Refugees that entered the U.S. at ages 18–45, have \"much lower levels of education and poorer language skills than natives and outcomes are initially poor with low employment, high welfare use and low earnings.\" But the authors of the study find that \"outcomes improve considerably as refugees age.\"\n\nA 2017 study found that the 0.5 million Portuguese who returned to Portugal from Mozambique and Angola in the mid-1970s lowered labor productivity and wages. A 2018 paper found that the areas in Greece that took on a larger share of Greek Orthodox refugees from the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 \"have today higher earnings, higher levels of household wealth, greater educational attainment, as well as larger financial and manufacturing sectors.\"\n\nResearch on the economic effects of undocumented immigrants is scant but existing studies suggests that the effects are positive for the native population, and public coffers. A 2015 study shows that \"increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens low-skilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low-skilled workers. Legalization, instead, decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and increases income per native.\" Studies show that legalization of undocumented immigrants would boost the U.S. economy; a 2013 study found that granting legal status to undocumented immigrants would raise their incomes by a quarter (increasing U.S. GDP by approximately $1.4 trillion over a ten-year period), and a 2016 study found that \"legalization would increase the economic contribution of the unauthorized population by about 20%, to 3.6% of private-sector GDP.\" A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that undocumented immigrants to the United States \"generate higher surplus for US firms relative to natives, hence restricting their entry has a depressing effect on job creation and, in turn, on native labor markets.\"\n\nA 2017 study in the \"Journal of Public Economics\" found that more intense immigration enforcement increased the likelihood that US-born children with undocumented immigrant parents would live in poverty.\n\nA paper by Spanish economists found that upon legalizing the undocumented immigrant population in Spain, the fiscal revenues increased by around €4,189 per newly legalized immigrant. The paper found that the wages of the newly legalized immigrants increased after legalization, some low-skilled natives had worse labor market outcomes and high-skilled natives had improved labor market outcomes.\n\nA 2018 study found no evidence that apprehensions of undocumented immigrants in districts in the United States improved the labor market outcomes for American natives.\n\nResearch suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. According to one study, welfare increases in both types of countries: \"welfare impact of observed levels of migration is substantial, at about 5% to 10% for the main receiving countries and about 10% in countries with large incoming remittances\". According to Branko Milanović, country of residency is by far the most important determinant of global income inequality, which suggests that the reduction in labor barriers would significantly reduce global income inequality. A study of equivalent workers in the United States and 42 developing countries found that \"median wage gap for a male, unskilled (9 years of schooling), 35 year-old, urban formal sector worker born and educated in a developing country is P$15,400 per year at purchasing power parity\". A 2014 survey of the existing literature on emigration finds that a 10 percent emigrant supply shock would increase wages in the sending country by 2–5.5%.\n\nAccording to economists Michael Clemens and Lant Pratchett, \"permitting people to move from low-productivity places to high-productivity places appears to be by far the most efficient generalized policy tool, at the margin, for poverty reduction\". A successful two-year in situ anti-poverty program, for instance, helps poor people make in a year what is the equivalent of working one day in the developed world. A slight reduction in the barriers to labor mobility between the developing and developed world would do more to reduce poverty in the developing world than any remaining trade liberalization.\n\nResearch on a migration lottery allowing Tongans to move to New Zealand found that the lottery winners saw a 263% increase in income from migrating (after only one year in New Zealand) relative to the unsuccessful lottery entrants. A longer-term study on the Tongan lottery winners finds that they \"continue to earn almost 300 percent more than non-migrants, have better mental health, live in households with more than 250 percent higher expenditure, own more vehicles, and have more durable assets\". A conservative estimate of their lifetime gain to migration is NZ$315,000 in net present value terms (approximately US$237,000).\n\nA 2017 study of Mexican immigrant households in the United States found that by virtue of moving to the United States, the households increase their incomes more than fivefold immediately. The study also found that the \"average gains accruing to migrants surpass those of even the most successful current programs of economic development.\"\n\nA 2017 study of European migrant workers in the UK shows that upon accession to the EU, the migrant workers see a substantial positive impact on their earnings. The data indicate that acquiring EU status raises earnings for the workers by giving them the right to freely change jobs.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" found that immigrants from middle- and low-income countries to the United States increased their wages by a factor of two to three upon migration.\n\nA 2017 survey of the existing economic literature found that \"high-skilled migrants boost innovation and productivity outcomes.\" According to a 2013 survey of the existing economic literature, \"much of the existing research points towards positive net contributions by immigrant entrepreneurs.\" Areas where immigrant are more prevalent in the United States have substantially more innovation (as measured by patenting and citations). Immigrants to the United States create businesses at higher rates than natives. A 2010 study showed \"that a 1 percentage point increase in immigrant college graduates' population share increases patents per capita by 9–18 percent.\" Mass migration can also boost innovation and growth, as shown by the Jewish, Huguenot and Bohemian diasporas in Berlin and Prussia, German Jewish Émigrés in the US, the Mariel boatlift, the exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s, European migration to Argentina during the Age of Mass Migration (1850–1914), west-east migration in the wake of German reunification, and Polish immigration to Germany after joining the EU. A 2018 study in the \"Economic Journal\" found that \"that a 10% increase in immigration from exporters of a given product is associated with a 2% increase in the likelihood that the host country starts exporting that good ‘from scratch’ in the next decade.\"\n\nImmigrants have been linked to greater invention and innovation in the US. According to one report, \"immigrants have started more than half (44 of 87) of America's startup companies valued at $1 billion dollars or more and are key members of management or product development teams in over 70 percent (62 of 87) of these companies.\" Research also shows that labor migration increases human capital. Foreign doctoral students are a major source of innovation in the American economy. In the United States, immigrant workers hold a disproportionate share of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM): \"In 2013, foreign-born workers accounted for 19.2 percent of STEM workers with a bachelor's degree, 40.7 percent of those with a master's degree, and more than half—54.5 percent—of those with a Ph.D.\"\n\nA 2015 study finds \"some evidence that larger immigrant population shares (or inflows) yield positive impacts on institutional quality. At a minimum, our results indicate that no negative impact on economic freedom is associated with more immigration.\" Another study, looking at the increase in Israel's population in the 1990s due to the unrestricted immigration of Jews from the Soviet Union, finds that the mass immigration did not undermine political institutions, and substantially increased the quality of economic institutions. A 2017 study in the \"British Journal of Political Science\" argued that the British American colonies without slavery adopted better democratic institutions in order to attract migrant workers to their colonies. A 2018 study fails to find evidence that immigration to the United States weakens economic freedom.\n\nSome research has found that as immigration and ethnic heterogeneity increase, government funding of welfare and public support for welfare decrease. Ethnic nepotism may be an explanation for this phenomenon. Other possible explanations include theories regarding in-group and out-group effects and reciprocal altruism.\n\nResearch however also challenges the notion that ethnic heterogeneity reduces public goods provision. Studies that find a negative relationship between ethnic diversity and public goods provision often fail to take into account that strong states were better at assimilating minorities, thus decreasing diversity in the long run. Ethnically diverse states today consequently tend to be weaker states. Because most of the evidence on fractionalization comes from sub-Saharan Africa and the United States, the generalizability of the findings is questionable. A 2018 study in the \"American Political Science Review\" cast doubts on findings that ethnoracial homogeneity led to greater public goods provision.\n\nResearch finds that Americans' attitudes towards immigration influence their attitudes towards welfare spending.\n\nA 2016 study found that immigration in the period 1940–2010 in the United States increased the high school completion of natives: \"An increase of one percentage point in the share of immigrants in the population aged 11–64 increases the probability that natives aged 11–17 eventually complete 12 years of schooling by 0.3 percentage point.\"\n\nStudies have found that non-native speakers of English in the UK have no causal impact on the performance of other pupils, immigrant children have no significant impact on the test scores of Dutch children, no effect on grade repetition among native students exposed to migrant students in Austrian schools, that the presence of Latin American children in schools had no significant negative effects on peers, but that students with limited English skills had slight negative effects on peers, and that the influx of Haitians to Florida public schools after the 2010 Haiti earthquake had no effects on the educational outcomes of incumbent students.\n\nA 2018 study found that the \"presence of immigrant students who have been in the country for some time is found to have no effect on natives. However, a small negative effect of recent immigrants on natives’ language scores is reported.\"\n\nA 2018 study in the \"American Sociological Review\" found that within racial groups, most immigrants to the United States had fully assimilated within a span of 20 years. Immigrants arriving in the United States after 1994 assimilate more rapidly than immigrants who arrived in previous periods. Measuring assimilation can be difficult due to \"ethnic attrition\", which refers to when ancestors of migrants cease to self-identify with the nationality or ethnicity of their ancestors. This means that successful cases of assimilation will be underestimated. Research shows that ethnic attrition is sizable in Hispanic and Asian immigrant groups in the United States. By taking account of ethnic attrition, the assimilation rate of Hispanics in the United States improves significantly. A 2016 paper challenges the view that cultural differences are necessarily an obstacle to long-run economic performance of migrants. It finds that \"first generation migrants seem to be less likely to success the more culturally distant they are, but this effect vanishes as time spent in the US increases.\"\n\nA 2018 study found that Chines nationals in the United States who received permanent residency permits from the US government amid the Tianamen Square protests (and subsequent Chines government clampdown) experienced significant employment and earnings gains relative to similar immigrant groups who did not have the same residency rights.\n\nDuring the Age of Mass Migration, infant arrivals to the United States had greater economic success over their lifetime than teenage arrivals.\n\nA 2015 report by the National Institute of Demographic Studies finds that an overwhelming majority of second-generation immigrants of all origins in France feel French, despite the persistent discrimination in education, housing and employment that many of the minorities face.\n\nResearch shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation but that there is considerable assimilation overall. Research finds that first generation immigrants from countries with less egalitarian gender cultures adopt gender values more similar to natives over time. According to one study, \"this acculturation process is almost completed within one generational succession: The gender attitudes of second generation immigrants are difficult to distinguish from the attitudes of members of mainstream society. This holds also for children born to immigrants from very gender traditional cultures and for children born to less well integrated immigrant families.\" Similar results are found on a study of Turkish migrants to Western Europe. The assimilation on gender attitudes has been observed in education, as one study finds \"that the female advantage in education observed among the majority population is usually present among second-generation immigrants.\"\n\nA 2017 study of Switzerland found that naturalization strongly improves long-term social integration of immigrants: \"The integration returns to naturalization are larger for more marginalized immigrant groups and when naturalization occurs earlier, rather than later in the residency period.\"\n\nFirst-generation immigrants tend to hold less accepting views of homosexual lifestyles but opposition weakens with longer stays. Second-generation immigrants are overall more accepting of homosexual lifestyles, but the acculturation effect is weaker for Muslims and to some extent, Eastern Orthodox migrants.\n\nA study of Bangladeshi migrants in East London found they shifted towards the thinking styles of the wider non-migrant population in just a single generation.\n\nA study on Germany found that foreign-born parents are more likely to integrate if their children are entitled to German citizenship at birth. A 2017 study found that \"faster access to citizenship improves the economic situation of immigrant women, especially their labour market attachment with higher employment rates, longer working hours and more stable jobs. Immigrants also invest more in host country-specific skills like language and vocational training. Faster access to citizenship seems a powerful policy instrument to boost economic integration in countries with traditionally restrictive citizenship policies.\" Naturalization is associated with large and persistent wage gains for the naturalized citizens in most countries. One study of Denmark found that providing immigrants with voting rights reduced their crime rate.\n\nStudies on programs that randomly allocate refugee immigrants across municipalities find that the assignment of neighborhood impacts immigrant crime propensity, education and earnings.\n\nResearch suggests that bilingual schooling reduces barriers between speakers from two different communities.\n\nResearch suggests that a vicious cycle of bigotry and isolation could reduce assimilation and increase bigotry towards immigrants in the long-term. For instance, University of California, San Diego political scientist Claire Adida, Stanford University political scientist David Laitin and Sorbonne University economist Marie-Anne Valfort argue \"fear-based policies that target groups of people according to their religion or region of origin are counter-productive. Our own research, which explains the failed integration of Muslim immigrants in France, suggests that such policies can feed into a vicious cycle that damages national security. French Islamophobia—a response to cultural difference—has encouraged Muslim immigrants to withdraw from French society, which then feeds back into French Islamophobia, thus further exacerbating Muslims’ alienation, and so on. Indeed, the failure of French security in 2015 was likely due to police tactics that intimidated rather than welcomed the children of immigrants—an approach that makes it hard to obtain crucial information from community members about potential threats.\"\n\nA study which examined Catalan nationalism examined the Catalan Government's policy towards the integration of immigrants during the start of the 1990s. At this time the Spanish region of Catalonia was experiencing a large influx in the number of immigrants from Northern Africa , Latin America and Asia.The Spanish government paid little attention to this influx of immigrants. However, Catalan politicians began discussing how the increase in immigrants would effect Catalan identity. Members of the Catalan parliament petitioned for a plan to integrate these immigrants into Catalan society. Crucially , the plan did not include policies regarding naturalisation , which were key immigration policies of the Spanish government.The plan of the Catalan parliament aimed to create a shared Catalan identity which included both the native Catalan population and immigrant communities. This meant that immigrants were encouraged to relate as part of the Catalan community but also encouraged to retain their own culture and traditions. In this way assimilation of immigrant cultures in Catalonia was avoided.\n\nA 2018 study in the \"British Journal of Political Science\" found that immigrants in Norway became more politically engaged the earlier that they were given voting rights.\n\nThere is some research that suggests that immigration adversely affects social capital. One study, for instance, found that \"larger increases in US states' Mexican population shares correspond to larger decreases in social capital over the period\" 1986–2004. A 2017 study in the \"Journal of Comparative Economics\" found that \"individuals whose ancestors migrated from countries with higher autocracy levels are less likely to trust others and to vote in presidential elections in the U.S. The impact of autocratic culture on trust can last for at least three generations while the impact on voting disappears after one generation. These impacts on trust and voting are also significant across Europe.\"\n\nResearch suggests that immigration has positive effects on native workers' health. As immigration rises, native workers are pushed into less demanding jobs, which improves native workers' health outcomes.\n\nA 2018 study found that immigration to the United Kingdom \"reduced waiting times for outpatient referrals and did not have significant effects on waiting times in accident and emergency departments (A&E) and elective care.\" The study also found \"evidence that immigration increased waiting times for outpatient referrals in more deprived areas outside of London\" but that this increase disappears after 3 to 4 years.\n\nA 2014 study of the United Kingdom found that immigration generally reduced house prices, because natives at the top of the wage distribution respond to immigration by moving to other areas, reducing demand for housing.\n\nMuch of the empirical research on the causal relationship between immigration and crime has been limited due to weak instruments for determining causality. According to one economist writing in 2014, \"while there have been many papers that document various correlations between immigrants and crime for a range of countries and time periods, most do not seriously address the issue of causality.\" The problem with causality primarily revolves around the location of immigrants being endogenous, which means that immigrants tend to disproportionally locate in deprived areas where crime is higher (because they cannot afford to stay in more expensive areas) or because they tend to locate in areas where there is a large population of residents of the same ethnic background. A burgeoning literature relying on strong instruments provides mixed findings. As one economist describes the existing literature in 2014, \"most research for the US indicates that if any, this association is negative... while the results for Europe are mixed for property crime but no association is found for violent crime\". Another economist writing in 2014, describes how \"the evidence, based on empirical studies of many countries, indicates that there is no simple link between immigration and crime, but legalizing the status of immigrants has beneficial effects on crime rates.\"\n\nThe relationship between crime and the legal status of immigrants remains understudied but studies on amnesty programs in the United States and Italy suggest that legal status can largely explain the differences in crime between legal and illegal immigrants, most likely because legal status leads to greater job market opportunities for the immigrants. However, one study finds that the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 led to an increase in crime among previously undocumented immigrants.\n\nA 2018 study found no evidence that apprehensions of undocumented immigrants in districts in the United States reduced crime rates.\n\nResearch suggests that police practices, such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas populated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately high numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects in Sweden, Italy, and England and Wales. Research also suggests that there may be possible discrimination by the judicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions for racial minorities in Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Denmark and France. A 2018 study found that the Dutch are less likely to reciprocate in games played with immigrants than the native Dutch.\n\nSeveral meta-analyses find extensive evidence of ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring in the North-American and European labor markets. A 2016 meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015 finds that there is extensive racial discrimination in hiring decisions in Europe and North-America. Equivalent minority candidates need to send around 50% more applications to be invited for an interview than majority candidates.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of racial and ethnic discrimination in the housing market of several European countries.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis of racial discrimination in product markets found extensive evidence of minority applicants being quoted higher prices for products. A 1995 study found that car dealers \"quoted significantly lower prices to white males than to black or female test buyers using identical, scripted bargaining strategies.\" A 2013 study found that eBay sellers of iPods received 21 percent more offers if a white hand held the iPod in the photo than a black hand.\n\nResearch suggests that police practices, such as racial profiling, over-policing in areas populated by minorities and in-group bias may result in disproportionately high numbers of racial minorities among crime suspects. Research also suggests that there may be possible discrimination by the judicial system, which contributes to a higher number of convictions for racial minorities. A 2012 study found that \"(i) juries formed from all-white jury pools convict black defendants significantly (16 percentage points) more often than white defendants, and (ii) this gap in conviction rates is entirely eliminated when the jury pool includes at least one black member.\" Research has found evidence of in-group bias, where \"black (white) juveniles who are randomly assigned to black (white) judges are more likely to get incarcerated (as opposed to being placed on probation), and they receive longer sentences.\" In-group bias has also been observed when it comes to traffic citations, as black and white cops are more likely to cite out-groups.\n\nA 2015 study using correspondence tests \"found that when considering requests from prospective students seeking mentoring in the future, faculty were significantly more responsive to White males than to all other categories of students, collectively, particularly in higher-paying disciplines and private institutions.\" Through affirmative action, there is reason to believe that elite colleges favor minority applicants.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis found extensive evidence of racial discrimination in the American housing market. Minority applicants for housing needed to make many more enquiries to view properties. Geographical steering of African-Americans in US housing remained significant. A 2003 study finds \"evidence that agents interpret an initial housing request as an indication of a customer's preferences, but also are more likely to withhold a house from all customers when it is in an integrated suburban neighborhood (redlining). Moreover, agents' marketing efforts increase with asking price for white, but not for black, customers; blacks are more likely than whites to see houses in suburban, integrated areas (steering); and the houses agents show are more likely to deviate from the initial request when the customer is black than when the customer is white. These three findings are consistent with the possibility that agents act upon the belief that some types of transactions are relatively unlikely for black customers (statistical discrimination).\"\n\nA report by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development where the department sent African-Americans and whites to look at apartments found that African-Americans were shown fewer apartments to rent and houses for sale.\n\nSeveral meta-analyses find extensive evidence of ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring in the American labor market. A 2016 meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests – tests where identical CVs for stereotypically black and white names were sent to employers – in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015 finds that there is extensive racial discrimination in hiring decisions in Europe and North-America. These correspondence tests showed that equivalent minority candidates need to send around 50% more applications to be invited for an interview than majority candidates. A study that examine the job applications of actual people provided with identical résumés and similar interview training showed that African-American applicants with no criminal record were offered jobs at a rate as low as white applicants who had criminal records.\n\nRemittances increase living standards in the country of origin. Remittances are a large share of the GDP of many developing countries. A study on remittances to Mexico found that remittances lead to a substantial increase in the availability of public services in Mexico, surpassing government spending in some localities.\n\nResearch finds that emigration and low migration barriers has net positive effects on human capital formation in the sending countries. This means that there is a \"brain gain\" instead of a \"brain drain\" to emigration.\n\nOne study finds that sending countries benefit indirectly in the long-run on the emigration of skilled workers because those skilled workers are able to innovate more in developed countries, which the sending countries are able to benefit on as a positive externality. Greater emigration of skilled workers consequently leads to greater economic growth and welfare improvements in the long-run. The negative effects of high-skill emigration remain largely unfounded. According to economist Michael Clemens, it has not been shown that restrictions on high-skill emigration reduce shortages in the countries of origin.\n\nResearch also suggests that emigration, remittances and return migration can have a positive impact on political institutions and democratization in the country of origin. Research also shows that remittances can lower the risk of civil war in the country of origin. Return migration from countries with liberal gender norms has been associated with the transfer of liberal gender norms to the home country. \n\nResearch suggests that emigration causes an increase in the wages of those who remain in the country of origin. A 2014 survey of the existing literature on emigration finds that a 10 percent emigrant supply shock would increase wages in the sending country by 2–5.5%. A study of emigration from Poland shows that it led to a slight increase in wages for high- and medium-skilled workers for remaining Poles. A 2013 study finds that emigration from Eastern Europe after the 2004 EU enlargement increased the wages of remaining young workers in the country of origin by 6%, while it had no effect on the wages of old workers. The wages of Lithuanian men increased as a result of post-EU enlargement emigration. Return migration is associated with greater household firm revenues.\n\nSome research shows that the remittance effect is not strong enough to make the remaining natives in countries with high emigration flows better off.\n"}

Built about 1854, it was from 1896 home to members of the Isham family, who restored it in the early 20th century. The family donated the property to Connecticut Landmarks in the 1970s, which now operates it has a museum, offering guided tours and facility event rentals. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\nThe Isham-Terry House occupies a prominent and highly visible location just north of Interstate 84 outside downtown Hartford, at the northwest corner of High and Walnut Streets, and adjacent to the city's police department headquarters. It is a roughly cubical painted brick structure, two stories in height, with a low-pitch roof. A three-story tower projecting from its southwest corner adds visual prominence. The roof eaves are deep, with decorative Italianate brackets for support. Windows are on the two main floors are set in rectangular openings, with narrow oblong windows in the attic level of the main block. On the street-facing facades, the second-floor windows are topped by gabled or segmented-arch pediments with brackets on either side. The first floor of the facade facining Walnut Street is sheltered by a porch supported by slender clustered columns, with round-arch openings that have carved woodwork in the spandrels, and a low spindled balustrade. A similar porch shelters the main entrance facing High Street, and balconies on the tower share similar features. The building interior is well preserved, with lincrusta wall covering, ornate woodwork, and glass chandeliers.\n\nThe house was built sometime between the 1852 purchase of land by Ebenezer Roberts, and his listing as the building's first occupant in 1856. Roberts was a directory of the Hartford National Bank, Travelers Insurance Company, and other local businesses. Construction of this house contributed to the development of Asylum Hill as a desirable and fashionable neighborhood for the city's elites, although urban renewal has resulted in demolition of nearly all of the other similar houses that once lined High Street. The house was purchased in 1896 by Dr. Oliver Isham, a descendant of the locally prominent Isham and Terry families. He lived here and operated a medical practice. In the 1970s his surviving descendants gave the property to Connecticut Landmarks for preservation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "343427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343427", "title": "Morpheus", "text": "Morpheus\n\nMorpheus ('Fashioner', derived from the meaning 'form, shape') is a god associated with sleep and dreams. In Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" he is the son of Sleep, who appears in dreams in human form. From the medieval period, the name began to stand more generally for the god of dreams, or of sleep.\n\nIn Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Morpheus is one of the thousand sons of Somnus (Sleep). His name derives from the Greek word for form (\"μορφή\"), and his function was to appear in dreams in human guise. According to Ovid \"no other is more skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech of men; the clothing also and the accustomed words of each he represents.\" Like other gods associated with sleep, Ovid makes Morpheus winged.\n\nOvid called Morpheus and his brothers, the other sons of Somnus, the \"Somnia\" (\"dream shapes\"), saying that they appear in dreams \"mimicking many forms\". Ovid gives names to two more of these sons of Sleep. One called Icelos ('Like'), by the gods, but Phobetor ('Frightener') by men, \"takes the form of beast or bird or the long serpent\", and Phantasos ('Fancy'), who \"puts on deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things\". \n\nThe three brothers names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, and are perhaps Ovidian inventions. Tripp calls these three figures \"literary, not mythical concepts\". However Griffin suggests that this division of dream forms between Morpheus and his brothers, possibly including their names, may have been of Hellenistic origin.\n\nRobert Burton, in his 1621 \"Anatomy of Melancholy\", refers to a depiction of Morpheus, saying \"Philostratus paints [Morpheus] in a white and black coat, with a horn and ivory box full of dreams, of the same colours, to signify good and bad\". In Carl Michael Bellman's \"Fredman's Epistle\" No. 72, \"Glimmande nymf\", Morpheus is invoked as the \"god of sleep\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7681317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7681317", "title": "Museum of Asian Art", "text": "Museum of Asian Art\n\nThe Museum of Asian Art () is located in the Dahlem neighborhood of the borough of , Berlin, Germany. It is one of the Berlin State Museums institutions and is funded by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. It houses some 20,000 Asian artifacts, making it one of the largest museums of ancient Asian art in the world. The museum is located in the same building as the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. The museum houses important collections of Art houses of South, Southeast and Central Asian countries and art from the Indo-Asian cultural area, from the 4th millennium BC to the present. Its geographic reach covers regions in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Autonomous Region of Tibet and Xinjiang of the People's Republic of China, the Southeast Asian countries of Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and also the Indonesian Islands or archipelago.\n\nThe collection originally belonged to the Ethnological Museum of Berlin founded in 1873. From 1904 it was known as the \"Indian Department\". \n\nOn November 8, 1906, by government decree, Wilhelm von Bode, director-general of the Royal Museums of Berlin, founded the collection of the Museum of East Asian Art in Berlin. Germany's oldest museum of its kind, it was first located on Museum Island.\n\nAs a result of the four German Turfan expeditions, from 1902 to 1914, the collection was expanded to include Central Asia. In 1924, the exhibition was moved into the building belonging to the Arts and Crafts Museum, which at that time was also home to the Museum of Pre- and Early History (since 1981, it has been known as Martin-Gropius-Bau). The Society for East Asian Art founded in 1926 has provided substantial support for the museum's work. Thanks to their consistent expansion until the Second World War, the collections were among the most important in the world.\n\nDuring the Second World War, there were regrettable losses, partly due to damage to the museum building and partly to the removal of a large number of artifacts to Russia. After the war, the Red Army took about 90 percent of the distributed collections to the Soviet Union as war booty. There they were taken to the Hermitage in St Petersburg where they have remained until today. Only a few pieces were returned to Berlin. The almost complete loss necessitated recreating the collection but this could only be achieved gradually. From 1952, it was the Pergamon Museum that exhibited East Asian Art. At the instigation of the first director, Herbert Härtel, the collections were presented as part of an independent \"Indian Art Department\", later called the \"Museum of Indian Art\" (from 1 January 1963 to 4 December 2006).\n\nAfter the Berlin Wall went up, it was decided in 1970 to build new exhibition premises in West Berlin in the Zehlendorf district. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, efforts were made to reorganize Berlin's museum scene. In 1992, the two separate collections were brought together in Dahlem. The Association of Friends of the Department, the Society of Indo-Asian Art Berlin eV, was founded in 1993. It publishes the annual \"Indo-Asiatische Zeitschrift\" (\"Indo-Asian Journal\"). In 2000, they were extended, forming until 2006 the Museum of East Asian Art, which now continues as the East Asian Art Collection at the Museum of Asian Art, since December 2006\n\nThe collection covers the art of all of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia, with special focus on sculpture (south and southeast Asia) and murals (central Asia). The artifacts date from the third millennium BC to the present day.\n\nThe permanent exhibition contains stone, bronze, stucco and ceramic sculptures and stone reliefs with Hindu, Buddhist and Jain subjects as well as murals, clay sculptures and textiles from Buddhist complexes on the northern Silk Road (now Xinjiang, PR China), and Indian miniatures and craftwork from the Islamic Mughal period. Sculptures of stone, bronze and wood, as well as ritual objects from Nepal, Tibet, Burma, and southeast Asia complete coverage of the Indo-Asian region. Special sections include the Gandhara Art Collection (Pakistan and Afghanistan, 1st-5th centuries) and a replica of a Central Asian Buddhist cave with a large section of the original. The Gandhara art displays include artifacts from the Swat Valley.\n\nThe museum, with an outstanding collection of some 20,000 artifacts, has example of stone sculptures, reliefs, bronze and terracotta works representative of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Much of its collection of Jain art and Hindu sculpture dates to the classic period or the Middle Ages, and the museum also contains reconstruction of Indian temples. The East Asian Art Collection houses the largest and most important collection of Chinese, Korean and Japanese art in Germany. It consists of some 13,000 artefacts from all cultural periods, from the Neolithic to the present day. The three countries of the Asian subcontinent are first presented separately in their own departments. Their galleries converge on a central hall exhibiting the art of Buddhism, a common element in all three cultures. The Chinese Department has a large exhibition of porcelain, considerably enriched by Georg Weishaupt's collection, as well as lacquerware. Over 3,000-year-old bronzes, jades and ceramics attest to the country's early civilization and culture. A porcelain cup from the Wanli Emperor's time (1573–1620) during the Ming dynasty is of outstanding cultural and historical significance. In a separate room, a 17th-century traveling throne belonging to the Kangxi Emperor is exhibited. Its unique rosewood screen has rich pearl inlays with decorations of gold and lacquerwork.\nWith selected examples its China-Japan gallery, the museum presents the art of writing, common to all areas of East Asian art. As many works of Chinese and Japanese writing and some of the old paintings are particularly sensitive to light, they are exhibited for periods of three months before being replaced. The same applies to many items of lacquerwork and textile art. However, as a result of ties with Japanese woodcuts and the museum's important graphic collection, new relationships and priorities constantly emerge. In the Japanese department, visitors are shown a Japanese tea room or Boki. A study collection offers interested museum visitors the opportunity to experience an in-depth insight into the collection. A central repository for the collections is being planned in Berlin Friedrichshagen.\n\nBy appointment the Japanese tea ceremony can be observed. A reference library is open exclusively to experts. An interactive computer program and alternating short films complement the presentation. The courtyard, which can be reached from the basement, presents a stone copy of the east gate of the famous Stupa I from Sanchi in central India.\n\nA tradition of close cooperation exists with the German Society for East Asian Art, one of the museum's two supporting associations. At an international level, the museum cooperates with various non-European art museums, as well as with the Museum Rietberg in Zürich and the Musée Guimet in Paris . In the scientific field, the South, Southeast and Central Asia Collection and the East Asian Art Collection are closely connected with the neighboring Free University of Berlin. For example, museum director Willibald Veit is also Professor of East Asian Art History at the University. The merger of the two museums has been done with a future expansion plans of the \"Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz\" and to establish the Humboldt-Forum on Schlossplatz in Berlin-Mitte, a new concept venue for unique European collections.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "390580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390580", "title": "NOP (code)", "text": "NOP (code)\n\nIn computer science, a NOP, no-op, or NOOP (pronounced \"no op\"; short for no operation) is an assembly language instruction, programming language statement, or computer protocol command that does nothing.\n\nSome computer instruction sets include an instruction whose explicit purpose is to not change the state of any of the programmer-accessible registers, status flags, or memory. It often takes a well-defined number of clock cycles to execute. In other instruction sets, a NOP can be simulated by executing an instruction having operands that cause the same effect; \"e.g.\", on the SPARC processor, the instruction codice_1 is the recommended solution.\n\nA NOP is most commonly used for timing purposes, to force memory alignment, to prevent hazards, to occupy a branch delay slot, to render void an existing instruction such as a jump, or as a place-holder to be replaced by active instructions later on in program development (or to replace removed instructions when reorganizing would be problematic or time-consuming). In some cases, a NOP can have minor side effects; for example, on the Motorola 68000 series of processors, the NOP opcode causes a synchronization of the pipeline.\n\nListed below are the NOP instruction for some CPU architectures:\n\nFrom a hardware design point of view, unmapped areas of a bus are often designed to return zeroes; since the NOP slide behavior is often desirable, it gives a bias to coding it with the all-zeroes opcode.\n\nNOP is sometimes used as a description for the action performed by a function or a sequence of programming language statements if the function or code has no effect (it might also be called redundant code). A common compiler optimization is the detection and removal of this kind of code. Such code may be required by the grammar of the programming language, which does not allow a blank.\n\nIn Ada, the codice_2 statement serves as a NOP. As the syntax forbids that control statements or functions be empty, the codice_2 statement must be used to specify that no action is required. (Thus, if the programmer forgets to write a sequence of statements, the program will fail to compile.)\n\nThe second line below is an example of a single C statement that \"behaves\" like a NOP. In practice, most compilers will not generate code for this statement:\nThis statement performs an addition and discards the result. Indeed, any statement without side effects (and that does not affect control flow, e.g., break, return) can be removed, as the result of the computation is discarded.\n\nThe simplest possible statement in C that behaves like a NOP is the so-called \"null statement\", which is just a semi-colon in a context requiring a statement. (A compiler is not required to generate a NOP instruction in this case; typically, no instructions whatsoever would be generated.)\nAlternatively, an empty block (compound statement) may be used, and may be more legible:\nIn some cases, such as the body of a function, a block must be used, but this can be empty. In C, statements cannot be empty – simple statements must end with a ; (semicolon) while compound statements are enclosed in {} (braces), which does not itself need a following semicolon. Thus in contexts where a statement is grammatically required, some such null statement can be used.\n\nThe null statement is useless by itself, but it can have a syntactic use in a wider context, e.g., within the context of a loop:\n\nalternatively,\n\nor more tersely:\n\n(note that the last form may be confusing, and as such generates a warning with some compilers or compiler options, as semicolon usually indicates an end of function call instruction when placed after a round parenthesis on the end of line).\n\nThe above code continues calling the function \"getchar()\" until it returns a \\n (newline) character, essentially fast-forwarding the current reading location of standard input to the beginning of next line.\n\nIn Fortran, the codice_4 statement is used in some contexts such as the last statement in a DO loop, although it can be used anywhere, and does not have any functionality.\n\nAs with C, the ; used by itself can be used as a null statement. In fact, due to the specification of the language, in a BEGIN / END block, the semicolon is optional before the END statement, thus a semicolon used there is superfluous. \n\nAlso, a block consisting of codice_5 may be used as a placeholder to indicate no action, even if placed inside another BEGIN / END block.\nThe Python programming language has a codice_6 statement which has no effect when executed and thus serves as a NOP. It is primarily used to ensure correct syntax due to Python's indentation-sensitive syntax; for example the syntax for definition of a class requires an indented block with the class logic, which has to be expressed as codice_6 when it should be empty.\n\nThe jQuery library provides a function codice_8, which does nothing.\n\nThe Angular framework provides angular.noop function that performs no operations.\n\nThe 'codice_9' [colon] character is a shell builtin that has similar effect to a \"NOP\" (a do-nothing operation). It's not technically an NOP, as it changes the special parameter $? (exit status of last command) to 0. It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin 'true', and its exit status is true (0).\n\nThe Lodash library provides a function codice_10, which returns undefined and does nothing.\n\nMany computer protocols, such as telnet, include a NOP command that a client can issue to request a response from the server without requesting any other actions. Such a command can be used to ensure the connection is still alive or that the server is responsive. A NOOP command is part of the following protocols (\"this is a partial list\"):\nNote that unlike the other protocols listed, the IMAP4 NOOP command has a specific purpose - it allows the server to send any pending notifications to the client.\n\nWhile most telnet or FTP servers respond to a NOOP command with \"OK\" or \"+OK\", some programmers have added quirky responses to the client. For example, the codice_11 daemon of MINIX responds to NOOP with the message:\n\nNOPs are often involved when cracking software that checks for serial numbers, specific hardware or software requirements, presence or absence of hardware dongles, etc. This is accomplished by altering functions and subroutines to bypass security checks and instead simply return the expected value being checked for. Because most of the instructions in the security check routine will be unused, these would be replaced with NOPs, thus removing the software's security functionality without attracting any attention.\n\nThe NOP opcode can be used to form a NOP slide, which allows code to execute when the exact value of the instruction pointer is indeterminate (e.g., when a buffer overflow causes a function's return address on the stack to be overwritten).\n\n"}

More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a contract, which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term can have different meanings, depending on what law is being applied and what country and context it is used in.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Nations almost all jurisdictions have codified the law relating to negotiable instruments in a Bills of Exchange Act, e.g. Bills of Exchange Act 1882 in the UK, Bills of Exchange Act 1908 in New Zealand, Bills of Exchange Act 1909 in Australia, the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in India and the Bills of Exchange Act 1914 in Mauritius. The Bills of Exchange Act:\n\nAdditionally most Commonwealth jurisdictions have separate Cheques Acts providing for additional protections for bankers collecting unendorsed or irregularly endorsed cheques, providing that cheques that are crossed and marked 'not negotiable' or similar are not transferable, and providing for electronic presentation of cheques in inter-bank cheque clearing systems.\n\nThe ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as \"praescriptiones\" in the 1st century BCE and 2,000-year-old Roman promissory notes have been found\n\nCommon prototypes of bills of exchanges and promissory notes originated in China, where special instruments called \"feitsyan\" were used to safely transfer money over long distances during the reign of the Tang Dynasty in the 8th century.\n\nAround 1150 the Knights Templar issued bank notes to pilgrims, pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value.\n\nIn the mid-13th century, the Ilkhanid rulers of Persia printed the \"cha\" or \"chap\" which was used as paper money for limited usage for transactions between the court and the merchants for about three years before it collapsed. The collapse was caused by the court accepting the \"cha\" only at progressive discount.\n\nLater, such documents were used for money transfer by Middle Eastern merchants, who had used the prototypes of bills of exchange (\"suftadja\" or \"softa\") from the 8th century to present. Such prototypes came to be used later by the Iberian and Italian merchants in the 12th century. In Italy in the 13–15th centuries, bills of exchange and promissory notes obtained their main features, while further phases of their development have been associated with France (16–18th centuries, where the endorsement had appeared) and Germany (19th century, formalization of Exchange Law). The first mention of the use of bills of exchange in English statutes dates from 1381, under Richard II; the statute mandates the use of such instruments in England, and prohibits the future export of gold and silver specie, in any form, to settle foreign commercial transactions. English exchange law was different than continental European law because of different legal systems; the English system was adopted later in the United States.\n\nThe modern emphasis on negotiability may also be traced to Lord Mansfield. Germanic Lombards documents may also have some elements of negotiability.\n\nA negotiable instrument can serve to convey value constituting at least part of the performance of a contract, albeit perhaps not obvious in contract formation, in terms inherent in and arising from the requisite offer and acceptance and conveyance of consideration. The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a \"holder in due course\", the payment on which is at least part of the performance of the contract to which the negotiable instrument is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a \"bearer instrument\", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course. Negotiation requires a valid \"endorsement\" of the negotiable instrument.\n\nThe consideration constituted by a negotiable instrument is cognizable as the value given up to acquire it (benefit) and the consequent loss of value (detriment) to the prior holder; thus, no separate consideration is required to support an accompanying contract assignment. The instrument itself is understood as memorializing the right for, and power to demand, payment, and an obligation for payment evidenced by the instrument itself with possession as a holder in due course being the touchstone for the right to, and power to demand, payment. In some instances, the negotiable instrument can serve as the writing memorializing a contract, thus satisfying any applicable statute of frauds as to that contract.\n\nThe rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:\n\nNegotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee’s own name. Negotiation can be effected by endorsement and delivery (order instruments), or by delivery alone (bearer instruments).\n\nPromissory notes and bills of exchange are two primary types of negotiable instruments.\n\nAlthough possibly non-negotiable, a promissory note may be a negotiable instrument if it is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand to the \"payee\", or at fixed or determinable future time, certain in money, to order or to bearer. (see Sec. 194) The law applicable to the specific instrument will determine whether it is a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable instrument.\n\nBank notes are frequently referred to as promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. According to section 4 of India's Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, \"a Promissory Note is an writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or the bearer of the instrument\".\n\nA bill of exchange or \"draft\" is a written order by the \"drawer\" to the \"drawee\" to pay money to the \"payee\". A common type of bill of exchange is the cheque (\"check\" in American English), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.\n\nA bill of exchange is essentially an order made by one person to another to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.\nA bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The \"holder in due course\" may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable.\nIn some cases a bill is marked \"not negotiable\"—see crossing of cheques. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.\n\nIn the United States, Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) govern the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments, unless the instruments are governed by Article 8 of the UCC. The various state law enactments of UCC §§ 3–104(a) through (d) set forth the legal definition of what is and what is not a \"negotiable instrument\":\n\nThus, for a writing to be a negotiable instrument under Article 3, the following requirements must be met:\nThe latter requirement is referred to as the \"words of negotiability\": a writing which does not contain the words \"to the order of\" (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in allonge) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of negotiability. The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a bank) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads \"pay John Doe\") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.\n\nUCC Article 3 does not apply to money, to payment orders governed by Article 4A, or to securities governed by Article 8.\n\nPersons other than the original obligor and obligee can become parties to a negotiable instrument. The most common manner in which this is done is by placing one's signature on the instrument (\"endorsement\"): if the person who signs does so with the intention of obtaining payment of the instrument or acquiring or transferring rights to the instrument, the signature is called an \"endorsement\". There are five types of endorsements contemplated by the Code, covered in UCC Article 3, Sections 204–206:\nIf a note or draft is negotiated to a person who acquires the instrument\nthe transferee is a \"holder in due course\" and can enforce the instrument \"without\" being subject to defenses which the maker of the instrument would be able to assert against the original payee, except for certain \"real defenses\". These real defenses include (1) forgery of the instrument; (2) fraud as to the nature of the instrument being signed; (3) alteration of the instrument; (4) incapacity of the signer to contract; (5) infancy of the signer; (6) duress; (7) discharge in bankruptcy; and, (8) the running of a statute of limitations as to the validity of the instrument.\nThe \"holder-in-due-course rule\" is a \"rebuttable presumption\" that makes the free transfer of negotiable instruments feasible in the modern economy. A person or entity purchasing an instrument in the ordinary course of business can reasonably expect that it will be paid when presented to, and not subject to dishonor by, the maker, without involving itself in a dispute between the maker and the person to whom the instrument was first issued (this can be contrasted to the lesser rights and obligations accruing to mere holders). Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in a particular State's law contemplate \"real defenses\" available to purported holders in due course.\nThe foregoing is the theory and application presuming compliance with the relevant law. Practically, the obligor-payor on an instrument who feels he has been defrauded or otherwise unfairly dealt with by the payee may nonetheless refuse to pay even a holder in due course, requiring the latter to resort to litigation to recover on the instrument.\n\nWhile bearer instruments are rarely created as such, a holder of commercial paper with the holder designated as payee can change the instrument to a bearer instrument by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs the back of the instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such.\n\nAlternatively, an individual or company may write a check payable to \"cash\" or \"bearer\" and create a bearer instrument. Great care should be taken with the security of the instrument, as it is legally almost as good as cash.\n\nUnder the Code, the following are not negotiable instruments, although the law governing obligations with respect to such items may be similar to or derived from the law applicable to negotiable instruments:\n\nAlthough often considered foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned. Negotiability can be traced back to the 1700s and Lord Mansfield, when money and liquidity was relatively scarce. The holder in due course rule has been limited by various statutes. Concerns have also been raised that the holder in due course rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2131904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2131904", "title": "Nick Bockwinkel", "text": "Nick Bockwinkel\n\nNicholas Warren Francis Bockwinkel (December 6, 1934 – November 14, 2015) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his appearances with the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association (AWA) from 1970 to 1987, where he held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship on four occasions and the AWA World Tag Team Championship on three.\n\nBockwinkel was recognised for his exceptional technical wrestling ability and mastery of in-ring psychology. He was also known for his even-toned, articulate promos, which distinguished him from many of his contemporaries. He was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nBockwinkel was born to Warren Bockwinkel – himself a professional wrestler – and Helen (née Crnkovich) Bockwinkel in St. Louis, Missouri on December 6, 1934. He attended the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship, playing for the Oklahoma Sooners until sustaining a knee injury that ended his football career and cost him his scholarship.\n\nBockwinkel was trained to wrestle by his father and Lou Thesz, debuting in 1955.\n\nWhen he was first breaking into the business, Bockwinkel served as the driver for Yukon Eric, taking him to various cities throughout the Eastern and Northeastern United States. He later commented that the experience, \"was so smart. [...] Lots of ways to learn about this business.\" After training to become a professional wrestler with his father Warren, a regional star in the 1940s, and Lou Thesz, he spent the early years of his career as part of a tag team with his father. At the age of 16, he had his debut match against Thesz. He won his first major singles title in 1963, defeating Tony Borne for the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. He also held several singles and tag team titles in Hawaii and California.\n\nIt was during his time at Georgia Championship Wrestling in Atlanta, Georgia that Bockwinkel developed into a main event star. He had previously been a heroic character, but began a transition to being a villain during a feud with NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dory Funk, Jr. Funk, Jr. later referred to Bockwinkel as \"One of the best wrestling challengers for the belt. [...] He was very technical, and put a lot of thought into his interviews, his talk, his work in the ring, his persona.\"\n\nIn 1970, Bockwinkel joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA), where he formed a team with wrestler Ray Stevens and manager Bobby Heenan. Together, they won the AWA World Tag Team Championship three times, the first in 1972. They defended the belts against such opponents as The Crusher, Dick the Bruiser, Billy Robinson, and Verne Gagne. The team eventually broke up after Stevens attacked Heenan when the latter praised himself and failed to comment on Stevens during an interview. Bockwinkel also teamed with Pat Patterson on occasion.\n\nBockwinkel became known for his articulate wrestling interviews. \"I used to use the four, five or six syllable words as best I could,\" he was quoted as saying in the book \"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Heels\". \"If I ran across one I didn't know, I had a little dictionary. I would have this little dictionary, with 70 or 80 words, that I would always be perusing. I had it with me all the time. Automatically, some of these words just starting coming to me in my interviews because I was familiar with them.\"\n\nWith Heenan still as his manager, Bockwinkel won the first of many AWA World Heavyweight Championships on November 8, 1975 at the age of 40, ending Verne Gagne's seven-year reign. As AWA Champion, Bockwinkel had feuds with Billy Robinson, Dick the Bruiser, The Crusher, Tito Santana, Mad Dog Vachon, Jerry Lawler, Otto Wanz, Mr. Saito, Jim Brunzell, Greg Gagne, Verne Gagne and Hulk Hogan. Bockwinkel was involved in the first ever AWA versus World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) World Title Unification match, wrestling WWWF Champion, Bob Backlund, to a double count-out, on March 25, 1979, in Toronto.\n\nBockwinkel's first reign lasted for 1716 days and ended on July 19, 1980 when he was defeated by Verne Gagne. Shortly after regaining the AWA World title, Gagne announced his retirement from professional wrestling, and the AWA Heavyweight Championship was awarded back to Bockwinkel on May 19, 1981. This move infuriated wrestling fans throughout the AWA, and it solidified Bockwinkel as one of the most despised wrestlers in the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest controversy surrounding Bockwinkel and his title reign involved a series of matches with Hulk Hogan, whom Gagne signed after Hogan left the World Wrestling Federation in 1981. In June 1982, Hogan defeated Bockwinkel by pinfall in St. Paul, Minnesota to capture the AWA World Title, but AWA President Stanley Blackburn reversed the decision and returned the title to Bockwinkel, who went on to lose it to Otto Wanz and regain it with Heenan's help in the span of two months. Hogan, in the meantime, grew tired of the politics surrounding Bockwinkel and the world title and departed the AWA to return to the WWF, where he became a star and helped the company become a worldwide brand.\n\nOn February 22, 1984, Jumbo Tsuruta defeated Bockwinkel to capture the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in a match where Terry Funk was a guest referee. On an AWA card, Bockwinkel wrestled NWA World Champion Ric Flair for the NWA title on January 16, 1986 at the Winnipeg Arena; the bout ended in a double count out. Bockwinkel last held the AWA World Championship in 1987, at the age of 52. He became popular in a feud against then-AWA champion Stan Hansen. When Hansen failed to appear for a title defense, Bockwinkel won the title by forfeit. Hansen had quit the AWA from that point. Months later he dropped the championship to another second generation wrestler, Curt Hennig, at SuperClash. The match ended in controversial fashion due to interference by Larry Zbyszko, who had handed a roll of coins to Hennig to use on Bockwinkel. Bockwinkel retired in 1987, ending a career that spanned four decades. In one of his final matches as an active competitor, he paid Zbyszko back for costing him the AWA World title by pinning him on an episode of \"AWA Championship Wrestling\" on ESPN after knocking him out with a roll of coins.\n\nAfter departing AWA, Bockwinkel worked as a road agent for the World Wrestling Federation, also serving as a color commentator for occasional televised events. He was released in 1989 due to budget cuts. He returned to the ring in 1993 at Slamboree: A Legends' Reunion. The card was promoted by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) but featured veteran wrestlers from all over the country. Bockwinkel wrestled former NWA World Champion Dory Funk, Jr. to a time limit draw as part of the undercard. In 1994, Bockwinkel became the on-screen commissioner of WCW. He was reunited on the program with Bobby Heenan but their former partnership in AWA was never mentioned.\n\nIn 2000, he and Yoshiaki Fujiwara were the commissioners for a short-lived shoot style promotion, the Japan Pro Wrestling Association, but as the shoot-style market in Japan had been low since the collapse of UWF International, the wrestlers on it moved to other promotions. Bockwinkel was the President of the Cauliflower Alley Club until stepping down in May 2014 due to health reasons.\n\nOn March 31, 2007, he was inducted in the WWE Hall of Fame by his former manager Bobby Heenan.\n\nBockwinkel made an appearance on WWE's \"Raw\" on March 29, 2010, as part of Legends lumberjack match between Christian and Ted Dibiase.\n\nBockwinkel was known for his technical wrestling ability and in-ring psychology. Bob Backlund wrote in his autobiography that \"Nick had a great head for the game, a wonderful sense of ring psychology, and an uncanny ability to use his intelligence and cockiness to get under the people's skin. He was a terrific representative for the AWA and was the key player in the success of the AWA for a long time.\" Backlund goes on to say, \"He was a very intelligent, well-spoken, and cocky heel, and his in-ring skills were right up there with the very best in the business.\" In the book \"50 Greatest Professional Wrestlers of All Time: The Definitive Shoot\", author Larry Matysik lists Bockwinkel as number 18, writing \"He was an athlete, he could wrestle, and his psychology was second to none.\"\n\nIn addition, he was also known for his calm, charismatic, articulate promos, which distinguished him from many of his contemporaries. In 2008, Chris Jericho based his new villainous wrestling persona on Bockwinkel. In his autobiography \"The Best in the World\" Jericho wrote, \"The WWE had recently released an AWA retrospective DVD, and while watching it, I remembered how great a heel Bockwinkel was. He wore suits for all his interviews and used ten-dollar words that went over the average fans' heads, pissing them off markedly. Here was this pompous blowhard using the fancy talk and wearing the fancy suits, claiming to be the best because he was the World Champion, which was the truth.\"\n\nIn 1968, Bockwinkel appeared as a contestant on a prime-time version of the NBC game show \"Hollywood Squares\", winning a Pontiac Firebird, a deluxe kitchen set, and $1300 in cash. He played Harry in the episode \"Savage Sunday\" in the show \"Hawaii Five-O\". Bockwinkel also played a wrestler in an episode of the 1960s television series \"The Monkees\".\n\nOn June 22, 1957, Bockwinkel married Susan Tranchitella, with whom he had two daughters: Johnna (born October 11, 1958) and Nikki (born April 30, 1961). The couple divorced in 1967. Bockwinkel remarried in 1972 to Darlene Hampp, with the marriage lasting until his death. The couple lived together in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nIn November 2007, Bockwinkel underwent triple bypass heart surgery.\n\nIn 2007, he was elected President of the Cauliflower Alley Club, a non-profit organization. In 2013, Ric Flair told Stone Cold Steve Austin on his podcast that Bockwinkel had Alzheimer's disease. Bockwinkel's wife Darlene denied Flair's claim, but did acknowledge that he had health problems which she wanted to keep private. In August 2014, Bockwinkel stepped down from his position as Cauliflower Alley Club president due to his declining health. He was replaced by former wrestler B. Brian Blair. At the Cauliflower Alley Club reunion in 2015 he appeared frail and his wife said he was making his final public appearance due to dementia and heart issues.\n\nBockwinkel died from undisclosed causes on the evening of November 14, 2015. His remains were cremated in Las Vegas and a memorial mass was held at St. Joseph Croatian Catholic Church in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri on November 21, 2015. He was survived by his wife, his two children from his first marriage, two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55782914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55782914", "title": "Okamoto Daihachi incident", "text": "Okamoto Daihachi incident\n\nThe of 1612 refers to the exposure of the intrigues involving the Japanese Christian \"daimyō\" and retainers of the early Tokugawa shogunate in Japan. The conspiracy - motivated by the Christian daimyō Arima Harunobu's desire to retake Arima lands in Hizen that were lost in the Sengoku wars - did much to shake the confidence that the Tokugawa regime placed on its Christian subjects, and was attributed as one of the reasons the Tokugawa eventually took an anti-Christian stance, which culminated in the persecution of Christians throughout the country.\n\nIn 1543, during the wars of the Sengoku period, the Portuguese made landing on Japan for the first time, and soon spread their guns and Christianity throughout Japan from Kyushu. Regional \"daimyō\", or feudal lords, were eager to trade with the Portuguese for their European arquebus, while the Portuguese saw the Japanese as potential converts to the Christian religion, preferring to trade with those who converted. Trade and religion thus tied, many \"daimyo\" became Christian, such that at the eve of unification of Japan by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1600, as many as 14 \"daimyo\" at the time were baptised. Even when some of those Christian \"daimyo\" supported Ieyasu at the decisive Battle of Sekigahara, many other Christian \"daimyo\" rallied around the heir of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In any case, the question remained for the unifier of Japan where the Christian lords' loyalties ultimately lay.\n\nArima Harunobu, the daimyo of Hinoe Domain, became one of the most important supporters of the Church in post-Sekigahara Japan as Tokugawa Ieyasu became \"shōgun\" and purged his enemies, like the influential Christian lord Konishi Yukinaga. In the first decade of the Tokugawa shogunate, Arima Harunobu was able to keep his fief and was given the right to send red seal ships to trade overseas. In one of these voyages in 1608, the crew of a red seal ship belonging to Harunobu became involved in a deadly quarrel in Portuguese Macau after coming back from Cambodia to fetch a cargo of agarwood for Ieyasu, resulting in 50 Arima samurai being killed under the orders of the Captain-major André Pessoa. The same captain-major came to Nagasaki on the \"Nossa Senhora da Graça\" to trade in 1609, and Arima Harunobu took this opportunity to seek permission from Tokugawa Ieyasu to seek revenge for his dead men. Ieyasu acceded - although the Portuguese controlled much of the Nanban trade, Ieyasu sought to decouple the close relationship between that trade and Christianity. Arima Harunobu thereupon took a flotilla of 1,200 men to attack Pessoa in Nagasaki, and after a three-day engagement, the \"Nossa Senhora da Graça\" sank in an explosion bringing Pessoa down with it on January 6, 1610. However, this victory for Harunobu soon led to his downfall.\n\nFor Arima's part in sinking the \"Nossa Senhora da Graça\", Ieyasu not only rewarded Arima Harunobu with a prized sword, but also presented his granddaughter Kunihime (国姫) as wife for Harunobu's son Naozumi. This proved to be problematic for the Arima, as Naozumi had followed Christianity like his father and had married a Christian girl. Naozumi eventually repudiated his legitimate wife in favour of Kunihime, showing that, rather than standing by his faith and family, Naozumi opted to not risk offending Ieyasu.\n\nHarunobu apparently felt that his efforts during the \"Nossa Senhora da Graça\" incident warranted further rewards — namely the return of the territories Isahaya and Kōjiro (神代) in Hizen Province that the Arima lost during the Sengoku period. To this end, Harunobu bribed Okamoto Daihachi (岡本大八, baptismal name Paulo), a Christian aide to the \"rōjū\" Honda Masazumi, who advised Ieyasu on affairs concerning the redistribution of fiefs. However, Okamoto took the money and did not follow through; instead, he strung Harunobu on by forging documents promising to reward Arima with the territories, then claiming that the reward had been revoked due to the interference of the Governor of Nagasaki Hasegawa Fujihiro. Harunobu, after seeking further assistance from a Jesuit priest on this matter to no avail, brought the issue directly to Ieyasu in 1612, bringing Okamoto's scam to light. At this juncture, Naozumi turned against his father and told Ieyasu of Harunobu's underhanded dealings with Okamoto.\n\nThat the investiture of fiefs, a matter that defines the feudal relations of the Tokugawa shogunate, could be bought and sold was deeply troubling to Tokugawa Ieyasu. He sentenced Okamoto Daihachi to death by burning for forging shōgunal documents, but not before Daihachi had a chance to reveal that Arima Harunobu had conspired to kill Hasegawa Fujihiro. As the important port city of Nagasaki was the governed directly by the shogunate, this conspiracy was seen as an affront to Tokugawa rule. For this and his bribery, Harunobu was exiled to Kai Province in late 1612, and was ordered to commit suicide by \"seppuku\" the next year. However, Harunobu refused on grounds of his faith, and instead had his head cut off. Naozumi was allowed to inherit his father's fief for his part in denouncing Harunobu.\n\nThe fact that the perpetrators of this episode of corruption, conspiracy, forgery, and attempted murder were both Christians was not lost on Ieyasu. The retired shōgun was further incensed to hear that Christian followers had gathered at Okamoto's execution to offer prayers and sing hymns, cementing in his mind that the creed encouraged insubordination against the shogunate. Ieyasu later referenced this incident along with other executions of Christian criminals in 1614:\n\nIn the same year as the Daihachi incident was uncovered, Ieyasu evicted the Christian servants of his household and forbade his vassals from following Christianity or risk having their revenues withheld. On January 27, 1614, the prohibition was extended to everyone regardless of class or origin, including all missionaries without exception. This order was unevenly followed by Ieyasu's vassals, as domains that were predominantly Christian or sufficiently far from the central did not interfere with their Christian subjects up to 1623. However, in Shimabara Domain (formerly the Hinoe Domain), Arima Naozumi apostatized and pursued a campaign of persecution of Christians, killing even his two half-brothers, aged 8 and 6. He was transferred to Nobeoka in Hyūga Province in mid-1614, leaving behind a restive Christian population that would instigate the Shimabara Rebellion.\n\n"}

It represents a synthesis of all the metallurgical techniques known in the region of Susa during the era of Uruk. It provides interesting information about one of the two known dog breeds in the Susan plain.\n\nIn this era, metallurgical techniques used a process where ore was melted to extract the metal and the metal was then poured into molds often at temperatures greater than 800°C.\n\nThe fabrication techniques include cire perdue casting for the large part of the body and \"hot drawing\" of the ears and tail, with additional material for the back of the dog.\n\nThe connection of the ring with the main body cannot be made with a simple binding, for there is a risk of melting the main body.

{"id": "24807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24807", "title": "Pleading", "text": "Pleading\n\nIn law as practiced in countries that follow the English models, a pleading is a formal written statement of a party's claims or defenses to another party's claims in a civil action. The parties' pleadings in a case define the issues to be adjudicated in the action.\n\nThe Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) govern pleading in England and Wales. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern pleading in United States federal courts. Each state in the United States has its own statutes and rules that govern pleading in the courts of that state.\n\nIn the United States, a \"complaint\" is the first pleading filed by a plaintiff which initiates a lawsuit. A complaint sets forth the relevant allegations of fact that give rise to one or more legal causes of action along with a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed (an ad quod damnum clause). In some situations, a complaint is called a \"petition\", in which case the party filing it is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent. In equity, sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a \"petition\" or a \"bill of complaint in chancery\".\n\nIn England and Wales, the first pleading is a Claim Form, issued under either Part 7 or Part 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules, which sets out the nature of the action and the relief sought, and may give brief particulars of the claim. The Claimant also has the option, under Practice Direction 7A.61 to serve Particulars of Claim (a document setting out the allegations which found the cause of action) within 14 days of issue of the Claim Form.\n\nWhen used in civil proceedings in England and Wales, the term \"complaint\" refers to the mechanism by which civil proceedings are instituted in the magistrates' court and may be either written or oral.\n\nA \"demurrer\" is a pleading (usually filed by a defendant) which objects to the legal sufficiency of the opponent's pleading (usually a complaint) and demands that the court rule immediately about whether the pleading is legally adequate before the party must plead on the merits in response. Since demurrer procedure required an immediate ruling like a motion, many common law jurisdictions therefore went to a narrower understanding of pleadings as framing the issues in a case but not being motions in and of themselves, and replaced the demurrer with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action or the application to strike out particulars of claim.\n\nAn \"answer\" is a pleading filed by a defendant which admits or denies the specific allegations set forth in a complaint and constitutes a general appearance by a defendant. In England and Wales, the equivalent pleading is called a Defence.\n\nA defendant may also file a cross-complaint against another defendant named by the plaintiff, and may also file a \"third-party complaint\" bring other parties into a case by the process of impleader.\n\nA defendant may file a \"counter-claim\" to raise a cause of action to defend, reduce or set off the claim of the plaintiff.\n\nCommon law pleading was the system of civil procedure used in England, which early on developed a strong emphasis on the form of action rather than the cause of action (as a result of the Provisions of Oxford, which severely limited the evolution of the common law writ system). The emphasis was on procedure over substance.\n\nLaw and equity evolved as separate judicial systems, each with its own procedures and remedies. Because the types of claims eligible for consideration was capped early during the development of the English legal system, claims that might have been acceptable to the courts' evolving sense of justice often did not match up perfectly with any of the established forms of action. Lawyers had to engage in great ingenuity to shoehorn their clients' claims into existing forms of action. The result was that at common law, pleadings were stuffed full of awkward legal fictions that had little to do with the actual \"real-world\" facts of the case. The placeholder name John Doe (still commonly used in American pleading to name unknown parties) is a remnant of this period.\n\nIn its final form in the 19th century, common law pleading was terribly complex and slow by modern standards. The parties would normally go through several rounds of pleadings before the parties were deemed to have clearly stated their controversy, so that the case was \"at issue\" and could proceed to trial. A case would begin with a complaint in which the plaintiff alleged the facts entitling him to relief, then the defendant would file any one of a variety of pleas as an answer, followed by a replication from the plaintiff, a rejoinder from the defendant, a surrejoinder from the plaintiff, a rebutter from the defendant, and a surrebutter from the plaintiff. At each stage, a party could file a demurrer to the other's pleading (essentially a request that the court immediately rule on whether the pleading was legally adequate before they had to file a pleading in response) or simply file another pleading in response.\n\nGenerally, a plea could be dilatory or peremptory. There were three kinds of dilatory plea: to the jurisdiction, in suspension, or in abatement. The first challenged the court's jurisdiction, the second asked the court to stay the action, and the third asked the court to dismiss the action without prejudice to the other side's right to bring the claims in another action or another court. A peremptory plea had only one kind: a plea in bar. A party making a plea in bar could either traverse the other side's pleading (i.e., deny all or some of the facts pleaded) or confess and avoid it (i.e., admit the facts pleaded but plead new ones that would dispel their effect). A traverse could be general (deny everything) or specific. Either side could plead imparlance in order to get more time to plead on the merits. Once the case was at issue, the defendant could reopen the pleadings in order to plead a newly discovered defense (and start the whole sequence again) by filing a plea puis darrein.\n\nThe result of all this complexity was that to ascertain what was \"at issue\" in a case, a stranger to the case (i.e., such as a newly appointed judge) would have to sift through a huge pile of pleadings to figure out what had happened to the original averments of the complaint and whether there was anything left to be actually adjudicated by the court.\n\nCode pleading was first introduced in 1850 in New York and in 1872 in California, and eventually spread to 22 other states. Code pleading sought to abolish the distinction between law and equity. It unified civil procedure for all types of actions as much as possible. The focus shifted from pleading the right form of action (that is, the right procedure) to pleading the right cause of action (that is, a substantive right to be enforced by the law). Under code pleading, the required elements of each action are supposed to be set out in carefully codified statutes.\n\nCode pleading stripped out most of the legal fictions that had encrusted common law pleading by requiring parties to plead \"ultimate facts.\" This means that to plead a cause of action, the pleader has to plead each element and also allege specific facts which, if proven with evidence at trial, would constitute proof of that element. Failure to provide such detail could lead to dismissal of the case if the defendant successfully demurred to the complaint on the basis that it merely stated \"legal conclusions\" or \"evidentiary facts.\"\n\nCode pleading also drastically shortened the pleading process. Most of the old common law pleadings were abolished. From now on, a case required only a complaint and an answer, with an optional cross-complaint and cross-answer, and with the demurrer kept as the standard attack on improper pleadings. Instead of piling layers and layers of pleadings and averments on top of each other, a pleading that was attacked by demurrer would either be completely superseded by an amended pleading or would proceed immediately \"at issue\" as to the validly pleaded parts. This meant that to determine what the parties were currently fighting about, a stranger to a case would no longer have to read the entire case file from scratch, but could (in theory) look \"only\" at the most recent version of the complaint filed by the plaintiff, the defendant's most recent answer to that complaint, and any court orders on demurrers to either pleading.\n\nCode pleading was criticized because many lawyers felt that it was too difficult to fully research all the facts needed to bring a complaint \"before\" one had even initiated the action, and thus meritorious plaintiffs could not bring their complaints in time before the statute of limitations expired. Code pleading has also been criticized as promoting \"hypertechnical reading of legal papers\".\n\nNotice pleading is the dominant form of pleading used in the United States today. In 1938, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted to govern civil procedure in United States federal courts. One goal of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was to relax the strict rules of code pleading. However, each state also has its own rules of civil procedure, which may require different, looser, or stricter rules in state court.\n\nLouisiana, a state that derives its legal tradition from the Spanish and French (as opposed to English common law), employs a system of fact pleading wherein it is only necessary to plead the facts that give rise to a cause of action. It is not necessary even for the petitioner to identify the cause of action being pleaded. Mere conclusory allegations such as \"the defendant was negligent\" are not, by themselves, sufficient to sustain a cause of action.\n\nOther states are also fact-pleading jurisdictions. Illinois, for example, requires that a complaint \"must assert a legally recognized cause of action and it must plead facts which bring the particular case within that cause of action.\"\n\nIn alternative pleading, legal fiction is employed to permit a party to argue two mutually exclusive possibilities, for example, submitting an injury complaint alleging that the harm to the plaintiff caused by the defendant was so outrageous that it must have either been intended as a malicious attack or, if not, must have been due to gross negligence.\n\nThe use of \"pleaded\" versus \"pled\" as the past tense version of \"pleading\" has been a subject of controversy among many of those that practice law. \"Pleaded\" is more common in Australian publications, while \"pled\" is more common in American, British, and Canadian publications. In a 2010 search of the Westlaw legal database, \"pled\" is used in a narrow majority of cases over \"pleaded\".\n\n\n"}

Built in 1824 and much modified in the 1880s, it is now a museum and art gallery which contains the collection of George Holt, a shipping-line owner and former resident, in its original setting. It includes work by Thomas Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, Edwin Landseer, John Everett Millais and J. M. W. Turner.\n\nThe house was bequeathed to the city of Liverpool by Holt's daughter, Emma Georgina Holt, in 1944 and is now managed by National Museums Liverpool.\n\nSudley, as it was originally known, was completed in 1824 on land formerly owned by the Tarleton family as a two-storey ashlar house for Nicholas Robinson, a corn merchant who was Lord Mayor of Liverpool in 1828-1829. Robinson paid £4500 for the land.\n\nUpon the death of Robinson in 1854, the house passed to his two daughters, who died in 1883. The house and estate, comprising just under , was put up for sale in 1880. It became the home of Victorian shipping-line owner and merchant George Holt in 1884. \"Pevsner\" says that the original design was probably by John Whiteside Casson and was modified by James Rhind when Holt purchased it. However, National Museums Liverpool say that the original architect is unknown, although there are features that suggest it may have been Thomas Harrison.\n\nThe structural modifications, which involved moving the main entrance from the east facade to that of the north and also adding an office wing on the west, have significantly affected the interior. The original staircase with Doric fluted columns, above which is a dome and glazed oculus, became exposed and, according to \"Pevsner\", this has left the surrounding internal features as \"a bit of a mess\". The new two-storey wing added two bays to the five that already existed on the south side, as well as a parapeted prospect tower to its rear.\n\nGeorge Holt was an art collector whose collection derived mainly from purchases from dealers and at exhibitions rather than from commissions. Among his most significant purchases, which remain in the house today, were J. M. W. Turner's \"Rosenau\", depicting Prince Albert's home in Germany, and Gainborough's \"Viscountess Folkestone\". Also among the collection are paintings by Richard Parkes Bonington, Edwin Landseer, John Everett Millais, Joshua Reynolds, George Romney and the Pre-Raphaelites.\n\nGeorge Melly, the jazz singer, critic and art historian, who was related to the Holt family, has described aspects of life at Sudley House during his various childhood visits in the 1930s, when it was owned by George Holt's only child, Emma Georgina Holt. According to him, her father, who died in 1896, had left an estate valued at over £600,000.\n\nThe house and the art collection, which is described by ArtUK as being \"the only British collection of its kind still in its original setting\", were bequeathed to the city in 1944 by Emma Holt and is now managed by National Museums Liverpool.\n\nSudley House closed for two years for a £1 million refurbishment, re-opening on 26 May 2007. This included redecorating in the Aesthetic style of George Holt's era and also significantly modifying the first floor, where three new attractions were incorporated as follows:\n\n\n\"Pevsner\" says that those modifications create an architectural \"tension\" between showing the house as a house and as a museum. The ground floor library now includes a display about the Holt family. This includes an introductory film, family portraits and a model of the steamer \"Verdi\", which belonged to the Lamport and Holt shipping company that George Holt had co-founded in 1845.\n\n"}

It contained various contemporary methods of cultivating and improving land; of breeding, managing, and fattening cattle; of curing the various diseases etc. The whole was ranged in alphabetical order, and every thing, relating to the fame subject was contained in one article. It was supplemented with a Gardener's Kalendar for the use of farmers and others, which contained accounts of the work necessary to be done every month in the year, and accounts for the nursery and kitchen gardens.\n\n\"The Complete Farmer\" was written by anonymous writers, which used the pseudonym a \"Society of Gentlemen,\" only revealing that they were members of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, the later Royal Society of Arts. The content was based on the insides of the foremost authorities, which were listed as \"Carl Linnaeus, Michel Lullin de Chateauvieux, Marquis de Turbilly, Hugh Plat, John Evelyn, John Worlidge, John Mortimer, Jethro Tull, Ellis, Philip Miller, Thomas Hale, Edward Lisle, Roque, John Mills, Arthur Young.\" This work was first issued in 1756, and published in weekly numbers until 1768. The second enlarged and improved edition of the work was published shortly after the weekly publishing of first edition was finished to supply the demands of the public. The third edition was published in 1877, the fourth in 1793, and the last fifth edition in two volumes in 1807.\n\nAccording to Fussell (1930) \"The Complete Farmer\" was one of seven similar dictionaries published during the 18th century, of which the \"Dictionarium rusticum, urbanicum & botanicum,\" published in 1726, was the first. These dictionaries were the first of its kind in the British history only proceeded by 17th-century \"Dictionarium Rusticum\", which was published as supplement to Worlidge's \"Systema Agriculturae\" in 1669. There general works were intended to assist in the management of their estates. Other 18th-century general works of this kind, where Hall's \"A Compleat Body of Husbandry\", Lisle's \"Observations in Husbandry\", Mill's \"A New System of Practical Husbandry\", and Jethro Tull's \"Horse-Hoeing Husbandry.\"\n\nThe preface of \"The Complete Farmer\" commands husbandry ahead of all human arts, which had \"its birth with the world\". It starts with:\n\nHUSBANDRY is, with great justice, placed at the head of human arts, as having a very great advantage over all others, both with regard to antiquity and usefulness. It had its birth with the world, and has always been the genuine source of solid wealth, and real treasures; for it will furnish a people with everything necessary to render life happy and desirable, form the principal revenues of the state, and even supply the defect of all others, when they happen to fail.\n\nA definition of husbandry can be found in the lemma on husbandry, which also appeared in Temple Henry Croker et al. (1764) \"The complete dictionary of arts and sciences,\":\n\nHUSBANDRY, the business or employment of a farmer, or person who cultivates land, Bzc.Husbandry is divided into two kinds, and distinguished by the old and new. early times ; and the latter that introduced by the ingenious Mr. Tull, and often called the horse-hoeing husbandry...\n\nThe lemma on husbandry continues with a section on preparing the ground and the need of plowing, which also appeared in John Mills (1763) \"A New and Complete System of Practical Husbandry,\" stating:\n\n... Experience shews, that land, though ever so well tilled in the autumn, when wheat for example, is sown, hardens and soddens in the winter; its particles, beaten down by heavy rains, and funk by their own own weight, approach each other daily more and more ; the roots of the plants cultivated have consequently less and less room to extend themselves in quest of their necessary food ; and the interstices in the earth become of course so few and close, that they are not able to pierce through them; whilst weeds spring up, and rob them of their nourishment. By this means the earth, reduced to nearly the fame condition as if it had not been ploughed at all, is unable to assist the plants sown in it in the spring, when they ought to shoot with the greatest vigour. They consequently then stand most of all in need of the plough, to destroy the weeds, to lay fresh earth to their roots in the room of that earth which they have exhausted, to break the particles of the ground anew, so as to enable their roots to spread, in order to their gathering an ample provision of food, which then does them the greatest service.\n\nThe lemma continues over more than 100 paragraphs, extensively citing from multiple sources, presenting several systems of crop rotation, and other accounts. According to Smollett (1768) the whole article on husbandry gave a \"very full and accurate comparison..., from a variety of authors, between the profits arising from the different methods of cultivation, according to the precepts of the old and new husbandry.\"\n\nThe lemma on \"Agriculture\" gave an account on the origin and historical development of agriculture and agricultural writings. The origin of this art and science is synchronized with the Bible, and reads:\nThis art claims the precedency of all others in point of antiquity, it having been the sole employment of our first parents in the delightful garden of Eden.<br>Adam instructed his children in this necessary art, both by precepts and example; and we are told by the sacred historian, that Cain applied himself to husbandry, while Abel led the life of a shepherd, and contented himself with feeding his flocks.<br>After the deluge the descendants of Noah carried with them the art of husbandry, and established it in the various countries where they settled. It was, however, very simple in these early ages, and its advances towards perfection slow and almost imperceptible.<br>Abraham, and the rest of the patriarchs, who had no fixed residence, applied themselves to a pastoral life, ennobling, by their example, a profession, which has now for many ages lost its original dignity, from its being practised only by the meaner sort of people. But as soon as their descendants were fixed in Palestine, they all became husbandmen, from the chief of the tribe of Judah, to the lowest branch of the family of Benjamin : birth at that time made no distinction, and agriculture was considered as a very honourable employment.\n\nAbout the agriculture and agricultural writings in Ancient Greece it summarized:\n\nThe Athenians, who were the first that received any tincture of politeness, taught the use of corn to the rest of the Greeks they also taught them the manner of cultivating the ground, and preparing it for the seed. The Greeks soon perceived that bread was more wholesome, and its taste more delicate than acorns and accordingly thanked the gods for such an unexpected and beneficial present. After this the Athenian kings thinking it more glorious to govern a small state wisely, than to aggrandize themselves by foreign conquests, withdrew their subjects from war, and employed them solely in; cultivating the earth. This constant application carried agriculture to a considerable degree of perfection, and soon reduced it into an art.<br>Hesiod, who is generally thought to have been contemporary with Homer, was the first among the Greeks who wrote on this subject. He calls his poem, \" Works and Days;\" because agriculture requires exact observations of times and seasons.<br>The other eminent Greek writers upon agriculture, are Democritus of Abdera, Socraticus, Xenophon, Tarentinus, Architas, Aristotle, and Theophrastus, from whom the art received considerable improvements; as also from Hieron, Epicharmus, Philomctor, and Attalus.\n\nVia the old Romans and its decline in the Middle Ages, agriculture arose from its dormant state in the Renaissance, \"when Crescenzio published an excellent performance on agriculture at Florence. He was soon followed by several of his countrymen, among whom Tatti, Stefano, Agustino Gallo, Sansovino, Lauro, and Tarello, deserve particular honour.\" This further evolved in Britain, The Flemings, France, Ireland etc. until its state of that time.\n\nOne of the first reviews of this work by Tobias George Smollett (1768) gave the following summary of the specific topics of \"The Complete Farmer\":\n\nThe whole is ranged in alphabetical order, and every thing, relating to the fame subject is contained in one article. Thus the reader will find under the articles Wheat, Barley, Rye, Pease, Beans, Turnips, etc. the whole method of cultivation, and the various improvements that have been made with regard to each respectively.\n\nUnder the article Husbandry, a very full and accurate comparison is given, from a variety of authors, between the profits arising from the different methods of cultivation, according to the precepts of the old and new husbandry. Nor is this treatise confined to the different species of grain and vegetables cultivated in almost every part of the kingdom – those that are more uncommon, and confined as it were to particular districts, are also considered in a very full and ample manner ; such as Hemp, Flax, Hops, Madder, Maize, Potatoes, Saffron, Teazle, or Fuller's Thistle, Weld, or Dyer's Weed, etc.\n\nAnd also:\n\nWe have also here accounts of the advantages of cultivating Bore-cole, Cabbages, Carrots, Parsnips, etc. for feeding cattle together with the best methods of cultivation. The new species of grass in that time introduced are here described, and the best methods of cultivating them fully explained ; such as Bird-grass, Black-grass, Timothy-grass, etc. Under the articles Farm, Common, Hay, Inclosing, Mowing, Ploughing, Seed, Sowing, Threshing, etc. the reader will find very useful instructions and observations, many of which are perhaps no where else to be found. Besides the common machines used in the practice of husbandry, we have here ample descriptions and accurate drawings of Mr. Hewitt's new Horse-hoe, Mr. Comber's Cutting-box, Mr. Clarke's Draining-plough, Mr. Ogden's Fallow-cleansing Machine, Mr. Randall's Spiky Roller, etc. etc. Under the article Bee, the authors have given a very full account of that laborious and useful insect, together with all the improvements that have been made with regard to the management of Bees, and the methods of taking the wax and honey without destroying them, according to the practice off White; Thorley, and Wildman.\nNor is the theory of agriculture wholly omitted : the book is indeed chiefly intended to facilitate the practice of husbandry, and introduce the various improvements that have been lately made in that useful and necessary art; but it should at the fame time be remembered, that every method of practice is founded on reason or theory; arid accordingly the authors have explained, under the articles Air, Atmosphere, Food of Plants, Husbandry, Leaves, Sap, Vegetation, Water, etc. the operations of nature, and laid down a theory, which cannot fail of being agreeable to the curious reader.\n\nSmollett (1768) ended his review with the words: \nWe had almost forgot to mention, that under the article Surveying, the authors have given a compendious treatise of that useful art, in so plain and easy a manner that any person of a very moderate capacity, though a stranger to the method of measuring land, may soon be able to survey, plan, and protract any farm or parcel of land, without any other assistance. From the above account of this work, the reader will be able to form some idea of its use, at a time when the study of agriculture is pursued with great assiduity in every part of Europe.\n\nIn those days \"The Complete Farmer\" was widely read, and was used as reference up until the early 19th century. For example, Samuel Deane's \"The New-England Farmer\" from 1822 used about a dozen citations from that work. In the preface of the first edition of \"The Encyclopedia of Agriculture\", John Claudius Loudon (1825) ranked \"The Complete Farmer\" among the foremost publications on rural matters of the early 19th century. According to Loudon:\n\nThe subject of Agriculture admits of two grand divisions; the improvement and general management of landed property, which may be termed Territorial Economy; and the cultivation and treatment of its more useful animal and vegetable productions, which is called Husbandry, or Agriculture in a more limited sense of the term.\"\n\n\"The Complete Farmer\" embraced both of these departments. Loudon describes this work as \"copious to an excess, containing an immense mass of matter, new and old, good and bad.\" He is however clear in his judgement \"As a dictionary of Husbandry, it was the best of its kind at the time of its publication: but the rapid progress of Agriculture since its date, renders it at the present time quite an obsolete work.\"\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from various books and/or websites/\n\n"}

Sometimes billed as \"Earth's largest space museum\", astronaut Owen Garriott described the place as, \"a great way to learn about space in a town that has embraced the space program from the very beginning.\"\n\nOpened in 1970, just after the second manned mission to the lunar surface, the center not only showcases Apollo Program hardware but also houses interactive science exhibits, Space Shuttle and Army rocketry and aircraft. With more than 1,500 permanent rocketry and space exploration artifacts, as well as many rotating rocketry and space-related exhibits, the center occupies land carved out of Redstone Arsenal adjacent to Huntsville Botanical Garden at exit 15 on Interstate 565. The center offers bus tours of nearby Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\nTwo camp programs offer visitors the opportunity to stay on the grounds and learn more about their respective subject matter. U.S. Space Camp gives an in-depth exposure to the space program through participant use of simulators, lectures, and training exercises. Similarly, Aviation Challenge offers a taste of military fighter pilot training including simulations, lectures, and survival exercises. Both camps provide residential and day camp educational programs for children and adults. \n\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center has one of the most extensive collections of space artifacts and displays more than 1500 pieces. Displays include rockets, engines, spacecraft, simulators, and hands-on exhibits.\n\nThe Space & Rocket Center introduces visitors to U.S. rocketry efforts from its predecessor at Peenemünde with the German V-1 flying bomb, through a progression of U.S. military rockets up to the Saturn rocket family civilian rockets, and on to the Space Shuttle. The Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle, the only Saturn V of the three on display to have been brought together outside a museum, is displayed overhead in a new building designed specifically for the rocket. The Space Shuttle \"Pathfinder\" was the first Space Shuttle — a mockup made of steel and wood to test facilities for handling the vehicle — and it now sits atop an external tank with solid rocket boosters attached.\n\nThe center showcases significant military rockets, including representatives of the Project Nike series, which formed the first ballistic missile defense, MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile, Hermes, an early surface-to-surface missile, MGR-1 Honest John and Corporal nuclear missiles and Patriot, first used in the Gulf War of 1991.\nThe rocketry collection includes numerous engines, as well. In addition to the authentic engines mounted on rockets on display, the museum has unmounted engines on display, including two F-1s, the type of gigantic engine that produced to push Saturn Vs off the launch pad, J-2 engine that powered second and third stages of the Saturn V, and both Descent and Ascent Propulsion System (DPS/APS) engines for the Lunar Module. Engines from the V-2 engine to NERVA to the Space Shuttle Main Engine are on display as well.\n\nThe Apollo program gets full coverage in the Davidson Center for Space Exploration with artifacts outlining Apollo missions. Astronauts crossed the service structure's red walkway to the White Room, both on display, and climbed in the Command Module atop a Saturn V which was their cabin for the trip to the moon and back. Apollo 16's command module is on display. The Saturn V Instrument Unit controlled five F-1 engines in the first stage of the rocket as it lifted off the pad. Several exhibits relate the complexity and magnitude of that phase of the journey. They took a Lunar Module (mockup on display) to the lunar surface where they collected moon rocks such as the Apollo 12 specimen at the museum. Later moon trips took a Lunar Rover (displayed beside the LM). The first few moon trips ended at a Mobile Quarantine Facility (Apollo 12's is on display) where astronauts stayed to ensure containment of any moon bugs after that mission.\nA restored engineering mock-up of Skylab is also on display, showing the Apollo project's post-lunar efforts.\n\nVarious simulators help visitors understand the spaceflight experience. Space Shot lets the rider experience launch-like 4 gs and 2–3 seconds of weightlessness. G-Force Accelerator offers 3 gs of acceleration for an extended period by means of a centrifuge. Several other simulators entertain and educate visitors.\n\nOther exhibits offer a hands-on understanding of concepts related to rocketry or space travel. A bell jar demonstrates the reason for using a rocket instead of a propeller in the vacuum of space. A wind tunnel offers visitors the opportunity to manipulate a model to see how forces change with its orientation, and The Mind of Saturn exhibit demonstrates gyroscopic force (necessary for rocket navigation). An Apollo trainer offers visitors the opportunity to climb in.\nSome simulators on exhibit were used for astronaut training. A Project Mercury simulator shows the cramped conditions endured by the first Americans in space. A Gemini simulator shows visitors the accommodations when two people flew together to space for the first U.S. missions involving extra-vehicular activities and space rendezvous.\n\nExhibits also cover the future of space flight. Two Orion CEV exhibits show the next NASA spacecraft, and a Bigelow Aerospace commercial habitat model details a space tourism effort.\n\nTwo play areas offer places indoors and out for children to release some energy. The outdoor play area offers a miniature (and slower) Space Shot ride along with slides and tunnels, all under a canopy. The indoor area fosters imaginative play about a trip to Mars with a space ship and some cartoon \"aliens\".\n\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center is also the resting place of Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey who flew on a suborbital test flight of the PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on May 28, 1959. Baker lived in a facility at the Center from 1971 until she died of kidney failure in November 1984.\n\nThe Space & Rocket Center offers bus tours of Marshall Space Flight Center. The tour offers views of all four National Historic Landmarks at the center including a stop at the landmark Redstone Test Stand, where Alan Shepard's Redstone Rocket was tested prior to launch. Another scheduled stop is the Payload Operations and Integration Center, which serves as mission control for a number of experiments. Bus tours originally started July 4, 1972, but were suspended following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Tours resumed July 20, 2012, the 43rd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, limited to United States citizens because of security protocol at the Army installation, Redstone Arsenal, which contains Marshall Space Flight Center.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, the Space and Rocket Center began hosting traveling exhibits. The first was with other exhibits planned. The United States Space Camp hosted at the facility has provided themed camps in conjunction with the exhibits, including a Jedi Experience camp.\n\nOther traveling exhibits include:\n\nThe idea for the museum was first proposed by Dr. Wernher von Braun, who led the efforts of the United States to land the first man on the moon. Plans for the museum were underway in 1960 with an economic feasibility study for the Huntsville-Madison County Chamber of Commerce.\n\nVon Braun, understanding the dominance of football in the Alabama culture, persuaded rival Alabama and Auburn coaches Bear Bryant and Shug Jordan to appear in a television commercial supporting a $1.9 million statewide bond referendum to finance museum construction. The referendum passed on November 30, 1965, and a donation of land from the Army's Redstone Arsenal provided a location on which to build.\n\nTo help draw tourists from far afield, the center needed a crown jewel. The Huntsville Times reported, Center director \"Edward O. Buckbee is the type of guy with the tenacity to 'arrange' for this planet's largest, most complex mechanical beast to become a part of the Alabama Space and Rocket Center at Huntsville. / Pulling off the coup – getting a Saturn 5 moon rocket here which cost 90 times the center itself – was 'a little difficult,' admits Buckbee in a galloping understatement.\" Buckbee worked with von Braun to see that the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle would be delivered to the site as it was on June 28, 1969. The Saturn I which stands erect at the museum was delivered the same day. Initial plans called for visitors to walk through the Saturn V. The center opened in 1970.\n\nThe Space & Rocket Center was a \"major sponsor\" of the United States pavilion at the 1982 World's Fair, providing exhibits on space and energy as well as equipment and operations for the IMAX theater at the fair. At the time, the Space & Rocket Center also served as the Alabama Energy Information Center. The Spacedome IMAX theater at the museum opened December 19, 1982.\n\nMike Wing plunged the Center into debt as its executive director from 1998 to 1999. Wing oversaw construction of a full-scale vertical Saturn V replica to be finished at by the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, July 1999. It serves as a towering landmark in Huntsville, and cost the center $8.6 million of borrowed money. The Huntsville Times estimated interest costs at $10 million. Wing also sought to create a program for fifth grade students in Alabama and elsewhere to attend Space Camp at no cost to them. Anonymous corporate pledges that Wing promised would fund the $800 per student never arrived. Wing prolonged the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission's investigation into the pledges by writing bogus personal checks and having the center record them as received. The program ultimately cost the center $7.5 million. Wing was pressured to resign, and several members of the governing Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission were ousted from that board as a result of the debacle. At the end of Wing's term as director, the center was $26 million in debt. The state sued Wing for $7.5 million over the Space Camp fraud. They settled for $500,000.\n\nThe expenditures would shape more than the next decade for the center. The new board of directors included Larry Capps who was selected to head the museum on February 9, 2000 after Wing. He reduced the debt to $16 million while also building the Davidson Center for Space Exploration and moving the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle into its custom-built facility. Capps was director through his retirement in 2010.\n\nDr. Deborah Barnhart, who headed Space Camp from 1986-1990, was selected to run the museum in 2010. She has since brought Orion and other post-Shuttle training apparatus to Space Camp and retired the center's line of credit, reducing interest expenditures. The center had about $13 million debt in May, 2014.\n\nHuntsville architect David Crowe designed the initial building with of exhibit space. An Omnimax (now called IMAX Dome) theater was installed prior to February 28, 1984. The movie SpaceCamp preceded droves more campers (5,000 in 1986 to 11,000 in 1987), for whom facilities were expanded again.\n\nSince 1969, Huntsville residents could point to the Saturn I rocket at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center as a distant landmark (located a few miles from the city center). In 1999, a full-scale model of the Saturn V rocket was erected, standing nearly twice as tall as the Saturn I.\n\nSince 1979, a Saturn IB rocket owned by the museum stands at the Alabama Welcome Center in Ardmore \"as a reminder to visitors of Alabama's role in the space program.\"\n\nA $3 million NASA Educator Resource Center was built during Larry Capps's tenure.\nThe newest addition to the U.S. Space & Rocket Center is the Davidson Center for Space Exploration, named after Dr. Julian Davidson, founder of Davidson Technologies. The building opened January 31, 2008. The Davidson Center was designed to house the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and many other space exploration exhibits. The vehicle is elevated above the floor surface with separated stages and engines exposed, so visitors have the opportunity to walk underneath the rocket. The Davidson Center also features a 3D movie theater in addition to the IMAX theater in the original museum.\n\nWhen the Davidson Center opened in 2008, the museum's ticket center and entrance was relocated to the Davidson Center, so it is now the first exhibit museum visitors experience. This, however, necessitated that visitors enter the original museum through the rear doors, causing it to be viewed out of its original sequence.\n\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center is owned by the State of Alabama and operated by the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission (ASSEC) whose 18 members are appointed by the Governor for terms of four or eight years. The composition and authority of the board are set forth in Title 41, Article 15 of the Code of Alabama. ASSEC meetings are open to the public.\n\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center Foundation is a nonprofit organization that raises funds for the ASSEC.\n\nThe Space & Rocket Center saw 540,153 visitors in 2010 and 553,137 in 2011, and over 584,000 in 2013, the latter earning the museum recognition as the top paid tourist attraction in Alabama. In 2017, more than 786,820 people visited the center, ranking it first among state attractions that charge admission, according to the Alabama Department of Tourism.\n\nThe NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge, previously known as the Great Moonbuggy Race, has run every year since 1994, and all but the first two have been held at the Space & Rocket Center. The race challenges high school and college students to design and build a small moonbuggy that they can assemble on-site and ride across a simulated lunar terrain.\n\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center was the setting for feature films \"Space Warriors\", \"SpaceCamp\", and \"Beyond the Stars\", along with the made-for-TV movie \"A Smile as Big as the Moon\".\n\nThe U.S. Space & Rocket Center was the site of a roadblock and pitstop at the end of Leg 3 of \"\" aired in October 2005.\n\n\"Good Morning America\" has featured the Space & Rocket Center multiple times. In their 2006 proclamation the \"Seven wonders of America\", GMA selected the Saturn V and particularly featured the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center.\n\n"}
{"id": "21513165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21513165", "title": "Uigwe", "text": "Uigwe\n\nUigwe () is the generic name given to a vast collection of approximately 3,895 books recording in detail the royal rituals and ceremonies of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. There is no generally agreed English translation; some scholars suggest \"book of state rites\", while the \"Glossary of Korean Studies\" from the Korea Foundation suggests \"manual of the state event\" or \"rubrica for a state ceremony.\" The expression \"Royal Protocols\" (of the Joseon Dynasty) is widely used.\n\nThe collection of Uigwe, was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme in 2007.\n\nCombining text and detailed illustrations, each Uigwe preserves the records of the Superintendency (\"dogam\"), set up temporarily to plan and carry out special state rites. These rites included investitures, coronations, weddings, banquets, the painting of royal portraits, funerals and ancestral rites. Each Uigwe, some in several volumes with several copies, was written either by hand but more often printed using woodblocks for the History Archive copies. Most of the Uigwe, had one exclusive edition for the king, distinguished by silk covers, high quality paper, binding, superior handwriting and overall presentation, was intended to serve as the royal viewing copy. The silk covers used exclusively for the king were made of quality silk, had superior patterns often of clouds, and usually had red decorations around its borderline. Four to nine other copied version for scholars were kept for each of the four state archives, which for most of the Joseon period were located on Mount Jeongjoksan on Ganghwa-do Island; Mount Jeoksang in Muju-gun County, Jeollabuk-do Province; Mount Odaesan in Gangwon-do Province and Mount Taebaeksan in Yeongwol-gun County. The Uigwe for funerals and weddings includes large and detailed images of processions, often involving thousands of participants.\n\nIn 1782, the Outer Gyujanggak library (known as Oe-Gyujang-gak) was built in the ancient royal palace on Ganghwa-do Island to accommodate an overflow of books from the main Gyujanggak library at Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul, where the royal viewing copies were kept, and most of the viewing copies were transferred there. In 1866, after the execution of a number of French Catholic missionaries in Korea, a French expeditionary force came from China to seek explanations, resulting in the French campaign against Korea. Unable to gain access to the authorities, the troops attacked Ganghwa-do Island and seized the royal books, along with a vast amount of silverware and other royal artifacts. The books were kept at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris soon after their arrival in France. They were largely forgotten until Korean scholar, Park Byeong-sen, discovered them in 1975, whilst working there as a librarian.\n\nFollowing the discovery, the return was officially requested in 1992. In 1993, then-French President François Mitterrand returned one copy during a visit to Seoul to sell its high-speed TGV train technology; with the promised to return the remaining collection. The Korean Government tried to retrieve the royal documents through a permanent lease, since French law prohibits national assets to be transferred abroad. In 2010, a Seoul-based civic group spearhead the return but the request to exclude illegally obtained property from its list of national assets was rejected by a Paris court.\n\nAfter a series of long disputes and negotiations, an agreement was made by President Lee Myung-bak and President Nicolas Sarkozy at the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit to return the documents on a five-year renewable loan basis. From April to June 2011, 297 volumes with 191 different Uigwes, were shipped back in four separate installments.\n\nIn 1922, during the Korea under Japanese rule, many volumes of books including 167 of Uigwe, along with some 1,000 other relics, stored at the royal Gyujanggak library at Changdeokgung Palace and history archive in the Buddhist temple at Mount Odaesan were transferred to the University of Tokyo. They were stored at the University of Tokyo. Hence were not included in the list of artifacts to be returned compiled in 1965, when the two countries signed a treaty which normalized diplomatic ties.\n\nIn November 2008, Seoul City Council passed a resolution urging Japan to return the uigwe. The looted collection is believed to have included Empress Myeongseong's state funeral protocol, that lasted for about two years following her murder by Japanese assassins in Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1895.\n\nIn August 2010, then-Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced the return of the Uigwe to mark the centenary of Japanese annexation of Korea. Then in October 2011, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda returned five copies during his visit to Seoul in a bid to improve relations. The copies chronicled the royal rituals of King Gojong and King Sunjong, the last two emperors of Joseon dynasty and Korean Empire before Korea was annexed in 1910. This was followed, after a 16-month process, by the return of 1,200 volumes including 150 Uigwe in December 2011.\n\nThe Uigwe that remained in Korea were preserved and housed in the Gyujanggak library at Seoul National University, and as part of the Jangseogak collection at Academy of Korean Studies. Gyujanggak library has the largest collection, with 2,940 volumes with 546 different Uigwe; while the latter has 490 volumes with 287 different Uigwe.\n\nThe 297 copies of the Uigwes that were returned from France, are housed at the National Museum of Korea, where a special exhibition, \"The Return of the Oegyujanggak Uigwe from France: Records of the State Rites of the Joseon Dynasty\", was held from 19 July to 18 September 2011.\n\nIn June 2011, ahead of the exhibition, the Museum showcased five of the copies to the media. They were \nselected for their historical significance and to demonstrate the wide range of activities recorded in different kinds of Uigwe. They were:\n\nThe Uigwe for a Royal Feast is the oldest copy that was looted by the French. It recorded the royal feast held by King Injo of Joseon in March 1630, wishing for longevity and good health for Queen Dowager Inmok. It is also one of the few \"copied\" versions as most of them are reportedly original editions that were exclusively printed for the king. The museum stated that three of the five shown do not have any surviving copied versions. Also a couple of silk covers of other volumes were displayed separately as Bibliothèque nationale de France removed 286 of them for restoration in the 1970s. Which were returned along with the 297 volumes.\n\nThe copies that were returned by Japan are housed at the National Palace Museum of Korea with a special exhibition from 27 December 2011 to 5 February 2012.\n\nTo mark the return of the stolen Uigwe on 2011 by French Government, a special episode of Running Man (Episode 48) was aired. In this episode, the Running Man members have to find 'the sleeping Uigwe' that was stored in the underground section. Song Ji-hyo won this episode.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "879245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=879245", "title": "Villa of the Papyri", "text": "Villa of the Papyri\n\nThe Villa of the Papyri (, also known as \"Villa dei Pisoni\") is named after its unique library of \"papyri\" (or scrolls), but is also one of the most luxurious houses in all of Herculaneum and in the Roman world. Its luxury is shown by its exquisite architecture and by the very large number of outstanding works of art discovered, including frescoes, bronzes and marble sculpture which constitute the largest collection of Greek and Roman sculptures ever discovered in a single context.\n\nIt is located in the current \"comune\" of Ercolano, southern Italy. It was situated on the ancient coastline below the volcano Vesuvius with nothing to obstruct the view of the sea. It was perhaps owned by Julius Caesar's father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus. Barker 1908 suggested Philodemus was owner of the Villa of the Papyri Library.\n\nIn AD 79, the eruption of Vesuvius covered all of Herculaneum with some 30 m of volcanic ash. Herculaneum was first excavated in the years between 1750 and 1765 by Karl Weber by means of underground tunnels. The villa's name derives from the discovery of its library, the only surviving library from the Graeco-Roman world that exists in its entirety. It contained over 1,800 papyrus scrolls, now carbonised by the heat of the eruption, the \"Herculaneum papyri\".\n\nMost of the villa is still underground, but parts have been cleared of volcanic deposits. Many of the finds are displayed in the Naples National Archaeological Museum. The Getty Villa is a reproduction of the Villa of the Papyri.\n\nSited a few hundred metres from the nearest house in Herculaneum, the villa's front stretched for more than along the coastline of the Gulf of Naples. It was surrounded by a garden closed off by porticoes, but with an ample stretch of gardens, vineyards and woods down to a small harbour.\n\nIt has recently been ascertained that the height of the main floor in antiquity was no less than above sea level, and the villa had four architectural levels underneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.\n\nThe villa's layout is faithful to, but enlarges upon, the architectural scheme of suburban villas in the country around Pompeii. The atrium functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.\n\nThe first peristyle had 10 columns on each side and a swimming pool in the centre. In this enclosure were found the bronze herma of Doryphorus, a replica of Polykleitos' athlete, and the herma of an Amazon made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens. The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large tablinum in which, under a propylaeum, was the archaic statue of Athena Promachos. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of Scipio Africanus.\nThe living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden \"capsae\", some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.\n\nThe grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, hermae and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.\n\nThe luxury of the villa is evidenced not only by the many works of art, but especially by the large number of rare bronze statues found there, all masterpieces. The villa housed a collection of at least 80 sculptures of magnificent quality, many now conserved in the Naples National Archaeological Museum. Among them is the bronze \"Seated Hermes\", found at the villa in 1758. Around the bowl of the atrium impluvium were 11 bronze fountain statues depicting Satyrs pouring water from a pitcher and Amorini pouring water from the mouth of a dolphin. Other statues and busts were found in the corners around the atrium walls.\n\nFive statues of life-sized bronze dancing women wearing the Doric peplos sculpted in different positions and with inlaid eyes are adapted Roman copies of originals from the fifth century BC. They are also hydrophorai drawing water from a fountain.\n\nThe owner of the house, perhaps Calpurnius Piso, established a library of a mainly philosophical character. It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso's family friend and client, the Epicurean Philodemus of Gàdara, although his conclusion is not certain. Followers of Epicurus studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at Herculaneum and Naples. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand papyrus rolls in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after Cicero, Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age. None of his prose work was known until the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri.\nAt the time of the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79, the valuable library was packed in cases ready to be moved to safety when it was overtaken by a pyroclastic flow; the eruption eventually deposited some 20–25 m of volcanic ash over the site, charring the scrolls but preserving them – the only surviving library of Antiquity – as the ash hardened to form tuff.\n\nThe Bourbon excavations were halted in 1765 due to complaints from the residents living above. The exact location of the villa was then lost for two centuries. In the 1980s work on re-discovering the villa began by studying 18th century documentation on entrances to the tunnels and in 1986 the breakthrough was made through an ancient well. The backfill from some of the tunnels was cleared to allow re-exploration of the villa when it was found that the parts of the villa that survived the Bourbon robbers were still remarkable in quantity and quality.\n\nExcavation to expose part of the villa was done in the 1990s and revealed two previously undiscovered lower floors to the villa with frescoes in situ. These were found along the southwest-facing terrace of about 4 metres height. The first row of rooms lying below the arcade was eveidenced by a series of rectangular openings along the façade.\n\nLimited excavations recommenced at the site in 2007 to preserve the remains when beautifully carved parts of wood and ivory furniture were discovered. Since then limited public access became available.\n\nAs of 2012, there are still 2,800 m left to be excavated of the villa. The remainder of the site has not been excavated because the Italian government is preferring conservation to excavation, and protecting what has already been uncovered. David Woodley Packard, who has funded conservation work at Herculaneum through his Packard Humanities Institute, has said that he is likely to be able to fund excavation of the Villa of the Papyri when the authorities agree to it; but no work will be permitted on the site until the completion of a feasibility report, which has been in preparation for some years. The first part of the report emerged in 2008 but included no timetable or cost projections, since the decision for further excavation is a political one. Politics involve excavation under inhabited areas in addition to unspecified but reported references to mafia involvement.\n\nUsing multi-spectral imaging, a technique developed in the early 1990s, it is possible to read the burned papyri. With multi-spectral imaging, many pictures of the illegible papyri are taken using different filters in the infrared or in the ultraviolet range, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, the optimum spectral portion can be found for distinguishing ink from paper on the blackened papyrus surface.\n\nNon-destructive CT scans will, it is hoped, provide breakthroughs in reading the fragile unopened scrolls without destroying them in the process. Encouraging results along this line of research have been obtained, which use Phase-contrast X-ray imaging. \nAccording to authors, \"this pioneering research opens up new prospects not only for the many papyri still unopened, but also for others that have not yet been discovered, perhaps including a second library of Latin papyri at a lower, as yet unexcavated level of the Villa.\"\n\nIn 1970, oil billionaire J. Paul Getty engaged the architectural firm of Langdon and Wilson to create a replica of the Villa dei Papiri to serve as an art museum based on his collection of antiquities. \n\nBased on Weber's plans published in \"Le Antichità di Ercolano\", the museum was built on Getty's Malibu ranch in 1972-74. Architectural consultant Norman Neuerburg and the curator of Getty's antiquities, Jiří Frel, worked closely with Getty and the architects to insure the accuracy of the museum building's design . \n\nSince the Villa dei Papiri was unexcavated, Neuerburg based many of the villa's architectural and landscaping details on elements from other ancient Roman houses in the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae.. For example, the mosaic fountain in the museum's garden peristyle replicates the one in the Nymphaeum of the House of the Large Fountain at Pompeii). \n\nIn 1997, the Getty Museum was relocated to the Getty Center. The Malibu villa was renovated and reopened in 2006. The reconceived Getty Villa, as it is now called, serves as an annex dedicated to the display of the museum's antiquities and as a center for the study of ancient art.\n\nSeveral scenes in Robert Harris' bestselling novel \"Pompeii\" are set in the Villa of the Papyri, just before the eruption engulfed it. The villa is mentioned as belonging to Roman aristocrat Pedius Cascus and his wife Rectina. (Pliny the Younger mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his Letters.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, Pliny the Elder, who commands the Roman Navy at Misenum on the other side of the Bay of Naples. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library – which is thus left for modern archaeologists to find.\n\nAccording to the 1908 publication \"Buried Herculaneum\" by Ethel Ross Barker, there were busts of Athene Gorgolopha, Archaistic Pallas, Archaic Apollo, Head of an Amazon, Dionysus or Plato (? Poseidon), Doryphorus, Mercury, Homer, Ptolemy Alexander (Alexander the Great?), Ptolemy Philadelphus, Ptolemy Soter I (Seleucus Nicator I), and the mythological Danaids and others.\nIllustrations included scenes with, Head with the wreathed helmet (Pyrrhus of Epirus?), Archimedes (Archidamus III?), Attilius Regulus (Philetairus of Pergamum?), Pseudo-Seneca (Philetas of Cos?), Berenice, Heraclitus, Ptolemy Lathyrus, Ptolemy Soter II, Sappho, Berenice, Warrior in a helmet, Scipio Africanus, Head of a Vestal (Woman unknown), Hannibal or Juba, and Head with a headdress.\n\nFrescoes included, Theseus victorious over the Minotaur, Telephus suckled by the hind, Chiron teaching Achilles the lyre, Perseus slaying Medusa, a charioteer, and papyri.\n\n\n\n"}

It was an important development in the history of Poland and Lithuania that extended religious tolerance to nobility and free persons within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and is considered the formal beginning of religious freedom in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Although it did not prevent all conflict based on religion, it did make the Commonwealth a much safer and more tolerant place than most of contemporaneous Europe, especially during the subsequent Thirty Years' War.\n\nReligious tolerance in Poland had had a long tradition (e.g. Statute of Kalisz) and had been \"de facto\" policy in the reign of the recently deceased King Sigismund II. However, the articles signed by the Confederation gave official sanction to earlier custom. In that sense, they may be considered either the beginning or the peak of Polish tolerance.\n\nFollowing the childless death of the last king of the Jagiellon dynasty, Polish and Lithuanian nobles (szlachta) gathered at Warsaw to prevent any separatists from acting and to maintain the existing legal order. For that the citizens had to unconditionally abide the decisions made by the body; and the confederation was a potent declaration that the two former states are still closely linked.\n\nIn January the nobles signed a document in which representatives of all the major religions pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. A new political system was arising, aided by the confederation which contributed to its stability. Religious tolerance was an important factor in a multiethnic and multi-religious state, as the territories of the Commonwealth were inhabited by many generations of people from different ethnic backgrounds (Poles, Lithuanians, Ruthenian, Germans and Jews) and of different denominations (Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish and even Muslim). \"This country became what Cardinal Hozjusz called “a place of shelter for heretics”. It was a place where the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in other countries of the Christian world, sought refuge.\n\nThis act was not imposed by a government or by consequences of war, but rather resulted from the actions of members of Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the 1572 French St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such an act in Poland.\n\nThe people most involved in preparing the articles were Mikołaj Sienicki (leader of the \"execution movement\"), Jan Firlej and Jan Zborowski. Their efforts were opposed by many dignitaries of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThey were opposed by most of the Catholic priests: Franciszek Krasiński was the only bishop who signed them (Szymon Starowolski claimed he did so under the \"threat of the sword\"), and the future legal acts containing the articles of the Confederation were signed by bishops with the stipulation: \"excepto articulo confoederationis.\" Another bishop, Wawrzyniec Goślicki, was excommunicated for signing the acts of the Sejm of 1587.\n\nThe articles of the Warsaw Confederation were later incorporated into the Henrician Articles, and thus became constitutional provisions alongside the \"Pacta conventa\" also instituted in 1573.\n\nLate-16th-century Poland stood between the Orthodox Muscovy in the East, the Muslim Ottoman Empire to the South, and Western Europe, torn between Reformation and Counter-Reformation, to the North and West. Its religious tolerance made it a welcome refuge for those escaping religious persecution elsewhere; in the words of Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, it became “a place of shelter for heretics”. The confederation legalized the previously unwritten customs of religious tolerance.\n\nThere is debate as to whether religious freedom was intended only for the nobility or also for the peasants and others; most historians favor the latter interpretation.\n\nIn 2003, the text of the Warsaw Confederation was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The PC World Test Center uses this same tool every month to test contenders for PC World's Top Desktop PCs and Top Notebook PCs charts. WorldBench is also used in conjunction with other tests to evaluate Top Graphics Boards, Top Hard Drives, and other product categories.\n\nThe PC World Test Center is currently on WorldBench 6, which specializes in tests for the 32 and 64-bit platforms of the Windows Operating System from Windows XP on. Ongoing beta testing for a power-consumption analysis tool that will be incorporated into the next version of WorldBench, along with several other new additions, is currently taking place in the PCWorld Lab.\n\nWorldBench is no longer available to the public, and the test suite is now exclusively used by the PCWorld Lab in their benchmarks.\n\nWorldBench uses popular desktop applications to perform realistic tasks, making it easier to accurately gauge how fast a computer runs applications routinely used, rather than just listing abstract measures of individual components. The application-based tests tell exactly what is needed—how fast the computer runs real applications. WorldBench installs special versions of each application tested, enabling the automated test scripts to perform every test. It also ensures that the software configuration and version are identical for every computer evaluated. The setup program installs the user interface, testing scripts, and all documents necessary to complete the tasks. It also unpacks and installs each application as needed during testing.\n\nOnce a test is completed, the program removes the unpacked application from the hard drive.\n\nFor security reasons, none of the test applications can be installed from the WorldBench CD.\n\nWhen a test is started from WorldBench, the benchmark manager begins running the test script. This script is a series of commands—menu requests, keystrokes, and mouse clicks—that cause the application to step through typical tasks. For example, in Microsoft Office, the script starts by unpacking the version of Office embedded on the WorldBench CD. Then it opens the included test documents, copies and pastes text, changes the documents’ formatting, checks spelling, and undertakes other tasks that are likely to be performed using Office. When Office has finished all the steps in the script, the benchmark closes Office.\n\nThe following process is the testing sequence supported by each test:\n\nAfter each test, the computer is shut down and restarted to release all memory and ready the system for the next test. The computer is also restarted after the initial system setup and final clean-up processes, which prepare it for testing and restore it to its original state.\n\nWorldbench is no longer being sold, and support for existing customers ends mid-2012.\n\n"}
