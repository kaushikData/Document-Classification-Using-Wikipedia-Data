This was the year after the death of Sir Walter Scott, whose residence of Abbotsford House gave the society its name, and whose literature the club's publications sought to illuminate. The club was modelled on the Roxburghe Club, of which Scott himself had been a member, as well as the Bannatyne Club, which was founded by Scott, and the Glasgow-centred Maitland Club. The founder and first secretary of the club was William Barclay Turnbull, a young Edinburgh lawyer. The stated objective of the Abbotsford Club was \"the printing of Miscellaneous Pieces, illustrative of History, Literature, and Antiquities\". Through its publishing activity, the club did much to promote the proliferation of Middle English literature. The Abbotsford Club effectively ceased publication in 1866. \n\nThe club was housed at 25 Great King Street in Edinburgh's Second New Town.\n\nThe complete publications of the Abbotsford Club are available online from the National Library of Scotland.\n"}

Among its many highlights include the Dordogne cave paintings and the skeleton of Lucy.\n\nAs stated upon its 2007 reopening, the mission of the hall is to \"combine discoveries in the fossil record with the latest genomic science to explore the most profound mysteries of humankind: who we are, where we came from, and what is in store for the future of our species. We will explore human biology and anatomy, trace the path of human evolution, and examine the origins of human creativity.\"\n\nThe hall starts with the present homo sapiens and traces its evolution backwards through time, while examining anthropology including music, art and technology. As the visitor winds through the hall, significant stops are made by life sized dioramas of \"Australopithecus afarensis\", \"Homo ergaster\", Neanderthal, and Cro-Magnon in an attempt to demonstrate the behaviors and capabilities of human predecessors. By the dioramas are actual archeological finds that showcase the evolution of creativity and brain development. Also displayed are full-sized casts of important fossils, including the 3.2-million-year-old Lucy skeleton and the 1.7-million-year-old Turkana Boy, and \"Homo erectus\" specimens including a cast of Peking Man.\n\nIn the 1999 film Election, Matthew Broderick's character compares his humiliating story to the apelike model of Homo ergaster.\n"}

Most of the contributions are from United States based institutions, but many other countries are represented, including Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. ArchiveGrid is associated with OCLC Research and helps to advance their goals of making archival collections and materials easier to find. ArchiveGrid is described as \"the ultimate destination for searching through family histories, political papers, and historical records held in archives around the world.\" \n\nResearch Libraries Group (RLG) was founded in 1974 by three universities (Columbia, Harvard, and Yale) and The New York Public Library. In 1998, RLG launched the RLG Archival Resources database, which offered online access to the holdings of archival collections. RLG began to redesign the database in 2004 in order to make it more useful for researchers. As a result of this redesign, RLG launched ArchiveGrid in March 2006. As a result of a grant, ArchiveGrid was freely accessible until May 31, 2006.\n\nIn 2006, the RLG and the Online Computer Learning Center, Inc.

{"id": "45415344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45415344", "title": "Art Apart Fair", "text": "Art Apart Fair\n\nArt Apart Fair is Singapore's first hotel-based boutique art fair. Initially called Worlds Apart Fair in January 2013, the success of the fair encouraged a second edition, later renamed as Art Apart Fair as part of a series of \"Apart Fairs\".\n\nArt Apart coincides with Singapore Art Week, an initiative launched by the National Arts Council, along with the Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Economic Development Board.\n\nThe fairs take place twice biannually – during January and July – in Singapore. Art Apart made its international debut in London in October 2014 at the Town Hall Hotel. It will be setting its stage in New York in October 2016.\n\nArt Apart Fair serves as a platform to provide support towards emerging artists with the potential to become established. The fair gives artists the opportunity to showcase their works and gain recognition among art lovers and collectors. In January 2014, some 33 galleries and 1,500 artists' work from countries such as Taiwan, China, Australia, Kazakhstan, Croatia, Japan, Vietnam, Austria, Cambodia, South Korea, Russia, Spain and Germany, were featured.\n\nSome of the galleries that have exhibited with Art Apart are South Korea's Seoul Arts Centre, Shanghai's Nancy Gallery, Madrid's Jorge & Fernando Alcolea Gallery and Russia's Gallery 11.12.\n\nIn comparison to other art fairs, Art Apart focuses on selecting galleries with emerging artists with a possibility of becoming established in their national or international market.\n\nDue to the high costs of exhibiting at art fairs and the presence of many artists struggling to succeed financially, there is an \"Adopt An Artist\" initiative, where a Patron of the Arts and sponsors help to fund these artists. Galleries that are invited to showcase new works at Art Apart also help support the emerging artists by paying for the exhibiting fee. Works have to be new and not shown at other art fairs before.\n\nBesides providing support for emerging artists, part of the revenue generated from the sales of art works and tickets goes towards helping the young and elderly in Singapore. One of the beneficiaries includes Halogen Foundation, an educational charity that helps to develop young leaders and entrepreneurs. Another beneficiary is the Lions Befrienders Service Association, Singapore's largest direct service voluntary welfare organisation, that assists the elderly and helps them engage with the community.\n\nThe idea of holding an art fair in a hotel first originated in 1994 as the Gramercy International Art Fair in the rooms of Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City. The fair was highly successful, and it is now renamed \"The Armory Show\".\n\nThe concept of a hotel-based art fair breaks the conventional presentation of art in a whitewashed gallery space. Visitors are provided with a good idea of how these works would look like in a home setting, as they are being displayed in a more informal setting, such as on beds, table tops, chairs and even bathrooms.\n\nInspired by this layout, Art Apart founder and director Rosalind Lim decided to bring the idea over to Singapore. With over 38 years of experience in diverse fields, such as Public Relations, Branding, Marketing and Event Management, she built the foundation for the first successful hotel art fair – the Worlds Apart Fair in January 2013 at Conrad Centennial Singapore. The fair was later renamed Art Apart Fair and moved to Parkroyal on Pickering, where the entire 14th floor – rooms, lobbies and corridors – is converted into art galleries.\n\nThe inaugural edition of Worlds Apart Fair was held from 25 to 27 January 2013 in 40 rooms at Conrad Centennial Singapore, and saw more than 3,000 visitors and buyers. The fair showcased some 3,400 art works, ranging from paintings and photography to video art, sculptures and installations.\n\nWorlds Apart Fair featured emerging contemporary artists from Asia, Africa, Lebanon, Europe, the Americas and Australia, with a greater focus on rising artists from Singapore. Some of the galleries that exhibited in clude Vertical Submarine (Singapore), Villa Del Arte Galleries (Spain) and Art Bridge Contemporary (Korea).\n\nTwo Chinese talents, Singaporean actor Qi Yuwu and renowned Chinese artist Feng Zhengjie collaborated for the first time specially for this fair and presented their work 'Showcase on Print'.\n\nWorlds Apart was renamed as Art Apart as part of a series of \"Apart Fairs\".\n\nThe second edition of Art Apart was held from 5 to 7 July 2013 at Parkroyal on Pickering, and featured over 120 Asian artists and galleries. The art works were focused on Korea and revolved around themes such as \"Korean Wave\", \"Asian Spirit\" and \"Butterfly Effect\".\n\nIn addition to the display of artworks, the fair included talks by prominent artists and industry experts from around Asia.\n\nAbout 3,000 visitors attended Art Apart Fair 2nd Edition.\n\nThe third edition of Art Apart took place from 17 to 19 January 2014, showcased more than 1,500 art pieces from 12 countries, including Germany, South Korea, Russia and the Philippines.\n\nBesides housing exhibitions such as \"The Destruction of the Readymade Everyday\", the main theme for Art Apart 3rd Edition was \"The Artists' Garden\" – a selection of 100 art pieces from the 33 participating galleries.\n\nOver 4,000 people visited the art fair, an increase from the 2nd Edition.\n\nThe fourth edition of Art Apart was held from 18 to 20 July 2014, where more than 2,000 art pieces were exhibited, with a focus on works by Russian artists. The aim of the event was to introduce Eastern European Art, such as works from Moscow, Kazakhstan, Croatia and Slovenia.\n\nApart from the display of art pieces, there were live paintings of portraits, talks by Russian art experts and Russian Art Performance.\n\nSimilar to the previous edition, over 4,000 visitors visited Art Apart 4th Edition.\n\nThe fifth edition of Art Apart was held from 23 to 25 January 2015 at Parkroyal on Pickering. Unlike past editions where the curations were focused on specific countries, such as Singapore, Korea and Russia, this edition showcased contemporary art, highlighted conceptual art works and urban art works by street artists from all around the world. Some of the featured artists include emerging Russian artists Rinat Voligamsi and Maxim Bashev, German artist Kaja el Attar and French artist Bruno Tanquerel.\n\nEight galleries from the previous editions of Art Apart made a return, such as Utterly Art, Gaze Gallery and Seoul Arts Centre.\n\nOver 4,000 visitors attended the fifth edition of the art fair.\n\nThe sixth edition of Art Apart was held from 17 to 19 July 2015. Art Apart Fair featured artworks from the Philippines. The finest Filipino galleries including Big and Small, Gallery Qube, Art Quartel and more showcased the best of contemporary Filipino artworks. Leading the pack of Filipino artists was glass artist Ramon Orlina, who showcased pieces from his stellar three decades in the industry. The art works of Ronald Ventura, the auctions record-holder for Southeast Asian paintings, as well as Geraldine Javier, Marina Cruz, Randy Salon and more were present at the sixth edition.\n\nThe seventh edition of Art Apart will be held from 22 to 24 January 2016. Art Apart Fair will see the participation of more than 40 Singaporean artists alongside others hailing from Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, Iceland, America, Philippines, Russia and France. The Fair is possibly the largest ensemble of fresh, emerging Singaporean artists in an art fair and signals a shift in focus from previous editions that focused on a matrix of foreign artists and art genre. The Presidential Suite will be themed \"Mosaic\" and feature never-before-seen works of Benny Ong, Daniela Beltrani's curated selection of 12 Singapore-based artworks and Rosalind Lim's selection of designers-turned-artists, Hayden Ng and luxury shoe designer Mashizan Masjum. Author Bryan Koh will also be presenting his books at the Fair.\n\nUnlike the Singapore Editions, where the fairs are conducted biannually, the fairs held overseas – more specifically London and New York – will take place biennially.\n\nArt Apart made its international debut from 17 to 19 October 2014 at the Town Hall Hotel, in Bethnal Green, East London. The show is believed to be the first hotel art fair that took place in London in a larger scale. The fair showcased over 2,000 contemporary works from more than 100 rising and mid-career artists, including artists such as Oscar Lett, Russell Marshall and Nikolai Ishchuk, occupying the entire second floor of the hotel. Besides featuring artists, art pieces by silversmiths, jewellers and makers, such as Hans Stofer and David Clarke were exhibited as well. Over 3,000 visitors were expected to be present for the Art Apart London 1st Edition.\n\nArt Apart is expected to debut in New York in March 2016.\n\nThe second edition of Art Apart in London is expected to be held in October 2016.\n"}

Schiffrin wanted to provide the public with reference editions of the complete works of classic authors in a pocket format. André Gide took an interest in Schiffrin's project and brought it into Gallimard, under which it is still published.\n\nThe Pléiade has a strong emphasis on works that were originally written in French, though the collection also includes classics of world literature, such as bilingual editions of the works of William Shakespeare, or French editions of Jane Austen's work. To date, more than eight hundred books have been published in the series, with eleven books generally published every year. The \"entry into the Pléiade\" is considered a major sign of recognition for an author in France, and it is extremely rare that a living author is published in the \"Pléiade\".\n\nIn 1992, Gallimard and Einaudi began a similar series of literature in Italian, the \"Biblioteca della Pléiade\". The \"Library of America\" series, launched in 1979, is a similar project in the United States inspired by the \"Bibliothèque de la Pléiade\".\n\nThe \"Bibliothèque de la Pléiade\" was founded by Jacques Schiffrin in 1931. The first volume published was the first tome of the complete works of Charles Baudelaire, on 10 September 1931. André Gide and Jean Schlumberger, creators of the \"Nouvelle Revue française\" (NRF), took interest in this, and integrated the collection into Gallimard on 31 July 1936. In 1939, André Gide became the first author to be published while still living, with the partial publication of his diary. In 1940, Jacques Schiffrin was fired by Gaston Gallimard because of the anti-Jewish laws. Jean Paulhan took the direction of the collection. After moving to New York to escape Nazism, Schiffrin became a founder of Pantheon Books.\n\nDirectors of the collection:\n\nAll the books offer a similar high quality appearance—leather bound, with gold lettering on the spine and bible paper, and they have a practical small format which makes them look like small Bibles. The use of bible paper allows the books to contain a high number of pages; it is common for a Pléiade book to contain 1500. The longest volume in the Pléiade is \"Les mille et une nuits\" I, II et III, at 3504 pages.\n\nThe leather covers of the books are also colour-coded according to period: 20th century literature comes in tobacco leather, 19th century in emerald green, 18th century in blue, 17th century in Venetian red, 16th in Corinthian brown, the Middle Ages purple, Antiquity green, spiritual texts grey, and anthologies red. The books are sold in a transparent rhodoïd dust jacket, and inserted in a white printed cardboard slipcase, although multiple volumes are often sold in a single slipcase.\n\nThe books are critical editions, with annotations, comments, manuscript and editorial variants and accompanying documents. The preparation of these critical editions can take many years for a team of specialists, which accounts partly for the books' generally steep cost. For works written in languages other than French, new French translations are usually created.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, an \"Encyclopédie de la Pléiade\" in the same format was also created, under the direction of Raymond Queneau.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, the collection includes nearly 800 books and more than 250 authors (collective works excluded):\n\nThe authors who were alive when published in the \"Bibliothèque de la Pléiade\" are:\nThe \"Bibliothèque de la Pléiade\" also publishes an Album de la Pléiade every Summer, which is an illustrated book in the same format as the rest of the series, usually dedicated to one of the writers but sometimes also dedicated to writers from a specific time period (1989 album) or to an important topic (1970 and 2009 albums) from the collection. The Albums are offered for free with the purchase of three books in the series. They are often collected.\n\n\n"}

In 2003, the artistic responsibility of the series was passed on to Roba's former assistant Laurent Verron. The stories center on a typical family: a man and his wife, their young son Boule and Bill the cocker spaniel.\n\n\"Boule et Bill\" first appeared in the Belgian comics magazine \"Spirou\" on December 24, 1959. The ambition was to make a sort of European Peanuts. The debut was made in a so-called \"mini-récit\" (mini-story), a story in 32 very small pages, printed on the inner spread of the magazine. Roba had until then mainly made illustrations for the magazine and had helped some other authors (including André Franquin), and now started with his own series. A few months later, a four-page comic with the same heroes appeared, and shortly thereafter Roba created a weekly one page comic. For the next twenty-five years, \"Boule et Bill\" was one of the most popular series of the magazine, and appeared mostly on the back cover. Some of the strips were even published in the rival \"Le Journal de Mickey\", which was based mainly around Walt Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.\nFrom 1961 to 1965, the strip appeared in British comic Valiant, renamed \"It's A Dog's Life\". Boule's name was changed to Pete and Bill's was changed to Larry. Apart from those changes this strip was mostly the same.\n21 Albums were edited by Dupuis until 1985, containing one long story and some 800 gags. Thereafter, Roba changed from editor, moving to Dargaud. In 2006, Jean Roba died, but he had announced that he wanted the series to be continued, and had appointed Verron as his successor.\n\n\"Boule et Bill\" relates the homely adventures of seven-year-old boy Boule and his dog Bill, a Cocker Spaniel, as well as that of Boule's mother and father and Caroline the turtle. Bill, while slightly anthropomorphized, basically acts as a normal dog, and the whole series places comical adventures in the realistic setting of a normal family in a normal town, with normal lives. Most of the gags happen in or around the house, but also include an almost yearly holiday setting with the family travelling away from home, usually at the beach.\n\n\nBoule et Bill were first published by Dupuis, then from 1988 by Dargaud.\n\n\nCinebook has published three books in English, with \"Boule and Bill\" renamed \"Billy and Buddy\", respectively.\n\n\n\"Boule et Bill\" is among the best-selling French-language comics, with 300,000 copies for the new album by Verron in 2009.\n\nIn 2013 a Belgian-French-Luxembourgian film was released, \"Boule et Bill\", based on the comics. It stars Franck Dubosc as the father, Marina Foïs as the mother, and Charles Crombez as Bill. It received bad reviews, but was commercially successful enough to warrant a sequel \"Boule et Bill 2\", released in 2017.\n\nFour animated television series based on \"Boule and Bill\" were produced:\n\nA Nintendo DS video game based on the comic was launched in 2008 by Atari and Anuman Interactive.\n\nIn the Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of Belgian comics, among them Jean Roba and his series \"Boule et Bill\".\n\nBoule et Bill is among the many Belgian comics characters to jokingly have a Brussels street named after them. The Rue au Beurre/ Boterstraat has a commemorative plaque with the name \"Rue Boule et Bill / Bollie en Billie straat\" placed under the actual street sign.\n\nIn 1992 a wall painting representing \"Boule and Bill\" was painted in the Rue du Chevreuil in Brussels. It was designed by G. Oregopoulos and D. Vandegeerde.\n\nIn 2000 a statue of Boule and Bill was erected in Jette, Belgium, next to where Roba lived. It was sculpted by Tom Frantzen. In 2014 the statue was subject of vandalism.\n\nIn 2002 La Poste, France's post office system, issued two postage stamps illustrating Boule and Bill. Three out of eight were semi-postal stamps benefiting the French Red Cross.\n\n\n"}

It is published from different parts of the world including Sierra Leone. The websites's owner and editor in chief is Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs-Kanu. It is published as an online website that covers political concerns, action news, commentary, editorial, sports and obituary of Sierra Leone, and the African diaspora. The Assistant Executive Officer is Foday Mansaray, Assistant CEOs are Mr. Pavi Jalloh and Bankole Gibson, and Assistant Editor is Jacob Sax-Conteh.\n\nUniversity of Sierra Leone alumni students including HE Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma had confirmed that COCORIOKO Newspaper was first published in 1973 when the editor in chief Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs-Kanu was a student at the University. Some Sierra Leonean newspaper publishers had also said that the first COCORIOKO newspaper started with a revolutionary student's union government led by the late Boubacar Njai-Bahled, an influential student on campus. Others have affirmed that Rev. Leeroy Kabs Kanu was the Minister of Propaganda in that student's government. To them, COCORIOKO Newspaper was the voice of that student's union when they were concerned with what they described as a \"battle of wits and supremacy with the college administration and political powers in the country.\"\n\nStudents from the 1973 to 1977 alumni had stated that COCORIOKO's Editor-In-Chief was Ben Ikeakor, a Nigerian student. They have said that the newspaper's editorial board members were Florence Iscandri, Millicent Macauley, Mohamed Lamin, Anthony Brewah, Princetta Godwin, Joan Mundoma, and Jaiah Kallon, who were student activists. The paper was said to cover the entertainment news on campus as well as the student's goals and aspirations. They claim that the student government aimed to effect change in the welfare of students on the campus.\n\nMany believe that this student government \"set the stage for the student revolution in 1977 headed by Hindolo Trye and that the massive students' action against the lethargic political powers forced the government to make wholesale reforms in governance which led to a snap General Elections that brought intellectuals into the national government for the first time. In an \"About COCORIOKO\" article Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs Kanu stated that the paper folded up in 1976 when the main publishers graduated from college. They attest that the newspaper was very influential on the college campus, attracting the attention of senior government officials and the media of Sierra Leone. However, upon graduating, they discontinued the paper.\n\nYears later, Rev. Leeroy Wilfred Kabs Kanu was featured editor of \"The West African Journal\"\" between 1995 and 1998 and \"Expo Times\" between 2000 and 2003. He revived his newspaper from college, COCORIOKO in 2002. According to AllAfrica.com, Kabs Kanu resumed publishing his newspaper at \"Leonenet - UMBC\", which was the first Sierra Leone discussion forum set up at the advent of the internet, by Claude Meama- Kajue. At the time the newspaper was called \"Daily News Inquirer.\" The Reverend later changed the paper's name to \"COCORIOKO,\" the name of his first newspaper the he published as a student at the University of Sierra Leone. In 2015 he stated that the “present mission of the newspaper is the rebranding of Sierra Leone.”\n\nSome Sierra Leoneans believe that the diligent reporting on Cocorioko newspaper greatly contributed to the regime change that took place during Sierra Leone’s 2007 General Elections. Others gather that an overwhelming number of the Sierra Leone people voted for Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma and his All People’s Congress Party (A. P. C.) during the democratic Presidential and Legislative Elections since the citizens believed Cocorioko newspaper's widely broadcast reports that the Sierra Leone People’s Party (S. L. P.

As a result of its success, in 1972 the NCRL was split off from the National Gallery of Canada and was renamed the Canadian Conservation Institute with Dr. Stolow as its first Director General. It now operates as an agency of the federal government of Canada, currently under the auspices of the Department of Canadian Heritage.\n\nThe CCI is primarily a research organization, but provides education and services on conservation and restoration-related matters. The CCI now promotes the proper care and preservation of Canada's cultural heritage and to advance the practice, science, and technology of conservation. The Institute has worked closely with hundreds of Canadian museums, art galleries, archives, libraries, historic sites, academic institutions, and other heritage organizations to help them better preserve their collections. The primary role of CCI's clients is to acquire, conserve, research, communicate, and exhibit permanent heritage collections that are accessible to the Canadian public for purposes of study, education, and enjoyment. As a Special Operating Agency of the Department of Canadian Heritage, CCI has widened its scope of activities and now markets its services and products around the world. The CCI was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa, held June 2, 2012.\n\nThe following are but some of the services CCI provides:\n\n\nCCI also provides project-specific teams for conservation, scientific, and testing projects. Its Paper Group works with archives and libraries in preserving and restoring their collections. Research conducted by the Paper Group includes paper bleaching, enzyme use, washing, and de-acidification. The CCI also self-publishes a variety of materials related to its work. As well, each year it publishes the \"CCI, the Journal of the Canadian Conservation Institute\". With a staff of about 80 to 100, the CCI has treated more than 13,000 objects for the heritage community, has published hundreds of scientific papers, and has distributed in excess of one million publications. The Institute responds to at least 2,000 requests for assistance annually. Working together in well-equipped, fully secure, climate-controlled laboratories, conservators, chemists, engineers, biologists, and other professionals handle projects ranging from information inquiries to complex treatments and research.\n\n"}

Blake and Jane Mouton using their Managerial Grid Model. Blake and Mouton used two axes. “Concern for people” is plotted on the Y axis and “Concern for task” is plotted on axis X. Using this group they developed five differing styles of approaching conflict resolution often referenced as: win-win, win-lose, compromise, avoid, and comply. In 1974, Kenneth W. Thomas and Ralph H. Kilman adopted this model and created the Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument. This is the best known of the conflict style inventories. Another often used instrument is the Conflict Dynamics Profile offered by Eckerd College in Florida. This is primarily designed to be offered as a 360 degree instrument.\n\nIn 2001 Glenn Hallam, Ph.D., Paul Seymour Ph.D. and Gina Hallam, M.A. published the Conflict Lens, an on-line instrument based on the premise that conflict management is a skill that can be learned if people know which behaviors lead to constructive outcomes and which behaviors lead to destructive outcomes. The Conflict Lens is founded on the belief that the concept of style is limited in that it does not inform a person what behaviors would be most valuable in successfully resolving conflict and that conflict resolution is based more on situational context than on dominant style (Callanan, Benzing, and Perri, 2006). The behaviors were identified through empirical research and indicate how to approach the relational aspects of conflict resolution and the actual issue itself. The instrument is based on a taxonomy of behaviors considering research by Johnson and Johnson (2000), Thomas (1975) and Deutch (1973).\n\nThe Conflict Lens asks a person to identify two actual conflicts they were involved in, and then asks them to answer 53 items about what they did, felt, or thought during the conflict and 13 items about the outcomes of each conflict. A 12-page computer generated report shows scores on how the person behaved on 10 dichotomous behavioral dimensions and whether the person saw the outcome as destructive or constructive. The scales are: Affiliate vs. Alienate; Analyze vs. Intuit; Compromise vs. Stand Firm; Control vs. Comply; Empathize vs. Egoize; Engage vs. Avoid; Own vs. Blame; Seek Support vs. Go Solo; Self-Restrain vs. Emote; and Trust vs. Distrust. The report contrasts the two conflicts so that the person can see how they behaved similarly or differently depending on the circumstances. The report also gives participants specific suggestions on what they did particularly well and how they might be more effective in the future. A Group Report for use in team building is also available. Trainers who use the instrument must be certified to order and interpret the instrument. The Conflict Lens is published and distributed by Work Effects Inc. in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nThe Conflict Lens focuses on specific behaviors instead of delineating style. The instrument asks the person to identify specific conflicts they were involved in vs. the usual method of asking people how they generally behaved. Sandy et al. (2000) write, “(T)here is reason to believe that conflict behavior is determined by both situational and dispositional influences.” Research by Rahim (1986) indicates that a manager in conflict with a supervisor typically yields, while with peers the manager compromises and with subordinates the manager problem solves. The instrument allows respondents to analyze how they responded in different situations. The ten behavioral dimensions are researched based best practices which allow a person to create a behavioral roadmap to use in the future and instructs people on both what to do and what not to do. Reliability and Validity data is available in a technical report. The average Cronbach’s alpha is .71. It is available in 19 languages and has been used worldwide. Support materials for interpretation and training are available in each language.\n\nThe Conflict Lens was normed on a US population and cross cultural analysis is not yet available. Some respondents who tend to avoid conflict sometimes find it difficult to identify two conflicts they were personally involved in. The Conflict Lens is based on self-reports and how a person perceives themselves to have behaved which may differ from how others perceived the behavior. Also, the instrument measures how a person believes they behaved but does not assess how well they actually executed the behavior.\n\nConflict Lens.com. (http://www.conflictlens.com)\n"}
{"id": "24610351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24610351", "title": "Democracy Ranking", "text": "Democracy Ranking\n\nThe Democracy Ranking is an index compiled by the Association for Development and Advancement of the Democracy Award, an Austria-based non-partisan organization. Democracy Ranking produces an annual global ranking of democracies. The applied conceptual formula, which measures the quality of democracy, integrates freedom and other characteristics of the political system with the performance of non-political dimensions (gender, economy, knowledge, health, and environment). Democracy Ranking has emphasized a broader understanding of democracy, creating a conceptual link between politics and the output and performance of society. The Democracy Ranking has compared several-year intervals, delivering ranking results, which show how ranking positions and score levels have developed recently. Referring to that information, a Democracy Improvement Ranking has been regularly released.\n\nSource:\n\n\"The Democracy Ranking is interested in contributing to the global enhancement of the Quality of Democracy in a world-wide understanding and approach.\"\n\nThe Democracy Ranking initiative applies the following conceptual formula for defining democracy and measuring the quality of democracy:\n\nThis approach includes also the output of democracies. Democracy Ranking refers to countries (country-based democracies) with a population of one million or more and that are classified by Freedom House as \"free\" or at least as \"partly free\" (see also the Freedom House report). The Democracy Ranking makes explicit the \"theoretical basis\", which governs the theoretical self-understanding of the Democracy Ranking.\n\nThe Democracy Ranking understands and measures democracies in a multi-dimensional framework and approach. By this, the Democracy Ranking contributes to a further development of measurement of democracy. According to the ranking, democracy consists of six dimensions (one political, five non-political), with different weights for the overall quality of democracy. Their weights are distributed accordingly:\n\nThe theoretical basis of the Democracy Ranking encourages a broader approach for explaining and measuring democracy while covering and integrating non-political dimensions. This is enabled by an understanding that democracy represents not only a concept of the political system, but also a concept that extends to society and the context of society, and includes interfaces between politics, society, economy, and even the environment.. Politics (policy) has or should have a responsibility for economic (socioeconomic) performance. Furthermore, there is also a need that democracy reflects the context of the (natural) environment.\n\nConcepts of democracy turn out to be more demanding, the more they move from a mainly electoral democracy (emphasizing elections and political rights) to a liberal democracy (also encompassing civil liberties), and further extending to a liberal democracy of an advanced high quality. In that logic, the Democracy Ranking reflects and requires a \"demanding type\" of democracy.\n\nMethodically, the Democracy Ranking does not create new indicators, but relies on already existing indicators that are being released regularly by renowned international and/or private non-profit organizations. The Democracy Ranking draws on available indicators according to a distinct conceptual formula and six-fold dimensional structure, thus providing a theoretically based conceptual design (a basic concept) of how to combine and aggregate these indicators. Depending on the source, the content of the indicators varies, extending from peer review assessment (for example, on freedom) to indicators that capture performance (e.g., socioeconomic behavior). The Democracy Ranking initiative acknowledges the work of organizations such as Freedom House, the World Bank, and also the United Nations Development Program (more specifically the Human Development Index).\n\nThe work of the Democracy Ranking is being reflected in academic discourse and in coverage by international media.\n\nThe Democracy Ranking analyzes several-year intervals, revealing relative ranking positions as well as changes of score levels over time. Typically, more than hundred countries are being compared in context of a specific Democracy Ranking. Based on ranking results and their shifts, a Democracy Improvement Ranking is being carried out, with a full result release. The Democracy Improvement Ranking places the emphasis on increases or decreases of the ranking scores of democracies. Individual annual rankings of the Democracy Ranking are also published in separate book volumes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10881572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10881572", "title": "Domain drop catching", "text": "Domain drop catching\n\nDomain drop catching, also known as domain sniping, is the practice of registering a domain name once registration has lapsed, immediately after expiry.\n\nWhen a domain is first registered, the customer is usually given the option of registering the domain for one year or longer, with automatic renewal as a possible option. Although some domain registrars often make multiple attempts to notify a registrant of a domain name's impending expiration, a failure on the part of the original registrant to provide the registrar with accurate contact information makes an unintended registration lapse possible. Practices also vary, and registrars are not required to notify customers of impending expiration. Unless the original registrant holds a trademark or other legal entitlement to the name, they are often left without any form of recourse in getting their domain name back. It is incumbent on registrants to be proactive in managing their name registrations and to be good stewards of their domain names. By law there are no perpetual rights to domain names after payment of registration fees lapses, aside from trademark rights granted by common law or statute.\n\nThe Redemption Grace Period is an addition to ICANN's Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) which allows a registrant to reclaim their domain name for a number of days after it expires. This length of time varies by domain, and is usually around 30 to 90 days. Prior to the RGP, individuals could easily engage in domain sniping to extort money from the original registrant to buy their domain name back.\n\nOnce time is up, the domain status changes to a \"redemption period\" when an owner may be required to pay a fee (usually around $70 - $250 (enom)) to re-activate and re-register the domain.\nICANN's RAA requires registrars to delete domain registrations once a second notice has been given and the RGP has elapsed. At the end of the deletion phase of 5 days, the domain will be dropped from the ICANN database.\n\nFor particularly popular domain names, there are often multiple parties anticipating the expiration. Competition for expiring domain names has since become a purview of drop catching services. These services offer to dedicate their servers to securing a domain name upon its availability, usually at an auction price. Individuals with their limited resources find it difficult to compete with these drop catching firms for highly desirable domain names.\nRetail registrars such as GoDaddy or eNom retain names for auction through services such as TDNAM or Snapnames through a practice known as domain warehousing. Drop catch services are performed by both ICANN-accredited registrars and non-accredited registrars.\n\nSome registry operators (for example dot-РФ, dot-PL, dot-RU, dot-ST, dot-TM, dot-NO) offer a service by which a back-order (also sometimes known as a \"domain future\" or \"domain option\") can be placed on a domain name. \n\nIf a domain name is due to return to the open market, then the owner of the back-order will be given the first opportunity to acquire the domain name before the name is deleted and is open to a free-for-all. In this way back-orders will usually take precedence over drop-catch.\n\nThere may be a fee for the back-order itself, often only one back-order can be placed per domain name and a further purchase or renewal fee may be applicable if the back-order succeeds.\n\nBack-Orders typically expire in the same way domain names do, so are purchased for a specific number of years.\n\nDifferent operators have different rules. In some cases back-orders can only be placed at certain times, for example after the domain name has expired, but before it has returned to the open market (see Redemption Grace Period).\n\nIn the Commodity market sense, a back-order is often more like an \"option\" than a \"future\" as there is often no obligation for the new registrant to take the name, even after it has been handed to the owner of the back-order. For example, some registries give the new registrant 30 days to purchase a renewal on the name before it is once again returned to the open market (or any new back-order registrant).\n\n"}
{"id": "3549243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3549243", "title": "EMedicine", "text": "EMedicine\n\neMedicine.com, Incorporated is an online clinical medical knowledge base founded in 1996 by two medical doctors, Scott Plantz and Jonathan Adler, and by Jeffrey Berezin, a computer engineer. The fundamental concept was to create a large repository of professional level medical content that could be both updated and accessed continuously to assist in clinical care and physician education. The eMedicine website consists of approximately 6,800 medical topic review articles, each of which is associated with one of 62 clinical subspecialty \"textbooks\". Pediatrics, for example, has 1,050 articles organized into 14 subspecialty \"textbooks\" (Pediatric endocrinology, genetics, cardiology, pulmonology, etc.); the emergency medicine volume has 630 articles and internal medicine is near 1,400. The knowledge base includes about 25,000 clinically relevant images. Each article is authored by board certified specialists in the subspecialty to which the article belongs and undergoes three levels of physician peer-review, plus review by a Doctor of Pharmacy. The article's authors are identified with their current faculty appointments. Each article is updated yearly, or more frequently as changes in practice occur, and the date is published on the article. eMedicine.com was sold to WebMD in January, 2006 and is available as the Medscape Reference.\n\nDr. Plantz, Dr. Adler and Mr. Berezin evolved the concept for eMedicine.com in 1996 and deployed the initial site via Boston Medical Publishing, Inc., a corporation in which Plantz and Adler were principals. Over a period of 1.5 years the Group Publishing System was developed that allowed large numbers of contributors to collaborate simultaneously. That system was first used to create a knowledge base in Emergency Medicine with 600 contributing MDs creating over 630 chapters in just over a year. In 1997 eMedicine.com, Inc. was legally spun off from Boston Medical Publishing. Several key individuals made investments in the company, including Richard Lavely, MD, JD who led recruitment and execution for the Internal Medicine volume, Julie Bohlen who ran editorial operations for many years and became a board member, and others. In that year the decision was made to broaden the scope of eMedicine to effectively all specialties.\n\nSeveral years were then spent creating the tables of contents, recruiting expert physicians and in the creation of the additional 6,170 medical articles. Operation were based out of a main office in Omaha, NE and the company was operated \"virtually\" with key staff in multiple sections of the US. \n\neMedicine.com became widely trafficked. In 2005, eMedicine entered into discussions for acquisition. The board of directors at the time of sale, consisting of Jonathan Adler, Jeffrey Berezin, Craig Burson, Lilian Shackelford Murray and Michael P. Tierney, unanimously recommended approval for sale of the company to WebMD. The sale was completed in January 2006 and the content is available via WebMD's Medscape site.\n\nContent now includes allergy and immunology, cardiology, clinical procedures, critical care, dermatology, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology. genomic medicine, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, obstetrics/gynecology, oncology, pathology, perioperative care, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, pulmonology, radiology, rheumatology, and sports medicine. Surgical subspecialties include neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, (ENT) and facial plastic surgery, plastic surgery, thoracic surgery, transplantation, Trauma, urology, and vascular surgery. \n\nThe site is free to use, requiring only registration. More than 10,000 physician contributors from several countries participated in the creation of the articles. Novel at the time, eMedicine content could also be accessed as an e-book, and could be downloaded into a palm top device.\n\nIn 2012 Volsky et al. evaluated the most frequently used internet information sources by the public, (1) identifying the three most frequently referenced Internet sources; (2) comparing the content accuracy of each of the three sources and (3) ascertaining user-friendliness of each site; and (4) informing practitioners and patients of the quality of available information. They found Wikipedia, eMedicine, and NLM/NIH MedlinePlus were the most referenced sources. For content accuracy, eMedicine scored highest (84%; p<0.05) over MedlinePlus (49%) and Wikipedia (46%). The highest incidence of errors and omissions per article was found in Wikipedia (0.98±0.19), twice more than eMedicine (0.42±0.19; p<0.05). Errors were similar between MedlinePlus and both eMedicine and Wikipedia. On ratings for user interface, which incorporated Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Level and Flesch Reading Ease, MedlinePlus was the most user-friendly (4.3±0.29). This was nearly twice that of eMedicine (2.4±0.26) and slightly greater than Wikipedia (3.7±0.3). All differences were significant (p<0.05). There were 7 topics for which articles were not available on MedlinePlus. They concluded \"Knowledge of the quality of available information on the Internet improves pediatric otolaryngologists' ability to counsel parents. The top web search results for pediatric otolaryngology diagnoses are Wikipedia, MedlinePlus, and eMedicine. Online information varies in quality, with a 46-84% concordance with current textbooks. eMedicine has the most accurate, comprehensive content and fewest errors, but is more challenging to read and navigate. Both Wikipedia and MedlinePlus have lower content accuracy and more errors, however MedlinePlus is simplest of all to read, at a 9th Grade level.\n\nIn 2012, Laraway and Rogers reported a structured review of journal articles that quoted The University of Washington Quality of Life Scale for head and neck cancer patients.\n\n\"The University of Washington Quality of Life Scale (UW-QoL) is one of the most frequently reported health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) questionnaires in head and neck cancer, and since its first publication in 1993 has been used in many different cohorts. There is a considerable amount of information to assimilate and, to date, we know of no attempt that has been made to summarise publications specific to its use in a peer review journal. The aim of this review was to systematically search published papers that report its use, identify common themes, and present a tabulated summary. Several search engines were used (PubMed, Medline, Medical-Journals.com, eMedicine), and 222 abstracts were found and hand searched. A total of 66 papers were eligible for inclusion, 21 on functional outcome, 25 on predictors of HR-QoL, 19 on development or validation of the questionnaire, and one clinical trial. The review includes a diversity of studies and a range of HR-QoL outcomes following head and neck cancer. It provides clinicians and their colleagues in multidisciplinary teams with a source of quick reference to relevant papers reporting the UW-QoL, and gives a short summary of the pertinent conclusions drawn from each paper.\"\n\nWhat is significant for eMedicine, is that Laraway and Rogers used PubMed, Medline Medical Journals.com and eMedicine as primary sources of information. This is significant because medline is the compendium of all NIH sponsored research. Emedicine is made up of articles translating the body of current research in medline into clinical practice guidelines from the perspective of each subspeciality.\nCao, Liu, Simpson, \"et al\" revealed that medline and emedicine were used as primary resources in developing the online system AskHERMES. Physicians were asked to solve complex clinical problems using three different sources of information: AskHermes, Google and UpToDate. Surveys of the physicians who used all three systems were asked to score the three systems by ease of use, quality of answer, time spent, and overall performance.\n\nA 2009 study showed that \"89.1% of ophthalmologist respondents accessed peer-reviewed material online, including Emedicine (60.2%).\"\n\nA 2007 study showed that 12% of radiology residents used eMedicine as their first source when doing research on the Internet.\n\nA 2005 study ranking 114 sites rated it the second-highest Internet-based source of information for pediatric neuro-oncology, after the site of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA 2002 study described the site's coverage of dermatology as \"excellent and comprehensive.\"\n\nIn 2000 an article in the Journal of Ear Nose and Throat by AD Meyers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO, announced the unveiling of the ENT textbook online at emedicine.com.\n\n"}

He was appointed Bishop of Rochester and Prior of the Cathedral Priory there. He built several castles, including Rochester, Colchester and the White Tower of the Tower of London and the Priory and Cathedral Church of Rochester.\n\nGundulf was a monk of Bec Abbey in Normandy and a friend, pupil and also chamberlain of Lanfranc. He was a monk of St. Etienne in Caen before he went to England in 1070, as one of several clergy from Bec and St Etienne. He was one of the most important of those chosen by Lanfranc to help him with the reorganisation of English monasticism, as Lanfranc had been charged to do, following his appointment as Archbishop of Canterbury by King William I.\n\nIn 1075 at Lanfranc's instigation, King William I agreed to the appointment of Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester and Gundulf was consecrated on 19 March 1077. Earlier that year Lanfranc had recovered much of the lands once belonging to St. Andrews Church at Rochester from the king's half-brother Odo and when Gundulf was enthroned Lanfranc endowed much of this property back to the church. This restored income enabled Gundulf to start reconstruction work on the almost derelict church building in 1080.\nIn 1078 King William used Gundulf's skill in the construction of the White Tower: the keep of the Tower of London, he was described as \"competent and skilled at building in stone and was the principle overseer and surveyor of the White Tower of London\"; also the castle at Colchester which was started around 1080. Colchester is attributed to Gundulf on the basis of the similarity in plan and design to the White Tower. In 1080 he was responsible for St. Leonard's Tower which became the tower of the monastic cell of St. Leonard's, belonging to Malling Abbey. Sometime around 1092 Gundulf founded the abbey of St Mary's, at West Malling, Kent for Benedictine nuns. He was also responsible for the founding of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Rochester, the chapel of which is original and still extant.\n\nIn 1083 the Cathedral Priory of St. Andrew the Apostle was founded at Rochester with Gundulf as Prior. He personally purchased a great deal of property for his house and also acquired other properties as the Priory found continued favour with the Norman kings. Together with Archbishop Lanfranc he began the construction of the monastery buildings and continued work on the church. Later Gundulf had the relics of St. Paulinus, a previous Bishop of Rochester, housed in a silver shrine at the church. By the time of Gundulf's death on 7 March 1108 the nave and western front of the church had been completed.\n\nBishop Gundulf's talent for architecture had been spotted by King William I and was put to good use in Rochester where he was sent as bishop. Almost immediately the king appointed him to supervise the construction of the White Tower, now part of the Tower of London in 1078. Under William Rufus he also undertook building work on Rochester Castle. Having served three Kings of England and earning \"the favour of then all\". Gundulf is accepted as the first King's Engineer. Gundulf died in 1108 and his statue adorns the west door of Rochester Cathedral.\n\nBecause of his 'military' engineering talent, Bishop Gundulf is regarded as the \"father of the Corps of Royal Engineers\", military engineers of the British Army. The Corps claims a line of 'King's Engineers' pre-dating the engineers of the Board of Ordnance in 1414 and the formal founding of the corps in 1716 all the way back to Gundulf of Rochester. This shared heritage and the close proximity to the cathedral of the Royal School of Military Engineering in Brompton means the Corps of Royal Engineers and Rochester Cathedral maintain strong links to this day.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14819129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14819129", "title": "Luzia Woman", "text": "Luzia Woman\n\nLuzia Woman () is the name for an Upper Paleolithic period skeleton of a Paleo-Indian woman who was found in a cave in Brazil. Some archaeologists believed the young woman may have been part of the first wave of immigrants to South America. The 11,500-year-old skeleton was found in a grotto in Lapa Vermelha, Pedro Leopoldo, Great Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1974 by archaeologist Annette Laming-Emperaire. The nickname \"Luzia\" pays homage to the Australopithecus fossil \"Lucy\". The fossil was kept at the National Museum of Brazil, where it was shown to the public until it was fragmented during a fire that destroyed the museum on September 2, 2018. On October 19, 2018, it was announced that most of Luzia's remains was identified from the Museu Nacional debris, which allows them to rebuild part of her skeleton.\n\nLuzia was originally discovered in 1974 in a rock shelter by a joint French-Brazilian expedition that was working not far from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The remains were not articulated. The skull, which was separated from the rest of the skeleton but was in surprisingly good condition, was buried under more than forty feet (12 meters) of mineral deposits and debris.\n\nThere were no other human remains at the site. New dating of the bones announced in 2013 confirmed that at an age of 10,030 ± 60 14C yr BP (11,243–11,710 cal BP), Luzia is one of the most ancient American human skeletons ever discovered. Forensics have determined that Luzia died in her early 20s. Although flint tools were found nearby, hers were the only human remains found in Vermelha Cave.\n\nThe fossil of Luzia was believed to have been destroyed when the National Museum burned, according to officials, but firefighters later discovered a human skull within the burned museum. On October 19, 2018 it was announced that the Luzia skull was indeed found, but in a fragmented state. 80% of the fragments were identified as being part of the frontal (forehead and nose), side, bones that are more resistant and the fragment of her femur that also belonged to the fossil and was stored. A part of the box that contained Luzia's skull was also recovered. The reassembly of the bones has not yet been undertaken.\n\nHer facial features included a narrow, oval cranium, projecting face and pronounced chin, strikingly dissimilar to most Native Americans and their indigenous Siberian forebears. Anthropologists variously described Luzia's features as resembling those of Negroids, Indigenous Australians, Melanesians and the Negritos of Southeast Asia. Walter Neves, an anthropologist at the University of São Paulo, suggested that Luzia's features most strongly resembled those of Australian Aboriginal peoples. Richard Neave of Manchester University, who undertook a forensic facial reconstruction of Luzia, described it as negroid.\n\nNeves and other Brazilian anthropologists theorized that Luzia's Paleo-Indian predecessors lived in South East Asia for tens of thousands of years after migrating from Africa and began arriving in the New World as early as 15,000 years ago. The oldest confirmed date for an archaeosite in the Americas is 18,500 and 14,500 cal BP for the Monte Verde site in southern Chile. Some anthropologists have hypothesized that a population from coastal East Asia migrated in boats along the Kuril island chain, the Beringian coast and down the west coast of the Americas during the decline of the Last Glacial Maximum. In 1998, Neves and archaeologist André Prous studied and dated 11,400 years for the skull of Luzia after naming her.\n\nNeves' conclusions have been challenged by research done by anthropologists Rolando González-José, Frank Williams and William Armelagos, who have shown in their studies that the cranio-facial variability could just be due to genetic drift and other factors affecting cranio-facial plasticity in Native Americans.\n\nA comparison in 2005 of Lagoa Santa specimens with modern Aimoré people of the same region also showed strong affinities, leading Neves to classify the Aimoré as Paleo-Indians.\n\nResearchers recreated the skull of Luzia with 3D printers by studies resumed in a laboratory of the National Institute of Technology (INT) by master's and doctoral students of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn November 2018, scientists of the University of São Paulo and Harvard University released a study that contradicts the alleged Australo-Melanesian physical appearance of Luzia. Using DNA sequencing, the results showed that Luzia had Mongoloid features.\n\nLuzia stood just under five feet (1.5 m) tall; about one-third of her skeleton has been recovered. Her remains seem to indicate that she died when she was approximately 20 years old, either in an accident or as the result of an animal attack. She was a member of a group of hunter-gatherers.\n\n"}

The historic Palace was restored by Berlin-based Architecture and Engineering firm ZRS Architekten Ingenieure. This important monument to Qatar’s past is now preserved as the heart of the new NMoQ. The relation between the new and old building is part of creating the bridge between the past and the present advocated by Sheikha Al Mayassa for it is the way to \"define ourselves instead of forever being defined by others […]\" and \"celebrating our identity.\" \n\nThe museum is created by a series of interlocking discs that create cavities to protect visitors from the desert heat. Located on a 1.5 million-square-foot site at the south end of Doha’s Corniche, the NMoQ building will rise from the sea and will be connected to shore by two pedestrian bridges and a vehicular bridge.\n\nThe main building is contracted to Hyundai E&C in 2011. The project involves the construction of the new National Museum situated next to the existing Qatar National Museum which is located across from the Corniche in the Qatari capital Doha, Qatar. The museum will be designed according to the Bedouin tradition of Qatar. It will include a building that will have the design of the desert rose and a 1.2 million square foot landscaped park. The project also includes an 115,000-square meter park with an artificial lagoon and parking spaces for 400 vehicles, a 220 seat auditorium, a research center, laboratories, a dedicated food forum, two restaurants, a café and a museum shop. \n\nA tour of the future museum will take visitors through a loop of galleries that address three major, interrelated themes. The galleries will be loosely arranged in chronological order, beginning with exhibitions on the natural history of the desert and the Persian Gulf, artifacts from Bedouin culture, historical exhibitions on the tribal wars and the establishment of the Qatari state, and finally the discovery of oil to the present. The displays and installations that explore these themes will integrate exciting and involving audiovisual displays with carefully selected treasures from the museum’s collections. These collections currently consist of approximately 8,000 objects and include archaeological artefacts, architectural elements, heritage household and traveling objects, textiles and costumes, jewellery, decorative arts, books and historical documents.\n\nThe museum's mission will be to celebrate the culture, heritage and future of Qatar and its people, embodying the pride and traditions of Qataris while offering international visitors a dialogue about rapid change and modernization.\n"}

The collection also includes state papers and other important documents.\n\nThe large collection of letters and papers was acquired in 1735 from the executors of the estate of William Paston, 2nd Earl of Yarmouth, the last in the Paston line, by the antiquary Francis Blomefield. On Blomefield's death in 1752 they came into the possession of Thomas Martin of Palgrave, Suffolk. On his death in 1771 some letters passed into the hands of John Ives, while many others were purchased by John Worth, a chemist at Diss, whose executors sold them in 1774 to Sir John Fenn of East Dereham.\n\nIn 1787, John Fenn published a selection of the letters in two volumes, bringing general interest to the collection. In 1789, Fenn published two further volumes of letters. Before he died in 1794 he prepared a fifth volume for publication, which was posthumously published in 1823 by his nephew, William Frere. In 1787, Fenn presented the originals of his first two volumes to King George III, who knighted Fenn on 23 May 1787. Shortly thereafter, the manuscripts for all five volumes disappeared , casting doubt on the authenticity of the letters. In 1865 their authenticity was questioned by Herman Merivale in the \"Fortnightly Review\", but James Gairdner countered that they were genuine in the same periodical. Within a year, Gairdner was proven right by the discovery of the originals of the fifth volume, together with other letters and papers, by Frere's son, Philip Frere, in his house at Dungate. Ten years later, the originals of Fenn's third and fourth volumes with ninety-five unpublished letters were found at Roydon Hall, Norfolk, the seat of George Frere. Finally the originals of the two remaining volumes were discovered in 1889 at Orwell Park, Ipswich, in the residence of Captain E.G. Pretyman. The last letters to be found were the letters presented to George III; they may have reached Orwell through Sir George Pretyman Tomline, the tutor and friend of William Pitt the Younger.\n\nMost of the Paston letters and associated documents are now in the British Library, but some are in the Bodleian Library, Oxford at Magdalen College, with a few at Pembroke College, Cambridge.\n\nFenn's edition of the \"Paston Letters\" were considered definitive until 1872, when James Gairdner published the first volume of a new edition. Taking Fenn's work as a basis, Gairdner ultimately published over four hundred previously unpublished letters in three volumes. Gairdner's edition included notes and an index, along with introductions to each volume containing a survey of the reign of King Henry VI. Before he had published all the volumes of his edition, some letters were discovered in 1875 at Roydon that he had written about. These unpublished letters were added as a supplement to a subsequent three-volume edition published in 1896. In 1904, Gairdner edited a complete edition of the \"Paston Letters\" in six volumes, containing 1,088 letters and papers with a new introduction.\n\n\"The Paston Letters 1422-1509 AD: A New Edition First Published in 1874 Containing Upwards of Four Hundred Letters, Etc., Hitherto Unpublished.

The first member of the family about whom anything is known was Clement Paston (d.1419), a yeoman holding and cultivating about one hundred acres (40 hectares) of land. His wife, Beatrice Somerton (d.1409), is said to have been 'a bond woman', but her brother, Geoffrey Somerton (d.1416), became a lawyer, and it was Geoffrey who paid for the education, both at grammar school and at the Inns of Court, of his nephew, William Paston (1378–1444), son of Clement and Beatrice. William, who is described as a \"right cunning man\" in the law, attained an influential position in his profession, and in 1429 became a Justice of the Common Pleas. He bought a good deal of land in Norfolk, including property in Paston and Gresham Castle, and improved his social position by his marriage with Agnes Barry (d.1479), the daughter and coheir of Sir Edmund Barry or Berry of Horwellbury. near Therfield and Royston, Hertfordshire. Agnes emerges from the letters as a difficult and quick-tempered woman, whose quarrels with the Paston villagers leave some valuable examples of colloquial English in the 1450s. She frequently quarreled with her children.\n\nOn his death, he left a large and valuable inheritance to John Paston, the eldest of his five sons, who was already married to Margaret (d. 1484), daughter of John Mautby of Mautby, Norfolk. England was experiencing instability at this time; the nobles surrounding the king did not allow him sufficient power to govern, and much of England was effectively lawless. A lawyer like his father, Paston spent much of his time in London, leaving his wife to look after his business in Norfolk, a task which Margaret, a sensible and competent woman, managed with considerable skill. Many of the letters were written by Margaret to her husband in London. The letters written during the lifetimes of John Paston and his eldest son, also named John, are most numerous and provide the most insight, not only on their family matters but on the overall history of England.\n\nIn 1448 Paston's manor of Gresham was seized by Robert Hungerford, Lord Moleyns (1431–1464), and, although it was afterwards recovered, the owner could obtain no redress for the loss and injury he had sustained. Moreover, Paston had become intimate with the wealthy knight Sir John Fastolf, who was a kinsman of Paston's wife, Margaret, and who had employed him on several matters.\n\nAt his death, Fastolf left his affairs in disorder. As was customary in his time, he left many of his estates in Norfolk and Suffolk to feoffees including Sir William Yelverton, John Paston and his brother William, retaining the revenues for himself. His written will tasked his ten executors with founding a college at Caister. However, two days before his death, according to John Paston, Fastolf made a nuncupative (spoken) will in which he bequeathed all his lands in Norfolk and Suffolk to Paston, for a payment of 4000 marks and the duty of founding the college at Caister.\n\nTaking possession of the lands, Paston's claims were challenged. Different noblemen claimed his estates. The excluded executors litigated, and Paston fell under the threat of violence. A feud broke out between John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, and the Pastons under Margaret and her eldest son, John, around Drayton and Hellesdon. Caister Castle was seized by John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, while similar occurrences took place at other estates. In 1460 and 1461, Paston returned to parliament as a knight of the shire for Norfolk, and, enjoying the favour of Edward IV, had regained his castle at Caister. He fell out of favor, however, and was imprisoned on three occasions. Paston died in May 1466, with the suit concerning Fastolf's will still proceeding in the church courts.\n\nJohn Paston left five sons. The eldest, Sir John Paston (1442–1479), had been knighted during his father's lifetime. He was frequently at the court of Edward IV, but afterwards favoured the Lancastrian party, and, with his younger brother, also named John, fought for Henry VI at the Battle of Barnet. Meanwhile, the struggle over Paston's estates continued, although in 1461 the king and council had declared that Paston's ancestors were not bondmen, and consequently that his title to his father's lands was valid. Caister Castle was taken after a siege by John Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk (1444–1476), and then recovered by the Pastons, and retaken by the duke. But in 1474 an arrangement was made with William Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester, the representative of the excluded executors, by which some of the estates were surrendered to the bishop for charitable purposes, while Paston was secured in the possession of others. Two years later the death of the Duke of Norfolk made the restoration of Caister Castle possible, but in 1478 a quarrel broke out with John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk.\n\nSir John Paston, who was a cultured man, was anxious to recover Caister, but he left the task to his mother and to the younger John. Owing to his carelessness and extravagance, the family lands were also diminished by sales, but nevertheless when he died unmarried in November 1479 he left a substantial inheritance to his younger brother John. About this time the Letters become scanty and less interesting, but the family continued to flourish. The younger John Paston (d. 1504), after quarrelling with his uncle William over the manors of Oxnead and Marlingford, was knighted at the Battle of Stoke in 1487. He married Margery, daughter of Sir Thomas Brewes, and left a son, William Paston (c. 1479–1554), who was also knighted, and who was a prominent figure at the court of Henry VIII. Sir William's second son, John Paston (1510–1575) was the father-in-law of Sir Edward Coke. Sir William's third son, Clement (c. 1515–1597), served his country with distinction on the sea, and was wounded at the Battle of Pinkie.\n\nThe family was continued by Sir William's eldest son, Erasmus (b. 1502-d. 1540), whose son William succeeded to his grandfather's estates in 1554, and to those of his uncle Clement in 1597. This William (1528–1610) was knighted in 1578. He was the founder of the Paston grammar-school at North Walsham, and made Oxnead Hall, near Norwich, his principal residence. Christopher Paston was Sir William's son and heir, and Christopher's grandson, William (d. 1663), was created a baronet in 1642; being succeeded in the title by his son Robert (1631–1683), who was a member of parliament from 1661 to 1673, and was created Earl of Yarmouth in 1679. Robert's son William (1652–1732), who married a natural daughter of Charles II, was the second earl, and, like his father, was in high favour with the Stuarts. When he died in 1732 he left no son, and his titles became extinct, his estates being sold to discharge his debts.\n\nThe disorder revealed by the \"Paston Letters\" reflects the general condition of England during this period. The weakness of the government left every branch of the administration disorganized. The succession to the crown itself was contested. Nobility fought a civil war. The prevailing discontent led to the rising of Jack Cade and of the Wars of the Roses. The correspondence reveals the Pastons in a variety of relations to their neighbours — both friendly and hostile. It abounds with illustrations of public events, as well as of the manners and morals of the time, and some valuable examples of colloquial English, such as Agnes Paston's quarrel with her neighbour, Warren Harman, c.1451, where she told him \"if his father had do as he did he would a be ashamed to say to me as he said\". Particularly remarkable is the habitual acquaintance of educated persons, both men and women, with the law, which was evidently indispensable to persons of substance. Of most interest, however, are the occasional love letters, notably those from Richard Calle to Margery Paston, and Margery Brews' famous Valentines to John Paston III.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18134289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18134289", "title": "Qualitative comparative analysis", "text": "Qualitative comparative analysis\n\nIn statistics, qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is a data analysis technique for determining which logical conclusions a data set supports. The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of logical inference to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by Charles Ragin in 1987.\n\nIn the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were dichotomous (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports.\n\nIn QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the \"prime implicates\" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference \"(A and B) implies the particular value of D\".\n\nTo establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge. The method is used in social science and is based on the binary logic of Boolean algebra, and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered.\n\nThe technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables. The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible. This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze.\n\nAs this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with \"crisp-set\" QCA (csQCA), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values). Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA (mvQCA) and fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA. \n\nStatistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to type I error. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated. Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error. Bear F. Braumoeller further explores the vulnerability of the QCA family of techniques to both type I error and multiple inference. Braumoeller also offers a formal test of the null hypothesis and demonstrates that even very convincing QCA findings may be the result of chance.\n\nQCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter-example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y. However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher. For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the \"coverage\" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the \"consistency\" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such a explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors.\n\nFuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.\n\nQCA has now become used in many more fields than political science which Ragin first developed the method for. Today the method has been used in:\n"}

Watermeyer CJ, Tindall JA, Greenberg JA, Schreiner JA, and Davis AJA. NE Rosenberg KC (with him D. Gould) appeared for the appellant, and C. Norman Scoble, for the Crown.\n\nThe appellant had been convicted of a contravention of Volksraad Besluit No. 104 of 25 September 1871, in that he had allowed coloured persons, other than those exempted by the Besluit, to occupy an erf in the village of belonging to the appellant, and had been fined £1. This decision was appealed on the grounds\n\n\nThe Appellate Division, allowing an appeal, did not think it necessary, for the purposes of this case, to attempt to lay down any specific test for deciding whether an enactment creates a criminal offence. It was sufficient, the court found, to apply the general rule of giving effect to the lawgiver's intention. It considered, therefore, whether or not the language of the Besluit, together with its surrounding circumstances, showed that it was a penal enactment. The court began by comparing the Besliut with other legislative enactments preceding and following it, and found none whose terms showed it to be a criminal enactment but which did not expressly mention a penalty: \"A survey of the legislation up to and including the period when the Besluit was passed affords good reason for holding that, as a matter of practice, 'when the Volksraad intended to create a crime, it prescribed a penalty.'\"\n\nThe court held, for this reason and for others, that the Besluit in question did not create a crime. Although it did not make the assumption that, if an enactment is to create a crime, it should provide, either expressly or by reference, for a punishment, \"I think it improbable that if the lawgiver had intended that the Besluit should create a crime, he would not have taken the precaution of inserting a penalty—more particularly as this is what appears generally to have been done.\"\n\nThe decision of the Transvaal Provincial Division (where Barry JP and Millin J dismissed an appeal from conviction in the Magistrate's Court of Johannesburg), was thus reversed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27560", "title": "Solar deity", "text": "Solar deity\n\nA solar deity (also sun god or sun goddess) is a sky deity who represents the Sun, or an aspect of it, usually by its perceived power and strength. Solar deities and sun worship can be found throughout most of recorded history in various forms. The Sun is sometimes referred to by its Latin name \"Sol\" or by its Greek name \"Helios\". The English word \"sun\" stems from Proto-Germanic *\"sunnǭ\".\n\nThe Neolithic concept of a \"solar barge\" (also \"solar bark\", \"solar barque\", \"solar boat\" and \"sun boat\", a mythological representation of the sun riding in a boat) is found in the later myths of ancient Egypt, with Ra and Horus. Predynasty Egyptian beliefs attribute Atum as the sun-god and Horus as a god of the sky and sun. As the Old Kingdom theocracy gained power, early beliefs were incorporated with the expanding popularity of Ra and the Osiris-Horus mythology. Atum became Ra-Atum, the rays of the setting sun. Osiris became the divine heir to Atum's power on Earth and passes his divine authority to his son Horus. Early Egyptian myths imply the sun is within the lioness, Sekhmet, at night and is reflected in her eyes; or that it is within the cow, Hathor, during the night, being reborn each morning as her son (\"bull\").\n\nMesopotamian Shamash plays an important role during the Bronze Age, and \"my Sun\" is eventually used as an address to royalty. Similarly, South American cultures have a tradition of Sun worship, as with the Incan Inti.\n\nProto-Indo-European religion has a solar chariot, the sun as traversing the sky in a chariot. In Germanic mythology this is \"Sol\", in Vedic Surya, and in Greek Helios (occasionally referred to as Titan) and (sometimes) as Apollo. In Proto-indo-European mythology the sun appears to be a multilayered figure, manifested as a goddess but also perceived as the eye of the sky father Dyeus.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, a festival of the birth of the \"Unconquered Sun\" (or \"Dies Natalis Solis Invicti\") was celebrated on the winter solstice—the \"rebirth\" of the sun—which occurred on December 25 of the Julian calendar. In late antiquity, the theological centrality of the sun in some Imperial religious systems suggest a form of a \"solar monotheism\". The religious commemorations on December 25 were replaced under Christian domination of the Empire with the birthday of Christ.\n\nThe Tiv people consider the Sun to be the son of the supreme being Awondo and the Moon Awondo's daughter. The Barotse tribe believes that the Sun is inhabited by the sky god Nyambi and the Moon is his wife.\nSome Sara people also worship the sun.\nEven where the sun god is equated with the supreme being, in some African mythologies he or she does not have any special functions or privileges as compared to other deities. The ancient Egyptian god of creation, Amun is also believed to reside inside the sun. So is the Akan creator deity, Nyame and the Dogon deity of creation, Nommo. Also in Egypt, there was a religion that worshipped the sun directly, and was among the first monotheistic religions: Atenism.\n\nSun worship was prevalent in ancient Egyptian religion. The earliest deities associated with the sun are all goddesses: Wadjet, Sekhmet, Hathor, Nut, Bast, Bat, and Menhit. First Hathor, and then Isis, give birth to and nurse Horus and Ra. Hathor the horned-cow is one of the 12 daughters of Ra, gifted with joy and is a wet-nurse to Horus.\n\nFrom at least the 4th Dynasty of ancient Egypt, the sun was worshipped as the deity Re (pronounced probably as Riya, meaning simply the sun), and portrayed as a falcon headed god surmounted by the solar disk, and surrounded by a serpent. Re supposedly gave warmth to the living body, symbolised as an ankh: a \"T\" shaped amulet with a looped upper half. The ankh, it was believed, was surrendered with death, but could be preserved in the corpse with appropriate mummification and funerary rites. The supremacy of Re in the Egyptian pantheon was at its highest with the 5th Dynasty, when open air solar temples became common. In the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, Re lost some of his preeminence to Osiris, lord of the West, and judge of the dead. In the New Empire period, the sun became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the sun. In the form of the sun disc Aten, the sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.\n\nThe Sun's movement across the sky represents a struggle between the Pharaoh's soul and an avatar of Osiris. Ra travels across the sky in his solar-boat; at dawn he drives away the demon king Apep. The \"solarisation\" of several local gods (Hnum-Re, Min-Re, Amon-Re) reaches its peak in the period of the fifth dynasty.\nRituals to the god Amun who became identified with the sun god Ra were often carried out on the top of temple pylons. A Pylon mirrored the hieroglyph for 'horizon' or \"akhet\", which was a depiction of two hills \"between which the sun rose and set\", associated with recreation and rebirth. On the first Pylon of the temple of Isis at Philae, the pharaoh is shown slaying his enemies in the presence of Isis, Horus and Hathor.\nIn the eighteenth dynasty, the earliest-known monotheistic head of state, Akhenaten changed the polytheistic religion of Egypt to a monotheistic one, Atenism of the solar-disk and is the first recorded state monotheism. All other deities were replaced by the Aten, including Amun-Ra, the reigning sun god of Akhenaten's own region. Unlike other deities, the Aten did not have multiple forms. His only image was a disk—a symbol of the sun.\n\nSoon after Akhenaten's death, worship of the traditional deities was reestablished by the religious leaders (Ay the High-Priest of Amen-Ra, mentor of Tutankhaten/Tutankhamen) who had adopted the Aten during the reign of Akhenaten.\n\nIn Aztec mythology, \"Tonatiuh\" (, \"Movement of the Sun\") was the sun god. The Aztec people considered him the leader of \"Tollan\" (heaven). He was also known as the fifth sun, because the Aztecs believed that he was the sun that took over when the fourth sun was expelled from the sky. According to their cosmology, each sun was a god with its own cosmic era. According to the Aztecs, they were still in Tonatiuh's era. According to the Aztec creation myth, the god demanded human sacrifice as tribute and without it would refuse to move through the sky. The Aztecs were fascinated by the sun and carefully observed it, and had a solar calendar similar to that of the Maya. Many of today's remaining Aztec monuments have structures aligned with the sun.\n\nIn the Aztec calendar, Tonatiuh is the lord of the thirteen days from 1 Death to 13 Flint. The preceding thirteen days are ruled over by Chalchiuhtlicue, and the following thirteen by Tlaloc.\n\nSun worship was apparently practiced in Pre-Islamic Arabia, abolished only under Muhammad. The Arabian solar deity appears to have been a goddess, Shams/Shamsun, most likely related to the Canaanite Shapash and broader middle-eastern Shamash. She was the patron goddess of Himyar, and possibly exalted by the Sabaeans and early Bedouin.\n\nIn Buddhist cosmology, the bodhisattva of the Sun is known as \"Sūryaprabha\" (\"having the light of the sun\"); in Chinese he is called \"Rigong Riguang Pusa\" (The Bright Solar Bodhisattva of the Solar Palace), \"Rigong Riguang Tianzi\" (The Bright Solar Prince of the Solar Palace), or \"Rigong Riguang Zuntian Pusa\" (The Greatly Revered Bright Solar Prince of the Solar Palace), one of the 20 or 24 guardian \"devas\".\n\nSūryaprabha is often depicted with \"Candraprabha\" (\"having the light of the moon\"), called in Chinese \"Yuegong Yueguang Pusa\" (The Bright Lunar Bodhisattva of the Lunar Palace), \"Yuegong Yueguang Tianzi\" ( The Bright Lunar Prince of the Lunar Palace), or \"Yuegong Yueguang Zuntian Pusa\" (The Greatly Revered Bright Lunar Prince of the Lunar Palace). Together with Bhaiṣajyaguru Buddha (Chinese: \"Yaoshi Fo\") these two bodhisattvas constitute the \"Dongfang San Sheng\" (Three Holy Sages of the Eastern Quarter).\n\nIn Chinese mythology (cosmology), there were originally ten suns in the sky, who were all brothers. They were supposed to emerge one at a time as commanded by the Jade Emperor. They were all very young and loved to fool around. Once they decided to all go into the sky to play, all at once. This made the world too hot for anything to grow. A hero named Hou Yi shot down nine of them with a bow and arrow to save the people of the earth. He is still honored this very day. In another myth, the solar eclipse was caused by the magical dog of heaven biting off a piece of the sun. The referenced event is said to have occurred around 2,160BCE. There was a tradition in China to make lots of loud celebratory sounds during a solar eclipse to scare the sacred \"dog\" away.\nThe Deity of the Sun in Chinese mythology is Ri Gong Tai Yang Xing Jun (Tai Yang Gong / Grandfather Sun) or Star Lord of the Solar Palace, Lord of the Sun. In some mythologies, Tai Yang Xing Jun is believed to be Hou Yi. \nTai Yang Xing Jun is usually depicted with the Star Lord of the Lunar Palace, Lord of the Moon, Yue Gong Tai Yin Xing Jun (Tai Yin Niang Niang / Lady Tai Yin). Worship of the moon goddess Chang'e and her festivals are very popular among followers of Chinese folk religion and Taoism. Similar to Santa Claus and Christmas in the West, the goddess and her holy days are ingrained in Chinese popular culture.\n\nThose who practice Dievturība, beliefs of traditional Latvian culture, celebrate the Sun goddess, Saule, known in traditional Lithuanian beliefs as Saulė. Saule/Saulė is among the most important deities in Baltic mythology and traditions.\n\nThe sun in Insular Celtic culture is assumed to have been feminine, and several goddesses have been proposed as possibly solar in character. In Continental Celtic culture, the sun gods, like Belenos, Grannos, and Lug, were masculine.\n\nIn Irish, the name of the sun, \"Grian\", is feminine. The figure known as Áine is generally assumed to have been either synonymous with her, or her sister, assuming the role of Summer Sun while Grian was the Winter Sun. Similarly, Étaín has at times been considered to be another theonym associated with the sun; if this is the case, then the pan-Celtic Epona might also have been originally solar in nature, though Roman syncretism pushed her towards a lunar role.\n\nThe British Sulis has a name cognate with that of other Indo-European solar deities such as the Greek Helios and Indic Surya, and bears some solar traits like the association with the eye as well as epithets associated with light. The theonym Sulevia, which is more widespread and probably unrelated to Sulis, is sometimes taken to have suggested a pan-Celtic role as a solar goddess. She indeed might have been the \"de facto\" solar deity of the Celts.\n\nThe Welsh Olwen has at times been considered a vestige of the local sun goddess, in part due to the possible etymological association with the wheel and the colours gold, white and red.\n\nBrighid has at times been argued as having had a solar nature, fitting her role as a goddess of fire and light.\n\nThe Ādityas are one of the principal deities of the Vedic classical Hinduism belonging to Solar class. In the Vedas, numerous hymns are dedicated to Mitra, Varuna, Savitr etc.\n\nEven the Gayatri mantra, which is regarded as one of the most sacred of the Vedic hymns is dedicated to Savitr, one of the principal Ādityas. The Adityas are a group of solar deities, from the Brahmana period numbering twelve. The ritual of \"Surya Namaskaar\", performed by Hindus, is an elaborate set of hand gestures and body movements, designed to greet and revere the Sun.\n\nThe sun god in Hinduism is an ancient and revered deity. In later Hindu usage, all the Vedic Ādityas lost identity and metamorphosed into one composite deity, Surya, the Sun. The attributes of all other Ādityas merged into that of Surya and the names of all other Ādityas became synonymous with, or epithets of, Surya.\n\nThe \"Ramayana\" has Rama as a descendant of the Surya, thus belonging to the Suryavansha or the clan of the Sun. The \"Mahabharata\" describes one of its warrior heroes, Karna, as being the son of the Pandava mother Kunti and Surya.\n\nThe sun god is said to be married to the goddess Ranaadeh, also known as Sanjnya. She is depicted in dual form, being both sunlight and shadow, personified. The goddess is revered in Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\nThe charioteer of Surya is Aruna, who is also personified as the redness that accompanies the sunlight in dawn and dusk. The sun god is driven by a seven-horsed Chariot depicting the seven days of the week.\n\nIn India, at Konark, in the state of Odisha, a temple is dedicated to Surya. The Konark Sun Temple has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Surya is the most prominent of the \"navagrahas\" or nine celestial objects of the Hindus. \"Navagrahas\" can be found in almost all Hindu temples. There are further temples dedicated to Surya, one in Arasavilli, Srikakulam District in AndhraPradesh, one in Gujarat at Modhera and another in Rajasthan. The temple at Arasavilli was constructed in such a way that on the day of Radhasaptami, the sun's rays directly fall on the feet of the Sri Suryanarayana Swami, the deity at the temple.\n\nChhath (Hindi: छठ, also called \"Dala Chhath\") is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to Surya, the chief solar deity, unique to Bihar, Jharkhand and the Terai. This major festival is also celebrated in the northeast region of India, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Chhattisgarh. Hymns to the sun can be found in the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Practiced in different parts of India, the worship of the sun has been described in the Rigveda. There is another festival called Sambha-Dasami, which is celebrated in the state of Odisha for the \"surya\".\n\nThe Gurjars (or Gujjars), were Sun-worshipers and are described as devoted to the feet of the sun god Surya. Their copper-plate grants bear an emblem of the Sun and on their seals too, this symbol is depicted.\n\nAccording to one hypothesis about Christmas, it was set to 25 December because it was the date of the festival of Sol Invictus. This idea became popular especially in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nAnother speculation connects the biblical elements of Christ's life to those of a sun god. The Christian gospels report that Jesus had 12 followers, which is claimed to be akin to the twelve zodiac constellations. When the sun was in the house of Scorpio, Judas plotted with the chief priests and elders to arrest Jesus by kissing him. As the sun exited Libra, it enters into the waiting arms of Scorpio to be kissed by Scorpio's bite.\n\nMany of the world's sacrificed godmen have their traditional birthday on December 25. During this time, people believed that the \"sun god\" had \"died\" for three days and was \"born again\" on December 25. After December 25, the Sun supposedly moves 1 degree north, foreshadowing longer days. The three days following December 21 remain the darkest days of the year where Jesus (the sun) dies and remains unseen for three days.\n\nAt the beginning of the first century, the sun on the vernal equinox passed from Aries to Pisces (1 A.D. to 2150 A.D). That harmonizes with the mentioned lamb and fish in the gospels. The man carrying a pitcher of water (Luke 22:10) is Aquarius, the water bearer, who is always seen as a man pouring out a pitcher of water. He represents the age after Pisces, and when the Sun leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus), it will go into the House of Aquarius.\n\nBy \"the sun of righteousness\" in \"the fathers, from Justin downward, and nearly all the earlier commentators understand \"Christ\", who is supposed to be described as the rising sun\". The New Testament itself contains a hymn fragment: \"Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\" Clement of Alexandria wrote of \"the Sun of the Resurrection, he who was born before the dawn, whose beams give light\".\n\nThe Philocalian calendar of AD 354 gives a festival of \"Natalis Invicti\" on 25 December. There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid-4th century. The charioteer in the mosaic of Mausoleum M has been interpreted by some as Christ. Clement of Alexandria had spoken of Christ driving his chariot across the sky. This interpretation is doubted by others: \"Only the \"cross-shaped\" nimbus makes the Christian significance apparent\". and the figure is seen by some simply as a representation of the sun with no explicit religious reference whatever, pagan or Christian.\n\nThe idea that Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Jesus on 25 December because this was the date of an already existing festival of the Sol Invictus was expressed in an annotation to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century Syrian bishop Jacob Bar-Salibi. The scribe who added it wrote: \"It was a custom of the Pagans to celebrate on the same 25 December the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in token of festivity. In these solemnities and revelries the Christians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the Church perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival, they took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be solemnised on that day.\" \n\nThis idea became popular especially in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIn the judgement of the Church of England Liturgical Commission, this view has been seriously challenged by a view based on an old tradition, according to which the date of Christmas was fixed at nine months after 25 March, the date of the vernal equinox, on which the Annunciation was celebrated. The Jewish calendar date of 14 Nisan was believed to be that of creation, as well as of the Exodus and so of Passover, and Christians held that the new creation, both the death of Jesus and the beginning of his human life, occurred on the same date, which some put at 25 March in the Julian calendar. \n\nIt was a traditional Jewish belief that great men lived a whole number of years, without fractions, so that Jesus was considered to have been conceived on 25 March, as he died on 25 March, which was calculated to have coincided with 14 Nisan. Sextus Julius Africanus (c.160 – c.240) gave 25 March as the day of creation and of the conception of Jesus. The tractate \"De solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae\" falsely attributed to John Chrysostom also argued that Jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as 25 March. A passage of the \"Commentary on the prophet Daniel\" by Hippolytus of Rome, written in about 204, has also been appealed to.\n\nAmong those who have put forward this view are Louis Duchesne, Thomas J. Talley, David J. Rothenberg, J. Neil Alexander, and Hugh Wybrew.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to Christian Thought\" also remarks on the uncertainty about the order of precedence between the celebrations of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun and the birthday of Jesus: \"This 'calculations' hypothesis potentially establishes 25 December as a Christian festival before Aurelian's decree, which, when promulgated, might have provided for the Christian feast both opportunity and challenge.\" Susan K. Roll calls \"most extreme\" the unproven hypothesis that \"would call Christmas point-blank a 'christianization' of Natalis Solis Invicti, a direct conscious appropriation of the pre-Christian feast, arbitrarily placed on the same calendar date, assimilating and adapting some of its cosmic symbolism and abruptly usurping any lingering habitual loyalty that newly-converted Christians might feel to the feasts of the state gods\".\n\nThe nimbus of the figure under Saint Peter's Basilica is described by some as \"rayed\", as in traditional pre-Christian representations, but another has said: \"Only the \"cross-shaped\" nimbus makes the Christian significance apparent\" (emphasis added). Yet another has interpreted the figure as a representation of the sun with no explicit religious reference whatever, pagan or Christian. Among scholars who view the celebration of the birth of Jesus on 25 December as motivated by choice of the winter solstice, rather than that he was conceived and died on 25 March, some reject the idea that this choice constituted a deliberate Christianization of a festival of the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun. For example, Michael Alan Anderson writes:\nBoth the sun and Christ were said to be born anew on December 25. But while the solar associations with the birth of Christ created powerful metaphors, the surviving evidence does not support such a direct association with the Roman solar festivals. The earliest documentary evidence for the feast of Christmas makes no mention of the coincidence with the winter solstice. Thomas Talley has shown that, although the Emperor Aurelian's dedication of a temple to the sun god in the Campus Martius (C.E. 274) probably took place on the 'Birthday of the Invincible Sun' on December 25, the cult of the sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect. The origins of Christmas, then, may not be expressly rooted in the Roman festival.\n\nThe same point is made by Hijmans: \"It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect the southern solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ ... While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas.\" He also states that, \"while the winter solstice on or around December 25 was well established in the Roman imperial calendar, there is no evidence that a religious celebration of Sol on that day antedated the celebration of Christmas\". \n\nA study of Augustine of Hippo remarks that his exhortation in a Christmas sermon, \"Let us celebrate this day as a feast not for the sake of this sun, which is beheld by believers as much as by ourselves, but for the sake of him who created the sun\", shows that he was aware of the coincidence of the celebration of Christmas and the Birthday of the Unconquered Sun, although this pagan festival was celebrated at only a few places and was originally a peculiarity of the Roman city calendar. It adds: \"He also believes, however, that there is a reliable tradition which gives 25 December as the actual date of the birth of our Lord.\"\n\nThe comparison of Christ with the astronomical Sun is common in ancient Christian writings. In the 5th century, Pope Leo I (the Great) spoke in several sermons on the Feast of the Nativity of how the celebration of Christ's birth coincided with increase of the sun's position in the sky. An example is: \"But this Nativity which is to be adored in heaven and on earth is suggested to us by no day more than this when, with the early light still shedding its rays on nature, there is borne in upon our senses the brightness of this wondrous mystery.\n\nChristians adopted the image of the Sun (Helios or Sol Invictus) to represent Christ. In this portrayal he is a beardless figure with a flowing cloak in a chariot drawn by four white horses, as in the mosaic in Mausoleum M discovered under Saint Peter's Basilica and in an early-4th-century catacomb fresco. Clement of Alexandria had spoken of Christ driving his chariot in this way across the sky.\n\nSolar gods have a strong presence in Indonesian mythology. In some cases the Sun is revered as a \"father\" or \"founder\" of the tribe. This may apply for the whole tribe or only for the royal and ruling families. This practise is more common in Australia and on the island of Timor, where the tribal leaders are seen as direct heirs to the sun god.\n\nSome of the initiation rites include the second reincarnation of the rite's subject as a \"son of the Sun\", through a symbolic death and a rebirth in the form of a Sun. These rituals hint that the Sun may have an important role in the sphere of funerary beliefs. Watching the Sun's path has given birth to the idea in some societies that the deity of the Sun descends in to the underworld without dying and is capable of returning afterward. This is the reason for the Sun being associated with functions such as guide of the deceased tribe members to the underworld, as well as with revival of perished. The Sun is a mediator between the planes of the living and the dead.\n\nThe primary local deity in Theosophy is the Solar Logos, \"the consciousness of the sun\".\n\nThree theories exercised great influence on nineteenth and early twentieth century mythography, beside the Tree worship of Mannhardt and the Totemism of J. F. McLennan, the \"Sun myth\" of Alvin Boyd Kuhn and Max Müller.\n\nR. F. Littledale criticized the Sun myth theory when he illustrated that Max Müller on his own principles was himself only a Solar myth, whilst Alfred Lyall delivered a still stronger attack on the same theory and its assumption that tribal gods and heroes, such as those of Homer, were mere reflections of the Sun myth by proving that the gods of certain Rajput clans were really warriors who founded the clans not many centuries ago, and were the ancestors of the present chieftains.\n\nA \"solar barge\"—also known as a \"solar bark\", \"solar barque\", \"solar boat\", or \"sun boat\"—is a mythological representation of the sun riding in a boat. The most famous of these is the \"Atet\", the barge of the Egyptian sun god Ra. The \"Khufu ship\", a 43.6-meter-long vessel that was sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example which may have fulfilled the symbolic function of a solar barque. This boat was rediscovered in May 1954 when archeologist Kamal el-Mallakh and inspector Zaki Nur found two ditches sealed off by about 40 blocks weighing 17 to 20 tonnes each. This boat was disassembled into 1,224 pieces and took over 10 years to reassemble. A nearby museum was built to house this boat.\n\nOther sun boats were found in Egypt dating to different pharonic dynasties.\n\nExamples include:\n\nA \"sun chariot\" is a mythological representation of the sun riding in a chariot. The concept is younger than that of the solar barge, and typically Indo-European, corresponding with the Indo-European expansion after the invention of the chariot in the 2nd millennium BC.\n\nExamples include these:\n\nThe sun itself also was compared to a wheel, possibly in Proto-Indo-European, Greek \"hēliou kuklos\", Sanskrit \"suryasya cakram\", Anglo-Saxon \"sunnan hweogul\" (PIE ).\n\nSolar deities are often thought of as male while the lunar deity is female, but the opposite case is also seen. The cobra (of Pharaoh Son of Ra), the lioness (daughter of Ra), the cow (daughter of Ra), the dominant symbols of the most ancient Egyptian deities, carried their relationship to the sun atop their heads; they were female and their cults remained active throughout the history of the culture. Later a \"sun god\" (Aten) was established in the eighteenth dynasty on top of the other solar deities, before the \"aberration\" was stamped out and the old pantheon re-established. When male deities became associated with the sun in that culture, they began as the offspring of a mother (except Ra, King of the Gods who gave birth to himself).\n\nIn Germanic mythology the Sun is female and the Moon is male. The corresponding Old English name is Siȝel , continuing Proto-Germanic *Sôwilô or *Saewelô. The Old High German Sun goddess is Sunna. In the Norse traditions, Sól rode through the sky on her chariot every day, pulled by two horses named Arvak and Alsvid. Sól also was called Sunna and Frau Sunne.\n\nOther cultures that have sun goddesses include the Lithuanians (Saulė) and Latvians (Saule), the Finns (Päivätär, Beiwe) and the related Hungarians. Sun goddesses are found around the world in Australia (Bila, Walo), India (Bisal-Mariamna, Bomong, Kn Sgni), among the Hittites (Wurusemu), and Egyptians (Sekhmet), in the Canary Islands (Chaxiraxi)/(Magek), in Native America, among the Cherokee (Unelanuhi), Natchez (Wal Sil), Inuit (Malina), and Miwok (Hekoolas), and in Asia among the Japanese (Amaterasu).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20263150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20263150", "title": "Sources (website)", "text": "Sources (website)\n\nSources is a web portal for journalists, freelance writers, editors, authors and researchers, focusing especially on human sources: experts and spokespersons who are prepared to answer Reporters' questions or make themselves available for on-air interviews.\n\nThe Sources website is built around a controlled-vocabulary subject index comprising more than 20,000 topics. This subject index is underpinned by an 'Intelligent Search' system which helps reporters focus their searches by suggesting additional subjects related to their search terms. For example, a search for \"cancer\" will suggest terms such as \"chemotherapy\", \"melanoma\", \"oncology\", \"radiation therapy\", \"tobacco diseases\" and \"tumours\", as well as topics that actually contain the word \"cancer\".\n\nEach topic reference links in turn to experts and spokespersons on that topic, with profiles describing their expertise and, where relevant, their approach to the issue, along with their phone numbers and other contact information. Sources includes listings for universities and research institutes, non-profit associations and NGOs, government and public sector bodies, businesses, and individuals including academics, public speakers, and consultants.\n\nThe subject index and the search menus are being translated into French, Spanish and German to make Sources more of an international resource.\n\nBased in Canada, Sources was founded in 1977 as a print directory for reporters, editors, and story producers. It was first published as a supplement to \"Content\" magazine, an influential and controversial magazine of journalism criticism. \"Content\", founded by Dick MacDonald in 1970 and published by Barrie Zwicker after MacDonald's death in 1974, frequently took journalists to task for always relying on the same narrow range of sources representing the same conventional points of view for their stories. Zwicker and MacDonald argued in \"Content\" and in their book \"The News: Inside the Canadian Media\" that there was a “terrible sameness” in the media’s coverage of many important issues, and a shutting out of other, potentially valuable, perspectives and sources of information.\n\nZwicker decided to do something about the problem, and in summer 1977, \"Content\" published its first directory issue, called Sources. Billed as “A Directory of Contacts for Editors and Reporters in Canada”, Sources listed “information officers, public relations officers, media relations and public affairs people, and other contacts for groups, associations, federations, unions, societies, institutions, foundations, industries and companies and federal, provincial and municipal ministries, departments, agencies and boards.”\n\nExplaining the rationale behind Sources, Zwicker said that “It’s a cliché that every story has two sides. An untrue cliché. Most have several. The reporter’s challenge is digging out all sides. Sources can help.” From the beginning, Zwicker saw Sources as a public service as well as a tool for journalists. He said that Sources aimed “to help promote a system of information fairness. Communications resources are equivalent to other basic needs – shelter, food, health care, for example. Everyone should have reasonable access to all.” Therefore, he said “we attempt to provide true diversity: access to people in organizations large and small, for-profit and not-for-profit, from low-tech to high-tech, long-established to just-launched.”\n\nZwicker told users that “within Sources you will find both mainstream and alternative information. Some may consider alternative as off to one side, not quite up to par, more or less second hand. Here at Sources ‘alternative’ is considered differently, considered as authentic and substantial, even if normally less accessible. The surprises, the jarring notes, the flashes of insight, the ‘odd takes’, the pearls of wisdom, the cries de coeur, the avant garde, tomorrow’s news, the prophesies, the unfiltered, the exciting, the elsewhere-squelched, the memorable, the eccentric, the thought-out-at-length, the unmentionable in polite company, the outrageous, the uncensored ... these are what ‘alternative’ media offer. So far as we can, we will include the alternative with Sources. Sources’ driving philosophy is flat-out informational democracy enabled by user-friendly technology. The assumption is that there is a significant fraction of Canadians who want to use and benefit from such an information resource. The assumption is that a significant fraction of Canadians want to expand their search for solutions, and deepen their understandings, rather than chant conventional wisdoms (however freshly minted) to each other.\"\n\nAfter a few years, Sources become so big that it could no longer fit into \"Content\" (the print directory eventually grew to more than 500 pages), and in 1981 it became an independent publication. \"Content\" itself eventually folded, but Zwicker continued to devote a substantial editorial section in Sources to coverage of topics of interest to journalists, ranging from practical topics such as grammar, style, fact-checking, photojournalism, copyright, fees for freelancers and self-publishing, to feature articles on the state of journalism and the media, to book reviews. From the early 1990s, Sources began to feature articles about online research, notably the regular feature 'Dean's Digital World' by informatics expert Dean Tudor.\n\nSources went on the Internet in 1995 and has been expanding its online portal ever since. It continues to publish a print edition of the directory, primarily for the benefit of freelancers who use it as a source of story ideas, but is now primarily a Web-based resource.\n\nThe Sources website includes not only the Sources directory itself, but a separate government directory, Parliamentary Names & Numbers; a directory of the media, Media Names & Numbers; and The Sources HotLink (www.hotlink.ca), which features articles about media relations and public relations. Also on the site is Fame and Fortune, a directory of awards, prizes, and scholarships available to writers and journalists, and a portal linked into the online archive of Connexions, a library of documents related to alternatives and social justice.\n\nThe site also houses Sources Select Resources, a large library of articles and reviews about journalism and the media, spanning a period of more than 30 years.\n\nWhile much of the editorial content has focused on the nitty-gritty of writing, editing and research, Sources has also regularly published articles that have sparked controversy on topics such as censorship and media bias. One campaign waged by Zwicker and others challenged the ethics of journalists accepting free gifts from the people they are supposed to cover. This campaign eventually led Canadian managing editors to agree among themselves that their newspapers would not accept free tickets from travel agencies, resorts, and hotels.\n\nA series of articles by Zwicker on \"War, Peace, and the Media\" (later collected and published as a booklet) provoked a furor from readers upset by its criticisms of how the media cover U.S. foreign policy. As Zwicker put it in a publisher's letter in the next issue, the \"reaction ranged from high praise to angry denunciation.\" The \"Toronto Sun\" newspaper devoted three stories to the series. The columnist Claire Hoy was left \"trembling with rage\" and the editor Peter Worthington felt \"outraged\" and a lead editorial denounced Zwicker.\n\nOther controversial articles included one by Wendy Cukier on the public relations battle surrounding proposed gun control legislation, which drew the ire of the gun lobby. Ulli Diemer, who succeeded Zwicker as publisher in 1999, came under attack from the Fraser Institute for his article \"Ten Health Care Myths: Understanding Canada’s Medicare Debate”, in which he argued that opponents of public health care were spreading mis-information designed to mislead and frighten the public.\n\nIn keeping with its mandate of encouraging a wide diversity of points of view in the media, Sources has added extra resources over time to help organizations and individuals to be heard. These include a calendar of events open to the media and a news release service which Sources members can use to distribute their statements and communiques via online posting and RSS. The releases are also subject indexed and integrated into the overall search structure for information on the Sources site.\n\n"}
{"id": "828838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=828838", "title": "Star (classification)", "text": "Star (classification)\n\nStars are often used as symbols for ratings. They are used by reviewers for ranking things such as films, TV shows, restaurants, and hotels. For example, a system of one to five stars is commonly employed to rate hotels, with five stars being the highest quality.\n\nRepeated symbols used for ranking date to Mariana Starke's 1820 guidebook, which used exclamation points to indicate works of art of special value:\n\n...I have endeavoured... to furnish Travellers with correct lists of the objects best worth notice...; at the same time marking, with one or more exclamation points (according to their merit), those works which are deemed peculiarly excellent.\n\nMurray's Handbooks for Travellers and then the Baedeker Guides (starting in 1844) borrowed this system, using stars instead of exclamation points, first for points of interest, and later for hotels.\n\nThe Michelin restaurant guide introduced a star as a restaurant rating in 1926, and expanded to a system of one to three stars in 1931.\n\nIn 1915, Edward O'Brien began editing The Best American Short Stories. This annual compiled O'Brien's personal selection of the previous year's best short stories. O'Brien was known to work indefatigably: he claimed to read as many as 8,000 stories a year, and his editions contained lengthy tabulations of stories and magazines, ranked on a scale of zero to three stars (representing O'Brien's notion of their \"literary permanence.\") At the end of each book, O'Brien listed all the stories published during the preceding year. O'Brien awarded no stars to those stories which failed \"to survive either the test of substance or the test of form.\" O'Brien listed these stories without comment or a qualifying asterisk. O'Brien awarded one star to \"those stories which may fairly claim to survive either the test of substance or the test of form. Each of these stories may claim to possess either distinction of technique alone, or more frequently, I am glad to say, a persuasive sense of life in them to which a reader responds with some part of his own experience.\" O'Brien awarded two stars to stories \"of still greater distinction\" that warranted a second reading \"because each of them has survived both tests, the test of substance and the test of form.\" O'Brien awarded three stars – the highest rating – to \"a small group of stories\" which had \"an even finer distinction—the distinction of uniting genuine substance and artistic form in a closely woven pattern with a spiritual sincerity so earnest, and a creative belief so strong, that each of these stories may fairly claim, in my opinion, a position of some permanence in our literature as a criticism of life. O'Brien further listed these stories \"in a special 'Roll of Honor.'\" In this special list O'Brien further attached an additional asterisk to those stories that O'Brien personally enjoyed. \"Stories indicated by this asterisk seem to me not only distinctive, but so highly distinguished as to necessitate their ultimate preservation between book covers. It is from this final short list that the stories reprinted in this volume have been selected.\"\n\nOliver Herford's essay \"Say it with Asterisks\", quips \"Never, I think, were a mob of overworked employees so pitifully huddled together in an ill-ventilated factory as are the Asterisks in this Sweatshop of Twaddle.\" Literary editor Katrina Kenison dismisses O'Brien's grading systems as \"excessive at best, fussy and arbitrary at worst.\"\n\nBook reviewers generally do not use a star-rating system though there are exceptions. The \"West Coast Review of Books\" rates books on a scale of one (\"poor\") to five (\"superior\") stars. According to editor D. David Dreis, readers love the ratings but publishers don't.\n\nIn the 31 July 1928 issue of the \"New York Daily News\", the newspaper's film critic Irene Thirer began grading movies on a scale of zero to three stars. Three stars meant 'excellent,' two 'good,' and one star meant 'mediocre.' And no stars at all 'means the picture's right bad,'\" wrote Thirer. Carl Bialik speculates that this may have been the first time a film critic used a star-rating system to grade movies. \"The one-star review of \"The Port of Missing Girls\" launched the star system, which the newspaper promised would be 'a permanent thing.'\n\nAccording to film scholar Gerald Peary, few newspapers adopted this practice until the French film magazine \"Cahiers du cinéma\" \"started polling critics in the 1950s and boiling their judgment down to a star rating, with a bullet reserved for movies that the magazine didn't like.\" The highest rating any film earned was five stars. The British film magazine \"Sight and Sound\" also rated films on a scale of one to four stars. Some critics use a \"half-star\" option in between basic star ratings. Leonard Maltin goes one further and gives \"\" a 2⅓ star rating.\n\nCritics do not agree what the cutoff is for a recommendation, even when they use the same scale. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert \"both consider[ed] a three-star rating to be the cutoff for a \"thumbs up\" on their scales of zero to four stars. Film critic Dave Kehr – who also uses a 0–4 star scale – believes \"two stars is a borderline recommendation\". On a five-star scale, regardless of the bottom rating, 3 stars is often the lowest positive rating, though judging on a purely mathematical basis, 2 1/2 stars would be the dividing line between good and bad on a 0-5 scale. Common Sense Media uses a scale of one to five, where 3 stars is \"Just fine; solid\" and anything lower is \"Disappointing\" at best.\n\nThere is no agreement on what the lowest rating should be. Some critics make \"one star\" or a \"half-star\" their lowest rating. Dave Kehr believes that \"one star\" indicates the film has redeeming facets, and instead uses zero stars as his lowest rating.\n\nExamples of rating scales:\n\nCritics have different ways of denoting the lowest rating when this is a \"zero\". Some such as Peter Travers display empty stars. Jonathan Rosenbaum and Dave Kehr use a round black dot. Leslie Halliwell uses a blank space. \"The Globe and Mail\" uses a \"0\", or as their former film critic dubbed it, the \"death doughnut\". Roger Ebert used a thumbs-down symbol. Other critics use a black dot.\n\nCritics also do not agree on what the lower ratings signify, let alone the lowest rating. While Maltin's and Scheuer's guides respectively explain that lowest rated films are \"BOMB(s)\" and \"abysmal\", British film critic Leslie Halliwell instead writes that no star \"indicates a totally routine production or worse; such films may be watchable but are at least equally missable.\" Like Halliwell and Dave Kehr, film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum believes one-star films have some merit, however unlike Halliwell, Rosenbaum believes that no stars indicate a \"worthless\" movie. Roger Ebert occasionally gave zero stars to films he deemed \"artistically inept and morally repugnant.\" Scheuer's guide calls \"one and a half star\" films \"poor\", and \"one star\" films \"bad\".\n\nNot all film critics have approved of star ratings. Film scholar Robin Wood wondered if \"Sight and Sound\" readers accepted \"such blackening of their characters.\" Jay Scott of Canada's \"The Globe and Mail\" was an opponent of using symbols to summarize a review and wrote in 1992 that \"When Globe editors first proposed the four-star system of rating movies about a year ago, the response from Globe critics was, to put it mildly, underwhelming.\" More recently, Mark Kermode has expressed a dislike of star ratings (assigned to his online reviews but not his print or radio reviews) on the grounds that his verdicts are sometimes too complex to be expressed as a rating.\n\nStar ratings are also given out at stand-up comedy performances and theatre productions. Star ratings are given at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the largest arts festival in the world. Since 2010, the British Comedy Guide has collected over 4,300 reviews of around 1,110 different acts, across 83 different publications in the form of a star rating.\n\nThe use of star ratings is controversial because the public may ignore the reviews and concentrate more the star ratings alone.\n\nStar ratings are not often used to rate the quality of a video game, but are rather used within certain games for varying purposes. One notable use of the star system is to grade a player's performance in completing a level with up to three stars, used in many modern multi-level games like \"Angry Birds\". This three-star rating system challenges the player to repeat and fully master previously beaten levels in order to receive a perfect 3-star rating, which may confer other benefits or bonus content. Another use of star ratings is to denote the rarity of characters in video games where players are tasked in collecting numerous characters, such as \"\" and \"\", in which stronger and rarer characters are marked with more stars to make them appear more valuable.\n\nRestaurant guides and reviewers often use stars in restaurant ratings. The Michelin system reserves stars for exceptional restaurants, and gives up to three; the vast majority of recommended restaurants have no star at all. Other guides now use up to four or five stars, with one-star being the lowest rating. The stars are sometimes replaced by symbols such as a fork or spoon. Some guides use separate scales for food, service, ambiance, and even noise level.\n\nThe Michelin system remains the best known star system. A single star denotes \"a very good restaurant in its category\", two stars \"excellent cooking, worth a detour\", and three stars, \"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey\".\n\nMichelin stars are awarded only for the quality of food and wine; the luxury level of the restaurant is rated separately, using a scale of one (\"quite comfortable\") to five (\"luxury in the traditional style\") crossed fork and spoon symbols.\n\nHotel luxury is often denoted by stars.\n\nOther classifiers, such as the AAA Five Diamond Award, use diamonds instead of stars to express hotel ratings levels.\n\nHotels are assessed in traditional systems and rest heavily on the facilities provided. Some consider this disadvantageous to smaller hotels whose quality of accommodation could fall into one class but the lack of an item such as an elevator would prevent it from reaching a higher categorization.\n\nIn recent years hotel rating systems have also been criticized by some who argue that the rating criteria for such systems are overly complex and difficult for laymen to understand. It has been suggested that the lack of a unified global system for rating hotels may also undermine the usability of such schemes.\n\nIn the UK, providers and comparison websites often use Stars to indicate how feature-rich financial products are.\n\nDefaqto is an organisation that independently assess every financial product in the UK. Each of these products is awarded a rating from 1 to 5 Stars, allowing consumers to see where it sits in the market. The higher the Star Rating, the more comprehensive a product.\n\nDefaqto Star Ratings are calculated using a scoring system of between 40 and 100 features and benefits for each product or insurance policy, with each scored from 1 to 5. The scores for each product are totalled and all products ranked. Our industry experts determine the scores necessary to achieve 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Star Ratings.\n\nThe most senior military ranks in all services are classified by a star system in many countries, ranging from one-star rank which typically corresponds to brigadier, brigadier general, Commodore or air commodore, to the most senior five-star ranks which include Admiral of the Fleet, Grand Admiral, Field Marshal, General of the Army and Marshal of the Air Force which typically only exist during large-scale conflicts. The North Korean rank of Taewonsu has been compared to a seven-star rank.\n\nIn the army of the Republic of Ireland, the most junior ranks are classified by stars. A three-star private/gunner/trooper is one who is considered a fully trained soldier. Two-star privates/gunners/troopers are those who have completed basic training but have not yet completed other specialised training necessary for their roles. One-star privates do not exist: the lowest rank is recruit. Senior officers are classified as Brigadiers, Majors General and Lts General.\n\nThere is no official star rating system for manufactured home parks because there is no rating organization. For such an organization to exist would require agreement between the owners of approximately 50,000 parks in the United States.\n\nA residual belief in such a system probably originated in a directory of mobile home parks printed in the 1970s, in which each park was assessed with a five star rating system.\n\nRecruits entering American college football are commonly ranked on a five-star scale, with five representing what scouts think will be the best college players.\n\nInternational organisations use a star rating to rank the safety of transportation. EuroRAP have developed a Road Protection Score which is a scale for Star Rating roads for how well they protect the user from death or disabling injury when a crash occurs. The assessment evaluates the safety that is 'built into' the road through its design, in combination with the way traffic is managed on it. The RPS protocol has also been adapted and used by AusRAP, usRAP and iRAP.\n\nEuroNCAP awards 'star ratings' based on the performance of vehicles in crash tests, including front, side and pole impacts, and impacts with pedestrians.\n\nThe United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also uses a star ranking to rank the safety of vehicles in crash tests, including front, side, pole impacts, and rollovers, with 5 stars being the most secure.\n\nSome Web content voting systems use five-star grades. This allows users to distinguish content more precisely than with binary \"like buttons\".\n\nMany recommender systems, such as MovieLens or Amazon.com, ask people to express preferences using star ratings, then predict what other items those people are likely to enjoy. Predictions are often expressed in terms of the number of predicted stars.\n\nThe Unicode Standard encodes several characters used for star ratings:\n\nThe STAR WITH LEFT HALF BLACK and LEFT HALF BLACK STAR are intended for use in left-to-right contexts where the half star is positioned to the right of one or more whole stars, whereas the STAR WITH RIGHT HALF BLACK and RIGHT HALF BLACK STAR are intended for use in right-to-left contexts (such as Arabic or Hebrew) where the half star is positioned to the left of one or more whole stars.\n\n"}
{"id": "28367066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28367066", "title": "Symmachian forgeries", "text": "Symmachian forgeries\n\nThe Symmachian forgeries are a sheaf of forged documents produced in the papal curia of Pope Symmachus (498–514) in the beginning of the sixth century, in the same cycle that produced the \"Liber Pontificalis\". In the context of the conflict between partisans of Symmachus and Antipope Laurentius the purpose of these \"libelli\" was to further papal pretensions of the independence of the Bishops of Rome from criticisms and judgment of any ecclesiastical tribunal, putting them above law clerical and secular by supplying spurious documents supposedly of an earlier age. \"During the dispute between Pope St. Symmachus and the anti-pope Laurentius,\" the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" reports, \"the adherents of Symmachus drew up four apocryphal writings called the 'Symmachian Forgeries'. ... The object of these forgeries was to produce alleged instances from earlier times to support the whole procedure of the adherents of Symmachus, and, in particular, the position that the Roman bishop could not be judged by any court composed of other bishops.\"\n\nTheir editor Louis Duchesne divided them in two groups, a group produced in the heat of the conflict involving Symmachus and a later group. Among writings to support Symmachus, \"Gesta de Xysti purgatione\" narrated a decision by Sixtus III, who cleared his name from defamation and permanently excommunicated the offender; \"Gesta de Polychronii episcopi Hierosolynitani accusatione\" concerned a purely apocryphal simonical Bishop of Jerusalem \"Polychronius\", who claimed Jerusalem as the first see and his supremacy over other bishops; \"Gesta Liberii papae\" concerned mass baptisms carried out by Pope Liberius during his exile from the seat of Peter; \"Sinuessanae synodi gesta de Marcellino\" recounted the accusation brought against Pope Marcellinus, that in the company of the Emperor Diocletian he had offered incense to the pagan gods, making the point that when Marcellinus eventually confessed to the misdeed it was declared that the pope had condemned himself, since no one had ever judged the pontiff, because the first see will not be judged by anyone. \n\nThe most important in this group of forgeries was \"Silvestri constitutum\", a report of a fictitious synod convoked by Pope Sylvester, giving twenty promulgated canons, among which was a prohibition of bringing a solitary accusation upon an ecclesiastic of a degree higher than the accuser's: a bishop might only be accused by seventy-two, and a pope could not be accused by anyone. \"Silvestri constitutum\" was also an early instance of the fable that Sylvester had cured Constantine the Great of leprosy with the waters of baptism, incurring the Emperor's abject gratitude, which was elaborated and credited to the point that, in greeting Pope Stephen II in 753, Pepin II dismounted to lead the Pope's horse to his palace on foot, as Constantine would have done.\n\nThe second, somewhat later group centers on the figure of Sylvester, who accepts the decree of the First Council of Nicaea on the date of Easter. One of these forgeries reports a fictitious synod convoking 275 bishops in the Baths of Trajan; several canons exalt the position of the cleric.\n\n"}

Its full title is The Literature of Australian Birds: A History and a Bibliography of Australian Ornithology. It was authored by Hubert Massey Whittell. It is in large octavo format (252 x 184 mm) and contains some 900 pages, two separately paginated parts bound in one volume in brown buckram. It contains a coloured frontispiece (Plate 1) of a drawing of the superb lyrebird by Lieutenant-General Thomas Davies from 1799, with another 31 black-and-white plates bound between Parts 1 and 2.\n\nPart 1, titled “A History of Australian Ornithology 1618 to 1850”, is 116 pages in length. It covers the period from the exploratory Dutch voyages of the early 17th century to the voyages of HMS \"Fly\" and HMS \"Rattlesnake\" during 1842-1850. Much the larger part of the book, however, lies in the 788 pages of Part 2, titled “A Bibliography of Australian Ornithology 1618 to 1950, with Biographies of Authors, Collectors and Others”, where Whittell has attempted to be exhaustively comprehensive in compiling mentions of Australian birds, not only from the scientific literature but also from newspapers, magazines and other published sources, and including potted biographies of their authors. The two parts of the book are dedicated separately, Part 1: \"To D.L.S. in Appreciation of our long Association in Australian Ornithology\", and Part 2: \"In Memoriam. GREGORY MACALISTER MATHEWS C.B.E.. A Pioneer Bibliographer of the Literature of Australian Birds. OBIT 1947.\"\n\nA facsimile edition was published by Oak Knoll Press in 1993 (). In 1995 the Bird Observers Club of Australia (BOCA) published BOCA Report Number 6 – “Whittell (1618-1950) Supplemented. Additions and Emendations to H.M. Whittell’s The Literature of Australian Birds”, compiled by Tess Kloot. In the preface to this latter work Kloot comments, with regard to Whittell:\n”In his monumental work, \"The Literature of Australian Birds\", (Paterson Brokensha Pty Ltd, 1954), the late Major H. M. Whittell paid tribute to those who went before him : In 1925 Gregory M. Mathews issued, as a supplement to his \"Birds of Australia\", a bibliography of books and articles studied in the preparation of his work, plus brief biographical notes on the authors; and in 1935 Anthony Musgrave published his \"Bibliography of Australian Entomology 1775-1930\". In turn, I can do no better than pay tribute to Major Whittell. With his book constantly before me as I worked, I never ceased to wonder at his exhaustive research and meticulous attention to detail. It is indeed a remarkable achievement. I offer this modest contribution (and later, \"A Bio-bibliography of Australian Ornithology: 1951-1975\") in the hope that others who come after me will build upon my work.”\n\n"}

The exhibit explores poison’s roles in nature, health, history, literature, and myth. The show attempts to unify various studies prevalent with the museum's research facilities in order to illustrate the fluidity between the fields. It was designed by the AMNH Exhibitions Lab.\nThe exhibit has four major sections, each highlighting poison as viewed by a different branch of science.\n\nBiology\nThe exhibit opens with three small live animals, showing poison as a universal characteristic of the biosphere.\nAscending a small platform, visitors enter a lengthy walkthrough diorama of Colombia’s dense Chocó lowland forest. As visitors walk through the rainforest, they encounter specimens that utilize poison in their daily lives. The purpose of the section is to examine poison in a context of multiple evolutionary strategies—including linked variations in the strength of a predator’s poison and the resistance of its prey.\n\nAnthropology\nExiting the forest, visitors find themselves in a fairytale-like series of dioramas depicting poison in mythology. These include Grimm's Folktales, Alice in Wonderland and Macbeth. Curated by the museum's social sciences departments, a selection of prominent historical artifacts are incorporated into the dioramas, revealing ways humans have imagined the presence of poisons. These, in the words of the designers, are meant to show \"the potent power of poison as a longstanding motif in fairy tales, legends, and children’s stories.\"\nA winding gallery takes visitors past life-sized models of some of history's most famous poisonings, such as Mozart's supposed death, Cleopatra’s snakebite and Napoleon’s poisoning by arsenic.\n\nForensics\nThe \"Dissecting Poison Theater\" is a live show that describes how forensic anthropologists can detect poison. Visitors explore a real-world poisoning case that highlights advances in toxicology and forensics since the 19th century. This section is tied in with an iPad game, where visitors can solve their own forensic mystery.\n\nHealth Sciences\nThis section uses three large forced perspective dioramas to tell stories about poison's dangerous and mercurial nature.\nThe exhibit's finale takes guests through a diorama illustrating natural poisons that can ameliorate cancer, quinsy, laryngitis, croup, and other global health problems.\n"}
