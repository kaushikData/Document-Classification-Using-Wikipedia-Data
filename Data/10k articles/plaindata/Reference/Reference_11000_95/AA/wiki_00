{"id": "1037542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1037542", "title": "A Greek–English Lexicon", "text": "A Greek–English Lexicon\n\nA Greek–English Lexicon, often referred to as Liddell & Scott (), Liddell–Scott–Jones, or LSJ, is a standard lexicographical work of the Ancient Greek language.\n\nThe lexicon was begun in the nineteenth century and is now in its ninth (revised) edition. Based on the earlier \"Handwörterbuch der griechischen Sprache\" by the German lexicographer Franz Passow (first published in 1819, fourth edition 1831), which in turn was based on Johann Gottlob Schneider's \"Kritisches griechisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch\", it has served as the basis for all later lexicographical work on the ancient Greek language, such as the ongoing Greek–Spanish dictionary project \"Diccionario Griego–Español\" (DGE).\n\nIt was edited by Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, and published by the Oxford University Press. It is now conventionally referred to as Liddell & Scott, Liddell–Scott–Jones, or LSJ, and its three sizes are sometimes referred to as \"The Little Liddell\", \"The Middle Liddell\" and \"The Big Liddell\" or \"The Great Scott\".\n\nAccording to Stuart Jones's preface to the ninth (1925) edition, the creation of the \"Lexicon\" was originally proposed by David Alphonso Talboys, an Oxford publisher. It was published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford rather than by Talboys because he died before the first edition (1843) was complete. The second through sixth editions appeared in 1845, 1849, 1855, 1861, and 1869.\n\nThe first editor of the LSJ, Henry George Liddell, was Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and the father of Alice Liddell, the eponymous Alice of the writings of Lewis Carroll. The eighth edition (1897) is the last edition published during Liddell's lifetime.\n\nThe LSJ is sometimes compared and contrasted with \"A Latin Dictionary\" by Lewis and Short, which was also published by Oxford University Press (OUP). For comparisons between the two works, see the article on Lewis and Short's dictionary. It is also sometimes compared with the Bauer lexicon, which is a similar work focused on the Greek of the New Testament.\n\nGreek scholars use these books so much that two short memorable clerihews have been written to describe the seminal work:\n\n1. <poem>Liddell and Scott, Liddell and Scott:\nSome of it's riddle, and some of it's rot.\nThat which is riddle was written by Liddell,\nThat which is rot was written by Scott.</poem>\n\n2. <poem>Two men wrote a dictionary, Liddell and Scott,\nAnd one half was good, the other was not.\nNow tell me the answer, boys, quick, to this riddle:\nwhich was by Scott and which was by Liddell?</poem>\n\nTwo condensed editions of LSJ were published by Oxford University Press and remain in print.\n\nIn 1843, the same year as the full lexicon's publication, \"A Lexicon: Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek–English Lexicon\", sometimes called \"the Little Liddell\" was published. Several revised editions followed. For example, a reprint, re-typeset in 2007, of the 1909 edition is available from Simon Wallenberg Press ().\n\nIn 1889, an intermediate edition of the lexicon, \"An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon\", was prepared on the basis of the seventh edition (1882) of LSJ. In comparison to the smaller abridgement, this \"Middle Liddell\" contains more entries covering the essential vocabulary of most commonly read Ancient Greek literature, adds citations of the authors to illustrate the history of Greek usage (without identifying the passages), and provides more help with irregular forms.\n\nAfter the publication of the ninth edition in 1940, shortly after the deaths of both Stuart Jones and McKenzie, the OUP maintained a list of \"addenda et corrigenda\" (additions and corrections), which was bound with subsequent printings. However, in 1968, these were replaced by a Supplement to the LSJ. Neither the \"addenda\" nor the Supplement has ever been merged into the main text, which still stands as originally composed by Liddell, Scott, Jones, and McKenzie. The Supplement was initially edited by M. L. West. Since 1981, it has been edited by P. G. W. Glare, editor of the \"Oxford Latin Dictionary\" (not to be confused with Lewis and Short). Since 1988, it has been edited by Glare and Anne A. Thompson. As the title page of the \"Lexicon\" makes clear (and the prefaces to the main text and to the Supplement attest), this editorial work has been performed \"with the cooperation of many scholars\".\n\nThe Supplement primarily takes the form of a list of additions and corrections to the main text, sorted by entry. The supplemental entries are marked with signs to show the nature of the changes they call for. Thus, a user of the \"Lexicon\" can consult the Supplement after consulting the main text to see whether scholarship after Jones and McKenzie has provided any new information about a particular word. As of 2005, the most recent revision of the Supplement, published in 1996, contains 320 pages of corrections to the main text, as well as other materials.\n\nHere is a typical entry from the revised Supplement:\n\nThe small \"x\" indicates that this word did not appear in the main text at all; \"S.\"fr\".\" refers to the collected fragmentary works of Sophocles.\n\nOne interesting new source of lexicographic material in the revised Supplement is the Mycenean inscriptions. The 1996 revised Supplement's Preface notes:\n\nThe ninth edition of LSJ has been freely available in electronic form since 2007, having been digitized by the Perseus Project. Diogenes, a free software package, incorporates the Perseus data and allows easy offline consultation of LSJ on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux platforms. Marcion is another open source application that includes the Perseus LSJ.\n\nFor mobile devices, both the Kindle E-Ink and the iPhone/iPod Touch feature data ported from Perseus. The Android Market also currently offers the intermediate LSJ as an offline downloadable app for free or for a small price. A CD-ROM version published and sold by Logos Bible Software also incorporates the Supplement's additions to the ninth edition of LSJ. A new online version of LSJ was released in 2011 by the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG). The TLG version corrects \"a large number of typographical errors\" and includes links to the extensive TLG textual corpus.\nA Kindle version, the \"Complete Liddell & Scott's Lexicon with Inflections\", is also available: it allows searches of most Classical Greek word-forms and supports a growing number of Ancient / Classical Greek texts for this device.\n\nThe Lexicon has been translated into Modern Greek by Anestis Konstantinidis (Greek: Ανέστης Κωνσταντινίδης) and was published in 1904 with the title \"H. Liddell – R. Scott – Α. Κωνσταντινίδου\" – \"Μέγα Λεξικόν τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς Γλώσσης\".\n\nFrench scholar Didier Fontaine was the author of \"A Greek and English Lexicon with a Revised Supplement. A simplified edition\". In 2010s, it was published the \"Dictionnaire grec - français du Nouveau Testament\" (the Greek-French Dictionary of the New Testament), based on some \"Lexicon\" of the New Testament and the Septuagint.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "654507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=654507", "title": "Abu Nuwas", "text": "Abu Nuwas\n\nAbū Nuwās al-Ḥasan ibn Hānī al-Ḥakamī (756–814), known as Abū Nuwās (; , \"Abū Novās\"), was a classical Arabic poet. Born in the city of Ahvaz in modern-day Iran, to an Arab father and a Persian mother, he became a master of all the contemporary genres of Arabic poetry. Abu Nuwas has also entered the folkloric tradition, and he appears several times in \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\".\n\nAbu Nuwas's father, Hānī, whom the poet never knew, was an Arab, a descendant of the Jizani tribe Banu Hakam, and a soldier in the army of Marwan II. His Persian mother, named Jullaban, worked as a weaver. Biographies differ on the date of Abu Nuwas' birth, ranging from 747 to 762. Some sources say he was born at Basra, but other accounts report he was born in Damascus, Busra, or at Ahwaz. His given name was \"al-Hasan ibn Hani al-Hakami\", 'Abu Nuwas' being a nickname. \"Father of the Lock of Hair\" referred to the two long sidelocks which hung down to his shoulders.\n\nIsmail bin Nubakht: \"I never saw a man of more extensive learning than Abu Nuwas, nor one who, with a memory so richly furnished, possessed so few books. After his death we searched his house, and could only find one book-cover containing a quire of paper, in which was a collection of rare expressions and grammatical observations.\"\n\nAbu Nuwas was forced to flee to Egypt for a time, after he wrote an elegiac poem praising the elite Persian political family of the Barmakis, the powerful family which had been toppled and massacred by the caliph, Harun al-Rashid. He returned to Baghdad in 809 upon the death of Harun al-Rashid. The subsequent ascension of Muhammad al-Amin, Harun al-Rashid's twenty-two-year-old libertine son (and former student of Abu Nuwas) was a mighty stroke of luck for Abu Nuwas. In fact, most scholars believe that Abu Nuwas wrote most of his poems during the reign of al-Amin (809-813). His most famous royal commission was a poem (a 'qasida') which he composed in praise of al-Amin.\n\n\"According to the critics of his time, he was the greatest poet in Islam.\" wrote F.F. Arbuthnot in \"Arabic Authors\". His contemporary Abu Hatim al Mekki often said that the deepest meanings of thoughts were concealed underground until Abu Nuwas dug them out.\n\nNevertheless, Abu Nuwas was imprisoned when his drunken, libidinous exploits tested even al-Amin's patience. Amin was finally overthrown by his puritanical brother, Al-Ma'mun, who had no tolerance for Abu Nuwas.\n\nSome later accounts claim that fear of prison made Abu Nuwas repent his old ways and become deeply religious, while others believe his later, penitent poems were simply written in hopes of winning the caliph's pardon. It was said that al-Ma'mun's secretary Zonbor tricked Abu Nuwas into writing a satire against Ali, the fourth Caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet, while Nuwas was drunk. Zonbor then deliberately read the poem aloud in public, and ensured Nuwas's continuing imprisonment. Depending on which biography is consulted, Abu Nuwas either died in prison or was poisoned by Ismail bin Abu Sehl, or both.\n\nAbu Nuwas is considered one of the greats of classical Arabic literature. He influenced many later writers, to mention only Omar Khayyám, and Hafiz — both of them Persian poets. A hedonistic caricature of Abu Nuwas appears in several of the Thousand and One Nights tales. Among his best known poems are the ones ridiculing the \"Olde Arabia\" nostalgia for the life of the Bedouin, and enthusiastically praising the up-to-date life in Baghdad as a vivid contrast. He is one of various people credited with inventing the literary form of the \"mu‘ammā\" (literally 'blinded' or 'obscured'), a riddle which is solved 'by combining the constituent letters of the word or name to be found'; he was certainly a major exponent of the form.\n\nHis freedom of expression, especially on matters forbidden by Islamic norms, continues to excite the animus of censors. While his works were freely in circulation until the early years of the twentieth century, in 1932 the first modern censored edition of his works appeared in Cairo. In January 2001, the Egyptian Ministry of Culture ordered the burning of some 6,000 copies of books of homoerotic poetry by Abu Nuwas. Any mention of pederasty was omitted from his entry in the Saudi \"Global Arabic Encyclopedia\".\n\nIn 1976, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in honor of Abu Nuwas.\n\nA heavily fictionalised Abu Nuwas is the protagonist of the novels \"The Father of Locks\" (Dedalus Books, 2009) and \"The Khalifah's Mirror\" (2012) by Andrew Killeen, in which he is depicted as a spy working for Ja'far al-Barmaki.\n\nIn the Sudanese novel \"Season of Migration to the North\" (1966) by Tayeb Salih, Abu Nuwas's love poetry is cited extensively by one of the novel's protagonists, the Sudanese Mustafa Sa'eed, as a means of seducing a young English woman in London: \"Does it not please you that the earth is awaking,/ That old virgin wine is there for the taking?\"\n\nAl-Khatib al-Baghdadi, the author of \"The History of Baghdad\", wrote that Abu Nuwas was buried in Shunizi cemetery in Baghdad.\n\nThe city has several places named for the poet. Abū Nuwās Street runs along the east bank of the Tigris that was once the city’s showpiece. Abu Nuwas Park is also located there on the 2.5-kilometer stretch between the Jumhouriya Bridge and a park that extends out to the river in Karada near the 14th of July Bridge.\n\nIn East Africa's Swahili culture the name \"Abu Nuwas\" is quite popular as Abunuwasi. Here it is connected to a number of stories which otherwise go by names like Nasreddin, Guha or \"the Mullah\" in folktale and literature of Islamic societies. In the tales Abunuwasi tricks greedy, wealthy men and avenges the poor people.\n\nThe Tanzanian artist Godfrey Mwampembwa (Gado) created a Swahili comic book called \"Abunuwasi\", which has adaptations of three of the Abunuwasi stories. The book was published by Sasa Sema Publications in 1996.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1618385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1618385", "title": "Bearer instrument", "text": "Bearer instrument\n\nA bearer instrument is a document that entitles the holder of the document rights of ownership or title to the underlying property, such as shares or bonds. Unlike normal registered instruments, no record is kept of who owns bearer instruments or of transactions involving transfer of ownership, enabling the owner to deal with the property anonymously. Whoever physically holds the bearer document is assumed to be the owner of the property, and the rights arising therefrom, such as dividends. \n\nBearer instruments are used especially by investors and corporate officers who wish to retain anonymity. The OECD in a 2003 report concluded that the use of bearer shares is \"perhaps the single most important (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism\" to protect the anonymity of a ship's beneficial owner. Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation, which in turn owns the asset. There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded.\n\nHowever, ownership (or legal entitlement) is extremely difficult to establish in event of loss or theft. In general, the legal \"situs\" of the property is where the instrument is located. Bearer instruments can be used in certain jurisdictions to avoid transfer taxes, although taxes may be charged when bearer instruments are issued.\n\nIn the United States, under the Uniform Commercial Code, a negotiable instrument (such as a check or promissory note) that is payable to the order of \"bearer\" or \"cash\" may be enforced (i.e. redeemed for payment) by the party in possession. The payee (i.e. the person named in the \"pay to\" line) may also convert an instrument into a bearer instrument by endorsing (signing) the back. In practice, however, many merchants and financial institutions will not pay a check presented for payment by anyone other than the named payee.\n\nBearer shares are banned in some countries, because of their potential for abuse, such as tax evasion, movement of funds, and money laundering. The United States ended federal tax deductions for interest paid on bearer bonds in 1982.\n\nThe first bearer securities in almost all countries were banknotes. Later, due to the monopolization of banknote issue by one or several banks (usually government ones), the form of bearer securities began to accept short-term bank loan obligations (certificates, vouchers, tickets) and long-term borrowing obligations of banks and corporations (bonds). With the development of the joint-stock form of enterprises in the form of bearer securities, shares were also issued. Historically, the first appeared registered shares, and much later there were shares of the bearer. Their appearance was associated with the development of the stock exchange. \n\nThe emergence of the first joint-stock companies can be attributed to the beginning of the 17th century: the famous English East India Company in 1613 and the Dutch East India Company in 1602. The shares of these companies were originally registered. The first bearer shares appeared with the establishment of John Law in France in 1717. By royal decree John Law was granted the right to establish a joint-stock bank with a fixed capital of 6 million francs, divided into 1,200 shares of 5,000 francs each with the right to issue banknotes. In August 1717, Law established a new joint stock company, Mississippi, with a fixed capital of 100 million, divided into 200,000 shares to colonize the countries lying along the banks of the Mississippi River. Shares of the bank, and of the company were bearer.\n\nFacilities associated with the bearer form of shares (ease of transfer, circulation on the exchange, proof of ownership) were evaluated and widely applied in joint-stock companies. But along with these advantages, the drawbacks of using these securities have also come to light: for example, their use in the exchange game. In the joint-stock establishments of John Law, these disadvantages of bearer shares were discovered quite soon. The stock market fever gripped a huge number of people, and after a while it ended in failure: the owners of shares, who for a few days considered themselves big capitalists, were left with nothing, holding worthless papers in their hands.\n\nDespite the first unfortunate experience, this form of participation in the joint-stock company as the acquisition of certificates of bearer shares has become quite widespread in Europe. Today there is an opinion that bearer shares are some kind of invention of offshore financial centers for the purpose of hiding information about the real owner of the company. However, this tool with more or less success has been functioning for more than one century.\n\nBearer shares are called securities, an anonymous holder of which is recognized from the legal point of view as a full-fledged shareholder of the company with all relevant rights. This document does not contain any indication of the name and name of the owner. The rights certified by the bearer act are actually owned by the owner of this document. The owner of the bearer certificate is considered the owner of shares certified by a certificate. Neither the company nor the chairman of the meeting of shareholders entered in the company's register, nor the director, any official of the company and no other authorized person is required to find out the circumstances under which the certificate was placed by its owner, or to raise the question of the validity or eligibility of any company, any actions of the owner of the certificate of such action. A shareholder is a person who actually owns a share (a share certificate). Bearer shares are transferred by simply delivering the certificate to a new holder. When the bearer shares are sold, it is not required to make any transfer inscriptions on the share certificate: the share is transferred by the physical transfer of the certificate from the seller (the bearer of the share certificate) to the buyer. The transfer of the bearer shares means the transfer of the relevant rights to the company. In contrast, a registered share contains an indication of the identity of the shareholder - only this person, and no one else can be a shareholder of the company. The names of the owners are entered in the register of the company's shareholders (owners of bearer shares are not registered in the company's register), and any transfer of shares from one owner to another is carried out on the basis of a written document (for example, a contract of sale between the seller and the buyer).Information on the change of owners of registered shares is also reflected in the shareholder register.\n\nThe first and most important condition for the issue of bearer shares is the fact that this right should be provided by the legislation of the country of registration for this type of company. In addition, the right to issue certificates of shares to bearer must be fixed in the company's constituent documents. The decision to issue shares in offshore jurisdictions is taken by the company's director. And at the same time the share certificate is issued.\n\nA share certificate is the main document certifying the rights of the shareholder, in which the statutory information is mandatory: name of the issuer, certificate number, the amount of the capital, number of shares owned by the holder of this certificate, date of issue of the certificate. In the column where the owner of the action is to be indicated, the name \"bearer\" is given in place of the name. This means that the actual owner of this certificate is the person who has this certificate. The company's constituent documents, as a rule, provide for the procedure for signing a certificate. In most offshore jurisdictions, share certificates must be signed by the director or other authorized person of the company.\n\nUntil recently, there was no mechanism to control the movement of bearer shares. Registered agents, sending their agent company's constituent documents, together with the certificate of registration, the charter and the memorandum of association, passed, as a rule, the forms of certificates of shares. Questions about who owns these certificates, and how they are transferred, were not asked. \n\nHowever, in the past few years, economically developed countries, in particular the United States, as well as international organizations such as OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) have begun to put significant pressure on offshore jurisdiction. Their main claim was not even that there is preferential taxation in low-tax areas, but lack of transparency: there are no open registries, no indication of who really owns the companies. And although international organizations have no right to issue binding instructions, and can not apply sanctions, nevertheless, some offshore jurisdictions have begun to improve their legislation in accordance with the recommendations of such international organisations. The FATF reflected its main directions of the prevention of money laundering in the document \"40 Recommendations\". Recommendations were adopted in April 1990 and almost every year undergo some changes. Recommendations of the FATF establish measures to ensure the transparency of legal entities with a view to obtaining competent authorities access to information about the beneficial owner at any time. Changes in the legislation of offshore jurisdictions within the framework of these recommendations are most often related to the open register of shareholders and directors, cancellation of bearer shares, as well as information cooperation with management and control bodies. Offshore centers reacted to criticism of their use of bearer shares in different ways. In a number of low-tax jurisdictions, bearer shares were banned (Bahamas, Isle of Man, Jersey, Mauritius). Now companies are registered there, but in a much smaller number than in other offshore territories. Some jurisdictions have taken compromise measures: on the one hand they tried to comply with the requirements of international organizations, and on the other hand - the requirements of customers who register and use companies (British Virgin Islands and Belize). And some countries, formally agreeing to cooperate, nevertheless, did not make significant changes to their legislation (Seychelles).\n\nThe main advantage for which registered companies with bearer shares earlier is confidentiality. Since at present information on holders of certificates of bearer shares is often needed to disclose even to one person, confidentiality can be called imaginary. Another advantage - the simplicity of transferring certificates of shares to the bearer is now also becoming more likely to become a drawback, namely, the insecurity of the owner from theft or loss. Any person who has acquired a certificate of bearer shares will be considered the owner of this certificate. The next drawback is the difficulty in opening a bank account. Some banks refuse to open accounts for companies that issued bearer shares, despite the fact that the client is ready to disclose all information about the owners of such shares, believing that this is contrary to their \"know your client\" policy. Some banks ask to deposit certificates of bearer shares with them. In addition, there may be difficulties in notifying shareholders about holding an annual meeting. As a rule, the procedure should be prescribed in the constituent documents. If a shareholder does not physically reside in this state, then it is likely that he simply will not find out about this fact. There can be a situation when the company wants to open an office in any country, and according to the legislation of this country it is necessary to confirm the fact of ownership of this company by the shareholder. A shareholder with certificates of bearer shares will not be able to confirm his rights, as his name is not indicated in the certificates. \n\n\n"}

It is based on the earlier work of Jan Długosz, supplementing its content with the events leading to the accession of Sigismund the Old to the throne. Although the first edition of the Chronicle was published in 1519, it was confiscated by the authorities. As a result of the intervention of the Senate some passages have been removed, others deeply revised, because a number of nobles felt offended by the hostile description of their ancestors. The book was republished in 1521 without the offending passages about Jagiellons and the Primate Jan Łaski. The Chronicle by Miechowita became a seminal source of data used in the creation of further chronicles by Bernard Wapowski and Marcin Kromer, the author of \"De origine et rebus GESTIS Polonorum\". Miechowita had his \"Chronica Polonorum\" republished by printer Hieronim Wietor of Kraków.

The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.\n\nA collaborative practice agreement can be referred to as a consult agreement, physician-pharmacist agreement, standing order or protocol, or physician delegation.\n\nAccording to healthcare researcher Karen E. Koch, the first coining of the term \"collaborative drug therapy management\" can be traced back to William A. Zellmer's 1995 publication in the \"American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy\". Zellmer advocates use of the term \"collaborative drug therapy management\" instead of \"prescribing,\" arguing that it will make legislation that expands the authority of pharmacists more palatable to lawmakers (and physician stakeholders). Most importantly, it centers the discussion on \"why\" pharmacists are interested in expanding that authority: to improve patient care through interdisciplinary collaboration. The modern concept of \"collaborative\" practice was derived, in part, to avoid the controversial term of dependent \"prescribing\" authority.\n\nThe term \"collaborative practice agreement\" has also been referred to as a consult agreement, collaborative pharmacy practice agreement, physician-pharmacist agreement, standing order or standing protocol, and physician delegation. A collaborative practice agreement is a legal document in the United States that establishes a formal relationship between pharmacists (often clinical pharmacy specialists) and collaborating physicians for the purpose of establishing a legal and ethical basis for pharmacists to participate in collaborative drug therapy management.\n\nLegal guidance and requirements for the formation of CPAs are established on a state by state basis. The federal government approved CPAs in 1995. Washington was the first state to pass legislation allowing for the formal formation of CPAs. In 1979, Washington amended the Practice of Pharmacy Requirements providing for the formation of \"collaborative drug therapy agreements.\" As of February 2016, 48 states and Washington D.C. have approved laws that allow for the provision of CPAs. The only two states that do not allow for the provision of CPAs are Alabama and Delaware. Alabama pharmacists had hoped to see a CPA law, House Bill 494, pass in 2015. The bill was introduced by Alabama House Representative Ron Johnson but died in committee.\n\nAs of 2010, Medicare Part B does not provide reimbursement for pharmacists. The Pharmacy and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act (H.R. 592 / S. 109) was introduced in both the House and the Senate on January 2017. This would allow pharmacists to be reimbursed through Medicare Part B for providing healthcare services in federally-defined medically underserved communities. These must be services that pharmacists are licensed to perform in their particular state, and services in which physicians would have been reimbursed for under Medicare. \n\nBelow is a list of US states that have approved CPAs and the year that they were approved (and/or later updated), as of February 2016:\n\nCPAs have been implemented for the management of a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the oncology setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.\n\nCPAs can be used as tools for pharmacists to better integrate with practicing clinicians in accountable care organization (ACO) offices, alleviate the time constraints of primary care visits, and help minimize delays in managing patients' chronic conditions.\n\nPharmacists involved in CPAs may participate in clinical services that are outside of the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists. Notably, pharmacists do not need to participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.\n\nExpanded pharmacy services under a CPA are described as collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM). While the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists provides for the legal authority to detect drug related problems (DRPs) and provide \"suggestions\" for solving DRPs to prescribers (such as physicians), pharmacists that provide CDTM \"directly\" solve DRPs when they detect them. This may involve prescribing activities, which include selecting and initiating medications for the treatment of a patient's diagnosed illnesses (as outlined in the CPA), discontinuing the use of prescription or over-the-counter medications, modifying a patient's drug therapy (e.g. changing the strength, frequency, route of drug administration, or duration of therapy), evaluating a patient's response to drug therapy (which may include ordering and performing laboratory tests, such as a basic metabolic panel), and continuing drug therapy (providing a new prescription).\n\nOther services may include administering medications, especially those administered parenterally (e.g. long-acting, injectable antipsychotics).\n\nThe legal provisions of CPAs vary on a state-by-state basis. This affects the specific services that pharmacists are allowed to perform pursuant to a CPA, as well as the terms of the arrangement (e.g. requirements for CPA renewal). Wisconsin's \"Wisconsin Act 294,\" for example, has been described by the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) as granting some of the most expansive powers to pharmacists in any state CPA law.\n\nCPAs are a focus of advocacy efforts for professional pharmacy organizations. In January 2012, the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) convened a consortium composed of pharmacy, medicine, and nursing stakeholders representing 12 states to discuss the integration of CPAs into everyday clinical practice. The consortium published a white paper titled \"Consortium Recommendations for Advancing Pharmacists' Patient Care Services and Collaborative Practice Agreements,\" summarizing their recommendations.\n\nIn July 2015, the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA) convened a working group composed of appointees from the CEOs of Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP) member organizations, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and individual states. The 18 member working group's report made recommendations towards what state lawmakers should include in CPA laws.\n\nIn 2015, the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) published an updated white paper on the subject of collaborative drug therapy management. The ACCP periodically publishes updates on the subject, with previous publications in 2003 and 1997. The paper describes the recent history of CPAs, the legislative progress, and discusses payment models for collaborative drug therapy management activities.\n\nCPAs have been met with mixed reviews by physicians and physician advocacy groups.\n\nIn a 2011 commentary for the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP), healthcare policy consultant and physician Terry McInnis stressed the need for pharmacist–physician collaboration to improve positive patient outcomes and to decrease healthcare costs. In the final paragraph, she makes an appeal towards pharmacists interested in pursuing CPAs:\n\nFor pharmacists, I believe that you have come to one of the rare crossroads that will define the future of your profession. You will either take your place as providers of care, or your numbers will dwindle as most dispensing activities are replaced by robotics and pharmacy technicians. I am a physician, and I say our profession and the patients that we serve need you 'on the team' as clinical pharmacist practitioners. But, will you truly join us?\n\nIn the keynote address of the 2013 APhA annual meeting, Reid Blackwelder, President of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), advocated for a \"collaborative view of health care.\"\n\nIn 2012, the AAFP produced a position paper that expressed support for CPAs, but stressed the risk of fragmenting care if pharmacists were given fully autonomous prescribing privileges.\n\nIn 2010, the American Medical Association (AMA) published a series of reports called the \"AMA Scope of Practice Data Series.\" One of the reports was focused on the profession of pharmacy, which criticized the formation of CPAs as an attempt to encroach upon the physician's scope of practice by pharmacists. In response to the report, a collaboration of seven national professional pharmacy associations drafted a response to the AMA's report on pharmacists. The response urged the AMA to correct their report, and to publish the revised report with errata. In 2011, the House of Delegates of the AMA adopted a softer tone by APhA in response to input from it and other professional pharmacy associations, ultimately passing the following resolution that refocused attention on opposing \"independent\" (rather than collaborative, or \"dependent\") practice agreements:\n\nThat our AMA develop model state legislation to address the expansion of pharmacist scope of practice that is found to be inappropriate or constitutes the practice of medicine, including but not limited to the issue of interpretations or usage of independent practice arrangements without appropriate physician supervision and work with interested states and specialties to advance such legislation (Directive to Take Action).\n\n"}

{"id": "22047237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22047237", "title": "Doe subpoena", "text": "Doe subpoena\n\nA Doe subpoena is a subpoena that seeks the identity of an unknown defendant to a lawsuit. Most jurisdictions permit a plaintiff who does not yet know a defendant's identity to file suit against John Doe and then use the tools of the discovery process to seek the defendant's true name. A Doe subpoena is often served on an online service provider or ISP for the purpose of identifying the author of an anonymous post. \n\nUnmasking an anonymous online poster is a two-step process. First, the plaintiff must issue a subpoena to the hosting website requesting the IP address of the poster. Most websites collect and temporarily store the IP addresses of visitors in a web server log, although no U.S. law requires that they retain this information for any particular length of time.\n\nIf the website provides the poster's IP address, the plaintiff must then subpoena the ISP that owns the address. This second subpoena requests the contact information associated with the account of the computer to which the IP address was assigned at the time the post was made.\n\nCourts do not require the target of a subpoena to provide notice to the person whose identity is sought. The hosting website is unlikely to notify the defendant, as it generally will not have access to contact information; subpoenas for IP addresses are therefore seldom subjected to legal challenge. The ISP, however, may be required by law to notify its subscriber before revealing any personally identifiable information in connection with a subpoena. \n\nA defendant who does receive notice may file a motion to quash, which asks the court to block the subpoena and prevent the ISP from complying. ISPs may also challenge Doe subpoenas on their customers' behalf, but they are not required to do so.\n\nNo uniform standard exists in the United States for determining the circumstances under which an anonymous online speaker may be unmasked. The federal and state courts that have considered the issue have applied a variety of tests. \n\nThis standard requires an ISP to divulge the identity of an anonymous poster if the plaintiff's case would be able to withstand a motion for summary judgment. This means that the plaintiff must \"make a sufficient showing on [every] essential element of its case with respect to which it has the burden of proof.\"\n\nThe lead case applying the summary judgment standard is \"Doe v. Cahill\", in which a city council member sued an anonymous poster for two allegedly defamatory blog comments. The Delaware Supreme Court held that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the comments were \"capable of a defamatory meaning,\" an essential element of any defamation claim. As a result, the plaintiff was not entitled to discovery of the Doe defendant's identity.\n\nOther courts have applied a \"prima facie showing\" test, which functions like the summary judgment test but avoids the \"potentially confusing\" attachment of a procedural label, since the standards governing such motions may differ depending on the jurisdiction. In \"Krinsky v. Doe 6\", the California Court of Appeals applied the prima facie showing test in the libel context, holding that \"[w]here it is clear to the court that discovery of the defendant's identity is necessary to pursue the plaintiff's claim, the court may refuse to quash a third-party subpoena if the plaintiff succeeds in setting forth evidence that a libelous statement has been made.\"\n\nThe prima facie standard was also favored by a New York state district court in \"Sony Music Entertainment Inc. v. Does\". The court first found that the Doe defendants, who had used a peer-to-peer network to download copyrighted music files, warranted a lesser degree of First Amendment protection than speakers who engaged in \"true expression\" intended \"to communicate a thought or convey an idea.\" It then held that disclosure of the Doe defendants' identities was warranted based on a consideration of: (1) the plaintiff's ability to establish a prima facie claim; (2) the specificity of the plaintiff's discovery request; (3) the availability of alternative means to obtain the subpoenaed information; (4) the central need for discovery to advance the plaintiff's claim; and (5) the defendants' expectation of privacy.\n\nThis test provides a higher level of protection to anonymous online speakers, in that it requires a court to first apply the summary judgment standard of \"Doe v. Cahill\" and then, if the plaintiff is able to meet its burden, to balance the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case against the poster's interest in remaining anonymous.\n\nA New Jersey appellate court applied this hybrid test in \"Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3\". The court set forth five guidelines for judges to follow in deciding whether to compel disclosure of an anonymous poster's identity: (1) the plaintiff must make good faith efforts to notify the poster and give the poster a reasonable opportunity to respond; (2) the plaintiff must specifically identify the poster's allegedly actionable statements; (3) the complaint must set forth a prima facie cause of action; (4) the plaintiff must support each element of the claim with sufficient evidence; and (5) \"the court must balance the defendant's First Amendment right of anonymous free speech against the strength of the prima facie case presented and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendant's identity to allow the plaintiff to properly proceed.\"\n\nThe so-called \"Dendrite\" standard was adopted by the Arizona Supreme Court in \"Mobilisa, Inc. v. Doe\", and most recently, by Maryland's highest court in \"Independent Newspapers v. Brodie\". After reviewing the treatment of anonymous online speech by other state and federal courts, the Maryland court concluded that \"a test requiring notice and opportunity to be heard, coupled with a showing of a prima facie case and the application of a balancing test—such as the standard set forth in \"Dendrite\"—most appropriately balances a speaker's constitutional right to anonymous Internet speech with a plaintiff's right to seek judicial redress from defamatory remarks.\"\n\nSome early cases required plaintiffs to demonstrate that their cause of action could withstand a motion to dismiss. This standard holds plaintiffs to a much lower evidentiary burden than the summary judgment standard, as it only requires the allegation of facts that, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to a legal remedy.\n\nA California district court applied this standard in one of the first cases to consider the discovery of an anonymous online speaker's identity, \"Columbia Insurance Co. v. Seescandy.com\". The court analogized the motion to dismiss standard to the requirement in a criminal investigation that the government show probable cause before obtaining a warrant, in that both prerequisites were necessary to \"prevent abuse.\" The court concluded that an anonymous poster could only be unmasked if the plaintiff made \"some showing that an act giving rise to civil liability actually occurred and that the discovery [was] aimed at revealing specific identifying features of the person or entity who committed that act.\" Inconsistent with a motion to dismiss standard, the court also relied on evidence of actual confusion in finding a basis for allowing discovery to identify the anonymous speaker.\n\nUnder a good faith standard, plaintiffs are simply required to show that their claim is made in good faith and not with the intent to harass the Doe defendant. In an early case, the Circuit Court of Virginia applied this standard in \"In re Subpoena Duces Tecum to America Online\", holding that a court may compel an ISP to reveal a subscriber's identity if it finds \"that the party requesting the subpoena has a legitimate, good faith basis to contend that it may be the victim of conduct actionable in the jurisdiction\" and that \"the identity information is centrally needed to advance that claim.\" In Doe v. 2themart.com Inc., the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington required showing of good faith, as well as the compelling need for the discovery of the identifying information.\n\nCourts and commentators have subsequently deemed this standard the \"most deferential to plaintiffs,\" as \"it offers no practical, reliable way to determine the plaintiff's good faith and leaves the speaker with little protection.\"\n\nFederal privacy statutes may limit a plaintiff's ability to gain access to an ISP's subscriber records.\n\nUnder the Cable TV Privacy Act of 1984, a cable ISP may be required to notify its subscribers and obtain consent before disclosing any personally identifiable information, but the statute provides limited exceptions to the consent requirement, including disclosure made pursuant to a court order.\n\nThe Electronic Communications Privacy Act restricts government and private access to computer records. Thus, in order to unmask the author of an anonymous post through the legal process, the individual seeking the information must comply with ECPA. There is no provision within ECPA, other than voluntary disclosure or with consent, that allows civil litigants to force an ISP or website to reveal the contents of a user's emails via a subpoena. However, a private party in a lawsuit may force an ISP to disclose non-content records (e.g. the name of the owner of an account, a list of email addresses to whom emails were sent, access times, etc.) through a subpoena. In addition, the government can obtain the records needed to identify the person behind an IP address using a subpoena. In order to obtain more detailed transactional records, the government would be required to obtain a court order by setting forth \"specific and articulable facts show that there are reasonable grounds to believe...the records...are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "303448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303448", "title": "Gwoyeu Romatzyh", "text": "Gwoyeu Romatzyh\n\nGwoyeu Romatzyh (pinyin: \"Guóyǔ luómǎzì\", literally \"National Language Romanization\"), abbreviated GR, is a system for writing Mandarin Chinese in the Latin alphabet. The system was conceived by Yuen Ren Chao and developed by a group of linguists including Chao and Lin Yutang from 1925 to 1926. Chao himself later published influential works in linguistics using GR. In addition a small number of other textbooks and dictionaries in GR were published in Hong Kong and overseas from 1942 to 2000.\nGR is the better known of the two romanization systems which indicate the four tones of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables (\"tonal spelling\"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: \"āi, ái, ǎi\" and \"ài\") or numbers (Wade–Giles: \"ai, ai\", etc.). GR spells the four tones of the same vowel, \"ai\", \"air, \"ae and \"ay\". These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable \"ai\".\n\nChao claimed that, because GR embeds the tone of each syllable in its spelling, it may help students to master Chinese tones. One study of GR, however, found the opposite to be true. GR uses a complicated system of tonal spelling that obscures the basic relationship between spelling and tone; for example, the difference between tones 1 and 2 is variously indicated as \"mha\" vs. \"ma\", \"ching\" vs. \"chyng\", \"chang\" vs. \"charng\", etc. Although tonal spelling has been adopted as part of the normal romanization of a number of Asian languages (e.g. Hmong), all such systems indicate different tones in a simple and consistent fashion by adding letters to the end of a syllable (e.g. in Hmong, \"-b\" indicates high tone, \"-s\" indicates low tone, \"-j\" indicates high-falling tone, etc.).\n\nIn 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's official romanization system. GR was used to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from a small number of trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi \"(shǎnxī, 陝西),\" which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi \"(shānxī, 山西)\" when written in pinyin without diacritics.\n\nTonal spelling, Gwoyeu Romatzyh's most distinctive feature, was first suggested to Y.R. Chao by Lin Yutang. By 1922 Chao had already established the main principles of GR.\nThe details of the system were developed in 1925–1926 by a group of five linguists, led by Chao and including Lin, under the auspices of the Preparatory Commission for the Unification of the National Language. In 1928 GR was officially adopted by the government. GR was intended to be used alongside the existing \"Juhin\" (\"Zhùyīn\") phonetic symbols: hence the alternative name for GR, \"Second Pattern of the National Alphabet.\" Both systems were used to indicate the revised standard of pronunciation in the new official \"Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use\" of 1932. The designers of GR had greater ambitions: their aim was complete reform of the script, using GR as a practical system of writing.\nIn the 1930s two shortlived attempts were made to teach GR to railway workers and peasants in Hénán and Shāndōng provinces. Support for GR, being confined to a small number of trained linguists and Sinologists, \"was distinguished more for its quality than its quantity.\" During this period GR faced increasing hostility because of the complexity of its tonal spelling. Conversely, Sinologist Bernhard Karlgren criticised GR for its lack of phonetic rigour. Ultimately, like the rival (toneless) system Latinxua Sinwenz, GR failed to gain widespread support, principally because the \"National\" language was too narrowly based on Beijing speech: \"a sufficiently precise and strong language norm had not yet become a reality in China\".\n\nA vestigial use of GR can be seen in the official spelling of the first syllable of \"Shaanxi\" for Shǎnxī (陝西) province, to distinguish it from Shānxī (山西) province, particularly in foreign-language text where the tone marks are often omitted. Some prominent Chinese have used GR to transliterate their names: for example the mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern. The romanization system was changed by the government of the People's Republic of China in 1958 to the current system used now in the country, and other foreign and international institutions, like the United Nations, the Library of Congress, the International Organization for Standardization, and is widely used to teach Mandarin Chinese to foreign students: Hanyu Pinyin. Meanwhile, in the Republic of China (Taiwan), GR survived until the 1970s as a pronunciation aid in monolingual dictionaries such as \"Gwoyeu Tsyrdean [Guóyǔ Cídiǎn]\" and \"Tsyrhuey [Cíhuì]\", but was officially replaced in 1986 by a modified form known as Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II. The Warring States period State of Wey () is often spelled as such to distinguish it from the more prominent state , which are both pronounced Wèi in Mandarin, but in Old Chinese it was probably /*ɢʷat-s/ and /*N-qʰuj-s/, respectively.\n\nAn important feature of GR, adopted from other precursors and later also adopted by Pinyin, is the use of contrasting unvoiced/voiced pairs of consonants from Latin to represent aspirated and unaspirated sounds in Chinese. For example \"b\" and \"p\" represent and (\"p\" and \"p‘\" in Wade). Another distinctive feature of GR is the use of \"j, ch,\" and \"sh\" to represent two different series of sounds. When followed by \"i\" these letters correspond to the alveolo-palatal sounds (Pinyin \"j, q,\" and \"x\"); otherwise they correspond to the retroflex sounds (Pinyin \"zh, ch,\" and \"sh\"). Readers used to Pinyin need to pay particular attention to these spellings: for example, GR \"ju, jiu,\" and \"jiou\" correspond to Pinyin \"zhu, ju,\" and \"jiu\" respectively.\n\nGR orthography has these additional notable features:\n\n\nBy default, the basic GR spelling described above is used for Tone1 syllables. The basic form is then modified to indicate tones 2, 3 and 4. This is accomplished in one of three ways:\n\n\nWherever possible the concise first method is used. The following rules of thumb cover most cases.\n\nTone 1 (basic form)\n\nTone 2: i/u → y/w; or add -r\n\nTone 3: i/u → e/o; or double vowel\n\nTone 4: change/double final letter; or add -h\n\nNeutral tone: precede with a dot (full stop)\n\nException Syllables with an initial sonorant (\"l-/m-/n-/r-\") use the basic form for T2 rather than T1. In these syllables the (rarer) T1 is marked with \"-h-\" as the second letter. For example \"mha\" is T1 (mā), whereas \"ma\" is T2 (má). T3 and T4 are regular: \"maa\" (\"mǎ\") and \"mah\" (\"mà\").\n\nAn important principle of GR is that syllables which form words should be written together. This strikes speakers of European languages as obvious; but in Chinese the concept of \"word\" is not easy to pin down. The basic unit of speech is popularly thought to be the monosyllable represented by a character ( \"tzyh\", \"zì\"), which in most cases represents a meaningful syllable or morpheme, a smaller unit than the \"linguistic word\". Characters are written and printed with no spaces between words; yet in practice most Chinese words consist of two-syllable compounds, and it was Chao's bold innovation in 1922 to reflect this in GR orthography by grouping the appropriate syllables together into words. This represented a radical departure from hyphenated Wade–Giles forms such as \"Kuo-yü Lo-ma-tzu\" (the Wade spelling of GR).\n\nChao used GR in four influential works:\n\n\"Readings in Sayable Chinese\" was written \"to supply the advanced student of spoken Chinese with reading matter which he can actually use in his speech.\" It consists of three volumes of Chinese text with facing GR romanization. They contain some lively recorded dialogues, \"Fragments of an autobiography,\" two plays and a translation of Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass (Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii)\". Two extracts from \"Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii\" with facing translations can be read online.\n\nIn 1942 Walter Simon introduced GR to English-speaking sinologists in a special pamphlet, \"The New Official Chinese Latin Script\". Over the remainder of the 1940s he published a series of textbooks and readers, as well as a Chinese-English Dictionary, all using GR. His son Harry Simon later went on to use GR in scholarly papers on Chinese linguistics.\n\nIn 1960 Y.C. Liu, a colleague of Walter Simon's at SOAS, published \"Fifty Chinese Stories\". These selections from classical texts were presented in both classical and modern Chinese, together with GR romanizations and romanized Japanese versions prepared by Simon (by that time Professor Emeritus of Chinese in the University of London).\n\nLin Yutang's \"Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" (1972) incorporated a number of innovative features, one of which was a simplified version of GR. Lin eliminated most of the spelling rules requiring substitution of vowels, as can be seen from his spelling \"Guoryuu Romatzyh\", in which the regular \"-r\" is used for T2 and a doubled vowel for T3.\n\nThe first 3 issues of the \"Shin Tarng\" magazine (which would be \"Xīn Táng\" in Pinyin; published in 1982-1989) used a Simplified Romanisation ( ) based on Gwoyeu Romatzyh; the fourth edition, entitled Xin Talng, used Pinyin with Gwoyeu Romatzyh-like tone marking.\n\nChao believed that the benefit of GR was to make tonal differences more salient to learners:\n\nFor example, it may be easier to memorize the difference between GR \"Beeijing\" (the city) and \"beyjiing\" (\"background\") than the Pinyin versions \"Běijīng\" and \"bèijǐng\", where the tones seem to be almost an afterthought. One study conducted at the University of Oregon in 1991–1993, compared the results of using Pinyin and GR in teaching elementary level Chinese to two matched groups of students, and concluded that \"GR did not lead to significantly greater accuracy in tonal production.\"\n\nGR continues to be used by some teachers of Chinese. In 2000, the Princeton \"Chinese Primer\" series was published in both GR and Pinyin versions.\n\nHere is an extract from Y.R. Chao's \"Sayable Chinese\". The topic is scholarly (\"What is Sinology?\"), but the style colloquial. The tonal spelling markers or \"clues\" are again highlighted using the same color-coding scheme as above. Versions in Chinese characters, Pinyin and English are given below the GR text.\n\n\n\n"}

A well known folktale to feature this character was recorded in Selkirkshire and featured her along with two other spinsters, who in compliment to Habetrot's deformed lips feature a splayed foot and a flat thumb respectively. This tale is related to tales found in countries such as Germany (such as The Three Spinners) and Norway (The Three Aunts).\n\nAccording to the folklore of the borders it was considered unlucky to step upon \"unchristened ground\" (the graves of stillborn or unbaptised children) and any who did were said to catch \"grave-merels\" (or \"grave-scab\") an illness that causes difficulty of breathing and trembling limbs as well as the burning of the skin as if touched by a hot iron. The only way for this to be relieved was for the unfortunate to wear a sack made from linen grown in a field using manure from a farmyard that has not been disturbed for forty years, spun by \"Habetrot\", bleached by an honest bleacher in an honest miller's milldam and sewed by an honest tailor.\n\n\n"}

Strictly speaking, it is distinct from other matters such as naturalization and citizenship, although they are often conflated. Immigration laws vary around the world, as well as according to the social and political climate of the times, as acceptance of immigrants sways from the widely inclusive to the deeply nationalist and isolationist. Countries frequently maintain laws which regulate both the rights of entry and exit as well as internal rights, such as the duration of stay, freedom of movement, and the right to participate in commerce or government.\n\nNational laws regarding the immigration of citizens of that country are regulated by international law. The United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights mandates that all countries allow entry to their own citizens.\n\nTo control immigration, many countries set up customs at entry points. Some common location for entry points are airports and roads near the border. At the customs department, travel documents are inspected. Some required documents are a passport, an international certificate of vaccination and an onward ticket. Sometimes travelers are also required to declare or register the amount of money they are carrying.\n\nThis section is an attempt to classify and bring together information about immigration legislation on a number of countries with high immigration.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016470", "title": "Johnny Valentine", "text": "Johnny Valentine\n\nJohn Theodore Wisniski (September 22, 1928 – April 24, 2001), better known by his ring name Johnny Valentine, was an American professional wrestler with a career spanning almost three decades. He has been inducted into four halls of fame for his achievements in wrestling. Wisniski is the father of professional wrestler Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine.\n\nHe held numerous regional titles, including the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. He had long running rivalries with Bobo Brazil, Pat O'Connor, Buddy Rogers, Antonio Rocca, Lou Thesz, Harley Race, The Sheik, Wahoo McDaniel, Fritz von Erich, Bruno Sammartino, Johnny Powers, Antonio Inoki and Jack & Jerry Brisco. He alternated between being a villain and a hero (babyface) during the Golden Era in the 1940s through 1960s of wrestling.\n\nIn 1975, he was injured in a plane crash; he suffered a broken back and was forced to retire from wrestling. He worked briefly as a manager before retiring altogether. He suffered from several health problems during his retirement, which worsened considerably after a fall in 2000. He died the following year.\n\nWisniski debuted as a professional wrestler in 1947, wrestling Karl Nowena in Buenos Aires. In order to make the matches as believable as possible Wisniski insisted the men he faced in the ring hit him as hard as possible. From that he earned a strong reputation as being a very tough man. On New Year's Day, 1950, Buddy Rogers defeated Wisniski in the finals of a United States title tournament. He also competed in the NWA's Capitol Wrestling territory. Jerry Graham, who was a co-holder of the Northeast version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship, selected Wisniski in November 1959 to take over the title from Graham's injured partner. They were beaten for the title belts the following April, but Wisniski took on a new partner, Buddy Rogers, to regain the championship by defeating The Fabulous Kangaroos on November 19, 1960. Wisniski's rivalry with the Kangaroos continued, as the Kangaroos regained the belts in a rematch one week later. Wisniski went over one year without holding a championship before teaming with a new partner, this time Bob Ellis, to defeat the Kangaroos and take back the championship. Wisniski & Ellis lost the belts to Buddy Rogers & Handsome Johnny Barend in a match where Arnold Skoaland subbed for Ellis, but the belts were still up, on Washington, DC TV. Rogers & Barend then defeated the real team of Wisniski & Ellis 2 pins to 1 in a main event at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn Toronto, Wisniski and three different partners won the International Tag Team title during 1963. Wisniski left the territory without dropping the title. He wrestled in Japan in the mid-1960s and had a series of matches against Antonio Inoki. Those matches are regarded as the bouts that helped build Inoki into an elite wrestler in Japan, as Valentine was the highest-profile foreign wrestler Inoki had ever faced at the time. Valentine put over Inoki in the matches, dropping the Toronto version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship to him catapulting Inoki's career in the process. Wisniski also continued to wrestle in the former Capitol Wrestling territory, which had since been renamed the World Wide Wrestling Federation. While there, he had one last reign with what was then known as the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship, as he teamed with Tony Parisi to hold the belts for seven months in 1966. Wisniski later turned on Parisi, however. This ignited a brief feud with Bruno Sammartino, who was billed as Parisi's cousin. Because Wisniski was also wrestling in Texas at the same time, he got only sporadic main event matches against Sammartino during this feud.\n\nWisniski then moved on to the Florida territory, where he won the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship three times. In Georgia, he defeated Tim Woods for the NWA Georgia Heavyweight title, on May 10, 1968, and repeated his win in a match against Doug Gilbert (not to be confused with the Doug Gilbert who was not yet born) to retake the title. In Missouri, Wisniski competed for the Missouri Heavyweight Championship in a tournament to determine the inaugural champion. He defeated Baron von Raschke before withdrawing from the tournament due to focus his efforts on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After Harley Race won the tournament and the title belt, Valentine defeated him to win the championship on January 19, 1973. He dropped the belt to Terry Funk the following month. Because Funk used a chair as a weapon in front of the referee, fans demanded a rematch. Valentine was unable to compete due to heart problems, however, so Gene Kiniski took his place and won the belt from Funk. In October 1972, Wisniski defeated Jacques Rougeau for the International Heavyweight Championship, but was stripped of the title in January 1973, after he no-showed the rematch.\n\nIn the National Wrestling Federation, Wisniski defeated Johnny Powers for the NWF North American Heavyweight Championship on September 1, 1972. Powers beat Wisniski for the title in October, but Wisniski won the title again from Abdullah the Butcher on October 19. He was stripped of the title following a match with Johnny Powers. On November 23, he captured the title from Powers, but lost it again in January. In the Japan Wrestling Association, Wisniski won the International Tag Team title on February 22, 1973, and then the United National Heavyweight Championship on March 2. He lost the Tag title on March 6, and the United Heavyweight title on March 8. Back in the National Wrestling Federation, in August 1973, Wisniski beat Jacques Rougeau, Sr. to win the North American Heavyweight Championship. He lost it to Johnny Powers in late 1973.\n\nIn Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, Wisniski was awarded the Mid Atlantic Heavyweight Championship in January 1974, after Jerry Brisco left to work in Japan. Bearcat Wright defeated Wisniski in a boxing match to win the title on May 13, 1974. He won the championship from Sonny King on November 4, and won the United States Heavyweight Championship on July 4, 1975.\n\nAfter Wisniski was paralyzed in a plane crash, he remained active in professional wrestling as a manager in Paul Boesch's Texas-based promotion. From his wheelchair, Wisniski managed Dale Hey, who competed as Dale Valentine in a storyline that saw the two promoted as brothers. The storyline did not last long, however.\n\nWisniski was originally from Maple Valley, Washington. He is said to have come from a dysfunctional family. He was a devout Christian for many years. He was married in the early 1950s and the marriage lasted 20 years until they divorced. He was later married to a woman named Sharon, who worked across the street from his apartment in the mid 1970s when they met. She later visited John as he was recovering in hospital from his 1975 plane crash. Some time later the relationship ended as he didn't want her to see him in his condition. Years later while on braces and crutches he managed to drive around her neighbourhood for hours until he found her house. As he slowly walked to the front door Sharon`s daughter announced to Sharon that Johnny Valentine was in front of their home. Sharon having been ill refused to go to the door and hid. Wisniski insisted he wouldn't leave until he saw her. When she finally came to the door he asked her to marry him and she accepted. Following John`s death, Sharon planned to write a book titled \"A Never Ending Love Story of a Wrestler and His Wife\" about their life together. He also had a son from a long ago previous relationship, Greg Valentine, who has wrestled professionally since 1970 and is best known as Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine. Ric Flair, who wrestled with Wisniski, has described him as a quiet person who kept to himself. He was also known for making his demands clear to employers and not backing down, and many stories continue to circulate about practical jokes, or ribs, that he played on his fellow wrestlers.\n\nOn October 4, 1975, Wisniski was in a private airplane (a twin-engined Cessna 310)\nwith Ric Flair, David Crockett, Bob Bruggers, and Tim Woods. Because of the weight of the passengers, the pilot realized that he could not take off without reducing the amount of fuel the plane was carrying. Part way through the flight, the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed near Wilmington, North Carolina. The crash broke Flair's back, Bob Bruggers, Wikniski, and pilot Michael Farkus also broke their backs. A bone fragment became embedded in his spinal column, paralyzing him for life and forcing him to have a clamp implanted to hold the bones in his back together. Farkus died a year later having never awakened from a coma. Crockett and Woods suffered less serious injury.\n\nIn August 2000, Wisniski fell from his front porch, and had a number of injuries and complications. These included a fractured back, pneumonia, staph infection, collapsed lungs and kidney failure. Due to his many injuries he slipped into a coma. At one point he came out of it while his wife was singing to him. He began singing himself but fell back into the coma. His wife had purchased medical insurance through a health maintenance organization (HMO), but the organization was unwilling to pay for Wisniski's extended stay in the hospital. As a result, Lou Thesz's wife convinced the Cauliflower Alley Club to help contribute to Wisniski's medical bills. Those medical bills reached close to a million dollars.\n\nValentine has been recognized for his wrestling career by several sources. Shortly after his death, he was named the 2001 recipient of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\"'s Stanley Weston Award, a recognition given for lifetime achievement in professional wrestling. He has also been inducted into several halls of fame. He was a member of the inaugural class of inductees to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996. He is also a member of the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he joined the St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame the following year.\n\nValentine died peacefully in River Oaks, Texas on April 24, 2001. He was 72. His wife Sharon kept his ashes in her bedroom. She died in 2013.\n\n\n"}

Though it is virtually the only secular text from the Byzantine age of eclipse that preceded the Macedonian Renaissance, surviving in a single manuscript, its modern commentators have not esteemed it highly: Alan Cameron found it \"so stuffed with such staggering absurdities and confusions (especially where Constantine is concerned) that it is seldom worth even attempting to explain them, much less sift out the few grains of historical fact behind them.\" A reviewer of its modern edition even called it \"the Byzantinist's \"Historia Augusta\"\". Classicists have been frustrated in not being able securely to identify in \"Parastaseis\" the great sculptures of Antiquity that had been removed to Constantinople by Constantine the Great and his successors, and which continued to represent continuity with the classical tradition by their prominent presence in Constantinople's public spaces.\n\nFire and damage took their toll, but enough remained to form the subject of Nicetas Choniates's little pamphlet \"On the Statues destroyed by the Latins\", in which Nicetas described the destruction of the remaining statues by the Latin crusaders at the sack of Constantinople in 1204.\n\nThe \"Parastaseis\", dedicated to a doubtless imaginary \"Philokalos\", the generic \"lover of beauty\", are generally interpreted on the simplest level as a kind of tourist's guide to the curiosities of Constantinople, in the manner of the later guides to Rome, \"Mirabilia urbis Romae\" and \"De mirabilibus urbis Romae\". In Classical Greek, a description of a work of art is an \"ekphrasis\", and when considered under this rubric, or compared with the later compilation of notes on Constantinople called the \"Patria\" of Constantinople, the \"Parastaseis\" fail to give an objective description. Instead, the reader is offered anecdotal narratives about the statues, which had become foci for legends and wonder-working objects themselves. \"Statues were perceived on both the intellectual and popular level as animated, dangerous and talismanic,\" observes Liz James. Few of these anecdotes were as extended as the first-person narration about a statue of \"Maximian\" in the theatre of the Kynegion, which fell upon the investigator's companion, killing him; the narrator, who had taken refuge in Hagia Sophia, was exonerated when a certain philosopher, Johannes, found a text attributed to Demosthenes, predicting that the statue was \"fated\" to kill a prominent man. The emperor Philippicus (reigned 711–13) then had the statue buried. Such anecdotes do not directly relate to the commonly attributed imperial motivations for displaying classical plunder, as manifestations of imperial splendor past, present and future, and may be too summarily dismissed merely as examples of Christian superstition with regard to \"idols\".\nLiz James reinterpreted the text as exemplifying Byzantine views of the \"daimones\" inhabiting such three-dimensional figural representations as potential sources of power, for those Christians who understood how to harness it. The objective assessment of a work of art was immaterial: what mattered to Byzantine writers was the \"meaning\" for which the statue served merely as a vehicle. With no sense of \"Antiquity\", the Byzantines did not distance themselves or their art from their East Roman forebears, and had no sense that their interpretations of subject matter, often given Christian reidentifications, or the artistic style in which these representations were dressed, had drifted; by contrast, \"we notice the distance that separates the Byzantines from the original meaning of pagan statues\", given new identities as Christian figures or Emperors. More recently, Benjamin Anderson has argued that the \"Parastaseis\" represents an attempt by a group of a self-styled aristocrats to claim the statues as repositories of secret knowledge about the future of the empire, and thus to gain leverage in their dealings with the eighth-century emperors.\n"}

His surname is rendered in various other ways: e.g., in English, \"Skalich, Scalich, Scaliger;\" in Latin, \"Scalichius\" or \"Scaligius;\" and in Spanish, \"Scalitzius\".\n\nSkalić studied theology and philosophy in Vienna and later moved around Europe, living in Bologna, Rome, Bohemia, Poland, France and Germany, among other places.\n\nHis book \"Encyclopaedia seu orbis disciplinarum tam sacrarum quam prophanarum epistemon\" (\"Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World of Disciplines\"; Basel, 1559) is one of the first books entitled \"encyclopedia\". Robert Collison later wrote that the work was poorly written, only being important today for its use of the word \"encyclopaedia,\" and that Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh had used the word \"cyclopaedia\" to describe his work in 1541. Skalić also wrote a treatise on music: \"Dialogus de Lyra\" (Cologne, 1570).\nHe and preacher Johann Funck exercised great influence over Albert (1490-1568), first duke of Prussia, and became wealthy. Religious differences with the king of Poland led to the execution of Funck and the rise of Skalić.\n\nReferences vary regarding Skalić's nationality. M. Girardi-Karšulin at the University of Zagreb claims that he was Croatian, as does Darko Žubrinić. But many modern English encyclopedias, such as \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" \"Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia\", and \"Encarta\" indicate that he was German. This could be because he lived at the time when Lika and the rest of Croatia was part of the Habsburg Monarchy, although, as stated above, he spent a major part of his life in Germany.\n\nOlder works such as the Spanish \"Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeoamericana\" (\"Espasa\") (vol. 19, (1930) page 1166) say that he is an Hungarian count (\"\"y esta voz, ya latinizada, se emplea en el rótulo de la obra del conde húngaro Scalitzus\",\" \"and this term, Latinized, is used in the heading of the work of the Hungarian count Scalitzius\".)

It was signed by the Polish underground organization, Front for the Rebirth of Poland, which was a continuation of the prewar Catholic Action. Its president at the time was the Polish writer, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka. \"Protest!\" was clandestinely issued as a leaflet in 5,000 copies in Warsaw on 11 August 1942. It was published a few weeks after the start of the Germans' liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto, from which – as part of Operation Reinhard – Jews were deported to the Treblinka extermination camp.\n\nThe world, Kossak-Szczucka wrote, was silent in the face of this atrocity. \"England is silent, so is America, even the influential international Jewry, so sensitive in its reaction to any transgression against its people, is silent. Poland is silent... Dying Jews are surrounded only by a host of Pilates washing their hands in innocence.\" Those who are silent in the face of murder, she wrote, become accomplices to the crime. Kossak-Szczucka saw this largely as an issue of religious ethics. \"Our feelings toward Jews have not changed,\" she wrote. \"We do not stop thinking of them as political, economic and ideological enemies of Poland.\" But, she wrote, this does not relieve Polish Catholics of their duty to oppose the crimes being committed in their country.\nWe are required by God to protest,\" she wrote. \"God who forbids us to kill. We are required by our Christian consciousness. Every human being has the right to be loved by his fellow men. The blood of the defenceless cries to heaven for revenge. Those who oppose our protest, are not Catholics.\n\nWe do not believe that Poland can benefit from German cruelties. On the contrary. ... We know how poisoned is the fruit of the crime. ... Those who do not understand this, and believe that a proud and free future for Poland can be combined with acceptance of the grief of their fellow men, are neither Catholics nor Poles.\n\nThe protest was a big surprise for leftist circles and the Jews themselves, because Zofia Kossak was associated with Catholic national circles, which in the pre-war Poland were very reserved for Jews and criticized Jewish communities. This position was also clearly presented by the author in the content of her protest. After announcing her appeal, Kossak repeatedly published in the underground press appeals to Poles for help to the Jews. Her efforts led in September 1942 to establishing an organization helping Jews, the Provisional Committee to Aid Jews (\"Tymczasowy Komitet Pomocy Żydom\"), later transformed into the Council to Aid Jews (\"Rada Pomocy Żydom\") - Żegota, an underground organization whose sole purpose was to save Jews in Poland from Nazi extermination. It was the only organization of this type in occupied Europe. Co-organizer was Wanda Krahelska, social activist of the Polish Socialist Party.\n\nKossak personally helped the Jews hiding on the \"Aryan side\" by supplying them with money and false documents. In 1943 she was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in the German concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, and later transferred to Pawiak prison, where she was sentenced to death. It was saved in 1944 thanks to the efforts of the Polish underground. For her contribution to saving Jews during World War II, she received posthumously in 1982 a medal and the title of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem.\n\nRegarding Kossak-Szczucka's \"Protest\", Robert D. Cherry and Annamaria Orla-Bukowska wrote in the introduction to \"Rethinking Poles and Jews\": \"Without at all whitewashing her antisemitism in the document, she vehemently called for active intercession on behalf of the Jews - precisely in the name of Polish Roman Catholicism and Polish patriotism. The deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto precipitated her cofounding of Żegota that same year - an Armia Krajowa (AK, Home Army) unit whose sole purpose was to save Jews.\"\n\n"}

It is located in the Loop in Chicago, Illinois. The school is associated with the museum of the same name, and \"The Art Institute of Chicago\" or \"Chicago Art Institute\" often refers to either entity. Providing degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels, SAIC has been recognized by \"U.S. News & World Report\" as one of the top graduate art programs in the nation, as well as by Columbia University's National Arts Journalism survey as the most influential art school in the United States.\n\nTracing its history to an art students' cooperative founded in 1866, which grew into the museum and school, SAIC has been accredited since 1936 by the Higher Learning Commission, by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design since 1944 (charter member), and by the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) since its founding in 1991. Additionally it is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board.\n\nIts downtown Chicago campus consists of seven buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the AIC building. SAIC is in an equal partnership with the AIC and share many administrative resources such as design, construction, and human resources. The campus, located in the Loop, comprises chiefly three buildings: the Michigan (112 S. Michigan Ave.), the Sharp (37 S. Wabash Ave.), and the Columbus (280 S. Columbus Dr.). SAIC also owns additional buildings throughout Chicago that are used as student galleries or investments.\n\nThe institute has its roots in the 1866 founding of the Chicago Academy of Design, which local artists established in rented rooms on Clark Street. It was financed by member dues and patron donations. Four years later, the school moved into its own Adams Street building, which was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.\n\nBecause of the school's financial and managerial problems after this loss, business leaders in 1878 formed a board of trustees and founded the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. They expanded its mission beyond education and exhibitions to include collecting. In 1882, the academy was renamed the Art Institute of Chicago. The banker Charles L. Hutchinson served as its elected president until his death in 1924.\n\nChancellor Walter E. Massey served as president from 2010–July 2016. The current president is Elissa Tenny, formerly the school's provost.\n\nSAIC offers classes in art and technology; arts administration; art history, theory, and criticism; art education and art therapy; ceramics; fashion design; filmmaking; historic preservation; architecture; interior architecture; designed objects; journalism; painting and drawing; performance; photography; printmaking; sculpture; sound; new media; video; visual communication; visual and critical studies; animation; illustration; fiber; and writing. SAIC also serves as a resource for issues related to the position and importance of the arts in society.\n\nSAIC also offers an interdisciplinary Low-Residency MFA for students wishing to study the fine arts and/or writing.\n\nAs of fall 2016, the student enrollment at SAIC is demographically classified as follows:\n\nTotal Enrollment: 3,569\n\nUndergraduate students: 2,848\n\nGraduate students: 721\n\nSex:\n\nFemale: 72.3%\n\nMale: 27.7%\n\nInternational and ethnic origin:\n\nInternational students: 32% (countries represented: 59)\n\nUnited States students: 68%, further subdivided as follows:\n\nWhite: 35.6%\n\nHispanic: 10.6%\n\nAsian or Pacific Islander: 10.4%\n\nAfrican American: 3.6%\n\nAmerican Indian: 0.3%\n\nMultiethnic: 2.8%\n\nNot Specified: 5.2%\n\nGeographic distribution of United States students:\n\nMidwest: 47% (includes 10.6% from Chicago)\n\nNortheast: 20%\n\nWest: 18%\n\nSouth: 16%\n\nFounded in 1868, the Visiting Artists Program (VAP) is one of the oldest public programs of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Formalized in 1951 by Flora Mayer Witkowsky's endowment of a supporting fund, the Visiting Artists Program hosts public presentations by artists, designers, and scholars each year in lectures, symposia, performances, and screenings. It is an eclectic program that showcases artists' working in all media, including sound, video, performance, poetry, painting, and independent film; in addition to significant curators, critics, and art historians.\n\nRecent visiting artists have included Catherine Opie, Andi Zeisler, Aaron Koblin, Jean Shin, Sam Lipsyte, Ben Marcus, Marilyn Minter, Pearl Fryar, Tehching Hsieh, Homi K. Bhabha, Bill Fontana, Wolfgang Laib, Suzanne Lee, and Amar Kanwar among others.\n\nAdditionally, the Distinguished Alumni Series brings alumni back to the community to present their work and reflect on how their experiences at SAIC have shaped them. Recent alumni speakers include Tania Bruguera, Jenni Sorkin, Kori Newkirk, Maria Martinez-Cañas, Saya Woolfalk, Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba, and Sanford Biggers to name a few.\n\n\nExTV is a student-run time-arts platform that broadcasts online and on campus. Its broadcasts are available via monitors located throughout the 112 S. Michigan building, the 37 S Wabash building, and the 280 S. Columbus building. It is available on campus and off campus at extvsaic.org and on cantv.\n\n\"F Newsmagazine\" is a student-run newspaper with both paid and volunteer positions. The magazine is a monthly publication with a run of 12,000 copies. Copies are distributed throughout the city, mainly at locations frequented by students such as popular diners and movie theaters.\n\nFree Radio SAIC is the student-run Internet radio station of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Free Radio uses an open programming format and encourage its DJs to explore and experiment with the medium of live radio. Program content and style vary but generally include music from all genres, sound art, narratives, live performances, current events and interviews. \n\nFeatured bands and guests on Free Radio SAIC include Nü Sensae, The Black Belles, Thomas Comerford, Kevin Michael Richardson, Jeff Bennett, Carolyn Lawrence, and much more.\n\nThe student government of SAIC is unique in that its constitution resembles a socialist republic, in which four officers hold equal power and responsibility. Elections are held every year. There are no campaign requirements. Any group of four students may run for office, but there must always be four students.\n\nThe student government is responsible for hosting a school-wide student meeting once a month. At these meetings students discuss school concerns of any nature. The predominant topic is funding for the various student organizations. Organizations which desire funding must present a proposal at the meeting by which the students vote whether they should receive monies or not. The student government cannot participate in the vote: only oversee it.\n\nThe student government is also responsible for the distribution of the Peanut Butter & Jelly Fund, Welcome Back to School Party, Monthly Morning Coffees, Open Forums, Barbecues in the Pit (the outdoor area at the entrance of the 280 S Columbus Building), Holiday Art Sale, and a Materials Event. In the past Student Government has accomplished such things as campus-wide recycling, and access to the Chicago Transit Authority's U-Pass.\n\nIn a survey conducted by the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, SAIC was named the “most influential art school” by art critics at general interest news publications from across the United States.\n\nIn 2017, US News ranked SAIC the fourth best overall graduate program for fine arts in the U.S. tying with the Rhode Island school of Design. In January 2013, The Global Language Monitor ranked SAIC as the #5 college in the U.S., the highest ever for an art or design school in a general college ranking.\n\nOn May 11, 1988, a student painting depicting Harold Washington, the first black mayor of Chicago, was torn down by some of the city's African-American aldermen — over the protests of many who attempted to block them — based on its content. The painting, titled \"Mirth & Girth\" by David Nelson, was of Washington clad only in women's underwear holding a pencil. Washington died on November 25, 1987.\n\nThe painting was returned after a day, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. The ACLU claimed the removal violated Nelson's First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendment rights. Nelson ended up receiving a monetary settlement for damage to the painting which occurred during its confiscation.\n\nIn February 1989, a student named \"Dread\" Scott Tyler draped the Flag of the United States across the floor for a piece titled \"What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?\" The piece consisted of a podium with a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit. However, the podium was set upon a flag laid on the floor. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag. Viewers were occasionally arrested at the request of veterans. The school stood by the student's art in the face of protests and threats. That year, the school's federal funding was cut from $70,000 to $1 and many benefactors pulled donations.\n\nIn 2017, a controversy arose over the resignation of Michael Bonesteel, an adjunct professor specializing in outsider art and comics after two Title IX complaints were filed. Bonesteel described the SAIC investigation as a \"Kafkaesque trial\" in which he was never shown copies of the complaints and in which he was guilty until proven innocent and that SAIC \"feels more like a police state than a place where academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas is valued\". Laura Kipnis, author of on Title IX cases, described SAIC as displaying \"jawdropping cowardice\" and said \"The idea that students are trying to censor or curb a professor’s opinions or thinking is appalling\". The School said the claims made against it were \"problematic\" and \"misleading\" and said it supports academic freedom.\n\nThis is a list of property in order of acquisition:\n\nSAIC also owns these properties outside of the immediate vicinity of the Chicago Loop:\n\nSAIC leases:\n\n\n"}

As this symbol was used in Merovingian documents at the starting point of what would diversify into the tradition of \"cross-signatures\", German scholarship of the 18th century extended use of the term \"Chrismon\" to the entire field. In medievalist paleography and \"Diplomatik\" (\"ars diplomaticae\", i.e. the study of documents or charters), the study of these signatures or sigils was known as \"Chrismologia\" or \"Chrismenlehre\", while the study of cross variants was known as \"Staurologia\".\n\n\"Chrismon\" in this context may refer to the Merovingian period abbreviation \"I. C. N.\" for \"in Christi nomine\", later (in the Carolingian period) also \"I. C.\" for \"in Christo\", and still later (in the high medieval period) just \"C.\" for \"Christus\".\n\nA cross symbol was often drawn as an invocation at the beginning of documents in the early medieval West. \nAt the end of documents, commissioners or witnesses would sign with a \"signum manus\", often also in the form of a simple cross. This practice is widespread in Merovingian documents of the 7th and 8th centuries. A related development is the widespread use of the cross symbol on the obverse side of early medieval coins, interpreted as the \"signum manus\" of the moneyer.\nThe tradition of minting coins with the monogram of the ruling monarch on the obverse side originates in the 5th century, both in Byzantium and in Rome. This tradition was continued in the 6th century by Germanic kings, including the Merovingians. These early designs were \"box\" monograms. The first \"cruciform\" monogram was used by Justinian I in the 560s. Tiberius III used a cruciform monogram with the letters \"R, M\" for Rome and \"T, B\" for Tiberius; Pope Gregory III used the letters \"G, R, E, O\". \n\nThe earliest surviving Merovingian royal charters, dating to the 7th century, have the box monograms of Chlothar II and Clovis II. Later in the 7th century, the use of royal monograms was abandoned entirely by the Merovingian kings; instead, royal wax seals were first attached to the documents, and the kings would sign their name in full.\n\nThe \"signum manus\" in the form of a modified cross symbol first appears in charters of both Frankish Gaul and Anglo-Saxon England in the late 7th and early 8th century. Charlemagne first used his cruciform monogram, likely inspired by the earlier papal monograms, in 769, and he would continue to use it for the rest of his reign. The monogram spells \"KAROLVS\", with the \nconsonants \"K, R, L, S\" at the ends of the cross-arms, and the vowels \"A, O, V\" displayed in ligature at the center. \nLouis the Pious abandoned the cross monogram, using again a H-type or box monogram.\n\n\n"}

Effort estimates may be used as input to project plans, iteration plans, budgets, investment analyses, pricing processes and bidding rounds.\n\nPublished surveys on estimation practice suggest that expert estimation is the dominant strategy when estimating software development effort.\n\nTypically, effort estimates are over-optimistic and there is a strong over-confidence in their accuracy. The mean effort overrun seems to be about 30% and not decreasing over time. For a review of effort estimation error surveys, see. However, the measurement of estimation error is problematic, see Assessing the accuracy of estimates.\nThe strong overconfidence in the accuracy of the effort estimates is illustrated by the finding that, on average, if a software professional is 90% confident or “almost sure” to include the actual effort in a minimum-maximum interval, the observed frequency of including the actual effort is only 60-70%.\n\nCurrently the term “effort estimate” is used to denote as different concepts such as most likely use of effort (modal value), the effort that corresponds to a probability of 50% of not exceeding (median), the planned effort, the budgeted effort or the effort used to propose a bid or price to the client. This is believed to be unfortunate, because communication problems may occur and because the concepts serve different goals.\n\nSoftware researchers and practitioners have been addressing the problems of effort estimation for software development projects since at least the 1960s; see, e.g., work by Farr and Nelson.\n\nMost of the research has focused on the construction of formal software effort estimation models. The early models were typically based on regression analysis or mathematically derived from theories from other domains. Since then a high number of model building approaches have been evaluated, such as approaches founded on case-based reasoning, classification and regression trees, simulation, neural networks, Bayesian statistics, lexical analysis of requirement specifications, genetic programming, linear programming, economic production models, soft computing, fuzzy logic modeling, statistical bootstrapping, and combinations of two or more of these models. The perhaps most common estimation methods today are the parametric estimation models COCOMO, SEER-SEM and SLIM. They have their basis in estimation research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s and are since then updated with new calibration data, with the last major release being COCOMO II in the year 2000. The estimation approaches based on functionality-based size measures, e.g., function points, is also based on research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, but are re-calibrated with modified size measures and different counting approaches, such as the use case points or object points in the 1990s and COSMIC in the 2000s.\n\nThere are many ways of categorizing estimation approaches, see for example. The top level categories are the following:\n\n\nBelow are examples of estimation approaches within each category.\n\nThe evidence on differences in estimation accuracy of different estimation approaches and models suggest that there is no “best approach” and that the relative accuracy of one approach or model in comparison to another depends strongly on the context\n. This implies that different organizations benefit from different estimation approaches. Findings (summarized in,) that may support the selection of estimation approach based on the expected accuracy of an approach include:\n\n\nThe most robust finding, in many forecasting domains, is that combination of estimates from independent sources, preferable applying different approaches, will on average improve the estimation accuracy.\n\nIt is important to be aware of the limitations of each traditional approach to measuring software development productivity.\n\nIn addition, other factors such as ease of understanding and communicating the results of an approach, ease of use of an approach, and cost of introduction of an approach should be considered in a selection process.\n\nThe most common measure of the average estimation accuracy is the MMRE (Mean Magnitude of Relative Error), where the MRE of each estimate is defined as:\n\n\"MRE\" = formula_1\n\nThis measure has been criticized \n\n, Weighted Mean of Quartiles of relative errors (WMQ)\n\nMRE is not reliable if the individual items are skewed. PRED(25) is preferred as a measure of estimation accuracy. PRED(25) measures the percentage of predicted values that are within 25 percent of the actual value.\n\nA high estimation error cannot automatically be interpreted as an indicator of low estimation ability. Alternative, competing or complementing, reasons include low cost control of project, high complexity of development work, and more delivered functionality than originally estimated. A framework for improved use and interpretation of estimation error measurement is included in.\n\nThere are many psychological factors potentially explaining the strong tendency towards over-optimistic effort estimates that need to be dealt with to increase accuracy of effort estimates. These factors are essential even when using formal estimation models, because much of the input to these models is judgment-based. Factors that have been demonstrated to be important are: Wishful thinking, anchoring, planning fallacy and cognitive dissonance. A discussion on these and other factors can be found in work by Jørgensen and Grimstad.\n\nThe chronic underestimation of development effort has led to the coinage and popularity of numerous humorous adages, such as ironically referring to a task as a \"small matter of programming\" (when much effort is likely required), and citing laws about underestimation:\n\n Adding to the fact that estimating development efforts is hard, it's worth stating that assigning more resources doesn't always help.\n\n"}

The museum is part of the wider network of Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales.\n\nIt consists of more than forty re-erected buildings from various locations in Wales, and is set in the grounds of St Fagans Castle, a Grade I listed Elizabethan manor house. In 2011 \"Which?\" magazine named the museum the United Kingdom's favourite visitor attraction.\n\nA six-year, £30 million revamp was completed in 2018.\n\nThe museum was started in 1946 following the donation of the castle and lands by the Earl of Plymouth. It opened its doors to the public in 1948, under the name of the Welsh Folk Museum. The museum's name in Welsh (also meaning \"Welsh Folk Museum\") has remained unchanged since that date, whereas the English title was modified to Museum of Welsh Life, thereafter St Fagans National History Museum, and again to its current nomenclature.\n\nThe brainchild of Iorwerth Peate, the museum was modelled on Skansen, the outdoor museum of vernacular Swedish architecture in Stockholm. Most structures re-erected in Skansen were built of wood and are thus easily taken apart and reassembled, but a comparable museum in Wales was going to be more ambitious, as much of the vernacular architecture of Wales is made of masonry.\n\nA redeveloped main reception building was opened in July 2017.. The six-year £30m redevelopment of the site, which was funded by a number of sources, notably the Welsh Government and the National Lottery, was completed in October 2018.\n\nThe museum includes more than forty buildings which represent the architecture of Wales, including a nonconformist chapel (in this case, Unitarian), a village schoolhouse, a Toll road tollbooth (below), a cockpit (below), a pigsty (below), and a tannery (below).\n\nThe museum holds displays of traditional crafts with a working blacksmith forge, a pottery, a weaver, miller, and clog maker. It also includes two working water mills: one flour mill and one wool mill. Part of the site includes a small working farm which concentrates on preserving local Welsh native breeds of livestock. Produce from the museum's bakery and flour mill is available for sale.\n\nThe medieval parish church of Saint Teilo, formerly at Llandeilo Tal-y-bont in west Glamorgan (restored to its pre-Reformation state), was opened in October 2007 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and still serves as a place of worship for Christmas, Easter, and Harvest Thanksgiving. A Tudor merchant's house from Haverfordwest, opened in 2012, is the latest building to be added to the museum's collection. Future plans include the relocation of the historic Vulcan public house from Newtown in Cardiff.\n\nAlthough the museum was intended to preserve aspects of Welsh rural life, it now includes several buildings that depict the industrial working life that succeeded it, that being almost extinct in Wales. There is a row of workers' cottages, depicting furnishing from 1800 to 1985, from Rhyd-y-car near Merthyr Tydfil (below), as well as the pristine Oakdale Workmen's Institute (below). Even a post-war prefabricated bungalow (below) has been erected on the grounds.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2012, the museum hosted the Everyman Summer Theatre Festival when it re-located from Dyffryn Gardens. This festival, which includes a Shakespeare play, a Musical, and a Children's Show has become part of Welsh theatrical calendar since its founding at Dyffryn in 1983.\n\nScenes from the \"Doctor Who\" episodes \"Human Nature\" and \"The Family of Blood\" were filmed at the museum.\n\nBased on archaeological findings, a reconstruction of Llys Rhosyr, a thirteenth-century court of the princes of Gwynedd, was completed and opened to the public in October 2018. Called \"Llys Llewelyn\" ('Llewelyn's Court'), it was hoped school children would be able to stay in the buildings overnight, from Spring 2019.\n\nThe \"Gweithdy\" ('Workshop') also opened in October 2018. It is a sustainable building housing improved facilities for visitors, supporting the study of collections and hosting demonstrations and workshops by traditional craftsmen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "338686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338686", "title": "The Children's Encyclopædia", "text": "The Children's Encyclopædia\n\nThe Children's Encyclopædia was an encyclopædia originated by Arthur Mee, and published by the Educational Book Company, a subsidiary of Amalgamated Press of London. It was published from 1908 to 1964. Walter M. Jackson's company Grolier acquired the rights to publish it in the U.S. under the name \"The Book of Knowledge\" (1910).\n\nThe encyclopædia was originally published in fortnightly parts between March 1908 and February 1910. Some readers could have bound their collections, but the first eight-volume sets were published in 1910. Each section contained a variety of articles, developing topics as it progressed. The work could be used as a conventional reference library, as the last volume had an alphabetical index, or each section could be read from start to finish. It was originally organised into sections but there were changes in subsequent editions. Some titles covered scientific subjects such as geology, biology and astronomy but such scientific terms were generally avoided.\n\n\nMee wrote an introduction called a \"Greeting\" and a \"farewell\". He took a strong interest in the \"Book of Wonder\", in which the Wise Man answered questions posed by children.\n\nThe illustrations were mostly anonymous but some illustrators included Susan Beatrice Pearse, C. E. Brock, Thomas Maybank, George F. Morrell, Dudley Heath, Charles Folkard, H. R. Millar, Alexander Francis Lydon, Arthur A. Dixon and Arthur Rackham. The books used photographs by Frank Hinkins, engravings, maps and graphics.\n\nThe encyclopædia broke ground in the approach to education, aiming to make learning interesting and enjoyable. Its articles were clearly written and intended to develop character and sense of duty.\n\nThe articles expressed pride for Great Britain and its empire. Christianity was held to be the only true religion. Europeans were clearly the most advanced and there were hints of the eugenic ideas of Caleb Saleeby. This was presented in a moderate and liberal way in many areas: other \"races\", although inferior according to the text, were to be treated with respect, and imperialism was justified only if it improved the lot of its subjects. At a time when the relation between science and religion was controversial, the encyclopædia supported evolution, but it did not admit any contradiction between religious teachings and Darwin's views.\n\nIt was sold door-to-door. It was used by schools and for teacher training. It gives insight into the social values of the society that created it. As the initial run ended, it was reissued as the monthly New Children's Encyclopædia. The title changed, becoming Children's Encyclopædia Magazine, Children's Magazine and, finally, \"My Magazine\" in 1914. From September 1910, the magazine included a supplement of news entitled \"The Little Paper\", the forerunner of Arthur Mee's \"Children's Newspaper\", launched in 1919.\n\n\"The Children's Encyclopædia\" sold 800,000 copies in 12 editions before being extensively revised in the early 1920s. The new 59-part, 7,412-page, 10-volume series debuted in October 1922 as \"The Children's Encyclopedia\", the digraph having been dropped, and went through 14 editions by 1946 under the imprint of The Educational Book Co. Translations appeared in France, Italy, Spain, Brazil and China.\n\nNew editions of the encyclopedia continued after Mee's death in 1943; the final, much revised, edition, still entitled \"Arthur Mee's Children's Encyclopedia\", appeared in 1964.\n\nWhile the encyclopedia itself did not carry any copyright or publishing dates, clues are present in the title used and the colour and design on the cover as to the approximate age of a complete collection. The initial release of \"The Children's Encyclopædia\" featured the spelling \"Encyclopædia\" and was initially an 8 volume collection, bound in brown. All other revisions used the spelling \"Encyclopedia\" and were a 10 volume collection. 1920 versions have blue binding. By the 1940s the binding is brown in colour, and displays a flaming torch on each book's spine. By the 1950s, the binding is red. There is also at least one green bound version that dates from the 1920s. One edition with a red binding and art deco patterning on the spine dates to the mid 1930s.\n\nIn May 1973 riots occurred in Jammu and Kashmir, India, in an area where the Jamaat-e-Islami was gaining influence, sparked by the discovery that an illustration contained in \"The Book of Knowledge\", which had been stored in a local library for decades, portrayed the Archangel Gabriel dictating portions of the Quran to Muhammad. Muslims offended by a visual depiction of Muhammad caused riots which left four dead and over a hundred wounded. The sale of the encyclopedia was then banned, although it was already out of print by that time.\n\n"}

The film is set in a new museum on Sesame Street, the Museum of Cookie Art and features the Cookie Monster, who has to deal with suspicion that he is eating all of the museum's exhibits. Starring Rachel Dratch.\n\nThis was one of Fran Brill's final works before she retired from puppeteer work. As of 2016, and the following season, Stephanie D'Abruzzo will be Prairie Dawn and Jennifer Barnhart will be Zoe.\n\nA new museum, the Museum of Cookie Art, has opened on Sesame Street and Cookie Monster has decided to attend with his friends Chris and Elmo where Prairie Dawn is working there as a tour guide. Upon seeing the art, which parodies art masterpieces such as da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\", Cookie Monster wants to eat everything he sees, prompting Chris to remind him that he can only look at it and not eat it. Even a female security guard (Rachel Dratch) tends to catch him almost committing the acts. However, when the cookie paintings start disappearing, the female security guard and the Penguin security guards believe that Cookie Monster is the thief. Elmo decides to take on the role of detective to figure out who stole them. He finds a trail of cookie crumbs and chocolate chips, which he correctly guesses proves the thief to be an anthropomorphic chocolate chip cookie. The trio tries to tell the guards, who do not believe them and throw them out of the museum.\n\nOnce outside, they manage to contact Abby Cadabby who magically transforms them into a painting. She then takes the painting to museum, where it is displayed and then stolen by the Cookie Thief. They then change back to their normal forms and, along with the museum's guards who now believe in Cookie Monster's innocence, chase the thief.\n\nUpon capture the Cookie Thief confesses to his crimes, which he explains he only did because of his love for cookie art. Cookie explains that while he understands his motivations, that if he stole the paintings then no one else could enjoy the artwork. He then tells the Cookie Thief that he can create his own cookie art and have it displayed in the museum, which the thief does.\n\n\n\nThe A.V.

{"id": "7520928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7520928", "title": "Touch piece", "text": "Touch piece\n\nA touch piece is a coin or medal believed to cure disease, bring good luck, influence people's behaviour, carry out a specific practical action, etc.\n\nWhat most touch pieces have in common is that they have to be touched or in close physical contact for the power concerned to be obtained and/or transferred. Once this is achieved, the power is permanently present in the coin, which effectively becomes an amulet.\n\nCoins which had been given at Holy Communion could be rubbed on parts of the body suffering from rheumatism and it was thought that they would effect a cure. Medallions or medalets showing the \"Devil defeated\" were specially minted in Britain and distributed amongst the poor in the belief that they would reduce disease and sickness. The tradition of touch pieces goes back to the time of Ancient Rome, when the Emperor Vespasian (69–79 AD) gave coins to the sick at a ceremony known as \"the touching\".\n\nMany touch piece coins were treasured by the recipients and sometimes remained in the possession of families for many generations, such as with the \"Lee Penny\" obtained by Sir Simon Lockhart from the Holy Land whilst on a crusade. This coin, an Edward I groat, still held by the family, has a triangular-shaped stone of a dark red colour set into it. The coin is kept in a gold box given by Queen Victoria to General Lockhart. It can supposedly cure rabies, haemorrhage, and various animal ailments. The coin was exempted from the Church of Scotland's prohibition on charms and was lent to the citizens of Newcastle during the reign of King Charles I to protect them from the plague. A sum of between £1,000 and £6,000 was pledged for its return.\n\nThe legend of the Lee Penny gave rise to Sir Walter Scott's novel \"The Talisman\". The amulet was placed in water, which was then drunk to provide the cure. No money was ever taken for its use. In 1629 Isobel Young, burned as a witch later that same year, sought to borrow the stone to cure cattle. The family of Lockart of Lee would not lend the stone in its silver setting; however, they gave flagons of water in which the coin had been steeped.\n\nPersons of royal blood were thought to have the \"God-given\" power of healing this condition by touch, and sovereigns of England and France practised this power to cure sufferers of scrofula, meaning \"Swine Evil\", as it was common in pigs, a form of tuberculosis of the bones and lymph nodes, commonly known as the \"King's or Queen's Evil\" or \"Morbus Regius\". In France it was called the \"Mal De Roi\". William the Lion, King of Scotland is recorded in 1206 as curing a case of scrofula by his touching and blessing a child who had the ailment. Charles I touched around 100 people shortly after his coronation at Holyrood in 1633. Rarely fatal, the disease was naturally given to spontaneously cure itself after lengthy periods of remission. Many miraculous cures were recorded, and failures were put down to a lack of faith in the sufferer. The original \"Book of Common Prayer\" of the Anglican Church contained this ceremony. The divine power of kings was believed to be descended from Edward the Confessor, who, according to some legends, received it from Saint Remigius.\n\nThe custom lasted from the time of Edward the Confessor until Anne's reign, although her predecessor, William III refused to believe in the tradition and did not practice the ceremony. James II and James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, performed the ceremony. Charles Edward Stuart, the \"Young Pretender\", is known to have carried out the rite in 1745 at Glamis Castle during the time of his rebellion against George II and also in France after his exile. Finally, Henry Benedict Stuart, the brother of Charles, performed the ceremony until his death in 1807. All the Jacobite Stuarts produced special touch-piece medalets, with a variety of designs and inscriptions. They are found in gold, silver and even lead.\n\nRobert II of France was the first to practise the ritual in the 11th century. Henry IV of France is reported as often touching and healing as many as 1,500 individuals at a time. No record survives of the first four Norman kings' attempting to cure by touching; however, there are records of Henry II of England doing so. Mary I of England performed the ceremony and her half-sister, Elizabeth I, cured all \"ranks and degrees\". William Tooker published a book on the subject, titled \"Charisma; sive Donum Sanationis\".\nQueen Anne, amongst many others, touched the 2-year-old infant Dr. Samuel Johnson in 1712 to no effect, for although he eventually recovered, he was left badly scarred and blind in one eye. He wore the medal around his neck all of his life and it is now preserved in the British Museum. It was believed that if the touch piece was not worn then the condition would return. Queen Anne last performed the ceremony on 14 April 1714. George I put an end to the practice as being \"too Catholic\", but the kings of France continued the custom until 1825. William of Malmesbury describes the ceremony in his \"Chronicle of the Kings of England\" (1120) and Shakespeare describes the practice in \"Macbeth\".\n\nThe gold Angel coins, which were first struck in Britain in 1465 and later dates, particularly of the reigns of James I and Charles I, are often found officially pierced in the centre, as illustrated in \"Coins of England 2001\" to be used as touch pieces. The sovereigns of the House of Stuart used the ceremony to help bolster the belief in the \"Divine Right of Kings\". Charles I indeed issued Angels almost exclusively as touch pieces to the point where intact specimens are hard to come by. He was the first monarch to perform the ceremony in Scotland at Holyrood Palace on 18 June 1633. The size of the hole may indicate the amount of gold taken in payment by the jeweller or the mint for the work of piercing or punching and the provision of a ribbon or silk string.\nThe cure was usually more of a \"laying on of hands\" by the monarch and the Angel coin or medalet, etc., although touched by the monarch, was seen as a receipt or talisman of the potential of the monarch's healing power. Originally the king had paid for the support of the sufferer until he had recovered or died. The move to the gift of a gold coin touch piece may represent the compromise payment when the custom of \"room and board\" support by the king ceased. Coffee in the 18th and early 19th centuries was thought to be a relief, but not a cure for scrofula.\n\nThe Angel coin was favoured at these ceremonies because it has on the obverse an image of St. Michael slaying the Devil represented as a dragon (actually a heraldic Wyvern). St. Michael, especially venerated for his role as captain of the heavenly host that drove Satan out of Heaven, was also associated with the casting out of devils and thus was regarded as a guardian of the sick.\n\nThe monarch him/herself hung these touch piece amulets around the necks of sufferers. In later years Charles II only touched the medalet as he unsurprisingly disliked touching diseased people directly. He \"touched\" 92,107 people in the 21 years from 1661 to 1682, performing the function 8,500 times in 1682 alone.\n\nAfter these coins ceased to be minted in 1634, Charles II had holed gold medalets specially produced by the mint with a similar design of good defeating evil. An example of a medalet in the British Museum has a hand descending from a cloud towards four heads, with \"He touched them\" around the margin, and on the other side a rose and thistle, with \"And they were healed.\"\n\nSamuel Pepys recorded in his diary for 13 April 1661: \"To Whitehall to the Banquet House and there saw the King heale, the first time that ever I saw him do it — which he did with great gravity; and it seemed to me to be an ugly office and a simple one.\" John Evelyn also refers to the ceremony in his \"Diary\" on the dates of 6 July 1660 and 28 March 1684.\n\nJohn Wain in his biography of Dr. Samuel Johnson writes that Johnson was taken by his mother as a small child to London, where after standing in a long line with many others, he was in turn subject to this ritual from Queen Anne.\n\nUnsurprisingly the system was open to abuse and numerous attempts were made to ensure that only the deserving cases got the gold coin, because others would simply sell it.\n\nIn many countries it was believed that coins with holes in them would bring good luck. This belief could link to a similar superstition linked to stones or pebbles which had holes, often called \"Adder Stones\" and hung around the neck. Carrying a coin bearing the date of your birth is lucky. In Austria any coin found during a rainstorm is especially lucky, because it is said to have dropped from Heaven. European charms often require silver coins to be used, which are engraved with marks such as an \"X\" or are bent. These actions personalize the coin, making it uniquely special for the owner. The lucky \"sixpence\" is a well-known example in Great Britain.\n\nHoly Sacrament communion coins were thought to acquire curative powers over various ailments, especially rheumatism and epilepsy. Such otherwise normal coins, which had been offered at communion, were purchased from the priest for 12 or 13 pennies. The coin was then punched through and worn around the neck of the sick person, or made into a ring.\n\nGonzalez-Wippler records that if money is left with a mandrake root it will double in quantity overnight. She also stated that the way to ensure the future wealth of a baby is to put part of the child's umbilical cord in a bag together with a few coins. Lucky coins are lucky charms which are carried around attract wealth and good luck, whilst many, often silver coins, attached to bracelets multiply the effect as well as create a noise which scares away evil spirits. Bathing with a penny wrapped in a washcloth brings good fortune at Beltane or the Winter Solstice in Celtic Mythology. Chinese \"Money Frogs\" or \"Money Toads\", often with a coin in their mouths, bring food, luck and prosperity.\nA Celtic belief is that at the full moon any silver coins on one's person should be jingled or turned over to prevent bad luck, also the silver coins would increase as the moon grew in size. A wish to a new moon could also be made, but not as seen through glass, jingling coins at the same time. American silver \"Mercury\" dimes, especially with a leap year date, are especially lucky. Gamblers' charms are often these dimes, Mercury being the Roman god who ruled the crossroads, games of chance, etc. Although these dimes actually figure the head of Liberty, people commonly mistake it for Mercury. A silver dime worn at the throat will supposedly turn black if someone tries to poison your food or drink. American \"Indian Head\" cents are worn as amulets to ward off evil or negative spirits. In Spain a bride places a silver coin from her father in one shoe and a gold coin from her mother in the other. This will ensure that she will never want for anything. Silver coins were placed in Christmas puddings and birthday cakes to bring good luck and wealth. A variation on this custom was that in some families each member added a coin to the pudding bowl, making a wish as they did so. If their coin turned up in their bowl it's said their wish was sure to come true. In Greece, a coin is added to vasilopita, a bread baked in honor of the feast day of St. Basil the Great. At midnight the sign of the cross is etched with a knife across the cake, to bless the house and bring good luck for the new year. A piece is sliced for each member of the family and any visitors present at the time, and the person who gets the slice with the coin will receive good luck, and often a gift.\n\nIn Japan the 5 yen coin is considered lucky because 5 yen in Japanese is \"Go en\" which is a homophone with go-en (御縁), \"en\" being a word for causal connection or relationship, and \"go\" being a respectful prefix. Therefore, they are often used at shrines as well as the first money put into a new wallet.\n\nIn ancient Rome \"good luck\" coins were in common circulation. \"Votive pieces\" for example were struck by new emperors, promising peace for a set number of years. Citizens would hold such coins in their hand when making a wish or petitioning the gods.\n\nCoins bearing religious symbols are often seen as lucky; for instance, the Mogul emperor Akbar's rupees carry words from the Islamic faith, and in India the \"Ramatanka\" shows the Hindu god Rama, his wife, Sita, his brother and the monkey god, Hanuman. Gold ducats issued in the name of the mid-18th century Doge Loredano of Venice bore an image of Christ and were issued to be worn as pendants by pilgrims. The Shinto religion has a shrine called Zeniariai-Benten where followers wash their money in the spring water at certain times of year to ensure that it doubles in quantity. In Roman times, sailors placed coins under the masts of their ships to ensure the protection of the gods from the wrath of the sea.\n\nA rare example of a \"Wish Tree\" exists near Ardmaddy House in Argyll, Scotland. The tree is a hawthorn, a species traditionally linked with fertility, as in \"May Blossom.\" The trunk and branches are covered with hundreds of coins which have been driven through the bark and into the wood. The local tradition is that a wish will be granted for each of the coins so treated. Many pubs, such as the \"Punch Bowl\" in Askham, near Penrith in Cumbria have old beams with splits in them where coins are forced \"for luck.\"\n\nAnother local custom at Askham is the throwing of coins from the nearby bridge onto a boulder that lies below the water level of the river. Getting the coin to stay on the rock gives the thrower \"good luck.\" Obvious connections exist with water generally and the practice of throwing in coins to seek favours of the water spirits. The Lady's Well in Kilmaurs, Scotland, is a typical wishing well. At St. Cuby's Well (SX224 564) in Cornwall the legend was that if anyone did not leave an offering of money then they would be followed home by Piskies in the shape of flying moths, embodying the spirits of the dead. At Loch na Gaire in Sutherland, Scotland, it was the tradition to throw coins into the waters to ensure that the waters kept their healing properties.\n\nA \"Black Saxpence\" in Scots, is a sixpence, supposed by the credulous to be received from the devil, as a pledge of an engagement to be his, soul and body. It is always of a black colour, as not being legal currency; but it is said to possess this singular virtue, that the person who keeps it constantly in his pocket, \"how much soever he spend, will always find another sixpence beside it\".\n\nA Devonian superstition is that carrying crooked coins is good luck and keeps the devil away.\n\nIn Ireland it is thought to be bad luck to give money away on a Monday.\n\nThe 1932 silver yuan coin from China showed a junk, rays of sunshine and a flock of birds. These were seen as symbolising Japan (the rising sun symbol) and its fighter planes (the birds) invading China. The coin was re-issued in 1933 without the sun or the birds.\n\nThe Queen Victoria \"Godless\" florin (which omitted all the Queen's titles, including the customary Dei Gratia, \"by the grace of god\") was regarded as bringing bad luck.\n\nFinding money was bad luck in some cultures and the curse could only be removed by giving away the money.\n\nIt is bad luck to have an empty pocket, for even a crooked coin keeps the devil away.\n\nThe bent coin as a love token may be derived from the well-recorded practice of bending a coin when making a vow to a saint, such as vowing to give it to the saint's shrine if the saint would intercede to cure a sick human, animal, etc. Bending a coin when one person made a vow to another was another practice which arose from this.\n\nIt was believed that the gift of second sight came from the devil; as protection, a silver coin was used to make a cross above the palm of a Gypsy fortune-teller, thus dispelling any evil. In Japan, Korea and Indonesia, coins were made tied together to form sword shapes which were thought to terrify, and therefore ward off, evil spirits. They were also hung above the beds of sick people to drive off the malevolent spirits who were responsible for the illness.\n\nIn 2007 a lead \"coin based\" curse on a Roman emperor was found by a metal detectorist in Lincolnshire. The 1,650-year-old curse was an act of treason, blasphemy and criminal defacement of the imperial coinage. The perpetrator had cursed the emperor Valens by hammering a coin with his image into lead, then folding the lead over his face. Thousands of ordinary lead cursing charms exist with written inscriptions and a small hole for suspending them.\n\nCoins placed on the eyes of the dead, if briefly dropped into the drink of a husband or wife, would \"blind\" them to any infidelities that the partner might be involved in.\n\nAlso, some groups say that if a penny is thrown into a person's drink, they must \"down\" the rest of it.\n\nIn Germany, since Medieval times, it was believed that a silver coin with a Sator square engraved on it will put out a fire if thrown into the conflagration. Coins were placed on the eyes of a corpse to prevent them from opening and also in Greek mythology as payment for the ferryman who would carry the dead person across the River Styx into Hades. In the 17th century coins bearing an engraving of St. George were carried by soldiers as a protection against injury following a lucky escape when a bullet hit such a coin and the soldier remained uninjured (Coins of the World). Some of the gold coins of Edward III carry the cryptic legend: IHS MEDIVM ILLORVM IBAT (\"But Jesus passing through the midst of them, went his way\" – St'Luke IV. 30). According to Sir John Mandeville, this was a spell against the power of thieves.\n\n\n"}

The Tucson Gay Museum collaborates under pre-existing agreements with numerous archives and museums worldwide collecting LGBTQ History, LGBTQ Memories and LGBTQ Collections.\n\nThe Tucson Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer LGBT LGBTQ Museum began on June 6, 1967 as an archiving project when a few local neighborhood school age boys came together to collect historical items, take photographs, make sound recordings in and around their community of LGBTQ events and subjects along with other history. As time when along the group began collecting LGBTQ historical related exhibit items from around Arizona, including Phoenix and others areas of the United States. The Tucson Gay LGBT LGBTQ Queer Museum still remains an all-volunteer effort. Its founding members used their own film loaded cameras and many developed their own film while collecting, photographing, filming, and archiving memorabilia to create historical exhibits for an almost continual 50 year time period.\n\nOver the years since those legendary historical days of the 1960s in the United States, the project gained broader focuses at times including the production of LGBTQ related historical movie documentaries, an LGBTQ related TV Show, sponsoring LGBTQ events, providing educational exhibits at events, working with local LGBTQ organizations, fielding LGBTQ historical documentary crews, and working with national and international LGBTQ historical groups on LGBTQ historical preservation. The Tucson Gay LGBT LGBTQ Queer Museum was the first virtual Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer Museum to open in the World.\n\nThe Tucson LGBTQ ( Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer Memories Project ) maintains various traveling historical exhibits displays which have been exhibited in locations such as Tucson, Phoenix, the University of Arizona, Washington D.C., The National LGBTQ Museum , local groups, and various other venues.
