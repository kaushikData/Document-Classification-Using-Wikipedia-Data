Starring Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder, the film was written by Brooks, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, Norman Steinberg and Al Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, was nominated for three Academy Awards and is ranked No. 6 on the American Film Institute's \"100 Years...100 Laughs\" list.\n\nBrooks appears in three supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane, a Yiddish-speaking Indian chief and “a director” in line to help invade Rock Ridge (a nod to Hitchcock); he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes Slim Pickens, Alex Karras and David Huddleston, as well as Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman. Bandleader Count Basie has a cameo as himself.\n\nThe film satirizes the racism obscured by myth-making Hollywood accounts of the American West, with the hero being a black sheriff in an all-white town. The film is full of deliberate anachronisms, from the Count Basie Orchestra playing \"April in Paris\" in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the \"Wide World of Sports\", to the German army of World War II.\n\nOn the American frontier of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through quicksand. The conniving attorney general Hedley Lamarr wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor William J. Le Petomane appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting a white foreman. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.\n\nAfter an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the \"Waco Kid\", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him; when he visits the railroad work site and discovers their interest in the land, the Waco Kid outshoots Taggart and his thugs; finally, Bart outmaneuvers German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtüpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, Ku Klux Klansmen, Nazis, and Methodists.\n\nThree miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the \"Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway\", forcing the raiding party to turn back for \"a shitload of dimes\" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are boobytrapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.\n\nThe resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs breaks the fourth wall, spilling onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a Busby Berkeley-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the Warner Bros. film lot into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to \"drive me off this picture\". He ducks into Grauman's Chinese Theatre, which is playing the premiere of \"Blazing Saddles\". As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on. Riding out of town, he finds Jim, and invites him along to \"nowhere special\". They ride off into the sunset on horseback, but stop at a chauffeured stretch limousine and continue outward in the vehicle.\n\nCast notes\n\nThe idea for the film came from a story outline written by Andrew Bergman that he originally intended to develop and produce himself. \"I wrote a first draft called \"Tex-X\"\" (a play on Malcolm X's name), he said. \"Alan Arkin was hired to direct and James Earl Jones was going to play the sheriff. That fell apart, as things often do.\" Brooks was taken with the story, which he described as \"hip talk—1974 talk and expressions—happening in 1874 in the Old West\", and purchased the film rights from Bergman. Though he had not worked with a writing team since \"Your Show of Shows\", he hired a group of writers (including Bergman) to expand the outline, and posted a large sign: \"Please do not write a polite script.\" Brooks described the writing process as chaotic: \"\"Blazing Saddles\" was more or less written in the middle of a drunken fistfight. There were five of us all yelling loudly for our ideas to be put into the movie. Not only was I the loudest, but luckily I also had the right as director to decide what was in or out.\" Bergman remembers the room being just as chaotic, telling \"Creative Screenwriting\", \"In the beginning, we had five people. One guy left after a couple of weeks. Then, it was basically me, Mel, Richie Pryor and Norman Steinberg. Richie left after the first draft and then Norman, Mel and I wrote the next three or four drafts. It was a riot. It was a rioter’s room!\"\n\nThe original title, \"Tex X\", was rejected, as were \"Black Bart\" and \"Purple Sage\". Brooks said he finally conceived \"Blazing Saddles\" one morning while taking a shower. For the movie's title song, Brooks advertised in the trade papers for a \"Frankie Laine-type\" singer; to his surprise, Laine himself offered his services. \"Frankie sang his heart out ... and we didn't have the heart to tell him it was a spoof. He never heard the whip cracks; we put those in later. We got so lucky with his serious interpretation of the song.\"\n\nCasting was problematic. Richard Pryor was Brooks' original choice to play the Sheriff Bart, but the studio, claiming his history of drug arrests made him uninsurable, refused to approve financing with Pryor as the star. Cleavon Little was cast in the role, and Pryor remained as a writer. Brooks offered the other leading role, the Waco Kid, to John Wayne; he declined, deeming the film \"too blue\" for his family-oriented image, but assured Brooks that \"he would be the first one in line to see it.\" Gig Young was cast, but he collapsed during his first scene from what was later determined to be alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and Gene Wilder was flown in to replace him. Johnny Carson and Wilder both turned down the Hedley Lamarr role before Harvey Korman was cast. Madeline Kahn objected when Brooks asked to see her legs during her audition. \"She said, 'So it’s THAT kind of an audition? Brooks recalled. \"I explained that I was a happily married man and that I needed someone who could straddle a chair with her legs like Marlene Dietrich in \"Destry Rides Again.\" So she lifted her skirt and said, 'No touching.\n\nBrooks had numerous conflicts over content with Warner Bros. executives, including frequent use of the word \"nigger\", Lili Von Shtupp's seduction scene, the cacophony of flatulence around the campfire, and Mongo punching out a horse. Brooks, whose contract gave him final content control, declined to make any substantive changes, with the exception of cutting Bart's final line during Lili's seduction: \"I hate to disappoint you, ma'am, but you're sucking my arm.\" When asked later about the many \"nigger\" references, Brooks said he received consistent support from Pryor and Little. He added, \"If they did a remake of \"Blazing Saddles\" today [2012], they would leave out the N-word. And then, you've got no movie.\" Brooks said he received many letters of complaint after the film's release, \" ... but of course, most of them were from white people.\"\n\nThe film was almost not released. \"When we screened it for executives, there were few laughs\", said Brooks. \"The head of distribution said, 'Let’s dump it and take a loss.' But [studio president John] Calley insisted they open it in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago as a test. It became the studio's top moneymaker that summer.\" The world premiere took place on February 7, 1974, at the Pickwick Drive-In Theater in Burbank; 250 invited guests—including Little and Wilder—watched the film on horseback. The film's subtitle on the poster, \"\"or never give a saga an even break!\" refers to W.C. Fields' film (and motto) \"Never Give a Sucker an Even Break\".\n\nWhile the film is now considered a classic comedy, critical reaction was mixed when the film was released. Vincent Canby wrote:\nRoger Ebert gave the film four stars and called it a \"crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a rubber chicken. Mostly, it succeeds. It's an audience picture; it doesn't have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?\"\n\nThe film grossed $119.5 million at the box office, becoming only the tenth film up to that time to pass the $100 million mark.\n\nOn the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has 90% positive reviews, saying, \"Daring, provocative, and laugh-out-loud funny, \"Blazing Saddles\" is a gleefully vulgar spoof of Westerns that marks a high point in Mel Brooks' storied career.\" \n\nHedy Lamarr sued Warner Bros., charging that the film's running parody of her name infringed on her right to privacy. Brooks said he was flattered; the studio settled out of court for a small sum and an apology for “almost using her name.\" Brooks said that Lamarr \"never got the joke.\"\n\nWhile addressing his group of bad guys, Harvey Korman's character reminds them that, although they are risking their lives, he is \"risking an almost certain Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor!\" Korman did not receive an Oscar bid, but the film did get three nominations in 1974: Best Supporting Actress (Madeline Kahn, who lost to Ingrid Bergman in \"Murder on the Orient Express\"), Best Film Editing (losing out to \"The Towering Inferno\"), and Best Music, Original Song (the title song, which lost to \"We May Never Love Like This Again\", also from \"The Towering Inferno\"). The film also earned two BAFTA awards nominations, for Best Newcomer (Cleavon Little) and Best Screenplay.\n\nThe film won the Writers Guild of America Award for \"Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen\" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger.\n\nIn 2006, \"Blazing Saddles\" was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\nA television series titled \"Black Bart\" was produced for CBS based on Bergman's original story. It featured Louis Gossett, Jr. as Bart and Steve Landesberg as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named \"Reb Jordan\". Other cast members included Millie Slavin and Noble Willingham. Bergman is listed as the sole creator.\n\nCBS aired the pilot once on April 4, 1975. The pilot episode featured guest appearances by Gerrit Graham and Brooke Adams and was written by Michael Elias and Rich Eustis. Elias and Eutis later created and executive produced the ABC sitcom \"Head of the Class\" (1986-1991).\n\nInterviewed in 1996, Steve Landesberg said \"Black Bart\" \"was like a joke. ... We did the pilot, and CBS dumped it at the end of the 1975 season in April or May on a Friday. We thought it was done, then CBS tells us to come back and film six more episodes. And then another six. Six episodes each season, when an order was usually for 24 or 26. I was on \"Barney Miller\" by that point, and we'd film during the winter break when all other TV shows were on hiatus. And they never aired any of them. It was like a sick joke. If I wasn't under contract I would have walked, but they were paying me so I can't complain.\"\n\nIn 1989, Louis Gossett, Jr. told \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"CBS and Warner Bros. made a deal. ... The deal was that CBS would get to air \"Blazing Saddles\", and any sequels from the movie, in exchange for co-producing a TV show. At the time Warners wanted to make \"Blazing Saddles\" into a comedy series of films, a new one coming out every year or so. They wanted to use the model that the Brits had for the \"Carry On\" films. But [Mel] Brooks had a clause in his contract that said Warner had to keep producing \"Blazing Saddles\" stories, in the movies or TV, or they'd lose the rights to make sequels. The TV show was a way to keep the rights. They didn't have to air it, just keep producing it. So for four years I spent my winter on a soundstage being paid to be in show that would never see the light of day, just so Warners could keep the sequel rights to \"Blazing Saddles\". By 1979 they finally figured out the market had changed and they weren't going to make any sequels, so we were cancelled, if a show that never was supposed to air can be cancelled.\"\n\nMel Brooks addressed the existence of the \"Black Bart\" series in 2005: \"My lawyers, bless their souls, came to me and said, 'Warner Bros. is going to try and take away your control of the movie. Let's put in a crazy condition that says they can't do any sequels unless they make it right away or make a TV show out of it within six months.' Which is brilliant. They couldn't make a sequel in six months, and the movie was too vulgar to be a TV show. Now it would air in family hour if that was still a thing. So the lawyers put that in, never thinking they'd make a TV show. ... In 1977, three years later, Warner Bros comes to me and says they want to make another \"Blazing Saddles\", and I say, 'No. You don't have the right to do that.' They say, 'Yes we do, we've been making a TV series and still control the rights.' What TV series? I haven't seen a TV show. They take me onto the lot, into a projection booth, and show me three episodes. My lawyers never thought to put in language that said they had to air the damn thing, only that they had to make it. Oy gevalt! Well, management changed and they never did \"Blazing Saddles 2\", and as far as I know they're still making that stupid show to this day.\"\n\nThe pilot episode of \"Black Bart\" was later included as a bonus feature on the \"Blazing Saddles\" 30th Anniversary DVD and the Blu-ray disc.\n\nThe first studio-licensed release of the full music soundtrack to \"Blazing Saddles\" was on La-La Land Records on August 26, 2008. Remastered from original studio vault elements, the limited edition CD (a run of 3000) features the songs from the film as well as composer John Morris's score. Instrumental versions of all the songs are bonus tracks on the disc. The disc features exclusive liner notes featuring comments from Mel Brooks and John Morris.\n\nThe 2017 animated film \"Blazing Samurai\", starring Michael Cera, Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Yeoh, and Ricky Gervais, has been characterized by its creators as \"equally inspired by and an homage to \"Blazing Saddles\".\" Brooks served as an executive producer for the production, and voiced one of the characters.\n\nIn September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of \"Blazing Saddles\" in the future.\n\nThe film was first released on DVD in 1997. In 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray. A 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray set was released in 2014.\n\n"}

Builder's risk insurance is \"coverage that protects a person's or organization's insurable interest in materials, fixtures and/or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from a covered cause.\"\n\nBuildings are subject to many different risks while under construction. They may catch fire, be damaged by high winds, or fall victim to other force majeure. A principle of common law is that any new construction or other improvement to land becomes property of the owner of the land - the title holder - once there has been an \"improvement\" to the owner's site. Builder's risk insurance indemnifies against some of these losses.\n\nBuilder's risk covers perils such as fire, wind, theft and vandalism and many more. It typically does not cover perils such as earthquake, flood or wind in beach zones unless the policy has been specifically endorsed to do so. However, earthquake riders can be very economical, depending on where your project is located and should be considered. These policies also do not cover accidents and injuries at the workplace. and is intended to terminate when the work has been completed and the property is ready for use or occupancy. If you are going to properly setup your policy, coverage should be effective prior to when the materials are delivered to the job site. Coverage ends upon the earlier of closing of the sale, occupancy or the policy expiration date. After builder risk coverage expires, due to sale or occupancy, the new owner should take out permanent property insurance on the building such as a home owner's policy or a commercial property policy.\n\nCoverage is often purchased by the custom builder or general contractor and may also be purchased by the property owner. Builder's risk coverage may be necessary to show proof of insurance to comply with local city, county, and state building codes and is often required as a condition to many contracts.\nHowever, many architects believe that it is the property owner who should have the builder's risk policy, because they have already paid for the improvements to their land, and if the builder receives the funds directly from a claim, theoretically, he/she could abscond with that benefit. It is far safer for the property owner to obtain the builder's risk policy, because they already own the building, even while it is under construction. If something happens to the under-construction project, then they should be the beneficiary and control how it is spent. Yes, the builder ends up receiving the funds in the end, to rebuild damage, but this method gives the control of the insurance benefit to the owner.\n\nIf the project involves renovations or additions to an existing building, the owner's existing property insurance may cover the work under construction, eliminating the need for builder's risk insurance. (Policies vary.) However, in the case of new buildings under construction on vacant sites, the owner may not have an existing policy that provides coverage.\n"}

Macdonald. The books are set in a high-fantasy pseudo-medieval era. The series protagonist is young squire Randal of Doun, whose life is changed forever when he meets the Master Wizard, Madoc The Wayfarer, and forsakes his home to pursue the study of magic. The series chronicles his apprenticeship at the Schola Sorceriae, the School of Wizardry, through his status of Journeyman and finally to his rise as a full Master of the Art.\n\nBook I. School of Wizardry\n\nThe protagonist, Randal, a young boy preparing for knighthood at Castle Doun, leaves his old life behind and follows Madoc the Wayfarer, who takes him to study at the Schola Sorceriae in the city of Tarnsberg. He struggles with his studies, aided by an elder student, Nick, and comforted by a young orphan lutenist, the girl Lys. After he narrowly squeaks through exams, the young and charismatic Master Laerg takes an interest in Randal, tutoring him in private; but his motives are less than honest.\n\nBook II. The Secret of the Tower / Tournament and Tower\n\nNo longer an apprentice, but a journeyman, Randal leaves the Tarnsberg to travel the world. Forbidden by the Regents of the Schola to use magic, Randal travels with Lys and his cousin Walter to gain the absolution of the retired Master Balpesh at his isolated tower. But more than a master wizard is waiting for them there.\n\nBook III. The Wizard's Statue / City by the Sea\n\nTraveling with Lys to visit Nick, who gave up wizardry for carpentry, Randal is left a mysterious ivory figurine by a dying journeyman wizard.

{"id": "7525126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7525126", "title": "Cloak of invisibility", "text": "Cloak of invisibility\n\nA cloak of invisibility is a fictional theme and a device under some scientific inquiry. In folklore, mythology and fairy tales, a cloak of invisibility appears either as a magical item used by duplicitous characters or an item worn by a hero to fulfill a quest. It is a common theme in Welsh and Germanic folklore, and may originate with the cap of invisibility seen in ancient Greek myths. The motif falls under \"D1361.12 magic cloak of invisibility\" in the Stith Thompson motif index scheme.\n\nCloaks of invisibility are magical items found in folklore and fairy tales. Such cloaks are common in Welsh mythology; a \"Mantle of Invisibility\" is described in the tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\" (c. 1100) as one of King Arthur's most prized possessions. The mantle is described again, and in more detail, in the \"Breuddwyd Rhonabwy,\" and is later listed as one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain. A similar mantle appears in the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, in which it is used by Caswallawn to assassinate the seven stewards left behind by Bran the Blessed and usurp the throne.\n\nIn the English fairy tale \"Jack the Giant Killer\", the hero is rewarded with several magical gifts by a giant he has spared, among them a coat of invisibility. Iona and Peter Opie observe in \"The Classic Fairy Tales\" (1974), that Jack's coat may have been borrowed from the \"Tale of Tom Thumb\" or from Norse mythology, but they also draw comparisons with the Celtic stories of the \"Mabinogion\".\n\nThe counterpart in Japan is the , a magical \"straw cape\" or \"raincoat\" of invisibility. In the folktale of the \"Peach Boy\" \"Momotarō\", one of the treasures the hero collects from the ogres is a cape of invisibility, paralleling the story of Jack the giant-slayer.\n\nAlthough occurrences in fairy tales are rare, the cloak of invisibility appears in the German tale \"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\" (KHM 133) and in \"The King of the Golden Mountain\" (KHM 92) in \"Grimm's Fairy Tales.\" The cloak in German fairy tales may be traceable to the \"tarnkappe\" (\"cloak of concealment\"), such as the one that the hero Sîfrit (Siegfried) acquires from the dwarf Alberich in the Middle High German epic \"Nibelungenlied\". The Grimms clarify that Sîfrit's \"kappe\" is a cape that covers not just the head but enshrouds the body, though in later times \"tarnkappe\" came to be regarded as a cap of invisibility. The \"tarnkappe\" (or \"tarnkeppelin\") is also owned by the dwarf king who is the title character in \"Laurin\". In different passages or variant manuscripts of these works, the \"tarnkappe\" is also referred to as the \"tarnhût\" (mod. Ger. \"Haut\" \"skin\") or \"hehlkappe\" (mod. Ger. \"hehlen\" \"to hide\").\n\nIn the original epic \"Nibelungenlied,\" the hero's cloak not only grants him invisibility, but also increases his strength, to win over the Icelandic queen Brünhild. In Richard Wagner's opera cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", the cloak becomes a magic helmet called the Tarnhelm, which also imparts the ability to transform upon its wearer. When Fritz Lang adapted \"Nibelungenlied\" for the movie screen in his 1924 film \"Die Nibelungen\", Siegfried uses a veil or net of invisibility gained from the dwarf Alberich. Another film from the same year to use a cloak of invisibility was Raoul Walsh's \"The Thief of Bagdad\", in which the cloak plays a pivotal role.\nEdgar Rice Burroughs uses the idea of an invisibility cloak in his 1931 novel \"A Fighting Man of Mars\". The movie \"Erik the Viking\" humorously depicts the title character using a cloak of invisibility, which he does not realize apparently works only on elderly men. In \"The Lord of the Rings\", Frodo's elven cloak camouflaged him so that the enemy could see \"nothing more than a boulder where the Hobbits were\".\n\nCamouflaging cloaks form a central plot element in Samuel R. Delany's 1975 novel \"Dhalgren\".\n\nCloaks of invisibility also exist in the \"Harry Potter\" series of novels by J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter uses a Cloak of Invisibility, that was passed down to him by his father, to sneak into forbidden areas of his school and remain unseen. It is later revealed that this specific cloak was once owned by Death himself, making it one of the Deathly Hallows.\n\nAlso found in popular fiction, \"The Secret History\", by Donna Tartt, 1992. The character, Richard, says, \"I became expert at making myself invisible\"...\"Sunday afternoons, my cloak of invisibility around my shoulders, I would sit in the infirmary for sometimes six hours at a time...\".\n\nOn October 19, 2006, a cloak was produced that routed microwaves of a particular frequency around a copper cylinder in a way that made them emerge almost as if there were nothing there. The cloak was made from metamaterials. It cast a small shadow, which the designers hope to fix.\n\nThe device obscures a defined two dimensional region and only at a particular microwave frequency. Work on achieving similar results with visible light is in progress. Other types of invisibility cloak are also possible, including ones that cloak \"events\" rather than objects.\n\nHowever, cloaking a human-sized object at visible wavelengths appears to have low probability. Indeed, there appears to be a fundamental problem with these devices as \"invisibility cloaks\":\n\nOn the other hand, a group of researchers connected with Berkeley Lab and the University of California, Berkeley believe that cloaking at optical frequencies is indeed possible. Furthermore, it appears within reach. Their solution to the hurdles presented by cloaking issues are dielectrics. These nonconducting materials (dielectrics) are used for a carpet cloak, which serves as an optical cloaking device. According to the lead investigator:\nFurthermore, a new cloaking system was announced in the beginning of 2011 that is effective in visible light and hides macroscopic objects, i.e. objects that can be seen with the human eye. The cloak is constructed from ordinary, and easily obtainable calcite. The crystal consists of two pieces configured according to specific parameters. The calcite is able to refract the light around a solid object positioned between the crystals. The system employs the natural birefringence of the calcite. From outside the system the object is not visible \"for at least 3 orders of magnitude larger than the wavelength of light in all three dimensions.\" The calcite solves for the limitations of attempting to cloak with metallic inclusions - this method does not require a nanofabrication process as has become necessary with the other methods of cloaking. The nanofabrication process is time consuming and limits the size of the cloaked region to a microscopic area. The system works best under green light. In addition the researchers appear to be optimistic about a practical cloaking device in the future:\nAnother design calls for tiny metal needles to be fitted into a hairbrush-shaped cone at angles and lengths that would force light to pass around the cloak. This would make everything inside the cone appear to vanish because the light would no longer reflect off it. \"It looks pretty much like fiction, I do realize, but it's completely in agreement with the laws of physics,\" said lead researcher Vladimir Shalaev, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue. \"Ideally, if we make it real it would work exactly like Harry Potter's invisibility cloak,\" he said. \"It's not going to be heavy because there's going to be very little metal in it.\"\n\nFurtherfurthermore, on April 30, 2009, two teams of scientists developed a cloak that rendered objects invisible to near-infrared light. Unlike its predecessors, this technology did not utilize metals, which improves cloaking since metals cause some light to be lost. Researchers mentioned that since the approach can be scaled down further in size, it was a major step towards a cloak that would work for visible light.\n\nThe headlined claims that laboratory results with metamaterials are demonstrations of prototype invisibility cloaks conflicts with two facts resulting from fundamental characteristics of the underlying metamaterial technology:\n\nThough perfect cloaking based on invisible paint is impossible if detectors (such as microphones) and sources (such as loudspeakers) are placed round a volume and if a particular formula is used to calculate the signals to be fed to the sources, perfect cloaking is possible. Such perfect cloaking does require that the information can flow through the volume fast enough and the calculations can be performed fast enough so that the necessary information can get to the sources on the far side of the volume fast enough. As a result, perfect cloaking for light is still probably at least very difficult if not impossible. For sound waves, though, such perfect cloaking is possible in principle; an object could therefore be made invisible to sonar, for example.\n\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, light follows the trajectory of the shortest optical path, that is, the path over which the integral of the refractive index function is minimal. Therefore, the refractive index of an optical medium determines how light propagates within it. Consequently, by a suitable choice of refractive index profile for an optical medium, light rays can be bent around and made to propagate in closed loops...\n\nJanos Perczel, 22, an undergraduate student at St Andrews University in Fife, has developed an optical sphere which could be used to create an \"invisibility cloak\". He said that by slowing down light by way of an optical illusion, the light can then be bent around an object to \"conceal\" it. Attempts have already been made to create invisibility cloaks but research shows that efforts are limited because any cloak would only work within certain backgrounds. But by slowing down the rays of light, Mr Perczel says the cloak wearer can move around ever-changing backgrounds.\n\nMr Perczel, from Hungary, came up with the idea under the guidance of \"invisibility expert\" Professor Ulf Leonhardt, who teaches at the university's school of physics and astronomy. The student recognised the potential of the invisible sphere and spent eight months fine tuning his project. The key development lies in the ability of the sphere, an optical device, to not only remain invisible itself but to slow light.\n\nAccording to Prof Leonhardt, all optical illusions can slow down rays of light and the sphere can be used to bend this illusion around an object, reflecting off it and making it appear to be invisible. Mr Perczel added: \"When the light is bent it engulfs the object, much like water covering a rock sitting in a river bed, and carries on its path, making it seem as if nothing is there. Light however can only be sped up to a speed faster than it would travel in space, under certain conditions, and this restricts invisibility cloaks to work in a limited part of the spectrum, essentially just one colour. This would be ideal if somebody was planning to stand still in camouflage. However, the moment they start to move, the scenery would begin to distort, revealing the person under the cloak. By slowing all of the light down with an invisible sphere, it does not need to be accelerated to such high speeds and can therefore work in all parts of the spectrum.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In particular, Sikh, Muslim, Arab, South Asian, and other American communities have confronted verbal harassment, employment discrimination, physical assault, and even murder. For example, Balbir Singh Sodhi, a turbaned Sikh, was murdered just days after 9/11.\n\nIn response to the post-9/11 climate and the need to understand how discrimination has impacted these targeted communities in the United States, DNSI was created. The purpose of the project is to examine the mistreatment of minority communities in times of war or national crisis. DNSI is specifically interested in the human consequences of such mistreatment. In addition to performing research and releasing substantive reports, DNSI regularly notes relevant incidents and developments on its blog.\n\nDNSI was officially established on December 18, 2004, the 60th anniversary of Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court of the United States case that upheld the forced exclusion of citizens of Japanese ancestry (\"see\", Japanese American Internment). The dissenting justices warned of the use of perceived race, ethnicity, or national origin as a proxy for suspect qualities, including subversion and disloyalty to the union, during wartime. \n\nDNSI examines discrimination and its social impact not just in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, but also in other historical and international contexts that implicate the tension between equality and concerns for national security, such as the backlash against Muslims after the 7 July 2005 London bombings and the broader debate regarding assimilation and multiculturalism that is taking place in several Western societies (\"see\", United Kingdom debate over veils). \n\nDNSI is directed by Valarie Kaur (creator, writer, and producer of the documentary, \"Divided We Fall\") and Dawinder “Dave” S.

{"id": "1665301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1665301", "title": "Giant Baba", "text": "Giant Baba\n\n, best known by his ring name , was a Japanese professional wrestler and co-founder of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) who, along with Antonio Inoki, became one of the most famous Japanese wrestlers of his era, with a popularity in Japan comparable to Hulk Hogan's in the United States.\n\nAmong his many accomplisments, Baba was a four-time PWF World Heavyweight Champion, three time NWA International Heavyweight Champion and a three-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nShohei Baba was born in Sanjo, Niigata Prefecture, on January 23, 1938. Second son of Kazuo Baba, a fruit and vegetable trader at Yokkaichi, in the hometown, and his wife Mitsu, he had a brother, Shōichi, twenty years older and beloved of their mother, and two sisters, Yoshi and Aiko, respectively sixteen and four years older.\n\nWhen he was a child, his father, a silent man, was ill and couldn't do much work. After the death of his older brother, enlisted by the Sendai troops and killed in the island of Guadalcanal, a battlefield of the Pacific War, by the American Army in February 1943, his mother had to fully support the family vegetable industry. To help her in heavy works with her two older sisters, for seven years from the fifth grade, with a bicycle and a loaded back carriage, he brought fruit and vegetables to the Nagaoka market, 12 km away, early in the morning before going to school, which was held twice a week.\n\nOn the evening of August 14, 1945, at the end of World War II, when he entered elementary school, Nagaoka was attacked by the incendiary bombs of the great formation of US military aircraft B29. His family had built a temporary hut on a rice field, about 500 m away from home, and took refuge when the alarm sounded. The next day, where the morning market was held, it became a burning field.\n\nHis father died in November 1968, at age 80. In December, after fighting with Gene Kiniski, he returned to his hometown to visit his tomb. His mother died three years later, in July 1971, at age 75.\n\nBefore entering professional wrestling he had been a professional baseball pitcher for the Yomiuri Giants, and was signed at the age of 17. Baba, who was issued jersey number 59, was a member of the organization for at least five years. It appears however, he spent most of his time in the minor leagues. He appeared in only three games with the Giants, and recorded a record of 0–1.\n\nIt was around this time when national wrestling hero and owner of the Japanese Wrestling Association (JWA) Mitsuhiro Momota – better known as Rikidōzan – began to feel the time was right for him to start grooming a successor in order to keep business strong.\n\nIn April 1960, Baba began training in Rikidōzan's dojo along with fellow student Kanji Inoki. The two trained together under Rikidōzan and made their debuts on September 30, 1960 at the old Daito Ku Gymnasium in Tokyo where Baba beat Yonetaro Tanaka and Inoki, renamed Antonio, lost to fellow Rikidōzan student Kintaro Ohki.\n\nBaba wrestled for Vincent J. McMahon in the United States in the early 1960s, unsuccessfully challenging NWA World Heavywight Champion Buddy Rogers for the world title, and returning to face Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in 1963 in Madison Square Garden, where Sammartino defeated Baba.\n\nThe period 1967–1971 is best remembered by Japanese wrestling fans for the Baba and Inoki tag team that first won the NWA International Tag Team Championship on October 31, 1967 beating Bill Watts and Tarzan Tyler, and would go on to hold the championship four times, a record that Baba would break later with another tag team partner, Jumbo Tsuruta.\n\nIn October 1972, with JWA on the decline and several months after Inoki had formed New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), Baba formed his own promotion, All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), with the backing of Nippon TV. All Japan eventually took over the JWA's spot in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) after its collapse, and under Baba's strong business acumen, the rest of the NWA's talent enjoyed an amazing run in Japan.\n\nBaba became the first Japanese wrestler ever to hold the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, defeating Jack Brisco in a two out of three falls match on December 2, 1974 in Kagoshima, Japan. He would hold the championship on two more occasions, but his reigns were short and limited to Japanese territory. Baba was additionally the first former NWA World Champion to be defeated by Ric Flair, as Flair was becoming a top contender to the title.\n\nBy 1984, Baba began phasing himself out to give rise to the next generation of wrestlers, led by Jumbo Tsuruta and Genichiro Tenryu. He voluntarily became a \"curtain jerker\", as he moved slowly and won only against mid-card talent. Under his leadership, All Japan Pro Wrestling became arguably the number one wrestling company in the world during the 1990s from a match quality standpoint. Following the formation of the quickly doomed Super World of Sports, established talent such as Tenryu, Ashura Hara and Great Kabuki left All Japan and Baba was forced to push younger talent, such as Toshiaki Kawada, Kenta Kobashi, Akira Taue and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi up the card to replace them.\n\nThe biggest move Baba made at this time was taking the mask off Tiger Mask II and giving Mitsuharu Misawa the push as the biggest new singles star by pinning Jumbo Tsuruta in one of the most emotional matches in company history on June 8, 1990 at Budokan Hall. The show was close to a sellout and Misawa was immediately catapulted to main event status because of his victory over the legend Jumbo. Budokan Hall became a hotbed for professional wrestling with a string of sellouts in the building lasting for several years, which validated Baba's insistence on clean finishes in matches (Baba's response to the popularity of shoot wrestling at the time; before that, major matches often ended with double countout finishes).\n\nWith the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship as the focal point, All Japan sold out more than 250 consecutive shows in Tokyo throughout the early to mid-1990s, routinely drawing houses in the $1,000,000 range eight times a year at Budokan Hall. At the peak of the company, tickets for the next Budokan show would be sold at the live event and completely sell out that night. In 1998, Baba finally agreed to run the Tokyo Dome on May 1, and despite it being a few years since the company peaked they still drew 58,300 paying fans. It became well known that as a promoter a hand shake agreement was often used rather than a signed contract, as he had a great reputation for keeping his word when it came to match finishes and payrolls. Because of this, many regarded Baba as the most honest promoter in the professional wrestling business.\n\nBaba's last \"comeback\" was during the World's Strongest Tag Determination League in 1994, when he teamed with old rival Stan Hansen in hopes of winning the World Tag Team Championship. The duo made it to the finals, but were defeated by Mitsuharu Misawa and Kenta Kobashi. His final match, prior to being confined to a hospital bed, occurred on December 5, 1998 at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, where he teamed with Rusher Kimura and Mitsuo Momota to take on Masanobu Fuchi, Haruka Eigen, and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi.\n\nOn January 22, 1999, Baba saw his last wrestling match, as Toshiaki Kawada defeated Mitsuharu Misawa for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. Nine days later, Baba died of cancer.\n\nOn September 16, 1971, after the death of his mother, in Hawaii he married Motoko Kawai (born January 2, 1940), but they had no children due to the fear of the children having gigantism. She passed away on April 14, 2018 from cirrhosis of the liver; she was 78 years old.\n\nAnother Japanese professional wrestler, Hiroshi Nagao from HUSTLE, takes his ring name (\"Giant Vabo\") from Giant Baba (and Volleyball, his weapon). He once used Baba's theme music and ring attire for a tag team match (his opponent Koinoki imitated legendary Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki).\n\n\"The 2006 Top 100 Historical Persons in Japan\" survey ranked Baba the 92nd greatest person in the history of Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

It was composed some time after 1131, based in large part on the equally anonymous \"Gesta Francorum et aliorum Hierosolimitanorum\" and also incorporating fragments from the \"Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem\", the \"Gesta Tancredi\" and other unknown texts. Although heavily reliant on the \"Gesta Francorum\", it is an important source for the Italo-Norman crusaders. Like the history of Robert the Monk and Guibert of Nogent's \"Dei gesta per Francos\", both of which were used as sources by its anonymous author, the \"Historia belli sacri\" is \"a serious and careful effort to rework the \"Gesta\" story and add to it significant information which is not found in any other source.\" It was, after all, \"written in an age when there were still survivors of the First Crusade.\"\n\nFor a long time the only known manuscript of the \"Historia belli sacri\" was to be found in the library of Montecassino. It was first edited by Jean Mabillon for his \"Museum Italicum\" (Paris, 1687), and this edition was re-published in the \"Recueil des Historiens des Croisades\" under the title Tudebodus imitatus et continuatus. It was regarded by the editors as an \"imitation\" and \"continuation\", along with the \"Gesta Francorum\", of Petrus Tudebodus' \"Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere\". A second fragment of the \"Historia belli sacri\" was discovered in Latin manuscript 6041 A of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This fourteenth-century Italian manuscript once belonged to François Roger de Gaignières. The catalogue of the Bibliothèque's Latin section, published in 1774, lists the third document of MS 6041 A as \" a history of Jerusalem by Pons of Baladun and Raymond, canon of Le Puy\" (\"Pontii de Baladuno et Raimundi, canonici Podiensis, Historia Hierosolymitana\"). The actual third document in the MS is not only a copy of the \"Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem\", usually attributed to Pons of Baladun and Raymond of Aguilers, but rather a compilation, by an unknown editor, of portions of three distinct works: the \"Historia Francorum\" (for the period up to the siege of Antioch), the \"Historia belli sacri\" (for the period from there to the conquest of Ramla) and the \"Gesta Francorum\" (for the period from Ramleh to the battle of Ascalon).\n\nThe \"Historia belli\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s section begins with this account of the crusaders' arrival at Antioch:\n\nOn the next day, they came as far as Antioch, at midday, on the fourth day of the week, which is the twelfth kalends of November [21 October], and miraculously we besieged the gates of the city.\n\n\"Crastina autem die, pervenerunt usque ad Antiochiam, ad medietatem diei, in quarta feria, quod est duodecimo kalendas Novembris, et obsedimus mirabiliter portas civitatis.\"\nOf the contemporary histories of the First Crusade, the \"Historia belli sacri\" provides the most information on the negotiations between the Crusaders and the Fatimid Caliphate. The \"Historia\" is also the only source to go into detail concerning Bohemond of Taranto's exceptionally long journey through the Balkans to Constantinople, which took six months with a comparatively small army, and after which he lodged in the suburb of Sancti Argenti for some time. It also records how at the beginning of the siege of Antioch, the local governor, Yaghi-Siyan, expelled the Christians from the city, and how a certain Hilary, a Muslim convert to Christianity, betrayed the Crusaders by divulging their weaknesses to the relieving army of Radwan of Aleppo, only to be killed when the army was driven off.\n\nSeveral of the \"Historia\"′s accounts are more fanciful. It places all the leaders of the Crusade at the Council of Clermont, although they were certainly not all there. It also has them begging Pope Urban II to lead them personally. It says that at the siege of Antioch a miraculous image of Christ that could not be pierced by Turkish arrows appeared in the cathedral. More credibly, it says that after the siege, the Christian women of the city went to release the imprisoned Patriarch of Antioch, John VII, only to find that he could not stand, his legs having been weakened by so long a confinement.\n"}

He is considered Poland's first historian.\n\nJan Długosz is best known for his \"Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae\" (\"Annals or Chronicles of the Famous Kingdom of Poland\"), covering events in southeastern Europe, but also in Western Europe, from 965 to 1480, the year he died. His work was first printed in 1701-1703. Whenever he bothers to mention himself in the book, he writes of himself in the third person. He belonged to the Wieniawa coat-of-arms.\n\nDługosz was a canon at Kraków, educated in the University of Krakow. He was sent by King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland on diplomatic missions to the Papal and Imperial courts, and was involved in the King's negotiations with the Teutonic Knights during the Thirteen Years' War (1454–66) and at the peace negotiations.\n\nIn 1434, Długosz's uncle, the first pastor at Kłobuck, appointed him to take over his position as canon of St. Martin church there. The town was in the Opole territory of Silesia, but had recently been conquered by Władysław II Jagiełło. Długosz stayed until 1452 and while there, founded the canonical monastery.\n\nIn 1450, Długosz was sent by Queen Sophia of Halshany and King Casimir to conduct peace negotiations between John Hunyadi and the Bohemian noble Jan Jiskra of Brandýs, and after six days' of talks convinced them to sign a truce.\n\nIn 1455 in Kraków, a fire spread which destroyed much of the city and the castle, but which spared Długosz's house.\n\nIn 1461 a Polish delegation which included Długosz met with emissaries of George of Podebrady in Bytom, Silesia. After six days of talks, they concluded an alliance between the two factions. In 1466 Długosz was sent to the legate of Wrocław, in order to attempt to obtain assurance that the legate was not biased in favor of the Teutonic Knights. He was successful, and was in 1467 entrusted with tutoring the king's son.\n\nDługosz declined the offer of the Archbishopric of Prague, but shortly before his death was nominated Archbishop of Lwów. This nomination was only confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV on 2 June 1480, two weeks after his death.\n\nHis work \"Banderia Prutenorum\" of 1448 is his description of the 1410 Battle of Grunwald, which took place between villages of Grunwald and Stębark.\n\nAt some point in his life Długosz loosely translated Wigand of Marburg's \"Chronica nova Prutenica\" from Middle High German into Latin, however with many mistakes and mixup of names and places.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was translated into Latin by Juan Badiano, from a Nahuatl original composed in the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in 1552 by Martín de la Cruz that is no longer extant. The \"Libellus\" is also known as the Badianus Manuscript, after the translator; the Codex de la Cruz-Badiano, after both the original author and translator; and the Codex Barberini, after Cardinal Francesco Barberini, who had possession of the manuscript in the early 17th century.\n\nThe Badianus Manuscript of 1552 is the first illustrated and descriptive scientific text of Nahua medicine and botany produced in the Americas. The original text was produced in Nahuatl and translated to Latin for European readers. It is a significant text in the history of botany and the history of medicine.\n\nIn 1552 Jacobo de Grado, the friar in charge of the Convent of Tlatelolco and the College of Santa Cruz, had the herbal created and translated for Don Francisco de Mendoza, son of Don Antonio de Mendoza, the viceroy of New Spain. Mendoza sent the Latin manuscript to Spain, where it was deposited into the royal library. There it presumably remained until the early 17th century, when it somehow came into the possession of Diego de Cortavila y Sanabria, pharmacist to King Philip IV. From Cortavila it travelled to the Italian Cardinal Francesco Barberini, possibly via intermediate owners. The manuscript remained in the Barberini library until 1902, when the Barberini library became part of the Vatican Library, and the manuscript along with it. Finally, in 1990 — over four centuries after it was sent to Spain — Pope John Paul II returned the \"Libellus\" to Mexico, and it is now in the library of the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City.\n\nA copy was made in the 17th century by Cassiano dal Pozzo, the secretary of Cardinal Barberini. Dal Pozzo's collection, called his \"Museo Cartaceo\" (\"Papers Museum\"), was sold by his heirs to Pope Clement XI, who sold it to his nephew, Cardinal Alessandro Albani, who himself sold it to King George III in 1762. Dal Pozzo's copy is now part of the Royal Library, Windsor. Another copy may have been made by Francesco de' Stelluti, but is now lost. Dal Pozzo and de' Stelluti were both members of the Accademia dei Lincei.\n\nThere are several published editions of the manuscript, beginning with the one by William E. Gates in 1939, now reissued in an inexpensive edition by Dover Books. Gates acquired photographs of the manuscript in Latin and water color renderings of the botanical drawings. He published both the original Latin manuscript as well as his translation to English. The reissued edition of Gates's manuscript has a very useful introduction by Bruce Byland, recounting the publication history of the manuscript and subsequent scholarship.\n\nAt the same time Gates was working on this publication, another was being prepared for publication by Emily Walcott Emmart. This resulted in a full-color facsimile publication, transcription, and translation to English, with notes and commentary. In 1964, an edition of the manuscript was published in full-color facsimile, with a translation of the Latin to Spanish.\n\nThe manuscript has been mainly studied by scholars interested in history of medicine and history of botany. In history of medicine, there has been some focus on the extent to which the manuscript might be incorporating aspects of European humoral theories of medicine or whether text is purely from the Nahua viewpoint. According to a study by Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano, the Badianus herbal was prepared for the king of Spain to demonstrate the intellectual sophistication of the Nahuas which might have skewed the manuscript to emulating aspects of European culture.\n\nThe botanical aspects of the manuscript are significant, showing that the Nahuas had a classification system that was indeed highly sophisticated. As with Book 11, \"The Earthly Things\" of the Florentine Codex by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún, the Badianus manuscript gives the Nahuatl names of plants, an illustration of the example, and the uses for the plant. However, unlike the Florentine Codex, there is little emphasis on supernatural healing characteristics of the plants. The examples in the Badinus manuscript deal solely with the medical conditions and curative aspects of the plants. For example, in the Gates translation, subject headings for plants' curative powers include \"Against stupidity of the mind,\" [against] \"Goaty armpits of sick people,\" \"Against lassitude,\" \"Medicine to take away foul and fetid breath.\" For scholars interested in gendered medical conditions, the Badinus manuscript has a whole chapter on \"remedies for recent parturition, the menses, lotion of the internal parts, childbirth, tubercules of the breasts, [and] medicine for increasing milk flow.\" Various plants listed in the Badinus manuscript have psychoactive properties, examined by anthropologist Peter Furst.\n\nIn 2014, Arthur O. Tucker and Rexford H. Talbert published a paper claiming a positive identification of 37 plants, 6 animals, and 1 mineral referenced in the manuscript. They argue that these were from Colonial New Spain and represented the Nahuatl language, and date the manuscript to between 1521 (the date of the Conquest) to ca. 1576, in contradiction to radiocarbon dating evidence of the vellum, which dates it to ca. 1420, and many other elements of the manuscript. The analysis has been criticized by noted Voynich Manuscript researchers, pointing out that—among other things—a skilled forger could construct plants that have a passing resemblance to existing plants that were heretofore undiscovered.\n\n"}

It is her best known work, pioneering the use of linguistic typology as a tool for understanding human migrations in prehistory.\n\nNichols selects a sample of the world's languages (one per stock) and tabulates typological characteristics such as:\nfor each language, using this data to discover regional patterns in the distribution of these features.\n\nOne pattern is spread zones (geographical areas where a language family has spread widely, often repeated with several language families in sequence, like Indo-European and later Turkic languages in central Eurasia) vs. residual zones (areas, often mountainous, where many languages of various families have been preserved, like the Caucasus or New Guinea). For example, head marking is more common in the residual zones, which Nichols suggests is a result of long-term language contact.\n\nAt the broadest level, Nichols divides the world of languages into three large regions:\nThe Old World is geographically largest, but has the least typological diversity and lowest density of language families, suggesting that repeated spreads from its center have eliminated much diversity which previously existed, especially at the edges of the Africa-Eurasia supercontinent. Surprisingly, typological statistics for African languages are similar to those for the languages of Eurasia, though there has been little spread of languages between the two areas, other than the Afroasiatic languages that span both areas.\n\nThe New World differs considerably from the Old World, with much higher frequencies of head-marking, ergativity and other features. The \"Pacific\" is intermediate on these features. One interpretation is that these patterns resulted from chance; another is that the New World was colonized from a Pacific region which was formerly larger and included unknown archaic languages of coastal East Asia. Based on the latter interpretation, Nichols suggests a relatively early date (pre-Clovis) for the initial peopling of the Americas.\n\nNichols also suggests that change over time in head-marking languages tends to destroy the information needed for the comparative method of reconstructing a protolanguage that is the ancestor to a number of known languages, while dependent-marking languages are more likely to preserve it over time. This would help account for the large number of language families in the Americas and Australasia that are still considered independent, in contrast to the large families of considerable time depth that have been reconstructed in Eurasia and Africa.\n"}

This sometimes occurs at illegal protests. Some mass arrests are also used in an effort to combat gang activity. This is sometimes controversial, and lawsuits sometimes result. In police science, it is deemed to be good practice to plan for the identification of those arrested during mass arrests, since it is unlikely that the officers will remember everyone they arrested.\n\nThe Japan Farmers' Union and Japanese labor-farmer groups were hit by mass arrests in the 1920s. On April 16, 1929, several thousand members of the farmers' movement were arrested. Following World War II, mass arrests (over 120,000) of actual and suspected Quislings occurred in the Netherlands. Totalitarian regimes have sometimes conducted mass arrests as a prelude to a purge of perceived political enemies, sometimes through executions.\n\nOn March 10, 2010 a mass crackdown was initiated to thwart a planned peaceful 'million march' to be conducted in a South Indian state capital of Hyderabad demanding formation of a new federal unit, more than 100,000 Telangana people were taken in to custody by a police force controlled by the coastal 'andhra' elites.\n\nThe 2010 G-20 Toronto summit was witness to the largest mass arrest in Canadian history.\n\nIn December 1964, the University of California, Berkeley was disrupted by a mass student sit-in in the administration building and by mass arrests of 700 students.\n\nBeginning on May 3, 1971, three days into the 1971 May Day Protests - a series of large-scale civil disobedience actions in Washington, D.C. - massive arrest sweeps begin. In a few days over 12,000 are arrested - the largest mass arrest in U.S. history.\n\nFormer American President Jimmy Carter said in regards to the racial conflicts of the time, \"I would be opposed to mass arrest, and I would be opposed to preventive detention. But I think that the abuses in the past have in many cases exacerbated the disharmonies that brought about demonstrations, and I think that arrest or large numbers of people without warrants ... is a contrary to our best systems of justice.\"\n\nA famous mass arrest occurred on September 27, 2002, in Washington, DC in which several hundred anti-World Bank/International Monetary Fund protestors, journalists and bystanders were systematically arrested by police and charged with failure to obey a police order. A class action lawsuit against the government ensued. Pre-emptive mass arrests have also sometimes been criticized.\n\nOver 1,700 protesters were arrested during the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City.\n\nOn October 1, 2011, more than 700 protesters with the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested while attempting to march across the bridge on the roadway.\n\nOn January 28, 2012, more than 400 people were arrested at Oakland.\n\nDuring a seven-day span on Capitol Hill, from April 11 through April 18, 2016 police arrested approximately 1,240 people (300 arrests were made on April 18 alone) who were demonstrating for reforms to how Americans vote and campaign in elections.\n\nIndiscriminate mass arrests were designated a war crime in 1944 by a Commission on war crimes created by the London International Assembly. This was one of two items added by that Commission to the list of war crimes that had been drawn up by the Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties in 1919. Specifically, \"indiscriminate mass arrests for the purpose of terrorizing the population\" were designated as war crimes by the Commission.\n\nAt the Netherlands temporary court martial in 1947, several members of the tokkeitai in the Netherlands East Indies were accused of the war crime of indiscriminate mass arrests. The applicable legislation, used by the court, was the NEI Statute Book Decree #44 of 1946, whose definition of war crimes paralleled the Commission's list. Specifically, item #34 of the enumerated list of war crimes under the NEI legislation was \"indiscriminate mass arrests for the purpose of terrorising the population, whether described as taking hostages or not\". The court understood the definition of such unlawful mass arrests to be as \"arrests of groups of persons firstly on the ground of wild rumours and suppositions, and secondly without definite facts and indications being present with regard to each person which would justify his arrest\". To this it added commentary on indiscriminate mass arrests that are for the purpose of terrorizing the populace, stating that they \"contained the elements of systematic terrorism for nobody, even the most innocent, was any longer certain of his liberty, and a person once arrested, even if absolutely innocent, could no longer be sure of health and life\".\n\n"}

{"id": "312489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312489", "title": "Pangu", "text": "Pangu\n\nPangu () is the first living being and the creator of all in some versions of Chinese mythology.\n\nThe first writer to record the myth of Pangu was Xu Zheng during the Three Kingdoms period. Recently his name was found in a tomb dated 194 AD.\n\nIn the beginning, there was nothing in the universe except a formless chaos. This chaos coalesced into a cosmic egg for about 18,000 years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of Yin and Yang became balanced, and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy giant who has horns on his head and wears fur. Pangu began creating the world: he separated Yin from Yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the Earth (murky \"Yin\") and the Sky (clear \"Yang\"). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the Sky. With each day, the sky grew ten feet (3 meters) higher, the Earth ten feet thicker, and Pangu ten feet taller. This task took yet another 18,000 years. In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the four most prominent beasts, namely the Turtle, the Qilin, the Phoenix, and the Dragon.\n\nAfter the 18,000 years had elapsed, Pangu died. His breath became the wind, mist and clouds; his voice, thunder; his left eye, the sun; his right eye, the moon; his head, the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood, rivers; his muscles, fertile land; his facial hair, the stars and Milky Way; his fur, bushes and forests; his bones, valuable minerals; his bone marrow, sacred diamonds; his sweat, rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became animals.\n\nThree main views describe the origin of the Pangu myth. The first is that the story is indigenous and was developed or transmitted through time to Xu Zheng. Senior Scholar Wei Juxian states that the Pangu story is derived from stories during the Western Zhou Dynasty. He cites the story of Zhong (重) and Li (黎) in the \"Chuyu\" section of the ancient classics \"Guoyu\". In it, King Zhao of Chu asked Guanshefu (觀射父) a question: \"What did the ancient classic \"Zhou Shu\" mean by the sentence that Zhong and Li caused the heaven and earth to disconnect from each other?\" The \"Zhou Shu\" sentence he refers to is about an earlier person, Luu Xing, who converses with King Mu of Zhou. King Mu's reign is much earlier and dates to about 1001 to 946 BC. In their conversation, they discuss a \"disconnection\" between heaven and earth.\n\nDerk Bodde linked the myth to the ancestral mythologies of the Miao people and Yao people in southern China.\n\nThis is Professor Qin's reconstruction of the true creation myth preceding the myth of Pangu. Note that it is not actually a creation myth:\n\nA brother and his sister became the only survivors of the prehistoric Deluge by crouching in a gourd that floated on water. The two got married afterwards, and a mass of flesh in the shape of a whetstone was born. They chopped it and the pieces turned into large crowds of people, who began to reproduce again. The couple were named 'Pan' and 'Gou' in the Zhuang ethnic language, which stand for whetstone and gourd respectively.\n\nPaul Carus writes this:\nP'an-Ku: The basic idea of the yih philosophy was so convincing that it almost obliterated the Taoist cosmology of P'an-Ku who is said to have chiseled the world out of the rocks of eternity. Though the legend is not held in high honor by the literati, it contains some features of interest which have not as yet been pointed out and deserve at least an incidental comment.\n\nP'an-Ku is written in two ways: one means in literal translations, \"basin ancient\", the other \"basin solid\". Both are homophones, i.e., they are pronounced the same way; and the former may be preferred as the original and correct spelling. Obviously the name means \"aboriginal abyss,\" or in the terser German, Urgrund, and we have reason to believe it to be a translation of the Babylonian Tiamat, \"the Deep.\"\n\nThe Chinese legend tells us that P'an-Ku's bones changed to rocks; his flesh to earth; his marrow, teeth and nails to metals; his hair to herbs and trees; his veins to rivers; his breath to wind; and his four limbs became pillars marking the four corners of the world, — which is a Chinese version not only of the Norse myth of the Giant Ymir, but also of the Babylonian story of Tiamat.\n\nIllustrations of P'an-Ku represent him in the company of supernatural animals that symbolize old age or immortality, viz., the tortoise and the crane; sometimes also the dragon, the emblem of power, and the phoenix, the emblem of bliss.\n\nWhen the earth had thus been shaped from the body of P'an-Ku, we are told that three great rivers successively governed the world: first the celestial, then the terrestrial, and finally the human sovereign. They were followed by Yung-Ch'eng and Sui-Jen (i.e., fire-man) the later being the Chinese Prometheus, who brought the fire down from heaven and taught man its various uses.\n\nThe Prometheus myth is not indigenous to Greece, where it received the artistically classical form under which it is best known to us. The name, which by an ingenious afterthought is explained as \"the fore thinker,\" is originally the Sanskrit pramantha and means \"twirler\" or \"fire-stick,\" being the rod of hard wood which produced fire by rapid rotation in a piece of soft wood.\n\nWe cannot deny that the myth must have been known also in Mesopotamia, the main center of civilization between India and Greece, and it becomes probable that the figure Sui-Jen has been derived from the same prototype as the Greek Prometheus.\nThe missionary and translator James Legge discusses Pangu:\n\nP'an-ku is spoken of by the common people as \"the first man, who opened up heaven and earth.\" It has been said to me in \"pidgin\" English that \"he is all the same your Adam\"; and in Taoist picture books I have seen him as a shaggy, dwarfish, Hercules, developing from a bear rather than an ape, and wielding an immense hammer and chisel with which he is breaking the chaotic rocks.\n\nThe Pangu myth appears to have been preceded in ancient Chinese literature by the existence of Shangdi or Taiyi (of the \"Taiyi Shengshui\"). Other Chinese myths, such as those of Nuwa and the Jade Emperor, try to explain how people were created and do not necessarily explain the creation of the world. There are many variations of these myths.\n\nAccording to Buyei mythology, after Pangu became an expert in rice farming after creating the world, he married the daughter of the Dragon King, and their union gave rise to the Buyei people.\n\nThe daughter of the Dragon King and Pangu had a son named Xinheng (新横). When Xinheng disrespected his mother, she returned to heaven and never came down, despite the repeated pleas of her husband and son. Pangu was forced to remarry and eventually died on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar.\n\nXinheng's stepmother treated him badly and almost killed him. When Xinheng threatened to destroy her rice harvest, she realized her mistake. She made peace with him, and they went on to pay their respects to Pangu annually on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar. This day became an important traditional Buyei holiday for ancestral worship.\n\nThis legend of creation is one of the main characteristics that distinguishes the Buyei from the Zhuang.\n\nPangu is worshipped at a number of shrines in contemporary China, usually with Taoist symbols, such as the Bagua.\n\nThe Pangu King Temple built in 1809 is located in Guangdong Province, northwest Huadu District (west of G106 / north of S118), north of Shiling Town at the foot of the Pangu King Mountain. The Huadu District is located north of Guangzhou to the west of the Baiyun International Airport.\n\n\n\n"}

Project Vitello I, the first phase, entailed the dismantling of the gun by the Royal Engineers at the artillery battery and transporting it to the Gibraltar dockyard in 1981. It was then shipped to Portsmouth on a Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel. Project Vitello II, the second phase, began with the arrival of the gun in Portsmouth and involved transporting the gun to the Duxford Aerodrome. The Royal Engineers not only reassembled the gun and its mount, but also constructed a base, shell pit, and parapet, with the operation completed in 1982.

As of 2012, one has been restored, the other is still awaiting restoration.] The Imperial War Museum's decision to preserve one of the weapons was based on its symbolism of Britain's links to Gibraltar since the turn of the eighteenth century, as well as its former status as the United Kingdom's most important gun for coastal defence.\n\nFollowing the explosion of one of the 38-ton guns aboard on 2 January 1879, a Committee on Ordnance was established to evaluate the United Kingdom's artillery and its future. The committee was to consider \"the question of breech-loading guns and such other questions as may be brought before it.\" The British Admiralty wanted a gun similar to one that was manufactured by Friedrich Krupp AG in Essen, Germany. The rifled breech-loading gun that resulted was an improvement over traditional rifled muzzle-loading weapons. The 9.2-inch breech-loading weapon was initially a naval gun, but was selected for use in coastal defence, the purpose of which was protection of naval bases, harbours, and ports, as well as prevention of invasion. In the late nineteenth century, torpedo boats and larger enemy vessels clad in iron posed a major threat to coastal countries, including those of the British Empire. Smaller guns were mounted to handle torpedo boats. However, the 9.2-inch guns were selected to deal with hostile warships and their long-range attacks. While the weapons on warships were more powerful, coastal defence positions had the advantage of firing from a stable base. The 9.2-inch gun retained its importance in British coastal defence for more than fifty years, until the mid-twentieth century. However, in 1956, Coast Defence was eliminated as a separate branch of the military. Although the 9.2-inch guns were still the primary coastal defence weapon, the decision had been made that planes and guided missiles were more effective in addressing invasion of a country or long-range attacks.\n\nThe first phase of the project to transfer the 9.2-inch gun at Spur Battery in Gibraltar to the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire was entitled Project Vitello I. It encompassed the dismantling of the gun at the battery and its transport to the Gibraltar dockyard. The Royal Engineers began the operation in the Spring of 1981. The 61 Field Support Squadron of the 36 Engineer Regiment found that access to the battery was somewhat difficult. There were space restrictions around the 9.2-inch gun, and the primary components of the gun had to be disassembled utilising traditional means. The total weight of the gun and its associated components was 140 tons, which then had to be driven down Gibraltar's roads, maneuvering hairpin turns and a steep grade, to the Gibraltar dockyard. The dismantling of the gun at Spur Battery was recorded, originally on Super 8 mm film. Now on 16 mm film, the footage, entitled \"Gibraltar's 9.2 Inch Gun\", is maintained by the Imperial War Museum at Duxford.\n\nThe second phase of the operation was entitled Project Vitello II. It commenced in August 1981 with the arrival of the gun at Portsmouth on RFA \"Bacchus\" (A404) \"(link to photograph below)\". The gun was transported to Duxford in eleven separate loads by the 56 Motor Transport (Training) Squadron of the Royal Engineers. The Engineers' 34 Field Squadron of the 39 Engineer Regiment then reassembled the 9.2-inch gun at the Duxford Aerodrome. This was undertaken in several phases. At the site of the previous rifle range on the aerodrome, 34 Field Squadron built a concrete base in September 1981. Over a period of five weeks in November to December 1981, the squadron reassembled the 9.2-inch gun on the concrete plinth. The following year, in February 1982, a parapet was built in front of the weapon, as well as a shell pit beneath. The construction performed by the squadron was intended to give an appearance similar to that encountered at Spur Battery in Gibraltar. The gun is displayed between Buildings 177 and 178, adjacent to the American Air Museum.\n\nOn 4 June 1982, Sir John Grandy (1913 – 2004) dedicated the display of the 9.2-inch gun, which in England is also referred to as the Gibraltar Gun. Grandy, Marshall of the Royal Air Force, had been the commanding officer at Duxford in 1942. After more than two and a half decades of leadership posts, Grandy became Chief of the Air Staff on 1 April 1967, the 49th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Air Force. Following his retirement in 1971, he served as Commander-in-chief and Governor of Gibraltar from 1973 to 1978. It represented the first time that an RAF officer filled that position. Grandy was Chairman of the Trustees of the Imperial War Museum from 1978 to 1989.\n\n"}
{"id": "816897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=816897", "title": "Red Book (Liberal Party of Canada)", "text": "Red Book (Liberal Party of Canada)\n\nThe Red Book, officially titled Creating Opportunity: The Liberal Plan for Canada was the platform of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1993 federal election. It earned its name from its bright red cover, red being the official colour of the Liberal Party. It was a 112-page booklet; many thousands of copies of it were printed, and it was widely distributed. There was even talk of trying to mail a copy to each Canadian household, but it was decided this would be too expensive.\n\nIt was exceptional in how specific it was; while platforms before and since have contained few substantive promises and many vague statements of principle, the Red Book laid out a long list of changes that the Liberals would make if brought to power.\n\nIt was also rare in Canada to have an entire platform released at once. Generally, a party would release a policy idea, wait for it to gather as much media attention as possible, and then release another. Those ideas had also been released during speeches by the party leader, not printed in unbending prose.\n\nPerhaps most central was that the Liberal Red Book gave costs for each of their promises and summed them. Never before had a party attempted to clearly prove that its promises were fiscally responsible and practical. Paul Martin, the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the Red Book in private as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: \"Don't tell me about the Red Book, I wrote the damn thing, and I know that it is a lot of crap!\".\n\nIt was one of the first \"contract with the public\" type platforms, an idea used by the United States Republican Party in its 1994 Contract with America and Mike Harris's 1995 Common Sense Revolution in Ontario.\n\nThe Liberals, out of power since 1984, were widely expected to win the 1993 election based on the great pan-Canadian dislike for the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. The Liberals under Jean Chrétien were worried by a jump in Tory support with the selection of new leader Kim Campbell.\n\nA larger concern was the general Canadian antipathy towards politicians after the tumultuous and scandal plagued Mulroney years. The 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown Accord was widely interpreted of a rejection of Canada's political elite by the general population.\n\nTo attempt to break through the cynicism and distrust the Liberals felt that being more specific and making many promises would help ensure a victory, thus the Red Book was created.\n\nThe Red Book was drafted mainly by Paul Martin, who finished as runner-up in the 1990 Liberal leadership convention to Chrétien, and Chaviva Hošek a top policy official with the Liberals. By giving Martin a prominent role in the campaign, this was seen as Chrétien's attempt to unify the Liberal Party.\n\nThe Liberals rolled out the Red Book on September 19, not long after the September 8 election call. Several days later, the Progressive Conservatives released the hastily assembled \"A Taxpayer's Agenda\", but the Liberals had captured the reputation of being the party with ideas since they had essentially released their entire platform. Thanks to the Red Book as well as a gradual decline in support for the governing Conservatives (unpopularity, vote splitting with Reform and Bloc), the Liberals won a strong majority government with 177 seats—the third-best result in the party's history, and their best performance since their record 190 seats in the 1949 election. The Conservatives were nearly eliminated from the political scene, falling to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level.\n\nThe specificity of the Red Book came back to haunt the Liberals, however, and much of the next few years were spent defending broken promises. The most notable of these was the Goods and Services Tax, which the Liberals had promised to replace but did not. Critics also said that the Liberals had broken their promises to increase the power of individual Members of Parliament and introduce a national childcare program.\n\nIn Chrétien's view, the majority of the promises were kept. He famously argued that 78% were honoured, a mark he could live with. Others contest whether some of these promises were kept or not. Some of the most notable promises from the Red Book that were kept were the pledge to cancel the purchase of new naval helicopters, canceling the sale of Toronto Pearson International Airport, reforming unemployment insurance, legislating more gun control, and reducing the size of the armed forces with the end of the Cold War. Perhaps the most important pledge kept was that of returning Canada to fiscal solvency.\n\nNew Liberal Red Books were published for the 1997 and 2000 elections. These contained far fewer specifics and more generalities.\n\n\n"}

Dated January 13, 1944, during the Holocaust, its primary author was Assistant to the Secretary Josiah E. DuBois Jr. Focusing on the period from late 1942 to late 1943, the report argued that certain officials within the US State Department not only had failed to use US government tools to rescue Jewish European refugees, but instead had used them to prevent or obstruct rescue attempts, as well as preventing relevant information from being made available to the American public. Described as \"scathing\" and as \"political dynamite\", the memorandum, re-titled \"Personal Report to the President\", helped convince President Franklin D. Roosevelt to approve the creation of the War Refugee Board.\n\nIn 1938 President Roosevelt called for an international conference on the plight of Jewish European refugees; this was held in Évian-les-Bains, France (and hence known as the Évian Conference), but no substantive change resulted. The German Foreign Office, in a sardonic reply, found it \"astonishing\" that other countries would decry Germany's treatment of Jews and then decline to admit them. \nIn the early 1940s, information about the Nazi atrocities toward Europe's Jews started to become public knowledge but was dismissed by many as exaggerated. As time passed, it became an increasingly contentious matter in contemporary American politics. At the same time, a public fear was generated concerning the security risk posed by admitting refugees to the United States. The U.S. State Department's Visa Division was responsible for issuing travel visas to foreign nationals seeking to get to the United States.\n\nHenry Morgenthau Jr., was the Secretary of the Treasury during the Roosevelt administration. By 1943 the State Department publicly confirmed reports of some details of the Nazi plan to annihilate Jews, and Morganthau discussed this with his staff. Officials at the Treasury Department were disappointed that the 1943 bi-national Bermuda Conference on refugees did not deliver results and suspected that the State Department had delayed financing for rescue of refugees.\n\nThe document has been described as a 17 or 18 pages-long memorandum. Dated January 13, 1944, the report was initiated by Treasury general counsel, Randolph Paul, authored by the Secretary's assistant Josiah E. DuBois Jr. with help from the director of foreign funds control, John Pehle, and addressed to U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. The Treasury officials criticized the US State Department for its alleged obstructionism and even conspiracies, and stated that \"Unless remedial steps of a drastic nature are taken, and taken immediately, I am certain that no effective action will be taken by this government to prevent the complete extermination of the Jews in German controlled Europe, and that this Government will have to share for all time responsibility for this extermination\". DuBois argued that certain officials within the State Department not only had failed to use US government tools to rescue the Jews, but had used them instead to prevent or obstruct rescue attempts, as well as preventing relevant information from being made available to the American public, and made further attempts to cover up such obstructionist activities.\n\nDubois' report was written in the first person and focused on the time period between late 1942, and late 1943. According to the report, in late 1942, largely through the efforts of Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles, the United States publicly confirmed the Nazi program, and led its allies in a December 1942 public condemnation and promise of help. (At the time, the allies were known as the United Nations). In January 1943, Welles cabled the American delegation in Switzerland for more information to be made public. In February persons unknown sent a cable from State basically ordering the diplomats in Switzerland not to make such information public. In April, the Bermuda Conference between State Department staff and British Foreign Office staff met specifically to discuss refugee issues but results of the conference were kept secret. (As it turned out, neither the British nor Americans expressed much interest in taking concrete action on refugees.) In the first half of 1943 several cables from State discussed a plan to fund refugee rescue. In July, State finally approached Treasury about these refugee funds and Treasury approved but State continued to delay on the funding. In addition, the report covered State's delays and failures in even filling refugee immigration quotas, ostensibly claiming security concerns. The report contains extended criticism, in particular of Assistant Secretary of State Breckinridge Long for delay and cover-up, and stressed that more than a year had gone by and nothing had been done, although people were dying and time was of the essence.\n\nThe title of Dubois' document was later described as vehement, even fantastic, though \"borne out by the grotesque revelations\". The report given to the president by Morgenthau had a less \"jarring\", more technical title: \"Personal Report to the President\". The report was described as \"scathing\" and as \"political dynamite\", in election year 1944. Within days of its receipt, Roosevelt approved the creation of a War Refugee Board, a U.S. executive agency to aid civilian victims of the Nazi and Axis powers.\n\n"}

The designation dates back to 1840. Any vessel designated as \"RMS\" has the right to fly both the pennant of the Royal Mail when sailing and to include the Royal Mail \"crown\" insignia with any identifying device and/or design for the ship.\n\nIt was used by many shipping lines, but is often associated in particular with the White Star Line, Cunard Line, Royal Mail Lines and Union-Castle Line, which held a number of high-profile mail contracts, and traditionally prefixed the names of many of their ships with the initials \"RMS\". \n\nWhile some lines in the past, particularly the Royal Mail Lines, called all their ships \"RMS\", technically a ship would use the prefix only while contracted to carry mail, and would revert at other times to a standard designation such as \"SS\".\n\nOriginally the Admiralty operated these ships.\n\nThe designation \"RMS\" has been used since 1840. In 1850 contracts were awarded to private companies. Having the title \"RMS\" was seen as a mark of quality and a competitive advantage, because the mail had to be on time.\n\nThe most valuable route, with the highest volume, was between Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), in Ireland, and Holyhead in Wales. The City of Dublin Steam Packet Company (CDSPCo) won the contract. They bought RMS \"St Columba\" and RMS \"Llewellyn\" from the Admiralty to supplement their \"Prince Arthur\".\n\nIn the CDSPCo contract, in 1860, there was a penalty clause of £ 1 1s 4d for every minute's delay.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway's trans-Pacific Royal Mail contract required the building of the first three of a fleet of steamships: the , and which regularly sailed between Vancouver and Asia beginning in 1891.\nThe RMS designation was also used on the ships White Star Line, P&O and the Cunard lines of the 19th and 20th century.\n\nIn recent years the shift to air transport for mail has left only three ships with the right to the prefix or its variations: , which serves as a passenger vessel in Gravenhurst, Ontario, Canada; , which serves the Isles of Scilly; and . QM2 was conferred \"RMS\" by Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route as a gesture to Cunard's history.\n\nThe Royal Mail continues a form of this tradition on modern day airliners. The UK's flag carrier airline, British Airways, is contracted to carry mail on some of its scheduled long-distance routes. Aircraft operating these routes with the facilities to carry mail are allowed to display the Royal Mail's logo and crest on their fuselage, usually alongside their registration markings.\n\nThe less-common designations RMMV for Royal Mail Motor Vessel and RMMS for Royal Mail Motor Ship, were used for a period when RMS was restricted to steam-ships. Motor Vessel and Motor Ship indicated that propulsion was provided by diesel rather than steam.\n\nThe carries the designation RMV for Royal Mail Vessel and is the only active RMV.\n\nThose highlighted are still in service with the status of Royal Mail Ship.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "936967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=936967", "title": "Scimitar oryx", "text": "Scimitar oryx\n\nThe scimitar oryx or scimitar-horned oryx (\"Oryx dammah\"), also known as the Sahara oryx, is a species of \"Oryx\" once widespread across North Africa which went extinct in the wild in 2000.\n\nIt has a long taxonomic history since its scientific description in 1816 by Lorenz Oken, who named it \"Oryx algazel\". This antelope stands a little more than at the shoulder. The males weigh and the females weigh . The coat is white with a red-brown chest and black markings on the forehead and down the length of the nose. The calves are born with a yellow coat without distinguishing marks; their coats change to adult coloration at 3–12 months old.\n\nThe scimitar oryx formed herds of mixed sexes of up to 70 members, usually guided by the bulls. They inhabited semideserts and deserts and were adapted to live in the extreme heat, with their efficient cooling mechanism and very low requirement of water. Scimitar oryx feed on foliage, grasses, succulent plants and plant parts during the night or early morning. Births peak between March and October. After a gestation of eight to nine months, one calf is born. Soon after, the female has a postpartum estrus.\n\nThe scimitar oryx was once widespread across northern Africa. Its decline began as a result of climate change during the neolithic period, and later it was hunted extensively for its horns. Today, it is bred in captivity in special reserves in Tunisia, Morocco and Senegal and on private exotic animal ranches in the Texas Hill Country. In 2016 a reintroduction program was launched and currently a small herd has been successfully reintroduced in Chad.\n\nThe scimitar oryx was domesticated in Ancient Egypt and is believed to have been used as food and sacrificed as offerings to gods. Wealthy people in Ancient Rome also bred them. The use of their valuable hides began in the Middle Ages. The unicorn myth may have originated from sightings of a scimitar oryx with a broken horn.\n\nThe scimitar oryx was the emblem of the ancient Egyptian Oryx nome and today is the animal symbol of the Sahara Conservation Fund.\n\nThe scimitar oryx is a member of the genus \"Oryx\" and family Bovidae. The German naturalist Lorenz Oken first described it in 1816, naming it \"Oryx algazel\". The nomenclature has undergone various changes since then, with the introduction of names like \"Oryx tao\", \"O. leucoryx\", \"O. damma\", \"O. dammah\", \"O. bezoarticus\" and \"O. ensicornis\". In 1826, Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar used the name \"Oryx ammah\" for the species. A year later, the name \"Oryx leucoryx\" came into use, but as this was a synonym of the Arabian oryx (then called \"Oryx beatrix\"), it was abandoned, and \"Oryx algazel\" was accepted once more. Over a hundred years later, in 1951, Sir John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott found that the name \"Oryx algazel\" was also ineligible for use. Finally, in January 1956, the International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature accepted \"Oryx dammah\" as the scientific name. There have been no more changes since then, though many papers published after 1956 created confusion by using names like \"O. gazella tao\".\n\nIts scientific name, \"Oryx dammah\", is derived from: Ancient Greek (\"orux\"), meaning a gazelle or antelope (originally a pickaxe); Latin \"damma\" (fallow deer or antelope); and Arabic \"dammar\" (sheep). The scimitar oryx is named for its horns, which resemble scimitars. Its common name in English is \"scimitar-horned oryx\", or simply \"scimitar oryx\".\n\nThe scimitar oryx has 58 chromosomes. It has one pair of large submetacentric autosomes and 27 acrocentric autosomal pairs. The X and Y chromosomes are the largest and smallest acrocentrics. The first molecular study of this species (published in 2007) observed genetic diversity among European, North American and some other captive groups. Divergence was found within the mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, and was estimated to have taken place between 2.1 and 2.7 million years ago. Population increases occurred approximately 1.2 and 0.5 million years ago.\n\nIn another study, intended to note genetic differences between \"Oryx\" species, karyotypes of \"Oryx\" species and subspecies – namely \"O. gazella\", \"O. b. beisa\", \"O. b. callotis\", \"O. dammah\" and \"O. leucoryx\" – were compared with the standard karyotype of \"Bos taurus\". The number of autosomes in all karyotypes was 58. The X and Y chromosomes were conserved in all five species.\n\nThe scimitar oryx is a straight-horned antelope that stands just over at the shoulder. The males weigh and the females . The body measures from the head to the base of the tail. The tail is long and ends with a tuft. They are sexually dimorphic with males being larger than females.\n\nIts coat is white with a red-brown chest and black markings on the forehead and down the length of the nose. The coat reflects the sun's rays, while the black portions and the tip of the tongue provide protection against sunburn. The white coat helps to reflect the heat of the desert. Calves are born with yellow coats and lack distinguishing marks, which appear later in life. Their pelage changes to adult coloration at 3–12 months old.\n\nBoth sexes have horns, but those of the females are more slender. The horns are long, thin, and symmetrical; they curve backwards (a distinctive feature of this species) and can reach on both the males and the females. The horns are so thin that they can break easily. The female has four nipples. The large, spreading hooves are well adapted to allow these antelopes to walk on the sand of their dry habitats. A scimitar oryx can live as long as 20 years. At Smithsonian National Zoo, a female oryx died at 21, an exceptional age since females generally have a lifespan of about 15 years.\n\nThe scimitar oryx can be infected with cryptosporidiosis, a parasitic disease caused by protozoan parasites of genus \"Cryptosporidium\" in the phylum Apicomplexa. A study in 2004 revealed that \"C. parvum\" or similar organisms infected 155 mammal species, including the scimitar oryx. An analysis in 2005 found \"Cryptosporidium\" parasites in stool samples from 100 mammals, including the scimitar oryx. Oocysts of a new parasite, \"Eimeria oryxae\", have been discovered in the feces of a scimitar oryx from Zoo Garden in Riyadh. In France, \"Streptococcus uberis\" was isolated for the first time in an oryx. It had caused vegetative endocarditis in the animal, leading to fatal congestive heart failure.\n\nA 1983 study examined the blood serum chemistry of blood samples taken from the jugular veins of fifty scimitar oryx ranging from neonates to adults over 13 years old. The study concluded that the higher eosinophil counts of the juveniles and adults might reflect larger internal parasite burdens in them as compared with the neonates.\n\nThe scimitar oryx was a very sociable animal and traveled in herds of between two and forty individuals, generally, led by a dominant bull. This species once gathered in groups of several thousand for migration. During the wet season, they migrated north into the Sahara. Scimitar oryx are diurnal. In the cool early mornings and evenings, they rest under trees and shrubs, or if neither are available, they dig depressions in the soil with their hooves and rest there. Males fight often, but not for long and not violently. Predators, such as lions, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, golden jackals, vultures and Cape hunting dogs, mostly kill weak and young oryx.\n\nThe play activity of eight calves in captivity was observed in a 1983 study. Male calves played for longer than females calves did. Mixed sex play was usual; selection of partners depended on age, but not on sex or genetic relatedness. Results suggested that size dimorphism was an important factor responsible for sex differences in play.\n\nWith a metabolism that functions at the high temperatures prevalent in their habitats, scimitar oryx need less water for evaporation to help conduct heat away from the body, enabling them to go for long periods without water. They can allow their body temperature to rise to almost before beginning to perspire. In times of ample supply, oryx can use fluid loss through urination and feces to lower their body temperature to below at night, giving more time before reaching maximum body temperature the following day. They can tolerate high temperatures that would be lethal to most mammals. They have a network of fine blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the brain, passing close to the nasal passage and thus allowing the blood to cool by up to before reaching the brain, which is one of the most heat-sensitive organs of the body.\n\nThe habitat of scimitar oryx in the wild was steppe and desert, where they ate foliage, grass, herbs, shrubs, succulent plants, legumes, juicy roots, buds, and fruit. They can survive without water for nine to ten months because their kidneys prevent water loss from urination – an adaptation to desert habitats. They can get water from water-rich plants such as the wild melon (\"Citrullus colocynthis\") and \"Indigofera oblongifolia\" and from the leafless twigs of \"Capparis decidua\". In the night or early morning, they often search for plants such as \"Indigofera colutea\", which produce a hygroscopic secretion that fulfils water requirements. They eat tuft grasses such as \"Cymbopogon schoenanthus\" after it has rained, but they normally prefer more palatable grasses, such as \"Cenchrus biflorus\", \"Panicum laetum\" and \"Dactyloctenium aegyptium\". When the dry season begins, they feed on the seedpods of \"Acacia raddiana\", and during the dry season, they rely on perennial grasses of genera such as \"Panicum\" (especially \"Panicum turgidum\") and \"Aristida\", and browse plants such as \"Leptadenia\" species, \"Cassia italica\" and \"Cornulaca monacantha\".\n\nBoth males and females reach sexual maturity at 1.5 to 2 years of age. Births peak between March and October. Mating frequency is greater when environmental conditions are favorable. In zoos, males are sexually most active in autumn. The estrous cycle lasts roughly 24 days, and females experience an anovulatory period in spring. Periods between births are less than 332 days, showing that the scimitar oryx is polyestrous.\n\nCourting is done by means of a mating circle: the male and female stand parallel to one another, facing in opposite directions, and then circle around each other until the female allows the male to mount from behind. If the female is not ready to mate, she runs away and circles in the reverse direction. Pregnant females leave the herd for a week, give birth to the calf and conceive again during their postpartum estrus; thus they can produce a calf a year. Gestation lasts about nine months, after which a single calf is born, weighing . Twin births are very rare - only 0.7% of the births observed in one study. Both mother and calf return to the main herd within hours of the birth. The female separates herself from the herd for a few hours while she nurses the calf. Weaning starts at 3.5 months, and the young become fully independent at around 14 weeks old.\n\nThe scimitar oryx once inhabited grassy steppes, semideserts and deserts in a narrow strip of central north Africa (Niger and Chad). It was widespread on the fringes of the Sahara, mainly in subdesert steppe, the grassy zone between the real desert and the Sahel, an area characterized by an annual rainfall of . In 1936, a single herd of 10,000 oryx was seen in the steppe area of Chad. By the mid-1970s, Chad was home to more than 95% of the world population of this species.\n\nFollowing the Neolithic Subpluvial, around 7500 to 3500 BCE, the \"green Sahara\" became dry and the scimitar oryx's population began to decline due to a loss of suitable habitat. This was further exacerbated by humans who hunted the oryx for both its meat and horns. The northern population was already almost lost before the 20th century. With the introduction of horses and firearms during the 20th century, nomadic hunters were able to decimate populations. The decline of the southern population accelerated as Europeans began to settle the area and hunt them for meat, hides and horn trophies. French involvement in World War II and the Civil War in Chad that started in the 1960s are thought to have caused heavy decreases of the species through an increase in hunting for food. Roadkill, nomadic settlements near watering holes (the oryx's dry-season feeding places), introduction of cattle and firearms for easy hunting have also reduced numbers.\n\nThe IUCN lists the scimitar oryx as regionally extinct in Algeria, Burkina Faso, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, Tunisia and Western Sahara, and has assessed it as extinct in the wild since 2000. Reports of sightings in Chad and Niger remain unsubstantiated, despite extensive surveys carried out throughout Chad and Niger from 2001 to 2004 in an effort to detect antelopes in the Sahel and the Sahara. At least until 1985, 500 oryx were estimated to be surviving in Chad and Niger, but by 1988, only a few individuals survived in the wild.\n\nThere is now a global captive breeding program for the scimitar oryx. In 2015, about 1,750 captives were managed as part of breeding programs, up to 11,000 were kept in Texas farms and 4,000 were held in Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Reintroduction plans involve fenced-in herds in Bou-Hedma National Park (1985), Sidi Toui National Park (1999) and Oued Dekouk National Park (1999) in Tunisia; Souss-Massa National Park (1995) in Morocco; and Ferlo Faunal Reserve (1998) and Guembeul Wildlife Reserve (1999) in Senegal.\n\nChad is currently leading a project to reintroduce the species in Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Game Reserve, with the support of the Sahara Conservation Fund and the Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi. At 78,000 km – equivalent to the size of Scotland- Ouadi Rimé Ouadi Achim is one of the world’s largest protected areas. The first group was released at the beginning of 2016 in an acclimation enclosure and then fully released in the wild in the rainy season. That group was made of 21 animals, which by the beginning of 2017 had already produced a calf, the first birth in the wild for more than 20 years. A second group comprising six males and eight females was placed in the acclimation enclosure on 21 January 2017.\n\nIn ancient Egypt scimitar oryx were domesticated and tamed, possibly to be used as offerings for religious ceremonies or as food. They were called \"ran\" and bred in captivity. In ancient Rome they were kept in paddocks and used for coursing, and wealthy Romans ate them. The scimitar oryx was the preferred quarry of Sahelo-Saharan hunters. Its hide is of superior quality, and the king of Rio de Oro sent 1000 shields made of it to a contemporary in the Middle Ages. Since then, it has been used to make ropes, harnesses and saddlery.\n\nThe myth of the one-horned unicorn may have originated from sightings of injured scimitar oryx; Aristotle and Pliny the Elder held that the oryx was the unicorn's \"prototype\". From certain angles, the oryx may seem to have one horn rather than two, and given that its horns are made from hollow bone that cannot be regrown, if an oryx were to lose one of its horns, for the rest of its life it would have only one.\n\nIn 2015, Yellow Nose, an oryx that lives in Portland, Oregon escaped and startled hikers in Forest Park. The following day he was caught and returned home. Yellow Nose inspired a parody twitter account of the same name.\n\nReed Gleason's herd of oryx have escaped in the past as well. \n\n"}

{"id": "194085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194085", "title": "Sleeping Beauty", "text": "Sleeping Beauty\n\nSleeping Beauty (), or Little Briar Rose (), also titled in English as The Sleeping Beauty in the Woods, is a classic fairy tale which involves a beautiful princess, a sleeping enchantment, and a handsome prince. The tale was originally published by Charles Perrault. The version collected by the Brothers Grimm was an orally transmitted version of the original literary tale published by Perrault in \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\" in 1697. This in turn was based on \"Sun, Moon, and Talia\" by Italian poet Giambattista Basile (published posthumously in 1634), which was in turn based on one or more folk tales. The earliest known version of the story is found in the narrative \"Perceforest\", composed between 1330 and 1344.\n\nPerrault’s narrative is written in two parts, which some folklorists believe were originally separate tales, as they were in the Brothers Grimm's version, and were later joined together by Giambattista Basile and once more by Perrault.\n\nAt the christening of a king and queen's long-wished-for child, seven good fairies are invited to be godmothers to the infant princess. The fairies attend the banquet at the palace. Each fairy is presented with a golden plate and drinking cups adorned with jewels. Soon after, an old fairy enters the palace and is seated with a plate of fine china and a crystal drinking glass. This old fairy is overlooked because she has been within a tower for many years and everyone had believed her to be deceased. Six of the other seven fairies then offer their gifts of beauty, wit, grace, dance, song, and goodness to the infant princess. The evil fairy is very angry about having been forgotten, and as her gift, enchants the infant princess so that she will one day prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The seventh fairy, who hasn't yet given her gift, attempts to reverse the evil fairy's curse. However, she can only do so partially. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a deep sleep for 100 years and be awakened by a kiss from a king's son. This is her gift of protection.\n\nThe King orders that every spindle and spinning wheel in the kingdom to be destroyed, to try to save his daughter from the terrible curse. Fifteen or sixteen years pass and one day, when the king and queen are away, the Princess wanders through the palace rooms and comes upon an old woman, spinning with her spindle. The princess, who has never seen anyone spin before, asks the old woman if she can try the spinning wheel. The curse is fulfilled as the princess pricks her finger on the spindle and instantly falls into a deep sleep. The old woman cries for help and attempts are made to revive the princess. The king attributes this to fate and has the Princess carried to the finest room in the palace and placed upon a bed of gold and silver embroidered fabric. The king and queen kiss their daughter goodbye and depart, proclaiming the entrance to be forbidden. The good fairy who altered the evil prophecy is summoned. Having great powers of foresight, the fairy sees that the Princess will awaken to distress when she finds herself alone, so the fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. The fairy also summons a forest of trees, brambles and thorns that spring up around the castle, shielding it from the outside world and preventing anyone from disturbing the Princess. they kiss a prince shalom\n\nA hundred years pass and a prince from another family spies the hidden castle during a hunting expedition. His attendants tell him differing stories regarding the castle until an old man recounts his father's words: within the castle lies a beautiful princess who is doomed to sleep for a hundred years until a king's son comes and awakens her. The prince then braves the tall trees, brambles and thorns which part at his approach, and enters the castle. He passes the sleeping castle folk and comes across the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Struck by the radiant beauty before him, he falls on his knees before her. The enchantment comes to an end by a kiss and the princess awakens and converses with the prince for a long time. Meanwhile, the rest of the castle awakens and go about their business. The prince and princess are later married by the chaplain in the castle chapel.\n\nAfter wedding the Princess in secret, the Prince continues to visit her and she bears him two children, Aurore (Dawn) and Jour (Day), unbeknown to his mother, who is of an ogre lineage. When the time comes for the Prince to ascend the throne, he brings his wife, children, and the talabutte (\"Count of the Mount\").\n\nThe Ogress Queen Mother sends the young Queen and the children to a house secluded in the woods and directs her cook to prepare the boy with \"Sauce Robert\" for dinner. The kind-hearted cook substitutes a lamb for the boy, which satisfies the Queen Mother. She then demands the girl but the cook this time substitutes a young goat, which also satisfies the Queen Mother. When the Ogress demands that he serve up the young Queen, the latter offers to slit her throat so that she may join the children that she imagines are dead. While the Queen Mother is satisfied with a hind prepared with \"Sauce Robert\" in place of the young Queen, there is a tearful secret reunion of the Queen and her children. However, the Queen Mother soon discovers the cook’s trick and she prepares a tub in the courtyard filled with vipers and other noxious creatures. The King returns in the nick of time and the Ogress, her true nature having been exposed, throws herself into the tub and is fully consumed. The King, young Queen, and children then live happily ever after.\n\nIn Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, \"Sun, Moon, and Talia\", the sleeping beauty is named Talia. By asking wise men and astrologers to predict her future after her birth, her father who is a great lord learns that Talia will be in danger from a splinter of flax. The splinter later causes what appears to be Talia's death; however, it is later learned that it is a long, deep sleep. After Talia falls into deep sleep, she is seated on a velvet throne and her father, to forget his misery of what he thinks is her death, closes the doors and abandons the house forever. One day, while a king is walking by, one of his falcons flies into the house. The king knocks, hoping to be let in by someone, but no one answers and he decides to climb in with a ladder. He finds Talia alive but unconscious, and \"...gathers the first fruits of love.\" Afterwards, he leaves her in the bed and goes back to his kingdom. Though Talia is unconscious, she gives birth to twins — one of whom keeps sucking her fingers. Talia awakens because the twin has sucked out the flax that was stuck deep in Talia's finger. When she wakes up, she discovers that she is a mother and has no idea what happened to her. One day, the king decides he wants to go see Talia again. He goes back to the palace to find her awake and a mother to his twins. He informs her of who he is, what has happened, and they end up bonding. After a few days, the king has to leave to go back to his realm, but promises Talia that he will return to take her to his kingdom.\n\nWhen he arrives back in his kingdom, his wife hears him saying \"Talia, Sun, and Moon\" in his sleep. She bribes and threatens the king's secretary to tell her what is going on. After the queen learns the truth, she pretends she is the king and writes to Talia asking her to send the twins because he wants to see them. Talia sends her twins to the \"king\" and the queen tells the cook to kill the twins and make dishes out of them. She wants to feed the king his children; instead, the cook takes the twins to his wife and hides them. He then cooks two lambs and serves them as if they were the twins. Every time the king mentions how good the food is, the queen replies, \"Eat, eat, you are eating of your own.\" Later, the queen invites Talia to the kingdom and is going to burn her alive, but the king appears and finds out what’s going on with his children and Talia. He then orders that his wife be burned along with those who betrayed him. Since the cook actually did not obey the queen, the king thanks the cook for saving his children by giving him rewards. The story ends with the king marrying Talia and living happily ever after.\n\nThere are earlier elements that contributed to the tale. In the medieval courtly romance \"Perceforest\" (published in 1528), a princess named Zellandine falls in love with a man named Troylus. Her father sends him to perform tasks to prove himself worthy of her, and while he is gone, Zellandine falls into an enchanted sleep. Troylus finds her and impregnates her in her sleep; when their child is born, he draws from her finger the flax that caused her sleep. She realizes from the ring he left her that the father was Troylus, who later returns to marry her.\n\nEarlier influences come from the story of the sleeping Brynhild in the \"Volsunga saga\" and the tribulations of saintly female martyrs in early Christian hagiography conventions. It was, in fact, the existence of Brynhild that persuaded the Brothers Grimm to include the story in later editions of their work rather than eliminate it, as they did to other works they deemed to be purely French, stemming from Perrault's work. Their decision was odd on one point, at least, since in none of the Teutonic myths, meaning the Poetic and Prose Eddas or Volsunga Saga, is their sleeper awakened with a kiss, a fact Jacob Grimm would certainly have known, who wrote an important and encyclopedic volume on German mythology.\n\nThe second half, in which the princess and her children are almost put to death, but instead hidden, may have been influenced by Genevieve of Brabant.\n\nThe princess's name has varied from one adaptation to the other. In \"Sun, Moon, and Talia\", she is named Talia (Sun and Moon being her twin children). She has no name in Perrault's story but her daughter is called \"Aurore\". The Brothers Grimm named her \"Briar Rose\" in their 1812 collection. Tchaikovsky's ballet and Disney's version named her Princess Aurora; however, in the Disney version, she is also called \"Briar Rose\" in her childhood, when she is being raised incognito by the good fairies. John Stejean named her \"Rosebud\" in TeleStory Presents.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm included a variant \" Little Briar Rose\" in their collection (1812). Their version ends when the prince arrives to wake Sleeping Beauty, unlike the stories of Basile and Perrault. Some translations of the Grimms' tale give the princess the name \"Rosamond\". The brothers considered rejecting the story on the grounds that it was derived from Perrault's version, but the presence of the Brynhild tale convinced them to include it as an authentically German tale. Still, it is the only known German variant of the tale, and Perrault's influence is almost certain.\n\nThe Brothers Grimm also included, in the first edition of their tales, a fragmentary fairy tale, \"The Evil Mother-in law\". This story begins with the heroine a married mother of two children, as in the second part of Perrault's tale, and her mother-in-law attempting to eat her and the children. Unlike Perrault's version, the heroine suggested an animal be substituted in the dish, and ends with the heroine's worry that she cannot keep her children from crying and getting the mother-in-law’s attention. Like many German tales showing French influence, it appeared in no subsequent edition.\n\nItalo Calvino included a variant in \"Italian Folktales\". The cause of her sleep is an ill-advised wish by her mother. As in \"Pentamerone\", the prince rapes her in her sleep and her children are born. He retains the element that the woman who tries to kill the children is the king's mother, not his wife, but adds that she does not want to eat them herself, but instead serves them to the king. His version came from Calabria, but he noted that all Italian versions closely followed Basile's.\n\nBesides \"Sun, Moon, and Talia\", Basile included another variant of this Aarne-Thompson type, \"The Young Slave\". The Grimms also included a second, more distantly related one, \"The Glass Coffin\".\n\nJoseph Jacobs noted that the figure of the Sleeping Beauty was in common between this tale and the Gypsy tale \"The King of England and his Three Sons\", in his \"More English Fairy Tales\".\n\nThe hostility of the king's mother to his new bride is repeated in the fairy tale \"The Six Swans\", and also features \"The Twelve Wild Ducks\", where she is modified to be the king's stepmother. However, these tales omit the attempted cannibalism.\n\nSome folklorists have analyzed \"Sleeping Beauty\" as indicating the replacement of the lunar year (with its thirteen months, symbolically depicted by the thirteen fairies) by the solar year (which has twelve, symbolically the invited fairies). The basic elements of the story can also be interpreted as a nature allegory: the princess represents nature, the wicked fairy godmother is winter, who puts the Court to sleep with pricks of frost until the prince (spring) cuts away the brambles with his sword (a sunbeam) to allow the Sun to awaken sleeping princess (nature).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27339088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27339088", "title": "Torture Memos", "text": "Torture Memos\n\nA set of legal memoranda known as the \"Torture Memos\" were drafted by John Yoo as Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the United States and signed in August 2002 by Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee, head of the Office of Legal Counsel of the United States Department of Justice. They advised the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States Department of Defense, and the president on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques: mental and physical torment and coercion such as prolonged sleep deprivation, binding in stress positions, and waterboarding, and stated that such acts, widely regarded as torture, might be legally permissible under an expansive interpretation of presidential authority during the \"War on Terror\".\n\nFollowing accounts of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal in Iraq, one of the memos was leaked to the press in June 2004. Jack Goldsmith, then head of the Office of Legal Counsel, had already withdrawn the Yoo memos and advised agencies not to rely on them. After Goldsmith was forced to resign because of his objections, Attorney General Ashcroft issued a one paragraph opinion re-authorizing the use of torture. Then in December 2004, another head of OLC reaffirmed the original legal opinions.\n\nIn May 2005, the CIA requested new legal opinions about the interrogation techniques it was using. The OLC issued three memos that month, signed by Steven G. Bradbury, ruling on the legality of the authorized techniques if agents followed certain constraints. In addition to these memos issued by the OLC to executive agencies, internal memos were written related to the use of torture in interrogation of detainees; for instance, in 2002 and 2003, Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, signed several memos authorizing \"Special Interrogation Plans\" for specific detainees held at Guantanamo Bay in an attempt to gain more information from them.\n\nAll of these memoranda have been the focus of considerable controversy over executive power, government practices, and the treatment of detainees during the Bush administration. They were repudiated by President Barack Obama on January 22, 2009, shortly after he took office.\n\nThe term \"torture memos\" was originally used to refer to three documents prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel at the United States Department of Justice and signed in August 2002: \"Standards of Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. sections 2340-2340A\" and \"Interrogation of al Qaeda\" (both drafted by Jay Bybee), and an untitled letter from John Yoo to Alberto Gonzales.\n\nSince the initial revelation of these documents, other communications related to the use of torture to coerce or intimidate detainees during the Bush administration have been divulged. These include a December 2, 2002, internal Department of Defense memo signed by Donald Rumsfeld, then Secretary of Defense, authorizing 17 techniques in a \"Special Interrogation Plan\" to be used against the detainee Mohammed al-Qahtani; a March 13, 2003, legal opinion written by John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel, DOJ, and issued to the General Counsel of Defense five days before the U.S. invasion of Iraq started, concluding that federal laws related to use of torture and other abuse did not apply to agents interrogating foreigners overseas; and other DOD internal memos authorizing techniques for specific military interrogations of certain individual detainees.\n\nIn 2005, Alberto Gonzales testified before Congress that the CIA sought the 2002 opinion after having captured Abu Zubaydah in 2002, who was then believed to be a significant al-Qaeda figure who could provide important information to U.S. efforts to constrain and prevent terrorism. They were anxious to get as much information from Zubaydah as fast as possible. Questions by CIA officers over which tactics could be used on the detainee had spurred writing the torture memo, which is reflected in the language of the memo; \"You have asked for this advice in the course of conducting interrogations of Abu Zubaydah.\" The memo's author, John Yoo, acknowledged the memo authorized the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" used by the CIA in Zubaydah's interrogation. Yoo told an interviewer in 2007, \"there was an urgency to decide so that valuable intelligence could be acquired from Abu Zubaydah, before further attacks could occur.\"\n\nJay Bybee, then Assistant U.S. Attorney General and head of the OLC, addressed a memorandum to Alberto Gonzales, then Counsel to the President, dated August 1, 2002, titled \"Standards for Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340-2340A\". He was responding to the president's reported request for a legal opinion on the U.N. Convention Against Torture and 18 U.S.C. section 2340 and the interrogation of al Qaeda operatives.\n\nThis is the primary \"torture memo\", which defines the Department of Justice's (DOJ) interpretation of torture. It is relied upon heavily by the subsequent \"torture memos\". It discusses the language of the torture statute (18 U.S.C. sections 2340-2340A) in detail in order to derive its definition of torture, states that \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading\" treatment is not torture according to that statute; and examines \"possible defenses that would negate any claim that certain interrogation methods violate the statute\". It concludes that torture is only: extreme acts according to the Convention Against Torture; that severe pain (a requisite for this definition of torture) is \"serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death\"; that prolonged mental harm is harm that must last for \"months or even years\"; that \"prosecution under Section 2340A may be barred because enforcement of the statute would represent an unconstitutional infringement of the President's authority to conduct war\"; and that \"under the current circumstances, necessity or self-defense may justify interrogation methods that might violate Section 2340A.\"\n\nPart one, in which the text and history of the U.S. torture statute (18 U.S.C. 2340-2340A) is examined, mainly addresses Bybee's interpretation of the definition of torture, including the definition of severe physical and mental pain or suffering.\n\nIn the first section, the memorandum states that the statute requires specific intent (the convention only requires general intent, but the \"specific intent\" language is found in the U.S. ratification reservation), and in citing case law, precedent states that specific intent means that \"the infliction of [severe] pain must be the defendant's precise objective\" and reminds the reader that \"general intent\" requires only actions that would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of the statute. The article concludes that, \"even if the defendant knows that severe pain will result from his actions, if causing such harm is not his objective, he lacks the requisite specific intent\". It suggests that a jury would likely act contrary to law (out of misunderstanding) by finding such an individual guilty regardless.\n\nIn the second section, the memo admits difficulty in finding any clear definition for the \"severe pain or suffering\" required by the torture statute (which is also required by the UN Convention). After examining the definition provided in various dictionaries, it concludes that \"pain\" is synonymous with \"suffering\" (\"it is difficult to conceive of such suffering that would not involve severe physical pain\"), and, selecting among the many definitions, the memo proposes that severe pain must be difficult to endure (some definitions quoted in the memo define severe pain as \"inflicting discomfort\"). In searching for a reference to the term in other U.S. statutes and law, it quotes from a health care law that defines \"emergency condition\", but merely mentions \"severe pain\" in passing. That statutory subsection, 8 U.S.C. section 1395w-22(d)(3)(B), defines an emergency condition as a condition \"manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that [one] ... could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in placing the health of the individual ... in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part\".\n\nThe memorandum concludes with a narrow definition of torture, that its \"severe pain\" must \"necessarily\" be pain associated with \"death, organ failure, or serious impairment of body functions\". It also states that the statute requires \"prolonged mental harm\" to accompany mental or physical pain, and that \"prolonged\" means a duration of months or years.\n\nThe memo discusses the Convention Against Torture (which the memo calls the \"Torture Convention\") and concludes that the convention makes a distinction between torture and \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment\", and that therefore torture is \"only the most extreme acts\", which the memo concludes, together with the ratifying reservations of the United States, confirms the interpretation of torture found in part one. It concludes that torture does not include \"other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" because such language is found in a different article than the definition of torture, and because it appears that the convention does not intend to criminalize such action, but instead discourage it. The memo examines the ratification history, and cites U.S. case law stating that the executive branch's interpretation of the treaty \"is to be accorded the greatest weight in ascertaining a treaty's intent and meaning\". It finds in the congressional record that the Reagan administration understood torture to be \"at the extreme end of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment\", and that such treatment or punishment, which is not torture, to be \"the cruel, unusual, and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States\".\n\nThe understanding of the George H. W. Bush administration, which ratified the Convention, was different from that of the Reagan administration. It failed to promote any language regarding torture to be only \"extremely cruel\" behavior resulting in \"excruciating and agonizing\" pain, and instead, filed a reservation that quoted the text of the U.S. torture statute. The memorandum states that, on the basis of the conclusions reached in part one, \"there was little difference between these two understandings and ... the further definition of mental pain or suffering merely sought remove [sic] the vagueness created by concept of 'agonizing and excruciating mental pain.\" The memo quotes a legal adviser of the Department of State, who stated that, \"no higher standard was intended by the Reagan administration understanding than was present in the Convention or the Bush understanding\".\n\nThe memo examines the negotiating history of the Convention, and finds that the U.S. originally proposed the terms \"extremely severe pain or suffering\", and that the U.K. proposed the terms, \"extreme pain or suffering rather than ... severe pain or suffering\", and states that \"[u]ltimately, in choosing the phrase \"severe pain\", the parties concluded that this phrase \"sufficient[ly] ... convey[ed] the idea that only acts of a certain gravity shall ... constitute torture\", rather than all acts that are inhumane and degrading. It concludes that the \"ratification history and negotiating history [of the convention] all confirm that Section 2340A reaches only the \"most heinous\" acts\", and thus implies that this confirms its definition of torture in part one, section two of this memo.\n\nPart three summarizes various techniques within the case law to outline the kind of conduct that the courts have previously found to be torture. The memo states that, through an analysis of those cases, \"courts are likely to take a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, and will look to an entire course of conduct, to determine whether certain acts will violate Section 2340A.\" After reviewing a number of torture-related cases in the U.S., in which victims were subjected to beatings, burning, electric shocks, and the threat of such actions, it states that, \"we believe that interrogation techniques would have to be similar to these in their extreme nature and in the type of harm caused to violate the law.\" It does discuss one case in which the federal court states that an isolated incident, such as a single blow to the stomach, is sufficient alone to be torture, but the memo states that this is in error, because \"a single blow does not reach the requisite level of severity [to constitute torture].\" It later says that this conclusion is \"based on our interpretation of the criminal statute\" found in section two of part one of this memo. Although the memo states that nowhere in the case law can a clear interpretation or definition of torture be found, because the cases it did find were all regarding extreme acts, it concludes that this confirms the memo's definition of torture.\n\nPart four examines international case law regarding torture, and concludes that while there are many methods that might be cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, \"they do not produce pain or suffering of the necessary intensity to meet the definition of torture.\" It discusses two cases:\n\nPart five of the memo analyzes constitutional law as to whether the statute passed by Congress infringes on the powers of the president to conduct war, and concludes that it is unconstitutional. It states specifically that the nation was \"in the middle of a war in which the nation [had] already suffered a direct attack\", and that limiting interrogations would encroach on the president's ability to prevent future attacks. The memo summarizes the terrorist threat from al Qaeda, including the September 11 attacks, and states that interrogation of al Qaeda operatives led to the stopping of Jose Padilla's planned attack. It provides case law supporting its position of the executive branch to conduct war. It also argues that prosecution of individuals following orders from the president, even if in violation of Section 2340A, should not be possible, since it would impinge upon the president's powers as commander-in-chief.\n\nPart six of the memo is titled \"Defenses\" and concludes that \"under the current circumstances, necessity or self-defense may justify interrogation methods that might violate Section 2340A.\" This is provided as a fail safe argument, because the author believes that, according to his view in part five of the memo, prosecution would probably be impossible.\n\nIn the conclusion section of the memorandum, Bybee summarizes what is viewed as the most important conclusions of the memorandum, namely the definition of torture, the possible unconstitutionality of the torture statute as applied to the president, and the legal justification of necessity or self-defense for any acts that might be torture.\n\nJay Bybee addressed a memorandum to John A. Rizzo, then the acting General Counsel of the CIA, dated August 1, 2002, in response to the CIA's reported request for legal opinion on 18 U.S.C. section 2340 (the torture statute) as applied to the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah. There was much administration opposition to releasing this memorandum to the public, and the first release was almost completely redacted. It summarizes the facts regarding Abu Zubaydah and his resistance to interrogation, as related by the CIA. It summarizes the various methods of physical and psychological coercion to be used by the CIA against Zubaydah (see next section, Part I for details). It discusses the background of Zubaydah and the possible mental effects from such abuse, the background of the consultant to be assisting, and the details of the proposed coercive actions. It then applies the U.S. torture statute (18 U.S.C. section 2340-2340A) to each of these proposed actions. It concludes that none of these methods, individually or simultaneously would be considered torture according to law.\n\nThe first part says that the advice provided in this memorandum applies only to the facts at hand regarding Abu Zubaydah, and that the conclusions of the memorandum may change given different facts. Those facts, according to the top secret memorandum, are that Abu Zubaydah was being held by the United States, and that, \"[t]he interrogation team is certain that he has additional information that he refuses to divulge\" regarding terrorist groups in the U.S. or Saudi Arabia planning attacks in the U.S. or overseas. It does not give any specifics or note what makes this conclusion certain. The memorandum states that it appears that the suspect has grown accustomed to their interrogation techniques, and refers to the threat of a possible attack in the United States by unknown individuals. Without further discussion, the fact summary concludes that the \"high level of threat [the reader] believe[s] now exists\" is why advice regarding further techniques is being sought. Continuing to summarize the facts, the memorandum summarizes the characteristics of the professionals present during the proposed interrogation techniques, and summarizes those coercive methods. It states that the purpose of these methods will be to \"convince Zubaydah that the only way he can influence his surrounding environment is through cooperation\". The memorandum describes in detail each of the techniques proposed as generally used, including attention grasp, walling, facial hold, insult slap, cramped confinement (large and small and with and without an insect), wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, and waterboarding. It clarifies that a medical expert will always be present \"to prevent severe physical or mental harm[.]\"\n\nPart two of this memorandum goes into great detail how the techniques described in part one will be applied in Abu Zubaydah's case. It describes the CIA practices, and reminds them how those practices are applied \"to ensure that no prolonged mental harm would result from the use of these proposed procedures\". This section reviews how no appreciable harm has ever resulted from the application of these techniques on U.S. military personnel, and that these techniques have the approval of the government medical experts who train in the application and subversion of these techniques. It summarizes the psychological profile provided of the subject, including his involvement in high-level terrorist activities [Note: as believed at the time, but found to be wrong] with al Qaeda and his background training operatives in resistance to interrogation, as well as his radical thinking, such as the fact that he \"has stated during interviews that he thinks of any activity outside of jihad as \"silly\". It states that after substantial research of the individual's background, behavior and journal entries, interrogators believe he does not suffer from any psychological disorders or disturbances. This section concludes by emphasizing the potential value of the information he could provide, as well as his likely strong ability to resist standard interrogation techniques.\n\nThis section provides legal analysis of the U.S. anti-torture law (18 U.S.C. section 2340-2340A) and the application of each of the proposed techniques in this particular situation. After summarizing the law, it analyses the elements of the offense of torture (inflicting severe pain or suffering), and the specific (or criminal) intent required by the statute for the offense.\n\nJohn Yoo, then Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel, addressed a memorandum to Alberto Gonzales, then the counsel to the president, dated August 1, 2002, in response to Gonzales' reported request for legal opinion on whether interrogation methods used on al Qaeda operatives would be in violation of the U.N. Convention Against Torture, and whether such actions could be the basis for prosecution in the International Criminal Court. The letter is intended to supplement the memorandum sent to Gonzales the same day by Jay Bybee, to which it occasionally refers. The letter concludes that the interpretation of the Department of Justice of 18 U.S.C. s. 2340, which enacted into U.S. law the Convention Against Torture, does not conflict with the Convention because the United States recorded its reservations upon ratification. It also concludes that \"actions taken as part of the interrogation ... cannot fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC, although it would be impossible to control the actions of a rogue prosecutor or judge.\" The letter explains the Department of Justice's interpretation of s. 2340-2340A, their interpretation of the Convention Against Torture as applied to the United States and the status of the U.S. reservations, and explains its position on the possibility of prosecution by the ICC.\n\nIn the explanation of the definition of torture according to 18 U.S.C. section 2340, it emphasizes the need for the pain to be severe, although it does not attempt to define what \"severe pain or suffering\" means. It also emphasizes that the individual inflicting such pain must have \"specific intention to inflict severe pain or suffering\". The letter explains section 2340's definition of \"severe mental pain or suffering\", and reminds the reader of the need for \"prolonged mental harm\".\n\nAs the memo quotes from the definition of torture in the Convention Against Torture, it compares that definition to the one found in the U.S. statute, and analyzes the effect of the ratification reservation of the U.S. to the Convention. That reservation was mainly regarding Article One of the Convention, which defines torture, but it also states that the U.S. refuses to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice regarding conformity to the Convention. The memo notes that in the reservation, the U.S. added language of \"specific intent\" (as opposed to the \"general intent\" in the Convention), and it explained what was meant by mental pain or suffering (as in the U.S. statute). Commenting on the specificity of the reservation and statute regarding mental pain or suffering, the memo says, \"this understanding ensured that mental torture would rise to a severity comparable to that required in the context of physical torture.\" The memo explains treaty law, which states that the U.S. is bound to the treaty only as modified by the reservation, and points out that the language of the reservation is \"nearly identical\" to that of 18 U.S.C. s. 2340. Therefore, it states, if the interrogation conduct did not violate the U.S. statute, it would also not violate the U.S. obligations under the Convention. While the letter states there is little substantive difference between the definition of torture in the text of the statute (or reservation) and in the Convention, most of the material in this part of the memo is dedicated to explaining why the reservation to the Convention is valid and cannot be overturned. The memo closes this section reminding the reader of the refusal of the U.S. to accept the jurisdiction of the ICC, and that, \"[a]lthough the Convention creates a [c]ommittee to monitor compliance, [the committee] can only conduct studies and has no enforcement powers.\"\n\nIn discussing the possible prosecution by the ICC, the memo states that the U.S. did not ratify the necessary treaty for such jurisdiction (the Rome Statute). The memo further argues that even if the ICC were to claim jurisdiction, \"interrogation of an al Qaeda operative could not constitute a crime under the Rome Statute\", since it would not involve the \"widespread and systematic attack directed against any civilian population\" and would not be considered a war crime. Yoo writes that, in his opinion, \"[t]he United States' campaign against al Qaeda is an attack on a non-state terrorist organization, not a civilian population.\" He also reiterates President W. Bush's \"assertion\" that \"neither members of the al Qaeda terrorist network nor Taliban soldiers were entitled to the legal status of prisoners of war under the [Geneva Convention],\" and therefore planned interrogation methods would not constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention, or war crime. This interpretation of the Geneva Convention was sent in memos, despite objections by attorneys and the Secretary of the Department of State, on January 9, 2002, January 22, 2002, February 1, 2002, and again on February 7, 2002.\n\nYoo concludes the letter by stating, \"It is possible that an ICC official would ignore the clear limitations imposed by the Rome Statute, or at least disagree with the President's interpretation of [the Geneva Convention]. Of course, the problem of the 'rogue prosecutor' is not limited to questions about the interrogation of al Qaeda operatives, but is a potential risk for any number of actions that have been undertaken during the Afghanistan campaign... We cannot predict the political actions of international institutions.\"\n\nAfter Bybee was confirmed in his appointment as a federal judge on March 13, John Yoo was the acting head of the OLC. He wrote a memo to the DOD on March 14, 2003, concluding that \"federal laws against torture, assault and maiming would not apply to the overseas interrogation of terror suspects\". This was five days before the Iraq War. The legal opinion had been requested by William J. Haynes, General Counsel of the Department of Defense. Yoo was acting head of OLC for several months before Jack Goldsmith was approved for the position. In 2008, leaders of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees concluded that the memo was used by the DOD to \"justify harsh interrogation practices on terror suspects at Guantánamo Bay\" and the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse.\n\nAfter Bybee resigned from the Department of Justice in March 2003 for a federal judgeship in Nevada, Attorney General Ashcroft vetoed the White House's choice of John Yoo as his successor. Yoo was acting head of OLC for several months.\n\nJack Goldsmith was appointed to succeed Bybee as head of the Office of Legal Counsel and took office in October 2003. A professor at the University of Chicago Law School before government service, he had previously been legal adviser to William Haynes, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense.\n\nIn the spring of 2004, the Abu Ghraib prisoner scandal broke into the news, and in June 2004, the Bybee memo was leaked to the press. Based on his review of the Torture Memos, Goldsmith concluded that they were legally defective and had to be withdrawn. In his book \"The Terror Presidency\" (2007), Goldsmith called them \"cursory and one-sided legal arguments\". Goldsmith says he had decided to revoke what the CIA had been calling its \"golden shield\" against prosecution six months before the abuses at Abu Ghraib were revealed. He was at work on the problem when the scandal and the leak of the memo precipitated the final decision.\n\nWhen Goldsmith brought his decision to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and Vice Presidential Counsel David Addington, Goldsmith wrote, Gonzales seemed \"puzzled and slightly worried\", while Addington \"was just plain mad\". Goldsmith submitted his resignation at the same time.\n\nReflecting afterward on the Torture Memos as a cautionary tale, Goldsmith wrote in his 2007 memoir:\nHow could this have happened? How could OLC have written opinions that, when revealed to the world weeks after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke, made it seem as though the administration was giving official sanction to torture, and brought such dishonor on the United States, the Bush administration, the Department of Justice, and the CIA? How could its opinions reflect such bad judgement, be so poorly reasoned, and have such terrible tone?... The main explanation is fear [of a new attack]. Fear explains why OLC pushed the envelope. And in pushing the envelope, OLC took shortcuts in its opinion-writing procedures.\n\nGoldsmith's tenure at OLC was ten months. He resigned he said, for several reasons but the main one was that, as a result of withdrawing the Torture Memos, \"important people inside the administration had come to question my ... reliability.\" He had been unable to finish replacement legal opinions, so that task fell to his successors. But, later that year, an opinion was issued by his successor at the OLC, that changed the very narrow definition of torture from the original legal opinions of the Bush administration on this topic.\n\nThe superseding OLC opinion of 30 December 2004, \"Definition of Torture Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340–2340A\" written by Daniel Levin, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, rolled back the narrow definition of torture in the memos. He noted, \"[w]hile we have identified various disagreements with the August 2002 Memorandum, we have reviewed this Office's prior opinions addressing issues involving treatment of detainees and do not believe that any of their conclusions would be different under the standards set forth in this memorandum.\"\n\nIn 2005, CIA lawyers reviewed videotapes of interrogations of detainees. Increasingly concerned about the legal implications of their practices, John Rizzo, then Acting General Counsel of the agency, requested the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, for new legal opinions on the use of these techniques. Steven G. Bradbury as head of the OLC signed three memos issued in May 2005 advising the CIA that a limited set of interrogation techniques could be used, according to certain constraints. The permissible techniques included waterboarding, walling, stress positions, striking a prisoner, exposure to extreme temperatures, and forced sleep deprivation of up to 180 hours (7½ days), including multiple techniques when used in combination.\n\nThe OLC said that the techniques did not violate the Convention Against Torture, as ratified by the United States in 1994. That year, the CIA destroyed the videotapes of the interrogations.\n\nBradbury authored an additional memo dated July 2007, seeking to reconcile the interrogation techniques with new legal developments, including \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\", as well as intervening legislation such as the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the December 2005 Detainee Treatment Act. The 2007 memo provided legal authorization and OLC approval for a more limited set of actions for use when interrogating high-value detainees. This approval encompassed six listed techniques, including temporary food deprivation (no less than 1,000 Calories/day), sleep deprivation by being forced to hold a \"standing position for as many as four days\", and several types of physical striking.\n\nNear the end of the Bush administration, Bradbury signed two memoranda for the files, explaining that during his tenure, OLC had determined that certain legal propositions previously stated in ten OLC opinions issued between 2001 and 2003 concerning executive power in the War on Terror no longer reflected the views of OLC. His memos said the 10 earlier opinions \"should not be treated as authoritative for any purpose\" and further explained that some of the underlying opinions had been withdrawn or superseded and that \"caution should be exercised\" by the Executive Branch \"before relying in other respects\" on the other opinions that had not been superseded or withdrawn. In the 15 January 2009 \"Memorandum Regarding Status of Certain OLC Opinions Issued in the Aftermath of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001,\" Steven G. Bradbury, Acting head of the OLC from 2005 to January 20, 2009, during the Bush administration, stated, and further that \n\nTwo days after taking office on January 20, President Barack Obama by Executive Order, released January 22, 2009, rescinded all the previous OLC guidance about \"detention or the interrogation of detained individuals\" and directed that no government agency may rely on \"any\" of the OLC opinions on that topic between 2001 and 2009. He had declared shortly before taking office \"under my administration the United States does not torture.\"\n\nIn April 2009, President Obama released redacted versions of the Torture Memos. Shortly afterward, he said that his administration would prosecute neither the authors of the memos nor those CIA or DOD personnel or contractors who carried out the acts described in them in the belief they were legal.\n\nHowever, in August 2009, the Justice Department announced that those who had exceeded approved \"techniques\" might face prosecution. The investigation by DOJ of such actions continued into 2010.\n\nBybee signed the legal memorandum that defined \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (including waterboarding), which are now regarded as torture by the Justice Department, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, medical experts, intelligence officials, military judges, and American allies. In 2009, a Spanish judge considered conducting a war crime investigation against Bybee and five other Bush administration figures, but the Attorney General of Spain recommended against it. Bybee was, however, investigated by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (see below).\n\nJack Goldsmith, who succeeded Bybee as head of the Office of Legal Counsel, withdrew the torture memos weeks before resigning in June 2004. He later said he was \"astonished\" by the \"deeply flawed\" and \"sloppily reasoned\" legal analysis in the memos.\n\nDavid Luban, a law professor at Georgetown Law School, testified before Congress on May 13, 2009, stating that the memos were \"an ethical train wreck\" and had been drafted to \"reverse engineer\" a defense for illegal actions already committed.\n\nIn 2009, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility reviewed the work of the principal author John Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley; and signatory Jay Bybee, now a federal judge, to determine whether the advice given \"was consistent with the professional standards that apply to Department of Justice attorneys\". John Yoo was later harshly criticized by the Department of Justice for failing to cite legal precedent and existing case law when drafting his memos. In particular, the 2009 DOJ report chastises Yoo for failing to cite \"Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,\" a seminal case on the powers of the Executive in times of war. In its 261-page final report, the OPR concluded that the legal opinions that justified waterboarding and other interrogation tactics for use on Al Qaeda suspects in United States custody amounted to professional misconduct. The report said that Yoo in particular \"knowingly failed to provide a thorough, objective, and candid interpretation of the law\", and recommended referral of him to the Bar for disciplinary action.\n\nHowever, in a memorandum dated January 5, 2010, to Attorney General Eric Holder, David Margolis, the top career Justice department lawyer who advises political appointees, countermanded the recommended referral. While Margolis was careful to avoid \"an endorsement of the legal work\", which he said was \"flawed\" and \"contained errors more than minor\", he concluded that Yoo had exercised \"poor judgment\", which did not rise to the level of \"professional misconduct\" sufficient to authorize OPR to refer its findings to the state bar disciplinary authorities.\n\nOn February 26, 2010, \"The New York Times\" reported that the Justice Department had revealed that numerous e-mail files were missing in relation to the decisions of that period and had not been available to the OPR investigation. These included most of Yoo's e-mail records, as well as a \"month's worth of e-mail files from the summer of 2002 for Patrick Philbin, another political appointee Justice Department lawyer who worked on the interrogation opinions. Those missing e-mail messages came during a period when two of the critical interrogation memos were being prepared.\"\n\nThe August 1, 2002, memo has been widely criticized, including within the Bush administration. Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, strongly opposed the invalidation of the Geneva Conventions, while Alberto Mora, General Counsel of the U.S. Navy, campaigned internally against what he saw as the \"catastrophically poor legal reasoning\" and dangerous extremism of Yoo's legal opinions.\n\nIn 2009, Philip D. Zelikow, the former State Department legal adviser to Condoleezza Rice, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee,\nIt seemed to me that the OLC interpretation of U.S. Constitutional Law in this area was strained and indefensible. I could not imagine any federal court in America agreeing that the entire CIA program could be conducted and it would not violate the American Constitution.\n\nZelikow alleged that Bush administration officials not only ignored his memos on the subject, but attempted to destroy them.\nIn June 2004, the memo was rescinded by Jack Goldsmith, who had been appointed in October 2003 to lead the OLC. He had earlier advised agencies not to follow the three August 2002 memos. He called the memo \"deeply flawed\" and \"sloppily reasoned\". In discussing the issues in 2007, after publishing his memoir about his service in the Bush administration, Goldsmith asserted that he \"hadn't determined the underlying techniques were illegal\". He continues, \"I wasn't in the position to make an independent ruling on the other techniques. I certainly didn't think they were unlawful, but I couldn't get an opinion that they were lawful either.\"\n\nIn 2004, the journalist Robert Scheer asked if Bybee's appointment to a lifetime job as a federal judge was reward for writing the torture memo. In his column in the \"Los Angeles Times\" Scheer wrote, \"Was it as a reward for such bold legal thinking that only months later Bybee was appointed to one of the top judicial benches in the country?\" He wrote, \"The Bybee memo is not some oddball exercise in moral relativism but instead provides the most coherent explanation of how this Bush administration came to believe that to assure freedom and security at home and abroad, it should ape the tactics of brutal dictators.\"\n\nIn 2005, testimony to Congress, Harold Hongju Koh, dean of the Yale Law School and former Assistant Secretary for Human Rights in the Bill Clinton administration, called the 1 August 2002 memo \"perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal opinion I have ever read\", which \"grossly overreads the president's constitutional power\". John Dean, the former Nixon White House Counsel involved in the Watergate scandal, concluded in 2005 that the memo was tantamount to evidence of a war crime. He noted that, after the memo was leaked, \"the White House hung Judge Bybee out to dry.\"\n\nOn March 9, 2006, after emerging from a closed talk at Harvard Law School sponsored by the student chapter of the Federalist Society, Bybee was confronted by around thirty-five protesters.\n\nIn October 2007, Malcolm Nance wrote an entry on the Small Wars Journal Blog named \"Waterboarding is Torture... Period.\" Nance was a US Navy counterterrorism specialist and testified before a House judiciary subcommittee concerning US torture practices. He may not have a law degree or wield political power, but he has \"personally led, witnessed and supervised waterboarding of hundreds of people\" during his stint as a Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) School instructor. The final paragraph of his entry asks that \"Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle... stand up for American values and clearly specify that coercive interrogation using the waterboard is torture and, except for limited examples of training our service members and intelligence officers, it should be stopped completely and finally - oh, and this time without a Presidential signing statement reinterpreting the law\" \n\nDouglas Kmiec, a law professor at Pepperdine University, has stated that ultimately the memo \"caused no long-term legal damage because it was redrafted and is not legally binding\".\n\nIn March 2009, Baltasar Garzón, a Spanish judge who has considered international war crimes charges against other high-profile figures, considered whether to allow charges to be filed against Bybee and five other former officials of the George W. Bush administration. On April 17, 2009, Spain's Attorney General Cándido Conde-Pumpido issued a non-binding recommendation against the investigation.\nOn April 19, 2009, an editorial in \"The New York Times\" said that Bybee is \"unfit for a job that requires legal judgment and a respect for the Constitution\" and called for Bybee's impeachment from the federal bench. Friends of Bybee have indicated that the jurist privately regrets the controversial memo's inadequacies and growing notoriety. In response to the criticism, Bybee told \"The New York Times\" that his signing of the controversial opinions was \"based on our good-faith analysis of the law\". In addressing reports of his regrets, he said in the same article that he would have done some things differently, such as clarifying and sharpening the analysis of some of his answers, to help the public better understand in retrospect the basis for his conclusions.\n\nIn an April 25, 2009, \"Washington Post\" article, Patrick J. Leahy (D-VT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is quoted: \"If the Bush administration and Mr. Bybee had told the truth, he never would have been confirmed,\" adding that \"the decent and honorable thing for him to do would be to resign [from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit]\". Four days later, Senator Leahy sent a letter to Judge Jay S. Bybee inviting him to testify before the Judiciary Committee in connection with his role in writing legal memoranda authorizing the use of harsh interrogation techniques while serving as the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC). Bybee \"declined to respond\" to the letter\".\n\nJudge Betty Fletcher, a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for 30 years until her death in 2012, is quoted from a statement regarding Bybee:\nHe is a moderate conservative, very bright and always attentive to the record and the applicable law. I have not talked to other judges about his memo on torture, but to me it seems completely out of character and inexplicable that he would have signed such a document.\n\n\n"}

Furthermore, the court found, when advising the Minister, the Board is bound to apply principles of openness and transparency. Failure on their part to consider all the relevant and material information prior to advising the Minister is also subject to judicial review, as provided for in section 6(2) of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act.\n\nThere were serious shortcomings, the court held, in the investigation the Board carried out and consequently in the memorandum it presented to the Minister. The Board did not investigate, and its memorandum did not contain information (or, at least, information which was material to the Minister and the recommendation) about the individual shareholders of the entities that constituted both the applicant and the third respondent.\n\nThe Minister and the National Lotteries Board failed to consider or take into account mandatory and material information prescribed by section 13 of the Lotteries Act, namely the shareholders in the entities which constitute the applicant.\n\nThe decision to award the licence to Gidani was accordingly set aside.\n\n\n"}
