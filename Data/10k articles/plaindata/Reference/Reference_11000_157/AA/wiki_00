{"id": "239564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239564", "title": "Communist International", "text": "Communist International\n\nThe Communist International (Comintern), known also as the Third International (1919–1943), was an international organization that advocated world communism. The Comintern resolved at its Second Congress to \"struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state\". The Comintern had been preceded by the 1916 dissolution of the Second International.\n\nThe Comintern held seven World Congresses in Moscow between 1919 and 1935. During that period, it also conducted thirteen Enlarged Plenums of its governing Executive Committee, which had much the same function as the somewhat larger and more grandiose Congresses. The Comintern was officially dissolved by Joseph Stalin in 1943 to avoid antagonizing its allies the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nWhile the differences had been evident for decades, World War I proved the issue that finally divided the revolutionary and reformist wings of the workers' movement. The socialist movement had been historically antimilitarist and internationalist and therefore opposed workers serving as cannon fodder for the bourgeois governments at war, this was especially true since the Triple Alliance comprised two empires while the Triple Entente gathered France and Britain into an alliance with Russia. Karl Marx's \"Communist Manifesto\" had stated that \"the working class has no country\" and exclaimed \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\". Massive majorities voted in favor of resolutions for the Second International to call upon the international working class to resist war if it were declared.\n\nNevertheless, within hours of the declarations of war almost all the socialist parties of the combatant states announced their support for the war. The only exceptions were the socialist parties of the Balkans and the British Labour Party. To Vladimir Lenin's surprise, even the Social Democratic Party of Germany voted in favor of war credits. The assassination of French Socialist Jean Jaurès on 31 July 1914 killed the last hope of peace by removing one of the few leaders who possessed enough influence on the international socialist movement to prevent it from segmenting itself along national lines and supporting governments of national unity.\n\nSocialist parties in neutral countries mostly supported neutrality rather than total opposition to the war. On the other hand, during the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference Lenin organized opposition to the imperialist war into a movement that became known as the Zimmerwald Left and published the pamphlet \"Socialism and War\" in which he called all socialists who collaborated with their national governments social chauvinists, i.e. socialists in word, but chauvinists in deed. The Zimmerwald Left produced no practical advice for how to initiate socialist revolt.\n\nThe International divided into a revolutionary left and a reformist right, with a center group wavering between those poles. Lenin condemned much of the center as social pacifists for several reasons, including their voting for war credits despite opposing the war. Lenin's term social pacifist aimed in particular at Ramsay MacDonald, leader of the Independent Labour Party in Britain, who opposed the war on grounds of pacifism, but did not actively resist it.\n\nDiscredited by its passivity towards world events, the Second International dissolved in the middle of the war in 1916. In 1917, Lenin published the \"April Theses\" which openly supported a revolutionary defeatism, i.e. the Bolsheviks pronounced themselves in favor of the defeat of Russia which would permit them to move directly to the stage of a revolutionary insurrection.\n\nThe victory of the Russian Communist Party in the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 was felt throughout the world and an alternative path to power to parliamentary politics was demonstrated. With much of Europe on the verge of economic and political collapse in the aftermath of the carnage of World War I, revolutionary sentiments were widespread. The Russian Bolsheviks headed by Lenin believed that unless socialist revolution swept Europe, they would be crushed by the military might of world capitalism just as the Paris Commune had been crushed by force of arms in 1871. The Bolsheviks believed that this required a new international to foment revolution in Europe and around the world.\n\nThe Comintern was founded at a Congress held in Moscow on 2–6 March 1919 against the backdrop of the Russian Civil War. There were 52 delegates present from 34 parties. They decided to form an Executive Committee with representatives of the most important sections and that other parties joining the International would have their own representatives. The Congress decided that the Executive Committee would elect a five-member bureau to run the daily affairs of the International. However, such a bureau was not formed and Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Christian Rakovsky later delegated the task of managing the International to Grigory Zinoviev as the Chairman of the Executive. Zinoviev was assisted by Angelica Balabanoff, acting as the secretary of the International, Victor L. Kibaltchitch and Vladmir Ossipovich Mazin. Lenin, Trotsky and Alexandra Kollontai presented material. The main topic of discussion was the difference between bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nThe following parties and movements were invited to the Founding Congress:\n\nOf these, the following attended (see list of delegates of the 1st Comintern congress): the communist parties of Russia, Germany, German Austria, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Estonia, Armenia, the Volga German region; the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party (the opposition), Balkan Revolutionary People's of Russia; Zimmerwald Left Wing of France; the Czech, Bulgarian, Yugoslav, British, French and Swiss Communist Groups; the Dutch Social-Democratic Group; Socialist Propaganda League and the Socialist Labor Party of America; Socialist Workers' Party of China; Korean Workers' Union, Turkestan, Turkish, Georgian, Azerbaijanian and Persian Sections of the Central Bureau of the Eastern People's and the Zimmerwald Commission.\n\nZinoviev served as the first Chairman of the Comintern's Executive Committee from 1919 to 1926, but its dominant figure until his death in January 1924 was Lenin, whose strategy for revolution had been laid out in \"What Is to Be Done?\" (1902). The central policy of the Comintern under Lenin's leadership was that communist parties should be established across the world to aid the international proletarian revolution. The parties also shared his principle of democratic centralism (freedom of discussion, unity of action), namely that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold in a disciplined fashion whatever decision was made. In this period, the Comintern was promoted as the general staff of the world revolution.\n\nAhead of the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in July through August 1920, Lenin sent out a number of documents, including his Twenty-one Conditions to all socialist parties. The Congress adopted the 21 conditions as prerequisites for any group wanting to become affiliated to the International. The 21 Conditions called for the demarcation between communist parties and other socialist groups and instructed the Comintern sections not to trust the legality of the bourgeois states. They also called for the build-up of party organisations along democratic centralist lines in which the party press and parliamentary factions would be under the direct control of the party leadership.\n\nRegarding the political situation in the colonized world, the Second Congress of the Communist International stipulated that a united front should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry and national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. Amongst the twenty-one conditions drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis which stipulated that all communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Notably, some of the delegates opposed the idea of alliance with the bourgeoisie and preferred giving support to communist movements in these countries instead. Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary M. N. Roy, who attended as a delegate of the Mexican Communist Party. The Congress removed the term bourgeois-democratic in what became the 8th condition.\n\nMany European socialist parties divided because of the adhesion issue. The French Section of the Workers International (SFIO) thus broke away with the 1920 Tours Congress, leading to the creation of the new French Communist Party (initially called French Section of the Communist International – SFIC). The Communist Party of Spain was created in 1920, the Communist Party of Italy was created in 1921, the Belgian Communist Party in September 1921 and so on.\n\nWritings from the Third Congress, held in June–July 1921, talked about how the struggle could be transformed into civil war when the circumstances were favorable and openly revolutionary uprisings. The Fourth Congress, held in November 1922, at which Trotsky played a prominent role, continued in this vein.\n\nThe Dungan commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment Magaza Masanchi attended the Third Congress.\n\nDuring this early period, known as the First Period in Comintern history, with the Bolshevik Revolution under attack in the Russian Civil War and a wave of revolutions across Europe, the Comintern's priority was exporting the October Revolution. Some communist parties had secret military wings. One example is the M-Apparat of the Communist Party of Germany. Its purpose was to prepare for the civil war the Communists believed was impending in Germany and to liquidate opponents and informers who might have infiltrated the party. There was also a paramilitary organization called the Rotfrontkämpferbund.\n\nThe Comintern was involved in the revolutions across Europe in this period, starting with the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader Béla Kun. Soon, an official Terror Group of the Revolutionary Council of the Government was formed, unofficially known as Lenin Boys. The next attempt was the March Action in Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train from Halle to Leipzig. After this failed, the Communist Party of Germany expelled its former chairman Paul Levi from the party for publicly criticising the March Action in a pamphlet, which was ratified by the Executive Committee of the Communist International prior to the Third Congress. A new attempt was made at the time of the Ruhr crisis in spring and then again in selected parts of Germany in the autumn of 1923. The Red Army was mobilized, ready to come to the aid of the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where 200–300 Communists attacked police stations, but were quickly defeated. In 1924, there was a failed coup in Estonia by the Estonian Communist Party.\n\nIn 1924, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party joined Comintern. At first, in China both the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang were supported. After the definite break with Chiang Kai-shek in 1927, Joseph Stalin sent personal emissaries to help organize revolts which at this time failed.\n\nLenin died in 1924 and the next year saw a shift in the organization's focus from the immediate activity of world revolution towards a defence of the Soviet state. In that year, Stalin took power in Moscow and upheld the thesis of socialism in one country, detailed by Nikolai Bukharin in his brochure \"Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?\" (April 1925). The position was finalized as the state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article \"On the Issues of Leninism\". Stalin made the party line clear: \"An internationalist is one who is ready to defend the USSR without reservation, without wavering, unconditionally; for the USSR it is the base of the world revolutionary movement, and this revolutionary movement cannot be defended and promoted without defending the USSR\".\n\nThe dream of a world revolution was abandoned after the failures of the Spartacist uprising in Germany and of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and the failure of all revolutionary movements in Europe such as in Italy, where the fascist \"squadristi\" broke the strikes and quickly assumed power following the 1922 March on Rome. This period up to 1928 was known as the Second Period, mirroring the shift in the Soviet Union from war communism to the New Economic Policy.\n\nAt the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern in July 1924, Zinoviev condemned Marxist philosopher Georg Lukács's \"History and Class Consciousness\", published in 1923 after his involvement in Béla Kun's Hungarian Soviet Republic and Karl Korsch's \"Marxism and Philosophy\". Zinoviev himself was dismissed in 1926 after falling out of favor with Stalin. Bukharin then led the Comintern for two years until 1928, when he too fell out with Stalin. Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov headed the Comintern in 1934 and presided until its dissolution.\n\nGeoff Eley summed up the change in attitude at this time as follows: By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924 [...] the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of \"Bolshevization\" was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single approved model of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of \"internal rectification\" began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, so that by the later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a hard-faced drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928.\n\nThe Comintern was a relatively small organization, but it devised novel ways of controlling communist parties around the world. In many places, there was a communist subculture, founded upon indigenous left-wing traditions which had never been controlled by Moscow. The Comintern attempted to establish control over party leaderships by sending agents who bolstered certain factions, by judicious use of secret funding, by expelling independent-minded activists and even by closing down entire national parties (such as the Communist Party of Poland in 1938). Above all, the Comintern exploited Soviet prestige in sharp contrast to the weaknesses of local parties that rarely had political power.\n\nCommunist front organizations were set up to attract non-members who agreed with the party on certain specific points. Opposition to fascism was a common theme in the popular front era of the mid 1930s. The well-known names and prestige of artists, intellectuals and other fellow travelers were used to advance party positions. They often came to the Soviet Union for propaganda tours praising the future. Under the leadership of Zinoviev, the Comintern established fronts in many countries in the 1920s and after. To coordinate their activities, the Comintern set up international umbrella organizations linking groups across national borders, such as the Young Communist International (youth), Profintern (trade unions), Krestintern (peasants), International Red Aid (humanitarian aid), Sportintern (organized sports) and more. Front organizations were especially influential in France, which in 1933 became the base for communist front organizer Willi Münzenberg. These organizations were dissolved in the late 1930s or early 1940s.\n\nIn 1928, the Ninth Plenum of the Executive Committee began the so-called Third Period, which was to last until 1935. The Comintern proclaimed that the capitalist system was entering the period of final collapse and therefore all communist parties were to adopt an aggressive and militant ultra-left line. In particular, the Comintern labelled all moderate left-wing parties social fascists and urged the communists to destroy the moderate left. With the rise of the Nazi movement in Germany after 1930, this stance became controversial.\n\nThe Sixth World Congress also revised the policy of united front in the colonial world. In 1927, the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese Communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The Congress did make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swarajist Party and the Egyptian Wafd Party on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable ally yet not a direct enemy. The Congress called on the Indian Communists to utilize the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists.\n\nThe Seventh and last Congress of the Comintern was held between 25 July 25 and 20 August 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were delivered by Palmiro Togliatti, Wilhelm Pieck and Dmitry Manuilsky. The Congress officially endorsed the popular front against fascism. This policy argued that communist parties should seek to form a popular front with all parties that opposed fascism and not limit themselves to forming a united front with those parties based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern. In France and Spain, it would have momentous consequences with Léon Blum's 1936 election which led to the Popular Front government.\n\nStalin's purges of the 1930s affected Comintern activists living in both the Soviet Union and overseas. At Stalin's direction, the Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise. One of its leaders, Mikhail Trilisser, using the pseudonym Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin, was in fact chief of the foreign department of the Soviet OGPU (later the NKVD). At Stalin's orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the Great Purge. Several hundred German communists and antifascists who had either fled from Nazi Germany or were convinced to relocate in the Soviet Union were liquidated and more than a thousand were handed over to Germany. Fritz Platten died in a labor camp and the leaders of the Indian (Virendranath Chattopadhyaya or Chatto), Korean, Mexican, Iranian and Turkish communist parties were executed. Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only Khorloogiin Choibalsan survived. Leopold Trepper recalled these days: \"In house, where the party activists of all the countries were living, no-one slept until 3 o'clock in the morning. [...] Exactly 3 o'clock the car lights began to be seen [...] we stayed near the window and waited [to find out], where the car stopped\".\n\nAt the start of World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention, arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, much like World War I had been, but when the Soviet Union itself was invaded on 22 June 1941 the Comintern changed its position to one of active support for the Allies. On 15 May 1943, a declaration of the Executive Committee was sent out to all sections of the International, calling for the dissolution of Comintern. The declaration read: The historical role of the Communist International, organized in 1919 as a result of the political collapse of the overwhelming majority of the old pre-war workers' parties, consisted in that it preserved the teachings of Marxism from vulgarisation and distortion by opportunist elements of the labor movement.\n\nBut long before the war it became increasingly clear that, to the extent that the internal as well as the international situation of individual countries became more complicated, the solution of the problems of the labor movement of each individual country through the medium of some international centre would meet with insuperable obstacles.\n\nConcretely, the declaration asked the member sections to approve: To dissolve the Communist International as a guiding centre of the international labor movement, releasing sections of the Communist International from the obligations ensuing from the constitution and decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International.\n\nAfter endorsements of the declaration were received from the member sections, the International was dissolved. Usually, it is asserted that the dissolution came about as Stalin wished to calm his World War II allies (particularly Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill) and keep them from suspecting the Soviet Union of pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in other countries.\n\nThe Research Institutes 100 and 205 worked for the International and later were moved to the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded at roughly the same time that the Comintern was abolished in 1943, although its specific duties during the first several years of its existence are unknown.\n\nFollowing the June 1947 Paris Conference on Marshall Aid, Stalin gathered a grouping of key European communist parties in September and set up the Cominform, or Communist Information Bureau, often seen as a substitute to the Comintern. It was a network made up of the communist parties of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia (led by Josip Broz Tito, it was expelled in June 1948). The Cominform was dissolved in 1956 following Stalin's 1953 death and the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile the communist parties of the world no longer had a formal international organization, they continued to maintain close relations with each other through a series of international forums. In the period directly after the Comintern's dissolution, periodical meetings of communist parties were held in Moscow. Moreover, \"World Marxist Review\", a joint periodical of the communist parties, played an important role in coordinating the communist movement up to the break-up of the Socialist Bloc in 1989–1991.\n\nSeveral international organizations were sponsored by the Comintern in this period:\n\nThe OMS (, \"otdel mezhdunarodnoy svyazi\", ), also known in English as the International Liaison Department (1921–1939), was the most secret department of the Comintern. It has also been translated as the Illegal Liaison Section and Foreign Liaison Department.\n\nOne historian has described: The OMS was the Comintern's department for the coordination of subversive and conspiratorial activities. Some of its functions overlapped with those of the main Soviet intelligence agencies, the OGPU and the GRU, whose agents sometimes were assigned to the Comintern. But the OMS maintained its own set of operations and had its own representative on the central committees of each Communist party abroad. In 2012, historian David McKnight stated: The most intense practical application of the conspiratorial work of the Comintern was carried out by its international liaison service, the OMS. This body undertook clandenstine courier activities and work which supported underground political activities. These included the transport of money and letters, the manufacture of passports and other false documents and technical support to underground parties, such as managing \"safe houses\" and establishing businesses overseas as cover activities.\n\n\nLists:\n\nInternationals:\n\n\n\n"}

The complete work comprises 51 parts and 3 supplements, containing 3,240 copper engraved plates. The original plan was to cover all plants, including bryophytes, lichens and fungi native to crown lands of the Danish king, that is Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Oldenburg-Delmenhorst and Norway with its North Atlantic dependencies Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. However, changes were made due to territorial cessations during the period of publication. After 1814, when the double monarchy of Denmark–Norway was abolished, very few Norwegian plants were included, and similar changes were seen after 1864, when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were ceded. However, in the mid-19th-century era of Scandinavism, the \"Nordiske Naturforskermøde\" in Copenhagen proposed to make Flora Danica a Scandinavian work. Thus, three supplementary volumes were issued, containing the remaining Norwegian plants and the more important plants only occurring in Sweden.\n\nPublishers/editors through time:\nIn 1790 the Danish Crown Prince Frederik ordered a dinner set made decorated with exact copies of the plates of \"Flora Danica\".

{"id": "38330532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38330532", "title": "Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana", "text": "Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana\n\nFlora of the Venezuelan Guayana is a multivolume flora describing the vascular plants of the Guayana Region of Venezuela, encompassing the three states south of the Orinoco: Amazonas, Bolívar, and Delta Amacuro. Initiated by Julian Alfred Steyermark in the early 1980s, it was completed after his death under the guidance of Paul E. Berry, Kay Yatskievych, and Bruce K. Holst. The nine volumes were published between 1995 and 2005 by Timber Press and Missouri Botanical Garden Press. The project brought together more than 200 botanists from around the world and was \"the first effort to produce a comprehensive inventory and identification guide for the plants of such an extensive region of northern South America\".\n\nThe first volume, written primarily by Italian ecologist Otto Huber, is an introduction to the geography, ecology, botanical history and conservation of the Venezuelan Guayana, and includes two fold-out maps of the region (one vegetation and one topographical, both 1:2,000,000 scale). The subsequent eight volumes cover the known plant families of the area in alphabetical order, each treating around 1000–1300 species. Ferns and fern allies are covered in the first part of volume 2, with the remainder of that volume, and the rest of the flora, devoted to seed plants (generally following the Cronquist system for flowering plants). Both native and naturalised species are included. Around half of all species are illustrated with black-and-white line drawings by Venezuelan artist Bruno Manara. Species accounts include non-exhaustive synonymies, and vernacular names are occasionally given.\n\n\nIn his \"Guide to Standard Floras of the World\", David G. Frodin cited \"Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana\" as an example of a \"[g]ood modern, relatively 'concise' conventional flora\".\n\nThe introductory volume has been singled out as both a useful addition to the flora and a valuable work in its own right. Writing in the \"Edinburgh Journal of Botany\", S. Bridgewater considered the first volume \"an excellent way of starting a Flora\" and \"a highly desirable book for anyone with a love of botany and South America\". He added that the prose \"is both unpretentious and accessible, whilst being thoroughly researched\". These views were echoed in the \"Handbook of Latin American Studies\", where the volume is described as \"authoritative and superbly illustrated\" and \"[m]uch broader than [its] title suggests\".\n\nR. Atkinson, who reviewed volume 2 for the \"Edinburgh Journal of Botany\", considered the book's dichotomous keys \"concise and easy to use\" and the illustrations \"clear although sometimes rather diagrammatic\". More serious criticism was levelled at the alphabetical arrangement of families, which Atkinson considered the work's \"biggest drawback\". He continued: \"It would be more valuable if a systematic approach had been taken to avoid the absurdity of closely related families being placed (under an evolutionarily arbitrary, alphabetical system) in different volumes.\"\n\nReviewing volume 7 in \"Economic Botany\", Neil A. Harriman wrote that the entire flora was \"lavishly produced, with a great many line drawings to aid in identification\". He added: \"I think it indicates how carefully these volumes are done, that weedy little \"Plantago major\" gets just as much space, and just as fine an illustration, as any of the rare, exotic, endemic orchid species do.\" Harriman also noted the comprehensive literature citations, which he found \"most helpful\". Although rather conservative, Harriman considered the species synonymies adequate.\n\n"}

{"id": "2028217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028217", "title": "Inland Empire (film)", "text": "Inland Empire (film)\n\nInland Empire is a 2006 film written and directed by David Lynch. The cast includes such Lynch regulars as Laura Dern, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, and Grace Zabriskie, as well as Jeremy Irons, Karolina Gruszka, Peter J. Lucas, Krzysztof Majchrzak, and Julia Ormond. There are also brief appearances by a host of additional actors, including Nastassja Kinski, Laura Harring, Terry Crews, Mary Steenburgen, and William H. Macy. The voices of Harring, Naomi Watts, and Scott Coffey are included in excerpts from Lynch's 2002 \"Rabbits\" online project.\n\nReleased with the tagline \"A Woman in Trouble\", the film follows the fragmented and nightmarish events surrounding a Hollywood actress (Dern) who begins to take on the personality of a character she plays in a film. An international co-production between the United States, France, and Poland, the film was completed over a three-year period and shot primarily in Los Angeles and Poland. The process marked several firsts for Lynch: the film was shot without a finished screenplay, instead being largely developed on a scene-by-scene basis; and it was shot entirely in low resolution digital video by Lynch himself using a handheld Sony camcorder rather than traditional film stock. The film's editing, score and sound design were also helmed by Lynch, with pieces by a variety of other musicians also featured. The title borrows its name from a residential area in Southern California.\n\n\"Inland Empire\" premiered in Italy at the Venice Film Festival on 6 September 2006. It received generally positive but polarized reviews from critics, with attention centering on its challenging and surrealist elements. It was named the second-best film of 2007 (tied with two others) by \"Cahiers du cinéma\", and listed among \"Sight & Sound\"s \"thirty best films of the 2000s\", as well as \"The Guardian\"s \"10 most underrated movies of the decade\".\n\nThe film opens to the sound of a gramophone playing \"Axxon N.\", \"the longest-running radio play in history\". Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the \"Lost Girl\", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girl's television displays a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are laugh track responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout \"Inland Empire\".\n\nThe main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), who has applied for a comeback role as a character named Sue in a film entitled \"On High in Blue Tomorrows\". The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman (Grace Zabriskie) claiming to be her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, \"caused evil to be born\". The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, \"discovers a palace\". The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler (Ian Abercrombie) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek (Peter J. Lucas) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.\n\nSome time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk (Justin Theroux) receive an interview on a talk show. The host (Diane Ladd) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them responds negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart (Jeremy Irons). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled \"47\". Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.\n\nImmersed in her character, while the film is being shot, \"Sue\" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / \"Billy\". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked \"Axxon N.\", and enters. It leads her back to the soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the room—she herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy. Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, \"Billy\".\n\nAt this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's \"Smithy\" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.\n\nPrior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billy's wife Doris (Julia Ormond) tells a policeman that she had been hypnotized to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in Łódź during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, \"Who is she?\" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and \"say whether you've known me before\". In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her childhood sexual abuse, disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be \"good with animals\". There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced she's being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.\n\nFinally, Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard, and is startled to see her doppelgänger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her \"no more blue tomorrows\". Off-camera, Kingsley yells \"Cut!\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.\n\nAs the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only \"On High in Blue Tomorrows\"—encompassing some of the subplots of the film—but events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked \"Axxon N.\". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.\n\nNikki flees into a nearby room—Room 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.\n\nNikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski, and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, \"Sweet!\" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone's \"Sinner Man\" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat.\n\n\"Inland Empire\" is the first Lynch feature to be completely shot in digital video; it was shot with a hand-held Sony DSR-PD150 by Lynch himself. Lynch has stated that he will no longer use film to make motion pictures. He explained his preference, stating that the medium gives one \"more room to dream\", and more options in post-production. Much of the project was shot in Łódź, Poland, with local actors, such as Karolina Gruszka, Krzysztof Majchrzak, Leon Niemczyk, Piotr Andrzejewski and artists of the local circus Cyrk Zalewski. Some videography was also done in Los Angeles, and in 2006 Lynch returned from Poland to complete filming. Lynch then edited the final results in Final Cut Pro in his home office over six months. He did not work with frequent collaborator and editor Mary Sweeney because \"there wasn't a real organized script to go by and no one knew what was going on except\" him.\n\nLynch shot the film without a complete screenplay. Instead, he handed each actor several pages of freshly written dialogue each day. In a 2005 interview, he described his feelings about the shooting process:\n\"I've never worked on a project in this way before. I don't know exactly how this thing will finally unfold ... This film is very different because I don't have a script. I write the thing scene by scene and much of it is shot and I don't have much of a clue where it will end. It's a risk, but I have this feeling that because all things are unified, this idea over here in that room will somehow relate to that idea over there in the pink room.\"\n\nInterviewed at the Venice Film Festival, Laura Dern admitted that she did not know what \"Inland Empire\" was about or the role she was playing, but hoped that seeing the film's premiere at the festival would help her \"learn more\". Justin Theroux has also stated that he \"couldn't possibly tell you what the film's about, and at this point I don't know that David Lynch could. It's become sort of a pastime—Laura [Dern] and I sit around on set trying to figure out what's going on.\" In an NPR interview, Dern recounted a conversation she had with one of the movie's new producers, Jeremy Alter. He asked if Lynch was joking when he requested a one-legged woman, a monkey and a lumberjack by 3:15. \"Yeah, you're on a David Lynch movie, dude,\" Dern replied. \"Sit back and enjoy the ride.\" Dern reported that by 4 p.m. they were shooting with the requested individuals.\n\nLynch financed much of the production from his own resources, with longtime artistic collaborator and ex-wife Mary Sweeney producing. The film was also partially financed by the French production company StudioCanal, which had provided funding for three previous Lynch films. StudioCanal wanted to enter the film in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Instead, it premiered at Italy's Venice Film Festival on 6 September 2006, where David Lynch also received the Golden Lion lifetime achievement award for his \"contributions to the art of cinema\". The film premiered in the United States on 8 October 2006 at the New York Film Festival. The film received a limited release in the US beginning on 15 December 2006; distribution was handled by the specialist company 518 Media.\n\nLynch hoped to distribute the film independently, saying that with the entire industry changing, he thought he would attempt a new form of distribution as well. He acquired the rights to the DVD and worked out a deal with StudioCanal in an arrangement that allowed him to distribute the film himself, through both digital and traditional means. A North American DVD release occurred on 14 August 2007. Among other special features, the DVD included a 75-minute featurette, \"More Things That Happened\", which compiled footage elaborating on Sue's marriage to Smithy, her unpleasant life story, the Phantom's influence on women, and the lives of the prostitutes on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nLynch contributed a number of his own compositions to the film's soundtrack, marking a departure from his frequent collaborations with composer Angelo Badalamenti. His pieces range from minimalist ambient music to more pop-oriented tracks such as \"Ghost of Love\". Polish composer Marek Zebrowski wrote music for the film and acted as music consultant. The soundtrack includes the following musical pieces:\n\n\nWhen asked about \"Inland Empire\", Lynch refrained from explaining the film, responding that it is \"about a woman in trouble, and it's a mystery, and that's all I want to say about it.\" When presenting screenings of the digital work, Lynch sometimes offers a clue in the form of a quotation from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:\n\nWe are like the spider. We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream. This is true for the entire universe.\n\nNew York Film Festival official Richard Peña summarized the film as \"a plotless collection of snippets that explore themes Lynch has been working on for years\", including \"a Hollywood story about a young actress who gets a part in a film that might be cursed; a story about the smuggling of women from Eastern Europe; and an abstract story about a family of people with rabbit heads sitting around in a living room.\" \"The Guardian\" critic Peter Bradshaw called the film \"a meditation on the unacknowledged and unnoticed strangeness of Hollywood and movie-making in general\", adding that Lynch \"establishes a bizarre series of worm-holes between the worlds of myth, movies and reality.\" Critic Mark Fisher wrote that the film \"often seems like a series of dream sequences floating free of any grounding reality, a dream without a dreamer [in which] no frame is secure, all attempts at embedding fail\", but argued that \"it is the \"film\" that is mad, not the characters in it ... it is Hollywood itself that is dreaming\". He also commented that \"to see Lynch's worlds captured on digital video makes for a bizarre short-circuiting: as if we are witnessing a direct feed from the unconscious\".\n\nDennis Lim of \"Slate\" described the film as \"a three-hour waking nightmare that derives both its form and its content from the splintering psyche of a troubled Hollywood actress\", and commented on Lynch's use of digital video, describing it as \"the medium of home movies, viral video, and pornography—the everyday media detritus we associate more with ... intimate or private viewing experiences than communal ones\", adding that the film \"progresses with the darting, associative logic of hyperlinks\". Scholar Anne Jerslev has argued that the film \"constitutes multiple and fractured modes of perception in a world of digital screens\". Other critics have argued that the film features \"formal similarities with a website's hyperlinked layering of screens/windows, constantly disclosing new worlds from new points of view\", but according to theorist Steven Shaviro \"it also builds on cinematic codes, even as it deconstructs them\". The scholar Delorme indicated that the film is about adultery, but in a way that Lynch \"avoid[s] a chronological unfolding of the scenes and situations provoked by the adultery\", but rather \"superimpose[s] them instead in as many scenarios developing from the potentials of the adultery\", so that \"[t]he narrative is constructed on strange characters brought together by a similar terror\".\n\nThe film was screened at several film festivals around the world, most notably the Venice Film Festival in Italy, New York Film Festival in New York, United States, the Thessaloniki Film Festival in Greece, Camerimage Film Festival in Poland, Fajr International Film Festival in Iran, International Film Festival Rotterdam in the Netherlands and the Festival Internacional de Cine Contemporáneo de la Ciudad de México in México City, Mexico.\n\n\"Inland Empire\" was released and distributed by Ryko to the United States on 14 August 2007. It was released on 20 August in the United Kingdom, 4 October in Belgium and the Netherlands, with distribution by A-Film and 6 August 2008 in Australia, with distribution by Madman Entertainment.\n\n518 Media released \"Inland Empire\" to two theaters in the United States on 6 December 2006, grossing a total of $27,508 over its opening weekend. It later expanded to its widest release of fifteen nationwide theaters, ultimately grossing $861,355 at American box office. In other countries outside the United States, \"Inland Empire\" grossed $3,176,222—bringing the film's worldwide total gross to $4,037,577.\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 72, based on 24 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\" and holds a 72% \"fresh\" rating on review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes. The site's consensus states that the film is \"typical David Lynch fare: fans of the director will find \"Inland Empire\" seductive and deep. All others will consider the heady surrealism impenetrable and pointless.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" classified \"Inland Empire\" as \"fitfully brilliant\" after the Venice Film Festival screening. Peter Travers, the film critic for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote, \"My advice, in the face of such hallucinatory brilliance, is that you hang on.\" \"The New Yorker\" was one of the few publications to offer any negative points about the film, calling it a \"trenchant, nuanced film\" that \"quickly devolves into self-parody\". Jonathan Ross, presenter of the BBC programme \"Film 2007\", described it as \"a work of genius ... I think\". Damon Wise of \"Empire\" magazine gave it five stars, calling it \"A dazzling and exquisitely original riddle as told by an enigma\" and Jim Emerson (editor of RogerEbert.com) gave it 4 stars and praised it: \"When people say \"Inland Empire\" is Lynch's \"Sunset Boulevard\", Lynch's \"Persona\" or Lynch's \"8½\", they're quite right, but it also explicitly invokes connections to Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\", Jean-Luc Godard's \"Pierrot le Fou\", Buñuel and Dalí's \"Un Chien Andalou\", Maya Deren's LA-experimental \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" (a Lynch favorite) and others\". However, Carina Chocano of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"the film, which begins promisingly, disappears down so many rabbit holes (one of them involving actual rabbits) that eventually it just disappears for good\".\n\nDern received almost universal acclaim for her performance, with many reviews describing it as her finest to date. Lynch attempted to promote Dern's chances of an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination at the 2007 Academy Awards by campaigning with a live cow. She was not nominated for the award.\n\n"}
{"id": "409677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=409677", "title": "Involuntary servitude", "text": "Involuntary servitude\n\nInvoluntary servitude or involuntary slavery is a United States legal and constitutional term for a person laboring against that person's will to benefit another, under some form of coercion other than the worker's financial needs. While laboring to benefit another occurs also in the condition of slavery, involuntary servitude does not necessarily connote the complete lack of freedom experienced in chattel slavery; involuntary servitude may also refer to other forms of unfree labor. Involuntary servitude is not dependent upon compensation or its amount.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution makes involuntary servitude illegal under any U.S. jurisdiction whether at the hands of the U.S. government or in the private sphere, except as punishment for a crime: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held, in \"Butler v. Perry\", that the Thirteenth Amendment does not prohibit \"enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc.\" Onerous long term alimony and spousal support orders, premised on a proprietary interest retained by former marital partners in one another's persons, have also been allowed in many states, though they may in practice embody features of involuntary servitude.\n\nThe Libertarian Party of the United States and other libertarians consider military conscription to be involuntary servitude in the sense of the Thirteenth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed with that interpretation in \"Arver v. United States,\" relying on text of Article I and the prerequisites of sovereignty. Some libertarians consider compulsory schooling involuntary servitude. John Taylor Gatto, a retired schoolteacher and libertarian activist critical of compulsory schooling writes of what he terms \"The Cult Of Forced Schooling\". Many libertarians consider income taxation a form of involuntary servitude. Republican Congressman Ron Paul has described income tax as \"a form of involuntary servitude, and has written, \"... things like Selective Service and the income tax make me wonder how serious we really are in defending just basic freedoms. \n\nSome have also argued that, should \"Roe v. Wade\", 410 U.S. 113 (1973), be overturned by the United States Supreme Court, a constitutional right to abortion could still be sustained on the basis that denying it would subject women to involuntary servitude contrary to the Thirteenth Amendment. However, no U.S. court has yet accepted such an argument. Differing views have been expressed as to whether the argument is so unpersuasive as to be \"frivolous\". One major difficulty with the argument relates to the claim that pregnancy and child-bearing are within the scope of the term \"servitude\".\n\n\n"}

The museum was established on 8 November 2017. It is part of a thirty-year agreement between the city of Abu Dhabi and the French government. The museum is located on the Saadiyat Island Cultural District. It is approximately in size, with of galleries , making it the largest art museum in the Arabian peninsula. The final cost of the construction is expected to be about €600 million. In addition, US$525 million was paid by Abu Dhabi to be associated with the Louvre name, and an additional US$747 million will be paid in exchange for art loans, special exhibitions and management advice.\n\nArtworks from around the world are showcased at the museum, with particular focus placed upon bridging the gap between Eastern and Western art.\n\nThe establishment of this museum was approved by the French Parliament on 9 October 2007. The architect for the building is Jean Nouvel and the engineers are BuroHappold Engineering. Jean Nouvel also designed the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris.\n\nThe museum is part of a US$27 billion tourist and cultural development for Saadiyat Island, a complex which is planned to include three other museums, including a Guggenheim Museum and the Zayed National Museum. According to the government-sponsored website UAE Interact: \"The French Museums Agency will operate in collaboration with the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), which is behind the transformation of Saadiyat Island. It will be chaired by French financier and member of the country's Académie des Beaux-Arts, Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, publisher of the periodical \"Revue des Deux Mondes\".\" Bruno Maquart, the former Executive Director of Centre Georges Pompidou, will take the position of Executive Director.\n\nSaadiyat Island's Cultural District plans to house the largest single cluster of world-class cultural assets. In addition to the Louvre Abu Dhabi these are intended to include: Zayed National Museum, to be designed by United Kingdom-based architectural company Foster and Partners under the direction of Lord Norman Foster; the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi contemporary arts museum – expected to be the world's largest Guggenheim; a performing arts centre designed by Zaha Hadid; a maritime museum with concept design by Tadao Ando and a number of arts pavilions.\n\nThe museum is designed as a \"seemingly floating dome structure\"; its web-patterned dome allowing the sun to filter through. The overall effect is meant to represent \"rays of sunlight passing through date palm fronds in an oasis.\" The total area of the museum will be approximately . The permanent collection will occupy , and the temporary exhibitions will take place over .\n\nBuroHappold Engineering provided multidisciplinary engineering services across the project, including structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, energy and environmental consultancy, water engineering, facade engineering, lighting design, people movement consultancy, security services and inclusive design. Their structural engineers realised the \"floating dome\" from 7,850 aluminium stars of varying sizes, which tessellate over eight layers to create a perforated roof structure that allows sunlight through to the spaces below. A team of specialist geotechnical and water engineers designed a watertight basement and tidal pools within the galleries to give the illusion of a \"museum in the sea\" while protecting artwork, artefacts and visitors from the corrosive marine environment.\n\nConstruction works at Louvre Abu Dhabi officially started on 26 May 2009. Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy inaugurated an exhibition titled, \"Talking Art: Louvre Abu Dhabi\" at the \"Gallery One\" of the Emirates Palace hotel which includes 19 works of art bought over the last 18 months for the Louvre Abu Dhabi, as well as loans from the French national museums to mark the beginning of the construction work.\n\nPiling works in Louvre were to be completed by August 2010, with the piling and enabling works package awarded to the German specialized company (Bauer International FZE). The total of 4536 piles consisted of RC Piles and H-Piles and was completed on 3 August 2010.\n\nOn 29 October 2011, Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC.), the project manager owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, announced it would delay establishing the museum. The company gave no new date. According to the UAE newspapers \"Gulf News\" and \"The National\", the delay could be explained by a review of the emirate's economic strategy.\n\nIn January 2012 it was confirmed that the Louvre Abu Dhabi's new opening date would be 2015.\n\nConstruction on the main phase of the museum began in early 2013 by a consortium headed by Arabtec, Constructora San José and Oger Abu Dhabi. This stage includes waterproofing and the two basement levels, along with four concrete pillars that will support the 7,000-tonne dome.\n\nWork on the construction of the gallery spaces and initial preparation for the dome began in the fourth quarter of 2013. On 5 December 2013, the first element of the museum's canopy was lifted into place.\n\nOn 17 March 2014 TDIC announced the completion of the first permanent gallery structure to mark the first anniversary of the start of construction. At this time, it was claimed that a total of ten million man hours had been worked and 120,538 cubic meters of concrete used.\n\nOn 22 September, the final super-sized element in the canopy was fitted in place, marking a significant milestone in the museum's construction phase. In October, The Tourism & Development Investment Company announced that the Louvre Abu Dhabi was more than 50 percent complete.\n\nThe three-languages wayfinding system for the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by Philippe Apeloig, and is implemented in both Arabic and Roman script. Frutiger LT typeface has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect readability for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an Arabic bespoke typeface, the LAD Arabic, based on the classic Naskh style and his Colvert Arabic font.\n\nThe design of the pictograms was inspired by the museum’s architecture, and particularly by the abstract shapes created by the rain of light filtering through the gigantic dome's mashrabiyas. Each pictogram is a combination of several of these shapes, creating silhouettes and objects.\n\nQuestions have been raised as to the nature of the artworks to be displayed at the museum. However, according to \"The National\": \"the type and nature of the exhibits planned for the Louvre Abu Dhabi have been affected to no extent by the fact the new museum would be in a Muslim country, said Mr. Loyrette.\"\n\nNevertheless, a walk through the museum reveals the absence of ancient Greek male nudes, other than medieval or Victorian era fig leaves.\n\nIt has been noted that the museum will showcase work from multiple French museums, including the Louvre, the Centre Georges Pompidou, the Musée d'Orsay and Palace of Versailles. However, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, the French Culture Minister, stated at the announcement that the Paris Louvre \"would not sell any of its 35,000-piece collection currently on display\".\nIn 2012, the Louvre Abu Dhabi started collecting photography, making its first acquisitions in the field, including works by Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, Roger Fenton and George Wilson Bridges. The museum also acquired a sculpture of a Bactrian princess dating from the third millennium BC, a pavement and fountain set from the early Ottoman period, as well as the paintings \"Breton Boys Wrestling\" (1888) by Paul Gauguin and \"The Subjugated Reader\" (1928) by René Magritte.\n\nFurther details of the museum's collection on opening were revealed in October 2014, with a number of important works to be loaned under the agreement with Agence France-Muséums and the Musée du Louvre, including Leonardo Da Vinci's \"La Belle Ferronniere\" and works by Henri Matisse, a self-portrait by Vincent Van Gogh, Jacques-Louis David's \"Napoleon Crossing the Alps\" and Claude Monet's \"Gare Saint-Lazare\".\n\nThe Louvre Abu Dhabi first started sharing its collection with the public through an exhibition entitled \"Talking Art: Louvre Abu Dhabi,\" which opened in May 2009. The exhibition presented the first 19 acquisitions for the institution, including a Mamluk holy Koran from the 14th century, a 5th-century Fibula from Domagnano, a Virgin and Child by Bellini, and Mondrian’s \"Composition with blue, red, yellow and black\" from 1922.\n\nA second exhibition, \"Birth of a Museum\", opened at the exhibition space Manarat Al Saadiyat in May 2013, ending in August that year. The first large-scale preview of the collection, it featured 130 works acquired by the government of Abu Dhabi for the permanent collection. They included a never-before-seen work by Picasso, a Bronze Age terracotta statue from Cyprus, along with artifacts from Greece, Turkey, Japan and Syria.\n\nIn May 2014, the Birth of a Museum exhibition, featuring works shown in Abu Dhabi and a number of new acquisitions opened at the Louvre in Paris. A number of new works were presented, including \"Chirisei Kyubiki\" by the Japanese artist Kazuo Shiraga and painted in 1960.\n\n@LouvreAbuDhabi tweeted 8 December 2017 that the Louvre Abu Dhabi is looking forward to displaying the \"Salvator Mundi\" by Leonardo Da Vinci. The work was acquired, at a record price for a painting, by the Department of Culture & Tourism of Abu Dhabi for the museum.\n\nThe Louvre Abu Dhabi has also been working with the Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi to set up a master’s program for museum professionals to train them and help them respond to local needs.\n\nLouvre Abu Dhabi is an entirely separate museum from the Louvre in Paris, although the two are linked by a thirty-year branding and training agreement and the Paris Louvre is one of the 12 shareholders in Agence France-Muséums. The thirty-year agreement, signed by French Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Sheik Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, will prompt the construction of a Louvre museum on Saadiyat Island, near central Abu Dhabi, in exchange for US$1.3 billion. The contract prohibits the creation of any similar operation with the name of the Louvre in any of the other emirates of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, or Iraq. French President Jacques Chirac praised the museum deal with Abu Dhabi, saying it reflects \"a certain idea of the world\" in which each party to the accord, \"proud of its roots and of its identity, is conscious of the equal dignity of all cultures.\"\n\nUS$525 million was paid by Abu Dhabi to be associated with the Louvre name, and an additional $747 million in exchange for art loans, special exhibitions and management advice. Arabtec is leading a consortium that is building the museum under a $653 million contract awarded early in 2013.\n\nUS$525 million was paid by the city of Abu Dhabi for the use of the Louvre brand name, with US$195 million payable within a month. In addition to this, US$247 million will be paid for the loan of artworks from the Louvre over a ten-year period, with a total of between two hundred and three hundred artworks expected. The Parisian Louvre will also be providing management advice to its Middle Eastern counterpart, at a cost of US$214.5 million. An additional US$253.5 million will be paid for various special art exhibitions. A total of four exhibitions will be hosted per year over a period of fifteen years. The city of Abu Dhabi will also make a direct donation of US$32.5 million to the Louvre to refurbish a wing of the Pavillon de Flore for the display of international art.\n\nThe deal has sparked controversy in both artistic and academic circles. According to Maymanah Farhat, \"the controversy that has surfaced in France is led by art historian Didier Rykner, one of the most outspoken critics of the French–Emirati deal.\" An online petition against the deal, signed by 4,650 curators, archaeologists and art historians, has insisted that French museums are not for sale. The Louvre has been accused of behaving \"like a corporation with a clearly-defined strategy: profit maximization.\" \n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", \"Henri Loyrette, the president and director of the Louvre, has responded to growing criticism of the museum’s new policy of establishing footholds abroad, arguing that the Louvre cannot ignore the 'internationalization' of museums.\" He had the following to say in the museum's defence: \n\nKhalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi said: \n\nIn April 2011, Al Jazeera reported that over 120 international artists urged a boycott of both the Louvre and Guggenheim museums over concerns regarding the abuse and exploitation of construction workers employed to develop the complex. One of the architects, Jean Nouvel, defended the treatment of the construction workers, starting that the condition of construction workers were better than some European countries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20561", "title": "Malleus Maleficarum", "text": "Malleus Maleficarum\n\nThe Malleus Maleficarum, usually translated as the Hammer of Witches, is the best known and the most important treatise on witchcraft. It was written by the discredited Catholic clergyman Heinrich Kramer (under his Latinized name \"Henricus Institoris\") and first published in the German city of Speyer in 1487. It endorses extermination of witches and for this purpose develops a detailed legal and theological theory. It was a bestseller, second only to the Bible in terms of sales for almost 200 years. The top theologians of the Inquisition at the Faculty of Cologne condemned the book as recommending unethical and illegal procedures, as well as being inconsistent with Catholic doctrines of demonology.\n\nThe \"Malleus\" elevates sorcery to the criminal status of heresy and prescribes inquisitorial practices for secular courts in order to extirpate witches. The recommended procedures include torture to effectively obtain confessions and the death penalty as the only sure remedy against the evils of witchcraft. At that time, it was typical to burn heretics alive at the stake and the \"Malleus\" encouraged the same treatment of witches. The book had a strong influence on culture for several centuries.\n\nJacob Sprenger's name was added as an author beginning in 1519, 33 years after the book's first publication and 24 years after Sprenger's death; but the veracity of this late addition has been questioned by many historians for various reasons.\n\nKramer wrote the \"Malleus\" following his expulsion from Innsbruck by the local bishop, due to charges of illegal behavior against Kramer himself, and because of Kramer's obsession with the sexual habits of one of the accused, Helena Scheuberin, which led the other tribunal members to suspend the trial.\n\nIt was later used by royal courts during the Renaissance, and contributed to the increasingly brutal prosecution of witchcraft during the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nMagical acts and witchcraft had long been forbidden by the Church, whose attitude towards witchcraft was explained in the \"Canon Episcopi\" written in about AD 900. It stated that witchcraft and magic were just delusions and that those who believed in such things \"had been seduced by the Devil in dreams and visions\". However, in the same period supernatural intervention was accepted in the form of ordeals that were later also used during witch trials. Possessions by the Devil are considered real even in present times by some Christians and it is a part of doctrine that demons may be cast out by appropriate sacramental exorcisms. In the \"Malleus\", exorcism is, for example, one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of incubi. Prayer and transubstantiation are traditionally excluded by Christians from the category of magical rites.\n\nIn 1484 clergyman Heinrich Kramer made one of the first attempts at prosecuting alleged witches in the Tyrol region. It was not a success: he was expelled from the city of Innsbruck and dismissed by the local bishop as \"senile and crazy\". According to Diarmaid MacCulloch, writing the book was Kramer's act of self-justification and revenge. Ankarloo and Clark claim that Kramer's purpose in writing the book was to explain his own views on witchcraft, systematically refute arguments claiming that witchcraft did not exist, discredit those who expressed skepticism about its reality, claim that those who practised witchcraft were more often women than men, and to convince magistrates to use Kramer's recommended procedures for finding and convicting witches.\n\nSome scholars have suggested that following the failed efforts in Tyrol, Kramer requested explicit authority from the Pope to prosecute witchcraft. Kramer received a papal bull \"Summis desiderantes affectibus\" in 1484. It allegedly gave full papal approval for the Inquisition to prosecute what was deemed to be witchcraft in general and also gave individual authorizations to Kramer and Dominican Friar Jacob Sprenger specifically. Other scholars have disputed the idea that Sprenger was working with Kramer, arguing that the evidence shows that Sprenger was actually a persistent opponent of Kramer, even going so far as to ban him from Dominican convents within Sprenger's jurisdiction while also banning him from preaching. In the words of Wolfgang Behringer: \"Sprenger had tried to suppress Kramer's activities in every possible way. He forbade the convents of his province to host him, he forbade Kramer to preach, and even tried to interfere directly in the affairs of Kramer's Séléstat convent... The same day Sprenger became successor to Jacob Strubach as provincial superior (October 19, 1487), he obtained permission from his general, Joaquino Turriani, to lash out adversus m[agistrum] Henricum Institoris inquisitorem (against Master Heinrich Kramer, inquisitor).\" \n\nThe preface also includes an alleged unanimous approbation from the University of Cologne's Faculty of Theology. Nevertheless, many historians have argued that it is well established by sources outside the \"Malleus\" that the university's theology faculty condemned the book for unethical procedures and for contradicting Catholic theology on a number of important points : \"just for good measure Institoris forged a document granting their apparently unanimous approbation.\" \n\nThe book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which \"denied any authority to the \"Malleus\"\" in the words of historian Wolfgang Behringer.\n\nIn modern times, the book has often been viewed as a typical inquisitorial manual, a perception that many historians have refuted. According to historian Jenny Gibbons:\n\nBefore 1400 it was rare for anyone to be persecuted for witchcraft, but the increasingly common persecution of heresy and failure to fully defeat those heretics paved the way for later criminal prosecution of witchcraft. By the 15th century belief in witches was widely accepted in European society. Previously, those convicted of witchcraft typically suffered penalties no more harsh than public penances such as a day in the stocks, but their persecution became more brutal following the publication of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", as witchcraft became widely accepted as a real and dangerous phenomenon. The most vigorous persecutions took place between years 1560 and 1630, ending in Europe around 1780.\n\nParticularly in the 16th and 17th centuries an intense discourse on the nature of witches preoccupied demonologists across Europe and they published many printed sermons, books and tracts. The Catholic Church played an important role in shaping of debate on demonology, but the discourse was not much affected by the Reformation. Martin Luther was also convinced about the reality and evil of witches, and facilitated development of Protestant demonology. Catholic and Protestant demonologies were similar in their basic beliefs about witches and most writers agreed on the severity of the crime of witchcraft. It was accepted by both Catholic and Protestant legislatures and witch-hunting was undeniably sponsored by both Protestant and Catholic governments. Witches became heretics to Christianity and witchcraft became the greatest of crimes and sins. Within continental and Roman Law witchcraft was the \"crimen exceptum\", a crime so foul that all normal legal procedures were superseded.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, belief in the powers of witches to harm began to die out in the West. For the post-Enlightenment Christians, the disbelief was based on a belief in rationalism and empiricism.\n\nThe \"Malleus Maleficarum\" consists of the following parts:\n\nIn this part it is briefly explained that prevalence of sorcery which is a method of Satan's final assault motivated authors to write the \"Malleus Maleficarum\":\n[...] [ Lucifer ] attacks through these heresies at that time in particular, when the evening of the world declines towards its setting and the evil of men swells up, since he knows in great anger, as John bears witness in the Book of Apocalypse [12:12], that he has little time remaining. Hence, he has also caused a certain unusual heretical perversity to grow up in the land of the Lord – a Heresy, I say, of Sorceresses, since it is to be designated by the particular gender over which he is known to have power. [...] In the midst of these evils, we Inquisitors, Jacobus Sprenger together with the very dear associate [Institoris] delegated by the Apostolic See for the extermination of so destructive a heresy [...] we will bring everything to the desired conclusion. [...] naming the treatise the \"Hammer for Sorceresses,\" we are undertaking the task of compiling the work for an associate [presumably, an ecclesiastic] [...]\n\nCopies of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" contain a reproduction of a papal bull known as \"Summis desiderantes affectibus\" that is addressed to Heinrich Institoris and Jakob Sprenger. According to it, Pope Innocent VIII acknowledges that sorceresses are real and harmful through their involvement in the acts of Satan. As Mackay writes \"It is then noted that \"Institoris\"'s and Sprenger's efforts to stamp these activities out had met with opposition in the form of technical objections relating to the specific offenses that were covered by their appointment as inquisitors, which the pope then overrides by reiterating and amplifying the terms of the inquisitors' appointment.\"\n\nAccording to the date on a document, the papal bull had been issued in 1484, two years before the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" was finished. Therefore, it is not an endorsement of a specific final text of the \"Malleus\". Instead, its inclusion implicitly legitimizes the handbook by providing general confirmation of the reality of witchcraft and full authority to Sprenger and Institoris in their preachings and proceedings: \n\nThis part of the \"Malleus\" is titled \"The Approbation of The Following Treatise and The Signatures Thereunto of The Doctors of The Illustrious University of Cologne Follows in The Form of A Public Document\" and contains unanimous approval of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" by all the Doctors of the Theological Faculty of the University of Cologne signed by them personally. The proceedings are attested by notary public Arnold Kolich of Euskirchen, a sworn cleric of Cologne with inclusion of confirmatory testimony by present witnesses Johannes Vorda of Mecheln a sworn beadle, Nicholas Cuper de Venrath the sworn notary of Curia of Cologne and Christian Wintzen of Euskirchen a cleric of the Diocese of Cologne.\n\nText of approbation mentions that during proceedings Institoris had a letter from Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor which is summarized in the approbation: \"[... Maximilian I] takes these Inquisitors under his complete protection, ordering and commanding each and every subject of the Roman Empire to render all favor and assistance to these Inquisitors and otherwise to act in the manner that is more fully contained and included in the letter.\"\n\nThe approbation consists of a preamble and is followed by a resolution in two parts.\n\nIt begins with a general statement about circumstances: IN THE NAME OF Our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let all those who will read, see or hear the present public document know that in the year since the Birth of Our Lord 1487, in the fifth indiction, on Saturday, the nineteenth day of May, at five in the afternoon or thereabouts, in the third year of the Pontificate of Our Lord, the Most Holy Father in Christ, Lord Innocent VIII, by Divine Providence Pope, in the presence of my notary public and of the witnesses written below who had been specifically summoned and asked for this purpose, the venerable and religious Brother Henricus Institoris, Professor of Holy Theology and member of the Order of Preachers, who was appointed as Inquisitor into Heretical Depravity by the Holy See along with his colleague, the venerable and religious Brother Jacobus Sprenger, also a Professor of Holy Theology and Prior of the Convent of Preachers in Cologne[...]\n\nThen, signatories complain that \"Some curates of souls and preachers of the Word of God feel no shame at claiming and affirming in their sermons to the congregation that sorceresses do not exist\" and notice that the intention of the authors of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" is not primarily to alleviate this ignorance but rather \"toil to exterminate the sorceresses by explaining the appropriate methods of sentencing and punishing them in accordance with the text of the aforementioned Bull and the regulations of the Holy Canons, thereby achieving their extermination\"; finally, signatories explain why they are providing their expertise: It is consonant with reason that those things that are done on behalf of the common good should also be confirmed through the common approval of the Doctors, and therefore, lest the aforementioned poorly educated curates and preachers think, in their ignorance of Holy Scripture, that the aforesaid treatise, which was composed in the manner mentioned above, is poorly supported by the determinations and pronouncements of the Doctors, they offered it for examination and comparison against Scripture to the illustrious University of Cologne or rather to certain Professors of Holy Theology, in order that if any things were found to be worthy of censure or incompatible with the Catholic Truth, they should be refuted by the judgment of those Professors, and that those things found to be compatible with the Catholic Truth should be approved. This was in fact done in the ways written below.\n\nThere are two signings, sometimes also referenced as two approbations. The difference is that four signatories of the first part testify that they have examined the treatises and endorse its text while in the second signing signatories do not assert that they have read the treatises but nonetheless express approval by explicitly restating some general propositions of the treatises and endorsing them instead.\n\nIn the first part, the opinion of a \"temporary Dean of the Faculty of Holy Theology at Cologne\" namely Lambertus de Monte of 's-Heerenberg is expressed and then professors Jacobus Straelen of Noetlinck, Andreas Schermer of Ochsenfurt and Thomas Lyel of Scotland testify that they agree with his opinion. The following is an excerpt from the opinion: [I proclaim] that this three part treatise, which has been examined by me and carefully compared against Scripture with regard to its first two parts, contains nothing, in my humble judgment at least, that is contrary to the pronouncements of the non-erroneous philosophers, or against the Truth of the Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Faith, or against the determinations of the Doctors approved or admitted by the Holy Church, and that the third part should certainly be upheld and approved in regard to the punishments of those heretics whom it treats, in that it does not contradict Holy Canons, and also because of the personal experiences described in this treatise, which are believed to be true because of the reputation of such great men, particularly since they are inquisitors. It should be ensured that this treatise will become known to learned and zealous men, who will then, on the basis of it, provide various healthy and appropriate advice for the extermination of sorceresses [...]\n\nThe second part is signed by those from the first signing and in addition by professors Ulrich Kridweiss of Esslingen, Konrad Vorn of Kampen, Cornelius Pays of Breda and Dietrich of Balveren (Bummel). Signatories attest that: 1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by the authority of the Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge that they think it right to carry out their office zealously.<br>2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works with them is not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but consonant with the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.<br>3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, to the extent that they can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.<br>4) All princes and Catholics should be urged to think it right to assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.\n\nThe \"Malleus Maleficarum\" asserts that three elements are necessary for witchcraft: the evil intentions of the witch, the help of the Devil, and the permission of God. The treatise is divided into three sections. The first section is aimed at clergy and tries to refute critics who deny the reality of witchcraft, thereby hindering its prosecution. The second lays the foundation for the next section by describing the actual forms of witchcraft and its remedies. The third section is to assist judges confronting and combating witchcraft, and to aid the inquisitors by removing the burden from them. However, each of these three sections has the prevailing themes of what is witchcraft and who is a witch.\n\nSection I examines the concept of witchcraft theoretically, from the point of view of natural philosophy and theology. Specifically it addresses the question of whether witchcraft is a real phenomenon or imaginary, perhaps \"deluding phantasms of the devil, or simply the fantasies of overwrought human minds\". The conclusion drawn is that witchcraft must be real because the Devil is real. Witches entered into a pact with Satan to allow them the power to perform harmful magical acts, thus establishing an essential link between witches and the Devil.\n\nMatters of practice and actual cases are discussed, and the powers of witches and their recruitment strategies. It states that it is mostly witches, as opposed to the Devil, who do the recruiting, by making something go wrong in the life of a respectable matron that makes her consult the knowledge of a witch, or by introducing young maidens to tempting young devils. It details how witches cast spells, and remedies that can be taken to prevent witchcraft, or help those who have been affected by it.\n\nSection III is the legal part of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" that describes how to prosecute a witch. The arguments are clearly laid for the lay magistrates prosecuting witches. The section offers a step-by-step guide to the conduct of a witch trial, from the method of initiating the process and assembling accusations, to the interrogation (including torture) of witnesses, and the formal charging of the accused. Women who did not cry during their trial were automatically believed to be witches.\n\nJakob Sprenger was an appointed inquisitor for the Rhineland, theology professor and a dean at the University of Cologne in Germany. Heinrich Kraemer (Institoris) was an appointed inquisitor of south Germany, a professor of theology at the University of Salzburg, the leading demonologist and witch-hunter in late medieval Germany. Pope Innocent VIII in Papal Bull \"Summis desiderantes affectibus\" refers to them both as \"beloved sons\" and \"professors of theology\"; also authorizes them to extirpate witchcraft.\n\nThe \"Malleus Maleficarum\" was intended to implement Exodus 22:18: \"You shall not permit a sorceress to live.\" and explicitly argues that \"Canon Episcopi\" does not apply to the new, formerly unknown heresy of \"modern witchcraft\". Kramer and Sprenger were the first to raise harmful sorcery to the criminal status of heresy. [...] If harmful sorcery is a crime on the order of heresy, Kramer and Sprenger argue, then the secular judges who prosecute it must do so with the same vigor as would the \"Inquisition\" in prosecuting a heretic. The \"Malleus\" urges them to adopt torture, leading questions, the admission of denunciation as valid evidence, and other Inquisitorial practices to achieve swift results. Moreover, the authors insist that the death penalty for convicted witches is the only sure remedy against withcraft. They maintain that the lesser penalty of banishment prescribed by \"Canon Episcopi\" for those convicted of harmful sorcery does not apply to the new breed of witches, whose unprecedented evil justifies capital punishment.\n\nThe treatise often makes references to the Bible and Aristotelian thought, and it is heavily influenced by the philosophical tenets of Neoplatonism. The first section of the book's main text is written using the scholastic methodology of Thomas Aquinas characterized by a mode of \"disputed questions\" most notably used in his \"Summa Theologica\". It was a standard mode of argumentation in scholastic discourse with a long tradition. Most of the citations in the \"Malleus\" come from multiple works of Aquinas, a highly influential author in theology. Aquinas is a main source for Section I but is cited in all sections; \"Formicarius\" by Johannes Nider is the important source for Section II, and \"Directorium Inquisitorum\" by Spanish inquisitor Nicholas Eymeric is a crucial source for Section III.\n\nThe ancient subjects of astronomy, philosophy, and medicine were being reintroduced to the West at this time, as well as a plethora of ancient texts being rediscovered and studied. The \"Malleus\" also mentions astrology and astronomy, which had recently been reintroduced to the West through the ancient works of Pythagoras. The \"Malleus\" is also heavily influenced by the subjects of divination, astrology, and healing rituals the Church inherited from antiquity.\n\nImportantly, Kramer and Sprenger were convinced that God would never permit an innocent person to be convicted of witchcraft.\n\nThe \"Malleus\" recommended not only torture but also deception in order to obtain confessions: \"And when the implements of torture have been prepared, the judge, both in person and through other good men zealous in the faith, tries to persuade the prisoner to confess the truth freely; but, if he will not confess, he bid attendants make the prisoner fast to the strappado or some other implement of torture. The attendants obey forthwith, yet with feigned agitation. Then, at the prayer of some of those present, the prisoner is loosed again and is taken aside and once more persuaded to confess, being led to believe that he will in that case not be put to death.\" \n\nAll confessions acquired with the use of tortures had to be confirmed: \"And note that, if he confesses under the torture, he must afterward be conducted to another place, that he may confirm it and certify that it was not due alone to the force of the torture.\" \n\nHowever, if there was no confirmation, tortures could not be repeated, but it was allowed to continue them at the specified day: \"But, if the prisoner will not confess the truth satisfactorily, other sorts of tortures must be placed before him, with the statement that unless he will confess the truth, he must endure these also. But, if not even thus he can be brought into terror and to the truth, then the next day or the next but one is to be set for a continuation of the tortures – not a repetition, for it must not be repeated unless new evidences produced. The judge must then address to the prisoners the following sentence: We, the judge, etc., do assign to you, such and such a day for the continuation of the tortures, that from your own mouth the truth may be heard, and that the whole may be recorded by the notary.\"\n\nThe treatise describes how women and men become inclined to practice witchcraft. The text argues that women are more susceptible to demonic temptations through the manifold weaknesses of their gender. It was believed that they were weaker in faith and more carnal than men. Michael Bailey claims that most of the women accused as witches had strong personalities and were known to defy convention by overstepping the lines of proper female decorum. After the publication of the \"Malleus\", it seems as though about three quarters of those individuals prosecuted as witches were women. \n\nWitches were usually female. The reasons for this is the suggestion that women are \"prone to believing and because the demon basically seeks to corrupt the faith, he assails them in particular.\" They also have a \"temperament towards flux\" and \"loose tongues\". They \"are defective in all the powers of both soul and body\" and are stated to be more lustful than men. The major reason is that at the foundation of sorcery is denial of faith and \"woman, therefore, is evil as a result of nature because she doubts more quickly in the faith.\" Men could be witches, but were considered rarer, and the reasons were also different. The most common form of male witch mentioned in the book is the sorcerer-archer. The book is rather unclear, but the impetus behind male witches seems to come more from desire for power than from disbelief or lust, as it claims is the case for female witches.\n\nIndeed, the very title of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" is feminine, alluding to the idea that it was women who were the villains. Otherwise, it would be the \"Malleus Maleficorum\" (the masculine form of the Latin noun \"maleficus\" or \"malefica,\" 'witch'). In Latin, the feminine \"maleficarum\" would only be used for women, while the masculine \"maleficorum\" could be used for men alone or for both sexes if together. The \"Malleus Maleficarum\" accuses male and female witches of infanticide, cannibalism and casting evil spells to harm their enemies as well as having the power to steal a man's penis. It goes on to give accounts of witches committing these crimes.\n\nArguments favoring discrimination against women are explicit in the handbook. Those arguments are not novel but constitute a selection from the long tradition of Western misogynist writings. However, according to Brauner, they are combined to produce new meanings and result in a comprehensive theory. It mixes elements borrowed from \"Formicarius\" (1435), \"Preceptorium divinae legis\" (1475) and \"Lectiones super ecclesiastes\" (1380).Kramer and Sprenger develop a powerful gender-specific theory of witchcraft based on a hierarchical and dualistic view of the world. Everything exists in pairs of opposites: God and Satan, Mary and Eve, and men (or virgins) and women. Each positive principle in a pair is delineated by its negative pole. Perfection is defined not as the integration or preservation of opposites, but rather as the extermination of the negative element in a polar pair. Because women are the negative counterpart to men, they corrupt male perfection through witchcraft and must be destroyed.\n\nAlthough authors give many examples of male witchery in the second part of the handbook, those witchcraft trials that are independently confirmed and that were led by Kramer himself are related to persecution of women almost exclusively. They took place in Ravensburg near Constance (1484) and Innsbruck (since 1485). According to Brauner, trial records confirm that Kramer believed that women are by nature corrupt and evil. His position was in harmony with the scholastic theory at the time. In contrast, Sprenger never conducted a witch trial though he was consulted in a few cases. Kramer and Sprenger use a metaphor of a world turned upside down by women of which concubines are the most wicked, followed by midwives and then by wives who dominate their husbands. Authors warn of imminent arrival of the apocalypse foretold in the Bible and that men risk bewitchment that leads to impotence and sensation of castration. Brauner explains authors' prescription on how a woman can avoid becoming a witch: According to the \"Malleus\", the only way a woman can avoid succumbing to her passions – and becoming a witch – is to embrace a life of devout chastity in a religious retreat. But the monastic life is reserved to the spiritually gifted few. Therefore, most women are doomed to become witches, who cannot be redeemed; and the only recourse open to the authorities is to ferret out and exterminate all witches.\n\nStrixology in the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" is characterized by a very specific conception of what a witch is, one that differs dramatically from earlier times. The word used, malefica, carries an explicit condemnation absent in other words referring to women with supernatural powers. The conception of witches and of magic by extension is one of evil. It differs from earlier conceptions of witchcraft that were much more generalized. This is the point in history where \"witchcraft constituted an independent antireligion\". The witch lost her powerful position vis-a-vis the deities; the ability to force the deities comply with her wishes was replaced by a total subordination to the devil. In short, the witch became Satan's puppet.\" This conception of witches was \"part of a conception of magic that is termed by scholars as 'Satanism' or 'diabolism'\". In this conception, a witch was a member of \"a malevolent society presided over by Satan himself and dedicated to the infliction of malevolent acts of sorcery (\"maleficia\") on others.\"\n\nAccording to Mackay, this concept of sorcery is characterized by the conviction that those guilty engage in six activities: \n\nIn the \"Malleus\" demons are the ones who tempt humans to sorcery and are the main figures in the witches' vows. They interact with witches, usually sexually. The book claims that it is normal for all witches \"to perform filthy carnal acts with demons.\" This is a major part of human-demon interaction and demons do it \"not for the sake of pleasure, but for the sake of corrupting.\" It is worth noting that not all demons do such things. The book claims that \"the nobility of their nature causes certain demons to balk at committing certain actions and filthy deeds.\" Though the work never gives a list of names or types of demons, like some demonological texts or spellbooks of the era, such as the \"Liber Juratus\", it does indicate different types of demons. For example, it devotes large sections to incubi and succubi and questions regarding their roles in pregnancies, the submission of witches to incubi, and protections against them.\n\nJoseph Hansen, a historian who was appalled by the witch-craze and those who carried it out, proposed that coauthorship by Sprenger was a falsehood presented by Institoris (Kramer) and that approbation is \"partially\" a forgery. This had never been proposed before until Joseph Hansen in the nineteenth century.\n\nChristopher Mackay, author of the modern academic translation of the \"Malleus\" into English offers rebuttals to arguments of proponents of this theory and in an interview gives an accessible summary:\nThe argument was made in the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger had nothing to do with the composition. The evidence for this is in my view very tenuous (and the main argument is clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once the argument was put forward, it took on a life of its own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.\nIn addition, Mackay points out that allegations raised in support of this theory that supposedly two of the signatories had not in fact signed the approbation are unsubstantiated.\n\nA similar response is offered by the author of the first translation of the \"Malleus\" into English Montague Summers. In his introduction, he ignores completely the theory that joint authorship or approbation could be a mystification. Nonetheless, he mentions briefly that it was questioned whether Kramer or Sprenger contributed more to the work. He comments that \"in the case of such a close collaboration any such inquiry seems singularly superfluous and nugatory\".\n\nBroedel, a historian who writes that it is likely that Sprenger's contribution was minimal, nonetheless says that \"Sprenger certainly wrote the \"Apologia auctoris\" which prefaces the \"Malleus\" and agreed to be a coauthor.\n\n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\" and \"The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca\" ignore completely Hansen's theory and list Sprenger and Kramer as co-authors.\n\nWolfgang Behringer argues that Sprenger's name was only added as an author beginning in 1519, thirty-three years after the book was first published and decades after Sprenger's own death. One of Sprenger's friends who was still alive denounced the addition of Sprenger's name as a forgery, stating that Sprenger had nothing to do with the book. Many historians have also pointed out that Sprenger's actual views in his confirmed writings are often the opposite of the views in the \"Malleus\", and Sprenger was unlikely to have been a colleague of Kramer since Sprenger in fact banned Kramer from preaching and entering Dominican convents within his jurisdiction, and spoke out against him on many occasions.\n\nThe alleged approval from the theologians at Cologne, which Kramer included in the \"Malleus\" with a list of names of theologians who he claimed approved the book, has also been questioned by many historians, since In 1490 the clergy at Cologne condemned the book and at least two of the clergy listed by Kramer, Thomas de Scotia and Johann von Wörde, publicly denied having approved the \"Malleus\".\n\nJacob Sprenger's name was added as an author beginning in 1519, 33 years after the book's first publication and 24 years after Sprenger's death.\n\nJenny Gibbons, a Neo-Pagan and a historian, writes: \"Actually the Inquisition immediately rejected the legal procedures Kramer recommended and censured the inquisitor himself just a few years after the \"Malleus\" was published. Secular courts, not inquisitorial ones, resorted to the \"Malleus\"\".\n\nThe preface also includes an allegedly unanimous approbation from the University of Cologne's Faculty of Theology. Nevertheless, many historians have argued that it is well established by sources outside the \"Malleus\" that the university's theology faculty condemned the book for unethical procedures and for contradicting Catholic theology on a number of important points : \"just for good measure Institoris forged a document granting their apparently unanimous approbation.\" \n\nIn 1484 Heinrich Kramer had made one of the first attempts at prosecuting alleged witches in the Tyrol region. It was not a success and he was asked to leave the city of Innsbruck. According to Diarmaid MacCulloch, writing the book was Kramer's act of self-justification and revenge. Ankarloo and Clark claim that Kramer's purpose in writing the book was to explain his own views on witchcraft, systematically refute arguments claiming that witchcraft does not exist, discredit those who expressed skepticism about its reality, claim that those who practiced witchcraft were more often women than men, and to convince magistrates to use Kramer's recommended procedures for finding and convicting witches.\n\nKramer wrote the \"Malleus\" following his expulsion from Innsbruck by the local bishop, due to charges of illegal behavior against Kramer himself, and because of Kramer's obsession with the sexual habits of one of the accused, Helena Scheuberin, which led the other tribunal members to suspend the trial.\n\nKramer received a papal bull, \"Summis desiderantes affectibus\", in 1484. It directed Bishop of Strasburg (then Albert of Palatinate-Mosbach) to accept the authority of Heinrich Kramer as an Inquisitor, although the motivation of the papal bull was likely political. The \"Malleus Maleficarum\" was finished in 1486 and the papal bull was included as part of its preface, implying papal approval for the work. However, the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" received an official condemnation by the Church three years later, and Kramer's claims of approval are seen by modern scholars as misleading.\n\nKramer was intensely writing and preaching until his death in Bohemia in 1505. He was asked by Nuremberg council to provide expert consultation on the procedure of witch trial in 1491. His prestige was not fading. In 1495 he was summoned by the Master General of the Order, Joaquin de Torres, O.P. to Venice and gave very popular public lectures and disputations. They were worthy of presence and patronage of Patriarch of Venice. He also wrote treatises \"Several Discourses and Various Sermons upon the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist\" (Nuremberg, 1496); \"A Tract Confuting the Errors of Master Antonio degli Roselli\" (Venice, 1499); followed by \"The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman Church Against the Picards and Waldenses\" which were quoted by many authors. He was appointed as papal nuncio and his assignment as inquisitor was changed to Bohemia and Moravia by Pope Alexander VI in 1500.\n\nSprenger continued his work as Inquisitor Extraordinary for the Provinces of Mainz, Trèves and Cologne. Later, he was elected Provincial Superior of the whole German Province (in 1488). He had enormous responsibilities. He received a letter from Pope Alexander VI praising his enthusiasm and energy in 1495 and died in the same year.\n\nSummers observes that 17th century \"Dominican chroniclers, such as Quétif and Échard, number Kramer and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their Order\".\n\nGender-specific theory developed in the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" laid the foundations for widespread consensus in early modern Germany on the evil nature of women as witches. Later works on witchcraft have not agreed entirely with the \"Malleus\" but none of them challenged the view that women were more inclined to be witches than men. It was perceived as intuitive and all-accepted so that very few authors saw the need to explain why women are witches. Those who did, attributed female witchery to the weakness of body and mind (the old medieval explanation) and a few to female sexuality.\n\nSome authors argue that the book's publication was not as influential as earlier authors believed. According to MacCulloch, the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" was one of several key factors contributing to the witch craze, along with popular superstition, and tensions created by the Reformation. However, according to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\":\n\nBetween 1487 and 1520, twenty editions of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" were published, and another sixteen between 1574 and 1669. The \"Malleus Maleficarum\" was able to spread throughout Europe rapidly in the late 15th and at the beginning of the 16th century due to the innovation of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century by Johannes Gutenberg. The invention of printing some thirty years before the first publication of the \"Malleus Maleficarum\" instigated the fervor of witch hunting, and, in the words of Russell, \"the swift propagation of the witch hysteria by the press was the first evidence that Gutenberg had not liberated man from original sin.\"\n\nThe late 15th century was also a period of religious turmoil. The \"Malleus Maleficarum\" and the witch craze that ensued took advantage of the increasing intolerance of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation in Europe, where the Protestant and Catholic camps respectively, pitted against one another, each zealously strove to maintain what they each deemed to be the purity of faith.\nThe Catholic Counter-Reformation would eventually even out this religious turmoil, but until then both the Catholics and Protestants constantly battled for what they believed was right. \nThe Latin book was firstly translated by into German in 1906; an expanded edition of three volumes was published in 1923. Montague Summers was responsible for the first English translation in 1928.\n\nSome translations ignore the most brutal third section and may be misleading to the reader. For instance, sections one and three have never been translated into Polish.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its collection ranks among the 100 largest libraries in America, which includes university, public, and private collections, and is among the nation's 20 largest public library systems. (Note: The Kansas City Public Library is a separate library system with facilities primarily serving Kansas City in Jackson County, Missouri.)\n\nOn May 8, 2014, the Mid-Continent Public Library received the National Medal for Museum and Library Service during a ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C. The medal is the country's highest honor awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.\n\nMid-Continent Public Library's roots go back to the Independence Public Library, formed by the Independence Library Association in 1892 and the creation of the Citizens Improvement Association Library (later the Carnegie Library) in Excelsior Springs in the 1890s.\n\nAfter World War II, Clay, Platte and Jackson counties formed countywide library systems. They began collaborating in the early 1960s, and on November 10, 1965 Clay and Jackson formed the Mid-Continent Public Library Service as a joint administrative body, though each library retained separate governing boards and budgets. \n\nEven though they remained separate, their combined resources allowed them to merge administrative costs. Gaining the name Mid-Continent Public Library in 1968, the library system was well on its way to achieving its goal. Separating library services from school districts enabled them to expand library services to rural areas, which presently did not have services. \n\nPlatte County joined the group in 1968. In 1978, seven years after the state legislature passed a law allowing for consolidated multi-county library systems, the Clay and Jackson libraries officially merged to form Consolidated Library District No. 3. Platte County joined a year later.\n\nA notable librarian, James A. Leathers, was influential in the creation of a regional library system and became the first Director of Mid-Continent Public Library Service. His focus was to provide education, information, and recreation to the public. His desire was for the library to serve all individuals regardless of age, and he aimed to provide services for the young as well as the elderly. \n\nThe library system is overseen by a Library Board of twelve members, four appointed by County Commissioners in each of the service region's three counties. It currently has 31 branches in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area of Missouri located in Kansas City, Independence, Liberty, Gladstone, Lee’s Summit, Grandview, Blue Springs, Grain Valley, and other cities. It also hosts two installations at community centers in partnership with the Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department that provide automated library services and public Internet access.\n\nIn 1994, the Mid-Continent Public Library began to see advances in technology. It made improvement with circulation, intra-library loan, and online catalogs. In 1995, dial-up Internet access was provided for catalog use. In 1996, the full access to Internet was provided. In 2001, WorldCat was added to the online databases. \n\nIn fiscal 2008-2009, the collection held 3,544,072 items. Total annual circulation was 9,183,005 items, and it filled 1,773,586 intra- and interlibrary loans. Branch libraries served 4,673,737 visitors. Total attendance at live programming events for adults and families and for children was 318,639 patrons. The system has 466,344 registered borrowers.\n\nAnnual circulation for the year exceeded one-half million items for each of the Mid-Continent Library’s five busiest branches: Liberty, Lee’s Summit, Colbern Road, North Independence, and Blue Springs South.\n\nThe system has one of the nation’s largest Summer Reading Programs, which was completed by 106,846 patrons in fiscal 2009. It is known for its array of services, including more than 250 online learning tools and research databases with remote access, downloadable audiobooks, and Library-by-Mail for homebound patrons. Library branches offer self-checkout machines and self-service hold pick-ups, and LCD flat-panel monitors on every on-site public access computer. Most branches also offer free wi-fi access. The library system collaborates and partners with local foundations.\n\nOn 21 June 2008, Mid-Continent Public Library inaugurated the Midwest Genealogy Center in Independence, Missouri. It is the largest stand-alone public genealogy research facility in America.\n\nThe building houses a unique collection of records in almost completely open stacks. It holds 80,000 family history books, 100,000 local history items, 565,000 rolls of microfilm, and 7,000 maps. It also contains all available U.S. federal population census records and federal indexes, Civil War histories, immigration and naturalization records, ship passenger lists, Native American records, biographical archives, manuscripts pertaining to the American slave trade and the Antebellum South, Papers of the St. Louis Fur Trade, and a large variety of state records for Missouri and other states such as state censuses, tax records, penitentiary records, military service records, compiled records of Missouri Union and Confederate Army soldiers, approximately 50 Missouri newspapers, local newspaper indexes to obituaries and weddings, and genealogical periodicals. The center also has 10,000 volumes available for circulation in the “Genealogy from the Heartland Collection” created from donations by the American Family Records Association (AFRA), Missouri State Genealogical Association (MoSGA), Heart of America Genealogical Society (HAGS), Gann Family Association, and patron contributions.\n\nThe center’s equipment includes microfilm reader-printers, self-digitization stations, and free access to important research databases. It offers many advanced services, including free wireless Internet access and digital video conferencing capabilities for viewing national broadcasts relevant to genealogists and family historians.\nThe Midwest Genealogy Center is open seven days per week. Groups and tours are welcomed by appointment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31637084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31637084", "title": "Modernist Cuisine", "text": "Modernist Cuisine\n\nModernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking is a 2011 cookbook by Nathan Myhrvold, Chris Young and Maxime Bilet. The book is an encyclopedia and a guide to the science of contemporary cooking. Its six volumes cover history and fundamentals, techniques and equipment, animals and plants, ingredients and preparation, plated dish recipes and a kitchen manual containing brief information on useful topics. At the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards 2010 the book was named \"the most important cookbook of the first ten years of the 21st century\" and was introduced into the group's hall of fame. Containing 2,438 pages and weighing in at , the book has been described as the “cookbook to end all cookbooks.”\n\nThe idea for the book came up when Myhrvold acquired a temperature-controlled water bath for sous vide cooking in 2003. He tried to find information about this new cooking technique, which had been invented in the 1960s and was in use at many restaurants by 2003. He could find only a few articles and one book (in Spanish) on sous vide, however. He posted messages on eGullet, a high-end cooking forum, asking for recipes or sources, but found that the process was poorly understood.\n\nMyhrvold has attended Ecole de Cuisine la Varenne, a cooking school in Burgundy, France and has also cooked part-time at Rover's, a French restaurant in Seattle owned by Thierry Rautureau. He is also a scientist, having earned advanced degrees in geophysics, space physics, and theoretical and mathematical physics, done post-doctoral research with Stephen Hawking at Cambridge University, and worked for many years as the chief technology officer and chief strategist of Microsoft. Drawing on his food and science skills, Myhrvold performed experiments and calculations to generate tables of times and temperatures for cooking various foods sous vide. When he posted these tables to eGullet, answering the question that he himself had asked in that forum about one year earlier, someone suggested that he should write a book. In 2006 he began to do so, but soon realized that he could not write the book he wanted himself, and that it would require a team using proper equipment.\n\nMyhrvold started buying equipment for the research kitchen in the Intellectual Ventures lab. Much of the equipment was standard cooking equipment, but it also included items such as rotor-stator homogenizers, ultrahigh-pressure homogenizers, freeze-dryers, a 50,000 G centrifuge, ultrasonic baths, and rotary evaporators. The laboratory already included other high-tech and industrial equipment, a 100-ton hydraulic press, a large water-jet cutter, an electrical discharge machine, and automated milling machines.\n\nMyhrvold and Wayt Gibbs, an executive editor at Intellectual Ventures who served as the editor-in-chief and project manager for the book, also hired writers and editors, research assistants, photo editors, and an art director. First hired was Chris Young, who had just stopped his work of leading the development kitchen in Heston Blumenthal's restaurant The Fat Duck in England. Young recruited Maxime Bilet, also from The Fat Duck, who led the team of research chefs that developed and tested the 1,522 recipes in the book. Photographer Ryan Matthew Smith joined the team after answering an advert on Craigslist seeking a photo editor. The book team ultimately grew to include more than 50 staff and freelance contributors plus 14 outside experts who reviewed various chapters of the book. At the high point of the project, 36 researchers, chefs, and editors were working simultaneously on the book.\n\nInitially the book was planned to be 150 pages on cooking sous vide in water baths and combi ovens, along with some scientific fundamentals relevant to those techniques. It gradually grew in scope, and by late 2009 the book plan had expanded to 1,500 pages, before finally being printed at 2,438 pages. The book cost more than to produce the first printing of 6,000 copies, which sold out shortly after the publication date in March 2011. In April 2011, The Cooking Lab ordered a second printing of 25,000 copies.\n\nThe Cooking Lab published a less expensive, two-volume sequel, titled \"Modernist Cuisine at Home\", coauthored by Myhrvold and Bilet, in October 2012. \"The Photography of Modernist Cuisine\", with 405 photographs and background details for each, including 127 from the 6-volume set and unpublished ones, was published in 2013.\n\n\"Modernist Cuisine\" consists of five major volumes plus a spiral-bound kitchen manual, which reprints recipes and reference tables from the major volumes on water-resistant paper for use while cooking.\n\n\nThe critical reception was generally positive, citing detail on molecular gastronomic techniques and strong illustrations. However, the book was criticized by reviewers in the New York Times and the New Yorker for being dryly written and of limited utility to cooks without an expensive array of kitchen tools at their disposal. Two years after it was first published, a reviewer in Forbes magazine pronounced \"Modernist Cuisine\" and its two successor books \"this decade’s most influential work about food\" and also likely the most profitable set of books in the genre in recent years.\n\nIn 2010 the book was inducted into the Gourmand Cookbook Hall of Fame. In 2012 the book won the James Beard Foundation's \"Cookbook of the Year\" and \"Cooking from a Professional Point of View\" awards, and the International Association of Culinary Professionals' \"Professional Kitchens\", \"Design\" and \"Visionary Achievement\" awards.\n\nThe Photography of Modernist Cuisine: The Exhibition opened at Pacific Science Center on October 26, 2013. This is a photo exhibition that features food processes, large scale views, and modern cooking techniques.\n\n"}

The demise of the \"National Atlas\" was announced in February 2014 and nationalatlas.gov was taken offline on October 1, 2014.\n\nSince the Atlas' retirement, its data remains available in two places:\n\nThe first national atlas of the United States, titled the \"Statistical Atlas of the United States Based on the Results of the Ninth Census 1870\", was published in 1874. Francis A. Walker, the Superintendent of the 1870 U.S. Census compiled this atlas \"with contributions from many eminent men of science and several departments of the government.\" The 1874 U.S. National Atlas contained population maps as well as economic and natural resources maps (including maps of forests, precious metals, coal, climate, and crops).\n\nHenry Gannett, who worked as the Chief Geographer of both the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), led the production of three additional national atlases of the United States after 1874, with the last of these atlases being published in 1920.\n\nThe next edition of the national atlas of the United States was issued in 1970—half a century later. The USGS and its chief geographer Dr. Arch C. Gerlach oversaw the preparation and production (which took several years to complete) of the 1970 \"U.S. National Atlas\" as well. The 1970 atlas weighed twelve pounds, contained four hundred pages, and had a collection of 765 maps. These maps showed \"scientific information from a variety of Federal sources and depicted the principal characteristics of the country, including its physical features, historical evolution, economic activities, sociocultural conditions, administrative subdivisions, and place in world affairs.\"\n\nThe 1970 atlas was primarily created for use by United States government officials, researchers, and others who need \"to visualize country-wide patterns and relationships between environmental phenomena and human activities\". 15,000 copies of the 1970 atlas were printed, and its price of made it cost-prohibitive for most Americans. A majority of those 15,000 copies were bought by schools and libraries. The 1970 atlas has been out of print since the early 1970s, but the Library of Congress posted it online as part of its American Memory collection. \"The 1970 National Atlas of the United States of America page describes the development of this atlas briefly and gives a link to the Library of Congress archive.\n\nThe final \"National Atlas\" of the United States was created in 1997 and was published online through the first nine months of 2014. The USGS led the creation of this edition of the \"National Atlas\", but more than twenty U.S. federal agencies cooperated in producing it. Its varied products and services included the first online interactive mapping program offered by the Federal government.\n\nThe \"National Atlas\" data is now archived as \"1997-2014 Edition of The National Atlas of the United States\" on the U.S. government's website.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey continues to make at least a subset of the \"National Atlas\" data available under its \"National Map Small Scale Collection.\" The USGS has updated a handful of the \"Atlas\" datasets on its pages since the Atlas retired.

The same structures were described by different names, depending (among other things) on the anatomist’s school and national tradition. Vernacular translations of Latin and Greek, as well as various eponymous terms, were barriers to effective international communication. There was disagreement and confusion among anatomists regarding anatomical terminology.\n\nThe first and last entries in the following table are not NA editions, but they are included for the sake of continuity. Although these early editions were authorized by different bodies, they are sometimes considered part of the same series.\n\nBefore these codes of terminology, approved at anatomists congresses, the usage of anatomical terms was based on authoritative works of scholars like Galen, Berengario da Carpi, Gaspard Bauhin, Henle, Hyrtl, etc.\n\nAround the time of the \"Twelfth Congress\" (London, 1985), a dispute arose over the editorial independence of the IANC. The IANC did not believe that their work should be subject to the approval of IFAA Member Associations.\n\nThe types of discussion underlying this dispute are illustrated in an article by Roger Warwick, then Honorary Secretary of the IANC:\n\nWhat declined, however, was the influence of the IANC on anatomical terminology. The IANC published a \"sixth\" edition of \"Nomina Anatomica,\" but it was never approved by the IFAA.\n\nInstead, at the \"Thirteenth Congress\" (Rio de Janeiro, 1989), the IFAA created a new committee – the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT). The FCAT took over the task of revising international anatomical terminology. The result was the publication, in 1998, of a \"new, updated, simplified and uniform anatomical terminology\", the Terminologia Anatomica (TA)\n. The IANC was acknowledged in this work as follows:\n\nThe \"Terminologia Anatomica \" is the joint creation of the FCAT (now FICAT—the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology) and the Member Associations of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA). The first edition, published in 1998, supersedes all previous lists. It is the international standard for anatomical terminology.\n\nThe 39th edition of \"Gray's Anatomy\" (2005) explicitly recognizes \"Terminologia Anatomica\".\n\n\"NA\" and its derivatives are still used in some contexts (even the controversial sixth edition), and there remain some obstacles to universal adoption of \"TA\":\n\n\n"}

{"id": "870352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=870352", "title": "Sentence (linguistics)", "text": "Sentence (linguistics)\n\nIn non-functional linguistics, a sentence is a textual unit consisting of one or more words that are grammatically linked. In functional linguistics, a sentence is a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time. This entry is mainly about \"sentence\" in its non-functional sense, though much work in functional linguistics is indirectly cited or considered such as the categories of Speech Act Theory.\n\nA sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to express a statement, question, exclamation, request, command or suggestion.\nA sentence is a set of words that in principle tells a complete thought (although it may make little sense taken in isolation out of context) It may be a simple phrase, but it conveys enough meaning to imply a clause, even if it is not explicit; for example, \"Two\" as a sentence (in answer to the question \"How many were there?\") implies the clause \"There were two.\" Typically a sentence contains a subject and predicate. A sentence can also be defined purely in orthographic terms, as a group of words starting with a capital letter and ending in a full stop.\n\nIn the teaching of writing skills (composition skills), students are generally required to express (rather than imply) the elements of a sentence, leading to the schoolbook definition of a sentence as one that must [explicitly] include a subject and a verb. For example, in second-language acquisition, teachers often reject one-word answers that only imply a clause, commanding the student to \"give me a complete sentence,\" by which they mean an explicit one.\n\nAs with all language expressions, sentences might contain function and content words and contain properties such as characteristic intonation and timing patterns.\n\nSentences are generally characterized in most languages by the inclusion of a finite verb, e.g. \"The quick brown fox \"jumps\" over the lazy dog.\"\n\nIn non-functional linguistics, a simple complete sentence consists of a single clause. In functional linguistics, a sentence is typically associated with a clause and a clause can be either a clause simplex or a clause complex. A clause is a clause simplex if it represents a single process going on through time and it is a clause complex if it represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more clause simplexes.\n\nA clause (simplex) typically contains a predication structure with a subject noun phrase and a finite verb. Although the subject is usually a noun phrase, other kinds of phrases (such as gerund phrases) work as well, and some languages allow subjects to be omitted. In the examples below, the subject of the outmost clause simplex is in italics and the subject of \"boiling\" is in square brackets. Notice that there is clause embedding in the second and third examples.\n\nThere are two types of clauses: \"independent\" and \"non-independent\"/\"interdependent\". An independent clause realises a speech act such as a statement, a question, a command or an offer. A non-independent clause does not realise any act. A non-independent clause (simplex or complex) is usually logically related to other non-independent clauses. Together they usually constitute a single independent clause (complex). For that reason, non-independent clauses are also called \"interdependent\". For instance, the non-independent clause \"because I have no friends\" is related to the non-independent clause \"I don't go out\" in \"I don't go out, because I have no friends\". The whole clause complex is independent because it realises a statement. What is stated is the causal nexus between having no friend and not going out. When such a statement is acted out, the fact that the speaker doesn't go out is already established, therefore it cannot be stated. What is still open and under negotiation is the reason for that fact. The causal nexus is represented by the independent clause complex and not by the two interdependent clause simplexes.\n\nSee also copula for the consequences of the verb \"to be\" on the theory of sentence structure.\n\nOne traditional scheme for classifying English sentences is by clause structure, the number and types of clauses in the sentence with finite verbs.\n\nSentences can also be classified based on their purpose:\n\nA major sentence is a \"regular\" sentence; it has a subject and a predicate, e.g. \"I have a ball.\". In this sentence, one can change the persons, e.g. \"We have a ball.\". However, a minor sentence is an irregular type of sentence that does not contain a main clause, e.g. \"Mary!\", \"Precisely so.\", \"Next Tuesday evening after it gets dark.\". Other examples of minor sentences are headings (e.g. the heading of this entry), stereotyped expressions (\"Hello!\"), emotional expressions (\"Wow!\"), proverbs, etc. These can also include nominal sentences like \"The more, the merrier\". These mostly omit a main verb for the sake of conciseness, but may also do so in order to intensify the meaning around the nouns.\n\nSentences that comprise a single word are called word sentences, and the words themselves sentence words.\n\nThe 1980s saw a renewed surge in interest in sentence length, primarily in relation to \"other syntactic phenomena\".\n\nOne definition of the average sentence length of a prose passage is the ratio of the number of words to the number of sentences.\nThe textbook \"Mathematical linguistics\", by András Kornai, suggests that in \"journalistic prose the median sentence length is above 15 words.\"\nThe average length of a sentence generally serves as a measure of sentence difficulty or complexity. In general, as the average sentence length increases, the complexity of the sentences also increases.\n\nAnother definition of \"sentence length\" is the number of clauses in the sentence, whereas the \"clause length\" is the number of phones in the clause.\n\nResearch by Erik Schils and Pieter de Haan by sampling five texts showed that two adjacent sentences are more likely to have similar lengths than two non-adjacent sentences, and almost certainly have a similar length when in a work of fiction. This countered the theory that \"authors may aim at an alternation of long and short sentences.\"\nSentence length, as well as word difficulty, are both factors in the readability of a sentence; however, other factors, such as the presence of conjunctions, have been said to \"facilitate comprehension considerably\".\n\n"}

At the start of 2015, while still Leader of the Opposition, Tsipras stated that the programme is \"not negotiable\".\n\nAfter Syriza won a plurality in legislative elections held on 25 January 2015, Tsipras became Prime Minister of Greece and brokered a coalition with the right-wing anti-austerity Independent Greeks with the shared goal of immediate realisation of the programme. An official Syriza statement promised that the \"new government will implement the Thessaloniki program to end the humanitarian crisis\".\n\nOn 13 July 2015, the Greek government and the European creditors reached an agreement under which the government had to implement harsh austerity measures, which effectivelly made the major economic measures proposed by the Thessaloniki programme virtually impossible to implement. \n\nThe programme is based on four pillars:\n\nAt the European level, the programme demands a \"European New Deal\" of large-scale public investment by the European Investment Bank, extended quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, and a conference for the reduction of Greek and southern European debt modeled on the London Debt Agreement of 1953. Domestically, the programme sets out a \"National Reconstruction Plan\" based on the rebuilding and extending of the welfare state, and the strengthening of democratic institutions alongside the implementation of forms of direct democracy. These policies would be financed through revenues raised by combatting tax evasion and appropriating European funds from bodies such as the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund.\n\nAt the time of its publication, the programme was criticised by the New Democracy–led government for underestimating the costs of its pledges. Since then, it has also been criticised from within Syriza. In January 2015, Central Committee member Stathis Kouvelakis stated that the programme \"was based on very over-optimistic estimates (or even simply wrong ones)\".\n\n\n"}

The earliest recorded attribution of the Tower to the Roman ruler dates to the mid-14th century in a poem by Sir Thomas Gray. The origin of the myth is uncertain, although it may be related to the fact that the Tower was built in the corner of London's Roman walls. Another possibility is that someone misread a passage from Gervase of Tilbury in which he says Caesar built a tower at Odnea in France. Gervase wrote Odnea as Dodres, which is close to the French for London, Londres.

It usually refers to migrations after Christopher Columbus' voyage to the Americas in 1492. For earlier Transatlantic crossings, see: Norse colonization of North America and Theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas.\n\n\nAmong the various transatlantic migrations, the period of time between the mid-19th century to the early 20th century marks the “Age of Mass Migration” where 40% of U.S. population growth was due to the inflow of immigrants. Economic theory sought to explain, however, if immigrants were positively or negatively selected from the sending pool into the United States. \nIngrid Semmingsen in her book, \"Norway to America: a History of the Migration\", wrote “Many have asked if it was the more capable, the more enterprising and energetic persons who left, or if it was those who fell behind in the struggle for bread, the losers, the maladjusted, and the deviant” in reference to the composition of those who migrated into the United States. \nThe Roy Model of comparative advantage suggests that where there are higher wages for skilled workers in one location, the most able will migrate to that country and earn that income. Moreover, if there are higher wages for unskilled workers in one location, the least able will leave their own country and migrate to earn that income. \n\nAs a result of the improvements in transportation after the Industrial Revolution, long-distance migrations increased in the 19th century. For example, the duration of the Atlantic passage fell from 5 weeks (1725) to one week (1900). In addition, the length of indentured servitude necessary to pay for the fare decreased from 4 years to approximately 4 weeks, substantially decreasing one of the main deterrents for making the trek. Between 1846 and 1940, some 55 million migrants moved from Europe to America. 65% went to the United States. Other major receiving countries were Argentina, Canada, Brazil and Uruguay. Also, 2.5 million Asians migrated to the Americas, most as indentured servant to the plantations of the Caribbean, but some also, notably Japanese, arrived in Brazil and the USA.\n\n\n"}

It is located at the Museum Square in the borough Amsterdam South, close to the Stedelijk Museum, the Rijksmuseum, and the Concertgebouw.\n\nThe museum opened on 2 June 1973. It is located in buildings designed by Gerrit Rietveld and Kisho Kurokawa. The museum's collection is the largest collection of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings in the world.\n\nIn 2017, the museum had 2.3 million visitors, and was the most visited museum in the Netherlands and the 23rd most visited art museum in the world.\n\nUpon Vincent van Gogh's death in 1890, his work not sold fell into the possession of his brother Theo. Theo died six months after Vincent, leaving the work in the possession of his widow, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. Selling many of Vincent's paintings with the ambition of spreading knowledge of his artwork, Johanna maintained a private collection of his works.\n\nThe collection was inherited by her son Vincent Willem van Gogh in 1925, eventually loaned to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam where it was displayed for many years, and was transferred to the state-initiated Vincent van Gogh Foundation in 1962.\n\nDesign for a Van Gogh Museum was commissioned by the Dutch government in 1963 to Dutch architect and furniture designer Gerrit Rietveld. Rietveld died a year later, and the building was not completed until 1973, when the museum opened its doors.\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, the building was renovated by the Dutch architect Martien van Goor and an exhibition wing by the Japanese modernist architect Kisho Kurokawa was added.\n\nStarting in late 2012, the museum was closed for renovations for six months. During this period, 75 works from the collection were shown in the Hermitage Amsterdam.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the museum unveiled a long-lost Van Gogh painting that spent years in a Norwegian attic believed to be by another painter. It is the first full-size canvas by him discovered since 1928. \"Sunset at Montmajour\" depicts trees, bushes and sky, painted with Van Gogh's familiar thick brush strokes. It can be dated to the exact day it was painted because he described it in a letter to his brother, Theo, and said he painted it the previous day 4 July 1888.\n\nIn 1991, twenty paintings were stolen from the museum, among them Van Gogh's early painting \"The Potato Eaters\". Although the thieves escaped from the building, 35 minutes later all stolen paintings were recovered from an abandoned car. Three paintings – \"Wheatfield with Crows\", \"Still Life with Bible\", and \"Still Life with Fruit\" – were severely torn during the theft. Four men, including two museum guards, were convicted for the theft and given six or seven-year sentences. It is considered to be the largest art theft in the Netherlands since the Second World War.\n\nIn 2002, two paintings were stolen from the museum, \"Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen\" and \"View of the Sea at Scheveningen\". Two Dutchmen were convicted for the theft to four-and-a-half-year sentences, but the paintings were not immediately recovered. The museum offered a reward of €100,000 for information leading to the recovery of the paintings. The FBI Art Crime Team listed the robbery on their \"Top Ten Art Crimes\" list, and estimates the combined value of the paintings at US$30million. In September 2016, both paintings were discovered by the Guardia di Finanza in Naples, Italy. The two artworks were found in a \"relatively good state\", according to the Van Gogh Museum.\n\nThe museum is situated at the Museumplein in Amsterdam-Zuid, on the Paulus Potterstraat 7, between the Stedelijk Museum and the Rijksmuseum. The museum consists of two buildings, the Rietveld building, designed by Gerrit Rietveld, and the Kurokawa wing, designed by Kisho Kurokawa. The museum offices are housed on Stadhouderskade 55 in Amsterdam-Zuid.\n\nThe Rietveld building is the main structure of the museum and exhibits the permanent collection. The building has a rectangular floor plan and is four stories high. On the ground floor are a shop, a café, and the introductory part of the art exhibition. The first floor shows the works of Van Gogh grouped chronologically. The second floor gives information about the restoration of paintings and has a space for minor temporary exhibitions. The third floor shows paintings of Van Gogh's contemporaries in relationship to the work of Van Gogh himself.\n\nThe Kurokawa wing is used for major temporary exhibitions. The building has an oval floor plan and is three stories high. The entrance to the Kurokawa wing is via an underground tunnel from the Rietveld building.\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum has the largest Van Gogh collection in the world. It comprises 200 paintings, 400 drawings, and 700 letters by Vincent van Gogh.\n\nThe main exhibition chronicles the various phases of Van Gogh's artistic life.\n\nHis selected works from Nuenen (1880–1885):\n\nHis selected works from Antwerp (1886):\n\nHis selected works from Paris (1886–1888):\n\n\nHis selected works from Arles (1888–1889):\n\nHis selected works from Saint-Rémy (1889–1890):\n\nAnd his selected works from Auvers-sur-Oise (1890):\n\nThe permanent collection also includes nine of the artist's self-portraits and some of his earliest paintings dating back to 1882.\n\nThe museum also features notable art works by Van Gogh's contemporaries in the Impressionist and post-Impressionist movements and holds extensive exhibitions on various subjects from 19th Century art history.\n\nThe museum has sculptures by Auguste Rodin and Jules Dalou, and paintings by John Russell, Émile Bernard, Maurice Denis, Kees van Dongen, Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Odilon Redon, Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum, which is a national museum (), is a foundation ().\n\nAxel Rüger has been the museum director since 2006.\n\nSince 2000, the museum had between 1.2 and 1.9 million visitors per year. From 2010 to 2012, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands. In 2015, the museum had 1.9 million visitors, it was the 2nd most visited museum in the Netherlands, after the Rijksmuseum, and the 31st most visited art museum in the world.\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum is a member of the national Museumvereniging (Museum Association).\n"}
{"id": "4601133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4601133", "title": "Vrba–Wetzler report", "text": "Vrba–Wetzler report\n\nThe Vrba–Wetzler report, also known as the Auschwitz Protocols, the Auschwitz Report and the Auschwitz notebook, is a 40-page document about the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland during the Holocaust.\n\nRudolf Vrba and Alfréd Wetzler, two Slovak Jews who escaped from Auschwitz on 10 April 1944, wrote the report by hand or dictated it, in Slovak, between 25 and 27 April, in Žilina, Slovakia. Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovak Jewish Council typed up the report and simultaneously translated it into German.\n\nThe Allies had known since November 1942 that Jews were being killed \"en masse\" in Auschwitz. The Vrba-Wetzler report was an early attempt to estimate the numbers and the most detailed description of the gas chambers to that point. The publication of parts of the report in June 1944 is credited with helping to persuade the Hungarian regent, Miklós Horthy, to halt the deportation of that country's Jews to Auschwitz, which had been proceeding at a rate of 12,000 a day since May 1944. The first full English translation of the report was published in November 1944 by the United States War Refugee Board.\n\nThe Vrba-Wetzler report is sometimes referred to as the \"Auschwitz Protocols\", although in fact the \"Protocols\" incorporated information from three reports, including Vrba–Wetzler. Under the title \"German Extermination Camps—Auschwitz and Birkenau\", the \"Auschwitz Protocols\" was first published in full in English on 25 November 1944 by the Executive Office of the United States War Refugee Board. Miroslav Kárný writes it was published on the same day the last 13 prisoners, all women, were gassed or shot in crematorium II in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The document combined the material from the Vrba–Wetzler report and two others, which were submitted together in evidence at the Nuremberg Trials as document no. 022-L, exhibit no. 294-USA.\n\nThe \"Protocols\" included a seven-page report from Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz and an earlier report, known as the \"Polish Major's report\", written by Jerzy Tabeau. Tabeau escaped from Auschwitz on 19 November 1943 and compiled his report between December 1943 and January 1944. This was presented in the \"Protocols\" as the 19-page \"Transport (The Polish Major's Report)\". Rosin and Mordowicz escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May 1944, using the demotion they received after Vrba and Wetzler's escape a month earlier, and met up with those escapees in Slovakia to contribute to the \"Protocols.\" The full text of the English translation of the \"Protocols\" is in the archives of the War Refugee Board at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in New York.\n\nAccording to the report's first post-war Slovak edition, \"Oswiecim, hrobka štyroch miliónov ľudí\" (\"Auschwitz, the tomb of four million\"), published in Bratislava in 1946, the report was first written in Slovak by Vrba and Wetzler, beginning on 25 April 1944, and simultaneously translated into German by Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovakian Jewish Council in Žilina. It was written and re-written several times. Wetzler wrote the first part, Vrba the third, and they wrote the second part together. They then worked on the whole thing together. Wetzler confirmed this version of how the report was written in a letter to Miroslav Kárný, dated 14 April 1982. Oscar Krasniansky, an engineer and stenographer, translated it from Slovak into German with the help of Gisela Steiner. They produced a 40-page report in German, which was completed by Thursday, 27 April. Vrba wrote that the report was also translated into Hungarian. The original Slovak version of the report was not preserved. Historians studying the Holocaust today usually base their research on the German translation, which Allied forces also used when translating the report into English shortly after the end of the war.\n\nThe Vrba-Wetzler report contains a detailed description of the geography and management of the camps, and of how the prisoners lived and died. It lists the transports that had arrived at Auschwitz since 1942, their place of origin, and the numbers \"selected\" for work or the gas chambers. Kárný writes that the report is an invaluable document because it provides details that were known only to prisoners, including, for example, that discharge forms were filled out for prisoners who had been gassed, indicating that death rates in the camp were actively falsified.\n\nThe report contains sketches and information about the layout of the gas chambers, describing the large room where victims were made to undress before being pushed into the gas chambers, as well as the attached crematoriums. In a deposition for the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, and in his book \"I Cannot Forgive\" (1964), Vrba said that he and Wetzler obtained the information about the gas chambers and crematoria from the \"Sonderkommando\" Filip Müller and his colleagues, who worked there. Müller confirmed Vrba's story in his \"Eyewitness Auschwitz\" (1979). The report offered a description of the camp's four crematoria.\n\nJean-Claude Pressac, a French specialist on the gas chambers, concluded in 1989 that, while the report was wrong on certain issues, it \"has the merit of describing exactly the gassing process in type II/III Krematorien as from mid-March 1943. It made the mistake of generalizing internal and external descriptions and the operating method to Krematorien IV and V. Far from invalidating it, the discrepancies confirm its authenticity, as the descriptions are clearly based on what the witnesses could actually have seen and heard.\" Auschwitz scholar Robert Jan van Pelt agreed, writing in 2002: \"The description of the crematoria in the War Refugee Board report contains errors, but given the conditions under which information was obtained, the lack of architectural training of Vrba and Wetzlar [sic], and the situation in which the report was compiled, one would become suspicious if it did not contain errors. ... Given the circumstances, the composite 'crematorium' reconstructed by two escapees without any architectural training is as good as one could expect.\"\n\nThe dates on which the report was distributed became a matter of importance within Holocaust historiography. Vrba alleged that lives were lost in Hungary because it was not distributed quickly enough by Jewish leaders, particularly Rudolf Kastner of the Budapest Aid and Rescue Committee.\n\nThe Allies had been told on 12 November 1942 that Jews were being killed \"en masse\" in Auschwitz; the \"New York Times\" published a report to that effect on 25 November 1942. From March 1943, the Polish government-in-exile forwarded intelligence about what was happening inside the camp. But it remained an \"inside story\", according to historian Michael Fleming, unpublished or not published prominently, as a result of anti-Semitism and the British Foreign Office's refusal to confirm the reports as genuine. A document named \"Aneks 58\" from the Polish underground (which named its report \"Aneks\") was received by Britain's Special Operations Executive in November 1942 and noted that, by the end of 1942, 468,000 Jews had been killed at Auschwitz.\n\nFleming writes: \"[N]ews of the true function of Auschwitz was effectively embargoed by British government policy.\" By issuing advice to newspaper owners and editors, by refusing to confirm Polish intelligence, and by insisting that Jews were simply citizens of the country in which they lived like any other citizen, the British government \"was able to choreograph news of the Holocaust\".\n\nOscar Krasniansky of the Jewish Council, who translated the report into German as Vrba and Wetzler were writing and dictating it, made conflicting statements about the report after the war, according to Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer. In his first statement he said he had handed the report to Rudolf Kastner on 26 April 1944 during the latter's visit to Bratislava, but Bauer writes that the report was not finished until 27 April. In another statement, Krasniansky said he had passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but Hansi Brand, Kastner's lover and the wife of Joel Brand, said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. It is clear from Kastner's post-war statements that he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, but perhaps not in April. According to Randolph L. Braham, Kastner had a copy by 3 May, when he paid a visit to Kolozsvár (Cluj), his home town.\nKastner's reasons for not making the document public are unknown. Vrba believed until the end of his life that Kastner withheld it in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the Aid and Rescue Committee and Adolf Eichmann, the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. Shortly after Vrba arrived in Slovakia from Auschwitz in April 1944, Eichmann proposed—to Kastner, Joel Brand and Hansi Brand in Budapest—that the Nazis trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but Kastner did obtain safe passage to Switzerland for 1,684 Jews on what became known as the Kastner train. Vrba believed that Kastner suppressed the Vrba–Wetzler report in order not to damage these negotiations.\n\nKastner copied the German translation of the report to Géza Soós, a Hungarian Foreign Ministry official who ran a resistance group, writes Bauer. Soós gave it to József Éliás, head of the Good Shepherd Mission, and Éliás's secretary, Mária Székely, translated it into Hungarian and prepared six copies. These copies made their way to several Hungarian and church officials, including Miklós Horthy's daughter-in-law. Braham writes that this distribution occurred before 15 May. According to Bauer, Ernő Pető, a member of the Budapest Jewish Council, said he gave copies to Horthy's son; the papal nuntius Angelo Rotta; and the finance minister Lajos Reményi-Schneller.\n\nThe Jewish Council in Budapest did hand the report out to individuals. The Hungarian biologist George Klein, as a teenager in Budapest, was working for the Jewish Council as a junior secretary at the time. One day in late May or early June, his boss, Dr. Zoltán Kohn, gave him a carbon copy of the report, and told him that he should tell only his closest family and friends about it. Klein told his uncle, a well-known physician, who \"became so angry that he nearly hit me\", and asked how he could believe such nonsense. It was the same with other relatives and friends. The older ones refused to believe it, while the younger ones believed it and wanted to act. When it came time for Klein to get on the train, he chose to run instead, and that saved his life.\n\nAccording to the USHMM (United Stated Holocaust Museum) the US War Refugee Board released the report after an unusually long delay. \"In November 1944, the WRB released a report written by escapees from the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, alerting Americans to the details of Nazi mass murder using gas chambers.\"\n\nOn 6 June 1944, the day of the Normandy landings, Arnošt Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz arrived in Slovakia, having escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May. Hearing about the Battle of Normandy and believing the war was over, they got drunk using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. As a result they were arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent time in jail before the Jewish Council paid their fines. On 15 June, the men were interviewed by Oscar Krasniansky. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau, and that most were killed on arrival, apparently with no knowledge of what was about to happen to them. John Conway writes that Vrba and Wetzler concluded that their report had been suppressed.\n\nBraham writes that the report was taken to Switzerland by Florian Manoliu of the Romanian Legation in Bern, and given to George Mantello, a Jewish businessman from Transylvania who was working as the first secretary of the El Salvador consulate in Geneva. It was thanks to Mantello, according to Braham, that the report received, in the Swiss press, its first wide coverage. According to David Kranzler, Mantello asked for the help of the Swiss-Hungarian Students' League to make around 50 mimeographed copies of the Vrba–Wetzler and other Auschwitz reports (the \"Auschwitz Protocols\"), which by 23 June he had distributed to the Swiss government and Jewish groups. The students went on to make thousands of other copies, which were passed to other students and MPs.\n\nAs a result of the Swiss press coverage, details appeared in the \"New York Times\" on 4 June, the BBC World Service on 15 June, and the \"New York Times\" again on 20 June, which carried a 22-line story that 7,000 Jews had been \"dragged to gas chambers in the notorious German concentration camps at Birkenau and Oświęcim [Auschwitz]\".\n\nOn 19 June, Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva, who had received a copy of the report from Mantello, wrote to the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem to say that they knew \"what has happened and where it has happened\", and reported the Vrba–Wetzler figure that 90 percent of Jews arriving at Birkenau were being killed. Vrba and Oscar Krasniansky met Vatican Swiss legate Monsignor Mario Martilotti at the Svätý Jur monastery in Bratislava on 20 June. Martilotti had seen the report and questioned Vrba about it for six hours. According to Bauer, Martilotti said he was travelling to Switzerland the next day. On 25 June Pope Pius sent a public cable to Horthy, asking that he \"do everything in ...[his] power to save as many unfortunate people from further pain and sorrow\". Other world leaders followed suit. Daniel Brigham, \"New York Times\" correspondent in Geneva, published a longer story on 3 July, \"Inquiry Confirms Nazi Death Camps\", and on 6 July a second, \"Two Death Camps Places of Horror; German Establishments for Mass Killings of Jews Described by Swiss\".\n\nOn 26 June, Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the Allies to hold members of the Hungarian government personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted by the Hungarian government and shown to Prime Minister Döme Sztójay, who passed it to Horthy. Horthy ordered an end to the deportations on 7 July, and they stopped two days later.\n\nHitler instructed the Nazi representative to Hungary, Edmund Veesenmayer, to relay an angry message to the Admiral. Horthy resisted Hitler's threats, and Budapest's 200,000–260,000 Jews were temporarily spared from deportation, until the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Party seized power in Hungary in a coup on 15 October 1944. Henceforth, the deportations resumed, but by then, the diplomatic involvement of the Swedish, Swiss, Spanish, and Portuguese embassies in Budapest, as well as that of the papal nuncio, Angelo Rotta, saved tens of thousands until the arrival of the Soviet Union in Budapest in January 1945.. Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of thousands of Jews (according to Yad Vashem museum display on the order of 50,000) with help of Moshe Krausz (then Director of the Jewish Agency’s Palestine Office in Budapest) and the Zionist Youth Underground. Raoul Wallenberg and others in the Swedish delegation also saved tens of thousands of Jews (according to some 70,000 to 100,000). As can be expected there are varying estimates of the number of Jews rescued.\n\n\n"}
