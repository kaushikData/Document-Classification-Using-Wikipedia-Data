Express terms must be given their plain meaning and extrinsic evidence (i.e. background matters) is not able to be considered, unless such terms are uncertain or ambiguous.\n\nIn 1988 Robert Jones (Pacific) Ltd agreed to purchase a building being constructed by Benjamin Developments (a subsidiary of McConnell Dowell Corporation). The building later became the Coopers and Lybrand building, and is now known as the ANZ Centre.\n\nHowever, the purchase agreement was conditional, with the main condition that prior to possession, Benjamin Developments was required to lease the building, and at specified rentals.\n\nIn the aftermath of the stock market crash, Benjamin Developments struggled to find tenants for the building. Faced with the option of having to sell the property to an underwriter for a significant amount less than RJP had agreed to pay, they decided to offer significant cash incentives to attract tenants to the building, about $60 million worth in total.\n\nWhen it came time for RJP to take possession, they refused, claiming that the floors were a few inches too short, and that they claimed that the contact called for real rentals, without incentives.\n\nThe court ruled that the plain meaning of the lease rentals did not exclude incentives. Hardie-Boys stated \"Where however the contractual intention is clear from the words used then the court must give effect to it. It is not permissible to inquire into preliminary or background matters in order to find a different meaning\".\n"}

It is situated within the Tower's Inner Ward and dates from 1520. It is a Royal Peculiar. The name refers to St. Peter's imprisonment under Herod Agrippa in Jerusalem. The Chapel is probably best known as the burial place of some of the most famous prisoners executed at the Tower, including Anne Boleyn, Catherine Howard and Lady Jane Grey.\n\nAt the west end is a short tower, surmounted by a lantern bell-cote, and inside the church is a nave and shorter north aisle, lit by windows with cusped lights but no tracery, a typical Tudor design.\n\nThe church is a Chapel Royal, and the priest responsible for it is the chaplain of the Tower, a canon and member of the Ecclesiastical Household. The canonry was abolished in 1685 but reinstated in 2012.\n\nThe existing building was rebuilt for Henry VIII by Sir Richard Cholmondeley in 1519–20, but a chapel stood in its position since before the Norman conquest.\n\nSt Peter ad Vincula was the church of the extra-parochial area of Tower Within, part of the Liberties of the Tower of London. On 16 December 1729 the church was added to the Bills of mortality, a record of burials in London, but was excluded in 1730 because of a successful claim by the inhabitants of it being extra-parochial and outside of the normal parish system. Extra-parochial places were eliminated in the 19th century, and in 1858 the area became a civil parish, following the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857. The Tower of London liberty was dissolved in 1894, and the parish was absorbed by St Botolph without Aldgate in 1901.\n\nThe church contains many splendid monuments. In the north-west corner is a memorial to John Holland, Duke of Exeter, a Constable of the Tower who died in 1447. Under the central arcade lies the effigy of Sir Richard Cholmondeley, a Lieutenant of the Tower who died in 1521. In the sanctuary, there is an impressive monument to Sir Richard Blount, who died in 1564 and is buried in the church, and his son Sir Michael, died in 1610, both Tudor Lieutenants of the Tower, who would have witnessed many of the executions. There is a fine 17th-century organ, decorated with carvings by Grinling Gibbons.\n\nThe church is perhaps most notable as the burial place of some of the most famous Tower prisoners, including three queens: Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, the second and fifth wives of Henry VIII, respectively, and Lady Jane Grey, who reigned for nine days in 1553. George Boleyn, brother of Anne, was also buried here after his execution in 1536, as were Edmund Dudley and Sir Richard Empson, tax collectors for Henry VII, and Guildford Dudley, husband to Lady Jane Grey, in February 1554, after being executed on Tower Green. Others were Thomas More and John Fisher, who incurred the wrath of Henry VIII, and after their execution, they were canonised as martyrs by the Roman Catholic Church; Philip Howard, a third saint who suffered under the Tudors, was also buried here for a time before his body was relocated to Arundel. After their executions, the following people were also buried here: Henry VIII's minister, Thomas Cromwell (1540); Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley, the brother of Jane Seymour, uncle of Edward VI, who is remembered for his unseemly conduct towards his step-niece, Elizabeth I (1549); Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (1552); John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland and John Gates in connection with the 1553 succession crisis (1553); and James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, under the communion table (1685).\n\nA list of \"remarkable persons\" buried in the chapel between 1534 and 1747 is listed on a table on the west wall. Thomas Babington Macaulay memorialised those buried in the chapel in his 1848 \"History of England\": \"In truth there is no sadder spot on the earth than that little cemetery. Death is there associated, not, as in Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul's, with genius and virtue, with public veneration and with imperishable renown; not, as in our humblest churches and churchyards, with everything that is most endearing in social and domestic charities; but with whatever is darkest in human nature and in human destiny, with the savage triumph of implacable enemies, with the inconstancy, the ingratitude, the cowardice of friends, with all the miseries of fallen greatness and of blighted fame. Thither have been carried, through successive ages, by the rude hands of gaolers, without one mourner following, the bleeding relics of men who had been the captains of armies, the leaders of parties, the oracles of senates, and the ornaments of courts.\"\n\nThe church is a Chapel Royal and the priest responsible for it is the chaplain of the Tower of London, a canon and member of the Ecclesiastical Household. The canonry was abolished in 1685 but reinstated in 2012. The Reverend Roger Hall, MBE was installed as a canon the same year.\n\nThe chapel can be visited as part of a specific tour within the Tower of London or by attending the regular Sunday morning service.\n"}

Nine hundred from Quintus Aurelius Symmachus (345–402) survive, and Libanius (c. 314–392 or 393) left over 1500 letters in Greek. Scholars have sometimes been disappointed with the content of the letters, which have tended to include rhetorical conventions to the exclusion of factual matters, or, in the case of Libanius, to include many generic recommendations on behalf of applicants to the Roman bureaucracy. A.H.M.

His best-known work is \"\", a history of representation in Western literature from ancient to modern times and frequently cited as a classic in the study of realism in literature.\n\nAuerbach, who was Jewish and born in Berlin, was trained in the German philological tradition and would eventually become, along with Leo Spitzer, one of its best-known scholars. After participating as a combatant in World War I, he earned a doctorate in 1921 at University of Greifswald, served as librarian at the Prussian State Library for some years, and in 1929 became a member of the philology faculty at the University of Marburg, publishing a well-received study entitled \"Dante: Poet of the Secular World\".\n\nWith the rise of National Socialism Auerbach was forced to vacate his position in 1935. Exiled from Nazi Germany, he took up residence in Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote \"Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature\" (1946), generally considered his masterwork. Auerbach's life and work in Turkey is detailed and placed in historical and sociological context by Kader Konuk, \"East West Mimesis: Auerbach in Turkey\" (2010).\n\nHe moved to the United States in 1947, teaching at Pennsylvania State University and then working at the Institute for Advanced Study.

{"id": "157861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157861", "title": "Filibuster", "text": "Filibuster\n\nA filibuster is a political procedure where one or more members of parliament or congress debate over a proposed piece of legislation so as to delay or entirely prevent a decision being made on the proposal. It is sometimes referred to as \"talking a bill to death\" or \"talking out a bill\" and is characterized as a form of obstruction in a legislature or other decision-making body. This form of political obstruction reaches as far back as Ancient Roman times and could also be referred to synonymously with political stonewalling. Due to the often extreme length of time required for a successful filibuster, many speakers stray off topic after exhausting the original subject matter. Past speakers have read through laws from different states, recited speeches, and even read from cookbooks and phone books.\n\nThe word filibuster comes from the Spanish \"fee-lee-bote,\" English \"fly-boat,\" a small, swift sailing-vessel with a large mainsail, which enabled buccaneers to pursue merchantmen in the open sea and escape when pursued. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" finds its only known use in early modern English in a 1587 book describing \"flibutors\" who robbed supply convoys.\n\nThe English \"filibuster\" was borrowed from Spanish in the 19th century. Originally it applied to pirates infesting the Spanish American coasts, but around 1850 it designated the followers of William Walker and Narciso López, who were then pillaging Spanish colonies in Central America. The word entered American political slang with the meaning \"to delay legislation by dilatory motions or other artifices.\"\n\nOne of the first known practitioners of the filibuster was the Roman senator Cato the Younger. In debates over legislation he especially opposed, Cato would often obstruct the measure by speaking continuously until nightfall. As the Roman Senate had a rule requiring all business to conclude by dusk, Cato's purposely long-winded speeches were an effective device to forestall a vote.\n\nCato attempted to use the filibuster at least twice to frustrate the political objectives of Julius Caesar. The first incident occurred during the summer of 60 BCE, when Caesar was returning home from his propraetorship in Hispania Ulterior. Caesar, by virtue of his military victories over the raiders and bandits in Hispania, had been awarded a triumph by the Senate. Having recently turned forty, Caesar had also become eligible to stand for consul. This posed a dilemma. Roman generals honored with a triumph were not allowed to enter the city prior to the ceremony, but candidates for the consulship were required, by law, to appear in person at the Forum. The date of the election, which had already been set, made it impossible for Caesar to stand unless he crossed the \"pomerium\" and gave up the right to his triumph. Caesar petitioned the Senate to stand \"in absentia,\" but Cato employed a filibuster to block the proposal. Faced with a choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship and entered the city.\n\nCato made use of the filibuster again in 59 BCE in response to a land reform bill sponsored by Caesar, who was then consul. When it was Cato's time to speak during the debate, he began one of his characteristically long-winded speeches. Caesar, who needed to pass the bill before his co-consul, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, took possession of the \"fasces\" at the end of the month, immediately recognized Cato's intent and ordered the lictors to jail him for the rest of the day. The move was unpopular with many senators and Caesar, realizing his mistake, soon ordered Cato's release. The day was wasted without the Senate ever getting to vote on a motion supporting the bill, but Caesar eventually circumvented Cato's opposition by taking the measure to the Tribal Assembly, where it passed.\n\nIn the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a bill defeated by a filibustering manoeuvre may be said to have been \"talked out\". The procedures of the House of Commons require that members cover only points germane to the topic under consideration or the debate underway whilst speaking. Example filibusters in the Commons and Lords include:\n\nThe all-time Commons record for non-stop speaking, six hours, was set by Henry Brougham in 1828, though this was not a filibuster. The 21st century record was set on December 2, 2005 by Andrew Dismore, Labour MP for Hendon. Dismore spoke for three hours and 17 minutes to block a Conservative Private Member's Bill, the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Protection of Property) Bill, which he claimed amounted to \"vigilante law.\" Although Dismore is credited with speaking for 197 minutes, he regularly accepted interventions from other MPs who wished to comment on points made in his speech. Taking multiple interventions artificially inflates the duration of a speech and thus may be used as a tactic to prolong a speech.\n\nIn local unitary authorities of England a motion may be carried into closure by filibustering. This results in any additional motions receiving less time for debate by Councillors instead forcing a vote by the Council under closure rules.\n\nA notable filibuster took place in the Northern Ireland House of Commons in 1936 when Tommy Henderson (Independent Unionist MP for Shankill) spoke for nine and a half hours (ending just before 4 am) on the Appropriation Bill. As this Bill applied government spending to all departments, almost any topic was relevant to the debate, and Henderson used the opportunity to list all of his many criticisms of the Unionist government.\n\nBoth houses of the Australian parliament have strictly enforced rules on how long members may speak, so filibusters are generally not possible, though this is not the case in some state legislatures.\n\nIn opposition, Tony Abbott's Liberal National coalition used suspension of standing orders in 2012 for the purposes of filibustering, most commonly during question time against the Labor government.\n\nIn August 2000, New Zealand opposition parties National and ACT delayed the voting for the Employment Relations Bill by voting slowly, and in some cases in Māori (which required translation into English).\n\nIn 2009, several parties staged a filibuster of the Local Government (Auckland Reorganisation) Bill in opposition to the government setting up a new Auckland Council under urgency and without debate or review by select committee, by proposing thousands of wrecking amendments and voting in Māori as each amendment had to be voted on and votes in Māori translated into English. Amendments included renaming the council to \"Auckland Katchafire Council\" or \"Rodney Hide Memorial Council\" and replacing the phrase \"powers of a regional council\" with \"power and muscle\".\n\nThe Rajya Sabha (Council of states) – which is the upper house in the Indian bicameral legislature – allows for a debate to be brought to a close with a simple majority decision of the house, on a closure motion so introduced by any member. On the other hand, the Lok Sabha (Council of the people) – the lower house – leaves the closure of the debate to the discretion of the speaker, once a motion to end the debate is moved by a member.\n\nIn 2014, Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter performed a filibuster; he was perceived to \"drone on and on\" and hence this was termed a \"Drone Attack\".\n\nA dramatic example of filibustering in the House of Commons of Canada took place between Thursday June 23, 2011 and Saturday June 25, 2011. In an attempt to prevent the passing of Bill C-6, which would have legislated the imposing of a four-year contract and pay conditions on the locked out Canada Post workers, the New Democratic Party (NDP) led a filibustering session which lasted for fifty-eight hours. The NDP argued that the legislation in its then form undermined collective bargaining. Specifically, the NDP opposed the salary provisions and the form of binding arbitration outlined in the bill.\n\nThe House was supposed to break for the summer Thursday June 23, but remained open in an extended session due to the filibuster. The 103 NDP MPs had been taking it in turn to deliver 20 minute speeches – plus 10 minutes of questions and comments – in order to delay the passing of the bill. MPs are allowed to give such speeches each time a vote takes place, and many votes were needed before the bill could be passed. As the Conservative Party of Canada held a majority in the House, the bill passed. This was the longest filibuster since the 1999 Reform Party of Canada filibuster, on native treaty issues in British Columbia.\n\nConservative Member of Parliament Tom Lukiwski is known for his ability to stall Parliamentary Committee business by filibustering. One such example occurred October 26, 2006, when he spoke for almost 120 minutes to prevent the House of Commons of Canada Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development from studying a private member's bill to implement the Kyoto Accord. He also spoke for about 6 hours on February 5, 2008 and February 7, 2008 at the House of Commons of Canada Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs meetings to block inquiry into allegations that the Conservative Party spent over the maximum allowable campaign limits during the 2006 election.\n\nAnother example of filibuster in Canada federally came in early 2014 when NDP MP and Deputy Leader David Christopherson filibustered the government's bill C-23, the Fair Elections Act at the Procedure and House Affairs Committee. His filibuster lasted several meetings the last of which he spoke for over 8 hours and was done to support his own motion to hold cross country hearings on the bill so MPs could hear what the Canadian public thought of the bill. In the end, given that the Conservative government had a majority at committee, his motion was defeated and the bill passed although with some significant amendments.\n\nThe Legislature of the Province of Ontario has witnessed several significant filibusters, although two are notable for the unusual manner by which they were undertaken. The first was an effort on May 6, 1991, by Mike Harris, later premier but then leader of the opposition Progressive Conservatives, to derail the implementation of the budget tabled by the NDP government under premier Bob Rae. The tactic involved the introduction of Bill 95, the title of which contained the names of every lake, river and stream in the province. Between the reading of the title by the proposing MPP, and the subsequent obligatory reading of the title by the clerk of the chamber, this filibuster occupied the entirety of the day's session until adjournment. To prevent this particular tactic from being used again, changes were eventually made to the Standing Orders to limit the time allocated each day to the introduction of bills to 30 minutes.\n\nA second high-profile and uniquely implemented filibuster in the Ontario Legislature occurred in April 1997, where the Ontario New Democratic Party, then in opposition, tried to prevent the governing Progressive Conservatives' Bill 103 from taking effect. To protest the Tory government's legislation that would amalgamate the municipalities of Metro Toronto into the \"megacity\" of Toronto, the small NDP caucus introduced 11,500 amendments to the megacity bill, created on computers with mail merge functionality. Each amendment would name a street in the proposed city, and provide that public hearings be held into the megacity with residents of the street invited to participate. The Ontario Liberal Party also joined the filibuster with a smaller series of amendments; a typical Liberal amendment would give a historical designation to a named street. The NDP then added another series of over 700 amendments, each proposing a different date for the bill to come into force.\nThe filibuster began on April 2 with the Abbeywood Trail amendment and occupied the legislature day and night, the members alternating in shifts. On April 4, exhausted and often sleepy government members inadvertently let one of the NDP amendments pass, and the handful of residents of Cafon Court in Etobicoke were granted the right to a public consultation on the bill, although the government subsequently nullified this with an amendment of its own. On April 6, with the alphabetical list of streets barely into the Es, Speaker Chris Stockwell ruled that there was no need for the 220 words identical in each amendment to be read aloud each time, only the street name. With a vote still needed on each amendment, Zorra Street was not reached until April 8. The Liberal amendments were then voted down one by one, eventually using a similar abbreviated process, and the filibuster finally ended on April 11.\n\nAn ironic example of filibustering occurred when the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador reportedly had \"nothing else to do in the House of Assembly\" and debated between only themselves about their own budget after both the Conservative and New Democratic Parties indicated either their support for the bill or intent to vote.\n\nOn 28 October 1897, Dr. Otto Lecher, Delegate for Brünn, spoke continuously for twelve hours before the \"Abgeordnetenhaus\" (\"House of Delegates\") of the \"Reichsrat\" (\"Imperial Council\") of Austria, to block action on the \"Ausgleich\" with Hungary, which was due for renewal. Mark Twain was present, and described the speech and the political context in his essay \"Stirring Times in Austria\".\n\nIn the Southern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly, Independent member Dr Ahrn Palley staged a similar filibuster against the Law and Order Maintenance Bill on 22 November 1960, although this took the form of moving a long series of amendments to the Bill, and therefore consisted of multiple individual speeches interspersed with comments from other Members. Palley kept the Assembly sitting from 8 PM to 12:30 PM the following day.\n\nIn the Senate of the Philippines, Roseller Lim of the Nacionalista Party held out the longest filibuster in Philippine Senate history. On the election for the President of the Senate of the Philippines in April 1963, he stood on the podium for more than 18 hours to wait for party-mate Alejandro Almendras who was to arrive from the United States. The Nacionalistas, who comprised exactly half of the Senate, wanted to prevent the election of Ferdinand Marcos to the Senate Presidency. Prohibited from even going to the comfort room, he had to relieve himself in his pants until Almendras' arrival. He voted for party-mate Eulogio Rodriguez just as Almendras arrived, and had to be carried off via stretcher out of the session hall due to exhaustion. However, Almendras voted for Marcos, and the latter wrested the Senate Presidency from the Nacionalistas after more than a decade of control.\n\nOn December 16, 2010, Werner Kogler of the Austrian Green Party gave his speech before the budget committee, criticizing the failings of the budget and the governing parties (Social Democratic Party and Austrian People's Party) in the last years. The filibuster lasted for 12 hours and 42 minutes (starting at 13:18, and speaking until 2:00 in the morning), thus breaking the previous record held by his party-colleague Madeleine Petrovic (10 hours and 35 minutes on March 11, 1993), after which the standing orders had been changed, so speaking time was limited to 20 minutes. However, it didn't keep Kogler from giving his speech.\n\nThe filibuster is a powerful legislative device in the United States Senate. Senate rules permit a senator or senators to speak for as long as they wish and on any topic they choose, unless \"three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn\" (usually 60 out of 100 senators) bring debate to a close by invoking cloture under Senate Rule XXII. Even if a filibuster attempt is unsuccessful, the process takes floor time. Defenders call the filibuster \"The Soul of the Senate.\"\n\nIt is not part of the US Constitution, becoming theoretically possible with a change of Senate rules only in 1806, and never being used until 1837. Rarely used for much of the Senate's first two centuries, it was strengthened in the 1970s and in recent years, the majority has preferred to avoid filibusters by moving to other business when a filibuster is threatened and attempts to achieve cloture have failed. As a result, in recent decades this has come to mean that all major legislation (apart from budgets) now requires a 60% majority to pass.\n\nUnder current Senate rules, any modification or limitation of the filibuster would be a rule change that itself could be filibustered, with two-thirds of those senators present and voting (as opposed to the normal three-fifths of those sworn) needing to vote to break the filibuster. However, under Senate precedents, a simple majority can (and has) acted to limit the practice by overruling decisions of the chair. The removal or substantial limitation of the filibuster by a simple majority, rather than a rule change, is called the constitutional option by proponents, and the nuclear option by opponents.\n\nOn November 21, 2013, the Democratic controlled Senate voted 52 to 48 to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of all executive and judicial nominees, excluding Supreme Court nominees, rather than the 3/5 of votes previously required. On April 6, 2017, the Republican controlled Senate voted 52 to 48 to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of Supreme Court nominees. A 3/5 supermajority is still required to end filibusters on legislation.\n\nIn the United States House of Representatives, the filibuster (the right to unlimited debate) was used until 1842, when a permanent rule limiting the duration of debate was created. The disappearing quorum was a tactic used by the minority until Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed eliminated it in 1890. As the membership of the House grew much larger than the Senate, the House had acted earlier to control floor debate and the delay and blocking of floor votes. On February 7, 2018, Nancy Pelosi set a record for the longest speech on the House floor (8 hours and 7 minutes), in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\nOnly 13 state legislatures have a filibuster:\n\nIn France, in August 2006, the left-wing opposition submitted 137,449 amendments to the proposed law bringing the share in Gaz de France owned by the French state from 80% to 34% in order to allow for the merger between Gaz de France and Suez. Normal parliamentary procedure would require 10 years to vote on all the amendments.\n\nThe French constitution gives the government two options to defeat such a filibuster. The first one was originally the use of the article 49 paragraph 3 procedure, according to which the law was adopted except if a majority is reached on a non-confidence motion (a reform of July 2008 resulted in this power being restricted to budgetary measures only, plus one time each ordinary session – i.e. from October to June – on any bill. Before this reform, article 49, 3 was frequently used, especially when the government was short a majority in the Assemblée nationale to support the text but still enough to avoid a non-confidence vote). The second one is the article 44 paragraph 3 through which the government can force a global vote on all amendments it did not approve or submit itself.\n\nIn the end, the government did not have to use either of those procedures. As the parliamentary debate started, the left-wing opposition chose to withdraw all the amendments to allow for the vote to proceed. The \"filibuster\" was aborted because the opposition to the privatisation of Gaz de France appeared to lack support amongst the general population. It also appeared that this privatisation law could be used by the left-wing in the presidential election of 2007 as a political argument. Indeed, Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP – the right wing party), Interior Minister, former Finance Minister and former President, had previously promised that the share owned by the French government in Gaz de France would never go below 70%.\n\nThe first incidence of filibuster in the Legislative Council (LegCo) after the Handover occurred during the second reading of the Provision of Municipal Services (Reorganization) Bill in 1999, which aimed at dissolving the partially elected Urban Council and Regional Council. As the absence of some pro-Establishment legislators would mean an inadequate support for the passing of the bill, the Pro-establishment Camp filibustered along with Michael Suen, the then-Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, the voting of the bill was delayed to the next day and that the absentees could cast their votes. Though the filibuster was criticised by the pro-democracy camp, Lau Kong-wah of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) defended their actions, saying \"it (a filibuster) is totally acceptable in a parliamentary assembly.\"\n\nLegislators of the Pro-democracy Camp filibustered during a debate about financing the construction of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link by raising many questions on very minor issues, delaying the passing of the bill from 18 December 2009 to 16 January 2010. The Legislative Council Building was surrounded by thousands of anti-high-speed rail protesters during the course of the meetings.\n\nIn 2012, Albert Chan and Wong Yuk-man of People Power submitted a total of 1306 amendments to the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill, by which the government attempted to forbid lawmakers from participating in by-elections after their resignation. The bill was a response to the so-called 'Five Constituencies Referendum, in which 5 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp resigned and then joined the by-election, claiming that it would affirm the public's support to push forward the electoral reform. The pro-democracy camp strongly opposed the bill, saying it was seen a deprivation of the citizens' political rights. As a result of the filibuster, the LegCo carried on multiple overnight debates on the amendments. In the morning of 17 May 2012, the President of the LegCo (Jasper Tsang) terminated the debate, citing Article 92 of the Rules of Procedure of LegCo: \"In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures.\" In the end, all motions to amend the bill were defeated and the Bill was passed.\n\nTo ban filibuster, Ip Kwok-him of the DAB sought to limit each member to move only one motion, by amending the procedures of the Finance Committee and its two subcommittees in 2013. All 27 members from pan-democracy camp submitted 1.9 million amendments. The Secretariat estimated that 408 man-months (each containing 156 working hours) were needed to vet the facts and accuracy of the motions, and, if all amendments were admitted by the Chairman, the voting time would take 23,868 two-hour meetings.\n\n, filibustering is still an ongoing practice in Hong Kong by the pan-democratic party, but at the same time, the pan-democratic party are undergoing huge amounts of fire from the pro-Beijing camp for making filibustering a norm in the Legislative Council.\n\nIn Italy, filibustering has ancient traditions and is expressed overall with the proposition of legal texts on which interventions take place.\n\nIn Iranian oil nationalisation, the filibustering speech of Hossain Makki, the National Front deputy took four days that made the pro-British and pro-royalists in Majlis (Iran) inactive. To forestall a vote, the opposition, headed by Hossein Makki, conducted a filibuster. For four days Makki talked about the country's tortuous experience with AIOC and the shortcomings of the bill. Four days later when the term ended the debate had reached no conclusion. The fate of the bill remained to be decided by the next Majlis.\n\nSouth Korean opposition lawmakers started a filibuster on February 23, 2016 to stall the Anti-Terrorism bill, which they claim will give too much power to the National Intelligence Service and result in invasions of citizens' privacy. As of March 2, the filibuster completed with a total of 193 hours, and the passing of the bill. South Korea's 20th legislative elections were held 2 months after the filibuster, and the opposite party the Minjoo Party of Korea won more seats than the ruling party, the Saenuri Party.\n\nCatalonia at Spain, pro-union members used filibuster 11 hours on September 6, 2017, to stall independence referendum, but failed.\n\n\n\n"}

Bush by J.H. Hatfield. The book was published in 1999 during the run-up to Bush's candidacy in the United States 2000 presidential election by St. Martin's Press, and retracted by the publisher.\n\nThe book alleges that Bush received preferential treatment throughout his life, from his early schooling at Andover, Yale and Harvard, to his business connections in Midland, Texas, and his personal ownership interest in the Texas Rangers baseball team, to his candidacy for Governor and President. Hatfield argues that Bush succeeded in life not on merit, but on family connections alone, as a member of a modern oligarchy.\n\nSoon after the book's release, \"The Dallas Morning News\" reported that Hatfield was a paroled felon who had been convicted in 1988 of paying a hit man $5,000 to murder his former boss with a car bomb. It was also revealed that Hatfield pleaded guilty to embezzlement in 1992. Hatfield at first denied the allegations when his publisher confronted him, but he eventually owned up to his criminal history.\n\nBush stated, regarding Hatfield:\nHatfield stated in a later interview that the book had been \"carefully fact-checked and scrutinized by lawyers\" before the Bush campaign brought pressure to bear, as publicly stated by St. Martin's Press.\n\nDue to the revelations of Hatfield's criminal past, and the damage to his credibility, in October 1999, Hatfield's publisher, St. Martin's Press, recalled 70,000 copies of \"Fortunate Son\" and left an additional 20,000 books in storage. Even so, the book had already reached the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. The book was later republished by Soft Skull Press.\n\nHatfield died on July 18, 2001, in what was apparently a suicide, dying of an overdose of prescription drugs. Police reports cited the events occurring in the aftermath of \"Fortunate Son\"s publication as a reason for taking his own life.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17098990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17098990", "title": "George Wigram", "text": "George Wigram\n\nGeorge Vicesimus Wigram (28 March 1805 – 1 February 1879) was an English biblical scholar and theologian.\n\nHe was the 20th child (hence his middle name) of Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet, a famous and wealthy merchant, and the 14th child of Lady Eleanor Wigram, Robert's 2nd wife (an aunt to Charles Stewart Parnell). His family were all capable and several of his siblings became illustrious in their own field. Sir James Wigram became a judge and Vice-Chancellor; Joseph Cotton Wigram became Bishop of Rochester, Loftus Wigram was a barrister and politician, and Octavius Wigram was prominent as an insurance underwriter in the City of London.\n\nAs a young man George Wigram obtained a commission in the army. One of his postings was to Brussels. He spent an evening exploring the Waterloo battlefield and it was here he had a religious experience that changed his life. He wrote of it thus, \"suddenly there came on my soul a something I had never known before. It was as if some One, Infinite and Almighty, knowing everything, full of the deepest, tenderest interest in myself, though utterly and entirely abhorring everything in, and connected with me, made known to me that He pitied and loved myself\". This led to his resigning his commission in the army and in 1826 he entered Queens College, Oxford, with the intention of becoming an Anglican clergyman.\n\nAt Oxford he met John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Wills Newton. Dissatisfied with the established church, Wigram and his friends left the Anglican church and helped establish non-denominational assemblies which became known as the Plymouth Brethren.\nHe had considered joining Anthony Norris Groves and his mission to Baghdad in June 1829, but changed his mind just prior to the faith mission set off. \nAfter leaving Oxford University, Wigram, using his family wealth, in 1831 bought church premises in Plymouth and there established a Brethren assembly. During the 1830s Wigram also financed the establishment of assemblies in London.\n\nWigram had a keen interest in the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible, which was of great interest to the emerging Brethren assemblies. In 1839, after years of work and financial investment, he published \"The Englishman's Greek and English Concordance to the New Testament\", followed in 1843 by \"The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance to the Old Testament\". He also edited the influential Brethren periodical \"Present Testimony and Original Christian Witness\" for many years (from 1849 to his death with posthumous issues running to 1881). This periodical superseded the Brethren's first magazine, \"The Christian Witness\".\nBesides his literary work his oral ministry was considered to be marked by an attractive freshness: a contemporary remarked that his \"very face became radiant as he spoke\". Many of his addresses have been preserved and published in the two volumes \"Memorials of the Ministry of G.V. Wigram\" and \"Gleanings from the Teaching of G.V. Wigram\". These were collected by the erstwhile Lewisham Road Baptist Church Minister, Edward Dennett.\n\nWith Wigram's help, Darby became the most influential personality within the Brethren movement. Wigram is often referred to as being Darby's lieutenant as he firmly supported Darby during moments of crisis. In 1845 he supported Darby in his doctrinal differences with Benjamin Wills Newton in the Brethren assembly at Plymouth. In Darby's 1848 dispute with George Müller, Wigram again sided with Darby in relation to the reception of believers who had previously been in fellowship with Newton, and on Müller's reluctance to publicly denounce errors by Newton in regards to the sufferings of Christ (errors which Newton had already retracted). He also helped Darby fend off accusations of heresy, also in regards to the sufferings of Christ, in articles written in 1858 and 1866, which some considered were very similar to Newton's errors two decades earlier.\n\nWigram married Fanny Bligh in 1830, the daughter of Thomas Cherburgh Bligh whom Wigram had known as a girl in Ireland; she died in 1834. His second marriage was to Catherine, the only daughter of William Parnell of Avondale. Their London home was 3 Howley Place, Harrow Road, London. In 1867, Wigram visited Canada. His wife Catherine joined him there two months later, but became ill and died after a short illness in Canada. The family physician was Limerick-born Dr Thomas Mackern. Wigram was 62 years old. Four years later his daughter Fanny Theodosia, child of his first wife, died.\n\nWigram travelled in the UK preaching and teaching in large Brethren assemblies. He visited Switzerland in 1853 and again in Vaud Canton in 1858. In later life he went abroad to minister to the many overseas assemblies of the Brethren, including Boston and Canada in 1867. Writing in November 1871, from Demerara, British Guiana, he said, \"I came out in my old age, none save Himself with me\". He visited Jamaica in 1872. This led to further travel, visiting Australia and New Zealand in 1873-75 and again in 1877-78.\n\nBesides travel he maintained a wide correspondence with labourers in emerging Brethren assemblies. Among these were Louis Favez of Mauritius.\n\nWigram contributed to the hymnology of the Brethren assemblies in a number of ways. He edited the anthology \"Hymns for the Poor of the Flock\" (1838). This collection contained hymns by Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper, Thomas Kelly and others; and an appendix was added, chiefly to include a number of hymns by Sir Edward Denny that had just been written. The four earliest of John Nelson Darby's were also inserted. 18 years later (1856) Wigram compiled \"A Few Hymns and some Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock\" to replace the previous collection. This hymnbook was revised by Darby in 1881, William Kelly in 1894 and again by T.H. Reynolds in 1903.\n\nWigram also wrote a number of hymns and these include the following\n\nWigram died in 1879 at the age of 74 and was buried with his daughter in Paddington Cemetery by the side of Sir Edward Denny. It has been said that the large concourse of people there sang a hymn in deference to his wish expressed in his lifetime, so that all might understand that he owed all to the sovereign mercy of God. The hymn sung was: \"Nothing but mercy'll do for me, / Nothing but mercy – full and free, / Of sinners chief – what but the blood / Could calm my soul, before my God\".\n\n"}

The kingship signified the exceptional status of Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nOttokar's Přemyslid ancestor Vratislaus II had already been elevated to a Bohemian king by Emperor Henry IV in 1085, in return for his support during the Saxon revolt and the Investiture Controversy. He was crowned at Prague by Archbishop Egilbert of Trier the next year, the title however was not hereditary and upon his death in 1092, his brother Conrad I succeeded him again as Bohemian duke. In 1158 Vratislaus' grandson Vladislaus II achieved kingship again, bestowed by Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, whom he had accompanied on his Italian campaign against Milan, but failed to secure the succession of his eldest son Frederick.\n\nIn September 1198 Frederick's younger half-brother Ottokar I made use of the rivalry among Otto IV from the House of Welf and the Hohenstaufen duke Philip of Swabia, youngest son of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who both had been elected King of the Romans. He received the hereditary royal title by Philip for his support and, maneuvering between both sides, achieved the acknowledgement by Otto IV as well as by Pope Innocent III. After the assassination of Philip and the papal ban imposed on Otto IV in 1210, Ottokar again switched sides, when he and several princes in 1211 convened at Nuremberg and elected the young Hohenstaufen scion Frederick II \"alium imperatorem\" (\"Other Emperor\"). Frederick, then King of Sicily, left for his coronation in Germany, reaching Basel in September 1212. Here he issued the Golden Bull that confirmed the kingship of Ottokar I and his heirs in Bohemia.\n\nAccording to the Golden Bull of Sicily, the estates of Bohemia and Moravia were an autonomous and undivisible constituent of the Holy Roman Empire. The King of Bohemia was no longer subject to appointment by the Emperor, and was only required to attend Reichstag diets close to the Bohemian border. Although a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemian king was to be the premier Prince-elector (\"Kurfürst\") of the Empire and to furnish all subsequent Emperors with a bodyguard of 300 knights when they went to Rome for their coronation. By this act Frederick II also declared that he and the Empire will give the investiture for Bohemia only to a ruler approved by the people of the country.\n\nWhen in 1346 King Charles IV united the rule over Bohemia and Germany in his hands, he established the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, which remained beyond the Empire's suzerainty and were not considered Imperial States.\n\nAs part of the 800th anniversary of the document's signature, the document was put on public display at the National Archive for four days in September 2012.\n\n"}

Originally part of the Federal Writers' Project, it was devoted to surveying and indexing historically significant records in state, county and local archives. The official mission statement was the \"discovery, preservation, and listing of basic materials for research in the history of the United States.\"\n\nOrganized on November 15, 1935 under the direction of Luther H. Evans with a budget of $1,195,800, the Survey began life under the Federal Writers' Project. It became an independent division of Federal Project Number One in October 1936 within the Works Progress Administration's Women's and Professional Division. In 1939, with more artistic federal programs under attack from Congress, partly because they employed suspected Communists, the less controversial HRS was moved to the Work Projects Administration Research and Records Program, Professional and Service Division. The program was shut down February 1, 1943.\n\nIn 1939 the federal government handed off the program's activities to willing state governments; each state had its own supervisor co-ordinating the Survey's activities.\n\nThe HRC, headquartered in Washington, D.C., was organized into subdivisions (regional, state, district) and much of the work was done at the behest of the National Archives and Records Administration or state archive agencies. The HRS sometimes cooperated with the Daughters of the American Revolution and other volunteer groups with an interest in local history and genealogy.\n\nThe HRS was generally considered the most efficient and inexpensive of the Federal One projects. However, because of the program's short lifespan, many of the indexes were not published and remain in only piecemeal form in local and state record repositories.\n\nAccording to Clifton Dale Foster,\n\nOther accomplishments included the soundex indexes for several of the states for several of the late 19th-century U.S. Censuses (1880, 1900, 1910, 1920), indexes of vital statistics, book indexes, bibliographies, cemetery indexes and newspaper indexes, the \"Atlas of Congressional Roll Calls Project\", a historical index of American musicians, surveys of portraits in public buildings, maritime records, a history of grazing, a food history project called \"America Eats\", and a necessary survey of the federal Archives—NARA itself had been established only in 1934.\n\nThe Survey also innovated in archival practice. For example, it made use of new microfilm technology, experimented with its use in archiving, and advanced on previously existing practices.\n\n\n\n"}

The hut was headed by Hugh Foss who reported to Frank Birch, the head of Bletchley's Naval section.\n\nHut 7 supplied cryptanalysts and linguists to Bletchley’s front line station the Far East Combined Bureau (FECB) at Hong Kong, then Singapore, then Anderson Station (Colombo, Ceylon, now Sri Lanka), then Allidina School in Kilindini, Kenya before moving back to Colombo.\n\nBletchley co-operated with the US Navy Code and Signals Section known as OP-20-G in Washington D.C., and with FRUMEL in Melbourne (although the reciprocal cooperation from Fabian at FRUMEL was limited and reluctant).\n\nAmong the first challenges was overcoming the special kana and romaji Morse code system used by the Japanese. GC&CS began breaking Japanese diplomatic traffic in the early 1920s. GC&CS subsequently attacked the Naval Reporting Code, and General Operations Code.\n\nThe section was headed by William \"Nobby\" Clarke with Harry Shaw and Ernest Hobart-Hampden. These were later joined by Eric Nave, seconded from the Royal Australian Navy, John Tiltman, and Hugh Foss.\n\nGC&CS operated the Far East Combined Bureau, the codebreaking and intercept station in Hong Kong prewar, which during the war moved to Singapore, Colombo and Kilindini.\n\nPotential linguists and cryptographers were recruited from the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford by referral through people like the Revd Martin Charlesworth, A.D. Lindsay, Dr C. P. Snow, and Theodore Chaundy. Candidates were interviewed and approved by a board that included Colonel Tiltman. Successful candidates received a final interview at Bletchley by a senior representative of their section.\n\nAt the outset of World War II, Britain had few Japanese linguists and conventional wisdom held that it would require two years to produce qualified linguists for the war effort. In February 1942, an accelerated program was established to train linguists to assist with Japanese signals intelligence. Candidates were put through an intensive six-month course taught by Captain Oswald Tuck, RN. The course was taught in various locations in Bedford including the Gas Company. The course produced linguists for the Navy, Army, Air Force, and Foreign Office. Some of the linguists were sent on to Bletchley, while others were sent to London to work with Captain Malcolm Kennedy.\n\nLater cryptanalysts did not require linguistic training, so could be recruited and put to work directly. Some of these cryptanalysts received a shorter version of the Japanese language course.\n\nThe Japanese Naval Section was originally stationed at the Elmer School near Bletchley. By August 1942, the unit consisted of 40 people. The unit was moved inside Bletchley Park in September and again in February 1943 to Hut 7. The unit expanded (or moved) later to Block B.\n\nThe wooden structure of the hut was demolished sometime between 1948 and 1954.\n\nIn addition to code books and manual ciphers, the Imperial Japanese Navy also utilized electric cipher machines known as JADE and CORAL using the same technology as PURPLE. While OP-20-G took the lead on these systems, Bletchley provided some contributions.\n\nIn 1921, GC&CS was able to provide insight into the Japanese bargaining position at the Washington Naval Conference of the nine major powers and limit their ambitions.\n\nPre-war accomplishments were helped tremendously by the death of Emperor Taishō in 1926. The repetition of the formal announcement provided GC&CS with cribs into almost every code in use. Later in 1934, Foss was able to break an early Japanese cipher machine.\n\nTiltman provided the major break into JN25 in 1939.\n\nIn early 1942, decrypts from Anderson gave advance warning of Vice Admiral Nagumo's Indian Ocean raid including a planned attack on Colombo. The warning allowed the British to limit damage, improve opposition, and evacuate the fleet and the cryptanalysts from Colombo to Kilindini.\n\nIn May 1945, the team at HMS Anderson successfully broke a message in JN25 that provided details of a supply convoy going from Singapore to the Andaman Islands. This message provided details that led to the sinking of the Japanese cruiser Haguro in the Battle of the Malacca Strait.\n\nThe following people served in Hut 7, HMS Anderson, and Kilindini:\n\n"}

Books have been translated for thousands of years, with no central record of the fact. The League of Nations established a record of translations in 1932. In 1946, the United Nations superseded the League and UNESCO was assigned the Index. In 1979, the records were computerised.\n\nSince the Index counts translations of individual books, authors with many books with few translations can rank higher than authors with a few books with more translations. So, for example, while the Bible is the single most translated book in the world, it does not rank in the top ten of the index. The Index counts the Walt Disney Company, employing many writers, as a single writer. Authors with similar names are sometimes included as one entry, for example, the ranking for \"Hergé\" applies not only to the author of \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (Hergé), but also to B.R. Hergehahn, Elisabeth Herget, and Douglas Hergert. Hence, the top authors, as the Index presents them, are from a database query whose results require interpretation.\n\nAccording to the Index, Agatha Christie remains the most-translated individual author.\n\nSource:UNESCO\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15679978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15679978", "title": "Israeli Apartheid Week", "text": "Israeli Apartheid Week\n\nIsraeli Apartheid Week is an annual series of university lectures and rallies. The series is held in February or March. According to the organization, \"the aim of IAW is to educate people about the nature of Israel as an apartheid system and to build Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns as part of a growing global BDS movement.\" Since IAW began in Toronto in 2005, it has since spread to at least 55 cities around the world including locations in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Botswana, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Jordan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Palestine, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nIsraeli Apartheid Week has garnered much controversy since its inception and has been criticized by some as anti-Semitic.\n\nThe organizers said the week has \"played an important role in raising awareness and disseminating information about Zionism, the Palestinian liberation struggle and its similarities with the indigenous sovereignty struggle in North America and the South African anti-Apartheid movement.\" An international divestment campaign was also said to have gained momentum in response to the 2005 statement by over 170 Palestinian civil society organizations who called for boycotts, divestments and sanctions. They also claimed that important gains had been made in the campaign in countries like South Africa, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.\n\nThe years preceding 2008, a significant year in that it marked the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel, had seen a sharp increase of literature and analysis that was said to have sought to document and challenge alleged Israeli apartheid, including reports issued by major international bodies and human rights organizations and findings published by political leaders, thinkers, academics, and activists. The efforts were also said to have highlighted the role that people and governments across the world could play in providing \"solidarity with the Palestinian struggle by exerting urgent pressure on Israel to alter its current structure and practices as an apartheid state.\"\n\nCities to have hosted a previous event of the Week are, amongst others: Oxford University (Oxford), New York City, University of Toronto and University of Ottawa, Canada; Montreal, Hamilton, London, Cambridge and Soweto, South Africa.\n\nSpeakers have included Balad MK Jamal Zahalka in 2007 and former MK Azmi Bishara, also of Balad, who began Israeli Apartheid Week 2008 with a live broadcast from Soweto.\n\nIn 2009, locations included Abu Dis, Berkeley, Boston College, Emory University, Bir Zeit, Edinburgh, Edmonton, Johannesburg, Oxford, Kalkilya, San Francisco, Soweto, Tulkarm and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2010, locations include \nJerusalem, Amsterdam, Bard (NY), Beirut, Berkeley, Bethlehem, Bil'in, Bogota, Bologna, Boston, Cape Town, Caracas, Chicago, Connecticut, Duluth, Dundee, Durban, Eastern Cape, Edinburgh, Edmonton, Gaza, Glasgow, Guelph, Hamilton, Houston, Ireland, Jenin, Johannesburg, Kingston, London (ON), London (UK), Madrid, Melbourne, Minneapolis/St.Paul, Montréal, Nablus, New York City, Nil'in,\nOttawa, Oxford, Peterborough, Pisa, Pretoria, Providence, Puebla, Roma, San Francisco, Seattle, Sudbury, Tilburg, Toronto, Truro (CA), Utrecht, Vancouver, Waterloo and Winnipeg.\n\nIn 2014, locations include \nVienna, Brussels, Ghent, Botswana, Cuiaba, Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Peterborough, Regina, Sudbury, Toronto, Vancouver, Waterloo, Winnipeg, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Joensuu, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Metz, Nantes, Paris, Strasbourg, Tours, Berlin, Freiberg, Stuttgart, Dehli, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Bologna, Cagliari, Rome, Venice, Japan, Amman, Irbid, Seoul, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Oslo, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gaza, Nablus, Naqab, Ramallah, Tulkarem, Yaffa (Jaffa), Aliwal North, Benoni, Cape Town, Durban, Fleurhof, Grahamstown, Johannesburg, Laudium, Mitchells Plain, Orange Farm, Pietermaritzburg, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Port Shepstone, Pretoria, Roshnee, Rustenburg, Soweto, Stellenbosch, Barcelona, Gijon, Irunea, Madrid, Palma, Sevilla, Valencia, Malmo, Stockholm, Basel, Berne, Geneva, Syria, Golan Heights, Bangkok, Birmingham, Bradford, Cambridge, Dundee, Durham, Edinburgh, Essex, Exeter, Glasgow, Kent, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Northampton, Nottingham, Oxford, Sheffield, Southampton, Sussex, London, Albuquerque, Arizona, Beaumont, Boston, Cambridge, Chicago, Dearborn, Delaware, Louisville, Maryland, Massachusetts, Milwaukee, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Olympia, Omaha, Philadelphia, Seattle, Toledo and Washington DC.\n\nThe first Israeli Apartheid week was held on January 31 to February 4, 2005.\n\nThe 2006 Israeli Apartheid week was held on February 13 to 17, 2006.\n\nThe 2007 Israeli Apartheid week was held on February 12 to 17, 2007.\n\nThe 4th Annual Israeli Apartheid Week 2008 was officially launched on February 3, 2008 in Soweto, South Africa as the \"exiled Palestinian Israeli Knesset\" Azmi Bishara, gave a lecture on the 60th anniversary of the Palestinian \"Nakba\". The conference continued till the 19th of the same month. The week of the event was February 4 to February 9, 2008.\n\nThe 2009 Israeli Apartheid Week was held on March 1 to 8, 2009.\n\nThe 2010 Israeli Apartheid Week was held on March 1 to 6, 2010.\n\nThe 2014 Israeli Apartheid Week was held on February 24 to March 28 in over 50 cities around the world.\n\nIn 2012, the Palestine Society of the London School of Economics (LSE) erected a mock \"Israeli Apartheid Wall,\" which led to a confrontation after Pro-Israel students threw waterballoons at the mock wall in protest.\n\nIn 2013, Harvard University's Palestine Solidarity Committee, which organizes Israeli Apartheid Week at Harvard University, posted mock eviction notices on students' dorm room doors.\n\nU.S. scholar and MIT professor Noam Chomsky has spoken various times at many university campuses as part of Israeli Apartheid Week.\n\nBen White, a freelance journalist and author of two books on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, has also been active speaker during Israeli Apartheid Week both in the United States and the United Kingdom including his alma mater Cambridge.\n\nIsraeli historian and Exeter professor Ilan Pappé has also spoken at Israeli Apartheid Week events throughout the UK.\n\nIsraeli historian and Oxford professor Avi Shlaim has given speeches at Israeli Apartheid Week, including one at the London School of Economics.\n\nIsraeli Apartheid Week events are almost always hosted by solidarity societies and organizations associated with academic institutions. Speakers at the various meetings around the world support the goals of the Week. An Arab citizen of Israel and Member of the Knesset, Jamal Zahalka, spoke in Montréal in 2007. He said: \"Calling the occupation apartheid isn’t an overstatement, it’s an understatement. The Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are worse than apartheid.\n\nIn 2014, South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, officially endorsed the Israeli Apartheid Week. The ANC, which led the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, said participating in this year's Apartheid Week was part of its commitment to the international anti-apartheid movement and that it remains “unequivocal in its support for the Palestinian people in their struggle for self-determination, and unapologetic in its view that the Palestinians are the victims and the oppressed in the conflict with Israel.\"\n\nAccording to IAW organizers, there has been \"a sharp increase of literature and analysis that has sought to document and challenge Israeli apartheid, including reports issued by major international bodies and human rights organizations and findings published by political leaders, thinkers, academics, and activists.\"\n\nThe University of Toronto president, David Naylor, said of the week featuring the events \"this isn’t [my] favourite time of year.\" However, Dr. Naylor responded to objections from the \"Friends of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies\", in signing a statement that declared, \"We do, in fact, recognize that the term Israeli Apartheid is upsetting to many people, [but] we also recognize that, in every society, universities have a unique role to provide a safe venue for highly charged discourse.\"\n\nUniversity of Manitoba President David Barnard, in a report to the Board of Governors regarding Israeli Apartheid Week in 2010, that \"while he had not personally attended any of the events, the events proceeded as anticipated and were orderly. He added that he had received a lot of communication from the external community regarding this, and that while there were a number of people against the event, there was also support for the University's position in allowing the event to proceed.\" In 2011, Barnard responded publicly to complaints about IAW, saying \"Ultimately, we have an obligation to uphold the right to freedom of expression, and will not censor an individual or group for what has not yet been expressed.\"\n\nIn 2013, UC Berkeley spokesperson, Dan Mogulof, stated that the campus agreed to consider clarifying its demonstration policies but would not curtail student speech. The Office for Civil Rights and a federal judge declared that the \"university has no right or ability to trample on the constitutional rights of students.\"\n\nTwo Berkeley students filed charges in July 2012 that the annual apartheid week events on campus has led to more anti-semitism on campus. Federal officials, in 2013, dismissed the claim stating that \"the events did not constitute actionable harassment.\" A UC spokesperson added, criticism of Israel is not necessarily anti-Semitic.\n\nIn 2007 the event spread to New York University, Columbia University and Hunter College in New York City. The David Project, organized meetings the same week in opposition to the characterization of Israel as an apartheid state, and the American Jewish Committee Koppelman Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations denounced the apartheid week saying \"the specter of apartheid should not be raised in any form.\"\n\nIn 2008 Israel's ambassador to Canada, Alan Baker, denounced Israeli Apartheid Week as \"crude propagandism, pure hypocrisy and cynical manipulation of the student body.\"\n\nOrganizers of the counter protest stated that they \"want to remove the connection that modern-day students have to the word apartheid and Israel and refocus it to the countries that we think really exemplify the definition of apartheid, being a policy of separation and segregation. Through a week which encompasses the themes of gender, sexual and political apartheid, we hope to get out a new message.\"\n\nIn February 2010, 30 members of the Ontario Provincial legislature of Ontario voted to condemn IAW as being \"odious, hateful and inappropriate.\" The largely symbolic vote received support from all three of Ontario's political parties.\n\nGay columnist and pornographic film producer Michael Lucas has called Israel Apartheid Week \"a hate group\" and \"a group of antisemites.\" In February 2011 he brought about the cancellation of a planned event involving New York's LGBT Center and Israel Apartheid Week after threatening to organize a boycott of large donors to the center. He said of his achievement that it was a landmark moment in his life, of which he was enormously proud.\n\nIn advance of the 2011 IAW, the government of Israel chose a group of Israelis, including Arabs, gays, Ethiopian Jews and an MTV \"VJ\" (presenter) to oppose the apartheid analogy used by going on a speaking tour of the United States; an additional group went to Britain \"to combat anti-Israel messages students there are receiving from Israel Apartheid Week activities.\"\n\nOn March 3, 2011, Historian Catherine Chatterley wrote an editorial for the \"National Post\" outlining the history of Israel Apartheid Week and its relationship to the BDS movement.\n\nThat same month, various Canadian government and other political figures, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney and Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff all criticized IAW. Kenney indicated that he was \"deeply concerned about the events and activities\" associated with IAW and said that the event was \"all too often [...] accompanied by anti-Semitic harassment, intimidation and bullying.\" He further indicated that students participating IAW were \"free [...] to speak their mind\" but encouraged them to \"reflect on whether these activities are beneficial.\" Ignatieff, in condemning the week, said it is a “dangerous cocktail of ignorance and intolerance” that threatens “the mutual respect” of Canadian society. Kenney has also accused the organizers of IAW of using \"the cover of academic freedom to demonize and de-legitimize the state of Israel. This week is nothing more than an unbalanced attempt to paint Israel and her supporters as racist. I call on all Canadians to reject anti-Semitism and all forms of racism, discrimination and intolerance.\" Conservative MP David Anderson has stated that labelling Israel as an apartheid state is \"abhorrent,\" and interim Liberal leader Bob Rae said the campaign \"continues to defy logic. This year the focus continues to be on Israel, rather than on the appalling massacres and human rights violations that have reached intolerable heights in countries such as Syria and Iran.\"\n\nIn April 2011, 16 African-American members of the Vanguard Leadership Group published full page ads in several U.S. university newspapers, with an \"Open Letter to Students for Justice in Palestine\" saying that the SJP's use of the word \"apartheid\" in regards to Israel and Israel Apartheid Week \"is not only false, but offensive.\"\n\nStuart Appelbaum, gay president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union feels that those groups opposing the New York LGBT Center’s decision to prohibit an Israel Apartheid Week March 2011 event were intellectually dishonest, saying \"This was not a question of free speech. This was hate speech. The center should not be used as a venue for racism, Islamophobia or anti-Semitism. Nor did they even care about free speech. The same groups have consistently sought to ban and prevent supporters of Israel from expressing their views.\"\n\nIn February 2012 the Public Diplomacy Ministry of Israel created the \"Faces of Israel\" mission to the United States, Canada, Ireland, Spain, Great Britain, and South Africa, comprising 100 Israelis including \"settlers, Arabs, artists, experts in national security, gay people, and immigrants from Ethiopia\" and actor Aki Avni, in order to \"represent and defend the state during Israel Apartheid Week.\"\n\nIn February 2012, Jonathan Kay sharply criticized IAW in the \"National Post\", stating that \"In Syria, the Assad regime continues to rain artillery on rebel positions in the city of Homs, killing journalists and innocent civilians alike. Iran's mullahs are set to execute a Canadian citizen for the crime of operating a website they don't like. The new Libyan regime is torturing Gaddafi loyalists. And Egypt's rulers are prosecuting NGO leaders on trumped up charges. And so next week, Canadian left-wing activists will congregate in Toronto to express their hatred of ... you guessed it: Israel.\" In the same article, Kay commented that not all IAW activists \"seek the outright destruction of Israel—[but] many certainly do. Some are merely naïve undergraduates. ... But all of them should understand that IAW and BDS are not what they seem: As some of Israel's own fiercest critics themselves now admit, these are dishonest cults meant to enlist ill-informed activists in a campaign to destroy the Jewish state.\"\n\nIn 2013, the University of Manitoba Students' Union (UMSU) in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, became the first student government in the world to remove Students Against Israeli Apartheid's student group status and ban it from using student union spaces. The council passed the motion banning the group after hearing evidence that Students Against Israel Apartheid and its \"Israel Apartheid Week\" violated student union policies by \"undermining the dignity and self esteem of students on campus\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2798890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2798890", "title": "Jack Brisco", "text": "Jack Brisco\n\nFreddie Joe \"Jack\" Brisco (September 21, 1941 – February 1, 2010) was an American professional wrestler. He performed for various territories of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), becoming a two-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, and multi-time NWA Tag Team Champion with his brother Gerald Brisco. Brisco is considered one of the top wrestlers of his era; in 2005, Don Leo Jonathan called him \"probably the greatest champion of the 20th century.\"\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Brisco brothers discovered Terry Bollea, the future wrestling legend best known as Hulk Hogan, whom they introduced to Hiro Matsuda for training.\n\nBrisco was raised in Blackwell, Oklahoma with five siblings. He grew up as a fan of professional wrestling, and particularly a fan of NWA World Champion Lou Thesz He was followed by his younger brother, Gerald Brisco, into sport wrestling and turned down a football scholarship at University of Oklahoma to go to Oklahoma State. In 1965, he became the first Native American to win an NCAA Wrestling National Championship. He won it during his junior year, and wasn't taken down once during the entire season.\n\nBrisco's first documented professional wrestling championship reign began on October 16, 1965, when he defeated Don Kent to win the NWA Missouri Junior Heavyweight Championship. He held the belt for less than a month, and regained it in November by defeating Kent again. Around this time, Brisco also wrestled for NWA Tri-State. While there, he won a couple of state titles (the Oklahoma Heavyweight Championship and the Arkansas Heavyweight Championship). He also won his first tag team title in this promotion, teaming with Haystacks Calhoun for his first reign as co-holder of the Tri-State version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. He later held the title again, as he teamed with Gorgeous George, Jr. to win the belts on May 9, 1967.\n\nBrisco then moved to the Florida area, where he wrestled for Championship Wrestling from Florida for several years. His first title there was the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship, which he won on February 11, 1969 by defeating The Missouri Mauler. He dropped the title to the Mauler and regained it on July 8. Two weeks later, he won the first of an eventual ten NWA Florida Tag Team Championships, with Ciclon Negro. Although he and Negro dropped the tag team belts the following month, Brisco held the Southern Heavyweight Title until November 1969, when he left the area to wrestle in Japan and Australia.\n\nWhen Brisco returned to Florida, he began teaming with his brother, who he had trained in professional wrestling. He also continued competing as a singles wrestler, winning the NWA Florida Television Championship on November 27, 1970. On February 16, 1971, the Briscos teamed up to win the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. They dropped the belts the next month to Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk and regained them from the Funks in April. That month, Brisco also beat Terry Funk in a singles match to win the NWA Florida Television Championship again. Brisco's next major success was regaining the Southern Heavyweight Championship from Dick Murdoch on June 8, 1971. The title was later held up after a controversial rematch with Murdoch.\n\nBrisco then took a short break from Florida wrestling to work for Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. While there, he won the NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Championship twice by defeating The Missouri Mauler and Rip Hawk.\n\nUpon his return to Florida, he quickly won the NWA Florida Brass Knuckles Championship from Paul Jones on June 13, 1972, and vacated it the same day. He then won his third and final Television Championship on November 7, 1972. Nine days later, he won the Tag Team Championship, again with his brother.\n\nBrisco's first NWA World Heavyweight Championship win was scheduled to be over Dory Funk Jr., capping off a multi-year feud. However, Dory claimed to be injured in a truck accident and missed the scheduled date. Brisco and Terry Funk were sent out to make the bookings that were already scheduled for Brisco, and Dory later lost the title to Harley Race. Brisco and several others within the NWA power structure always questioned the legitimacy of the accident, claiming Dory Funk Sr. did not want his son to lose to a \"pure\" wrestler and harm his credibility Brisco won the title from Race after a brief reign, in Houston, Texas on July 20, 1973. He defended the championship in NWA-affiliated promotions across the world facing top names like Johnny Valentine, Stan Stasiak, Abdullah The Butcher, Gene Kiniski, The Sheik and Bobby Shane until losing to Giant Baba on December 4, 1974. He regained it four days later. Brisco then defended the title until losing it to Terry Funk on December 10, 1975. His loss continued the extensive feud between the Briscos and Funks, which went on for several more years. During his initial reign as champion, Brisco toured Australia where he successfully defended his title against local favorite, Spiros Arion. \n\nIn 1976, Brisco wrestled in several promotions and continued to add to his list of titles. He won the Memphis version of the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship on August 10, 1976, by defeating local favorite Jerry Lawler. He won the NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship from Bob Backlund on November 26. At this time, the Briscos were also awarded the ESA International Tag Team Championship, although they did not wrestle as a team in the area.\n\nWrestling in Florida again, Brisco teamed with his brother to win several more championships. In 1977, they defeated Bob Orton, Jr. and Bob Roop for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Ox Baker and Superstar Billy Graham and soon regained it in a rematch. On January 25, 1978, they won the belts again by defeating Ivan Koloff and Mr. Saito. While holding these belts, they also won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship on February 21, from Mike Graham and Steve Keirn. They dropped the United States tag belts back to Graham and Keirn but soon regained them. They were defeated for the United States title by Killer Karl Kox and Bobby Duncum, and were again successful in regaining it in a rematch. The same thing happened when the Briscos faced Mr. Saito and Mr. Sato that year: they lost the belts and quickly won them back. The Briscos also defeated Saito and Sato to regain the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship. The following year, another victory over Saito and Sato earned the Briscos their final United States Tag Team Championship reign.\n\nThe Briscos also had success in Georgia Championship Wrestling, where they won the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship twice. They competed in a tournament for the tag team belts and finished in second place after a loss to the Funks. They defeated the Funks for the belts two months later. On November 25, 1979, the Briscos defeated Austin Idol and The Masked Superstar to win the belts a second time. Jack gave up his share of the title, however, to Ole Anderson. Later that year, Brisco became the first NWA National Heavyweight Champion by defeating Terry Funk in a tournament final.\n\nIn 1980, Brisco resumed wrestling in Florida. He won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship again, teaming with Jimmy Garvin this time. After losing the belts, Brisco teamed with his brother to win them for a final time.\n\nIn 1981, Brisco won his final Southern Heavyweight Championship by defeating Bobby Jaggers. He finished his time in Florida with two reigns as co-holder of Florida's version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship. He and his brother won a tournament to win their first title, defeating Assassin #1 and Bobby Jaggers in the finals. They lost the belts to the Funks on January 9, 1982, and regained them in a rematch one week later.\n\nBrisco also wrestled in Puerto Rico in 1981, for the World Wrestling Council. He won the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship on May 30, and held it for almost seven months. He teamed with his brother to win the WWC North American Tag Team Championship from Los Pastores (better known as The Bushwhackers) on August 8, holding it for six weeks before dropping it to The Fabulous Kangaroos. Brisco also returned to Missouri in 1981, defeating Ted DiBiase to win a second NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship. He held the belt for three weeks before losing it to Ken Patera.\n\nIn 1982, Brisco returned to Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. He regained the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship (formerly called the NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Championship) by defeating Roddy Piper on May 10, 1982. He dropped the title back to Piper on July 7 and regained it in August. After his matches with Piper, Brisco traded the title back and forth with Paul Jones several times. He lost the belt to Jones on September 1 and won it back on October 18. Jones won the belt again a week later, and dropped it back to Brisco in November.\n\nBrisco teamed with his brother to win the Mid-Atlantic version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship three times. As heels, they beat Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood for the belts on June 18, 1983. This set up a rivalry in which the belts switched hands several times. Steamboat and Youngblood regained the belts on October 3, but the Briscos won them back on October 21. They held the title for a little over a month before dropping it back to Steamboat and Youngblood. The Briscos again won the belts the following year, from Wahoo McDaniel and Mark Youngblood. In 1985 he fought Ric Flair for the NWA championship in Toronto.\n\nThe Briscos acquired minority interests in Georgia Championship Wrestling and, in 1984, convinced a majority (52%) of the shareholders to sell their shares to Vince McMahon, enabling him to increase his dominance of the professional wrestling world. The popular story that the Briscos were offered lifetime jobs with the WWF in exchange for selling their interests in Georgia Championship Wrestling was refuted by Jack Brisco in a 1996 interview for Wrestling Perspective.\n\nOn December 28, 1984, the Briscos challenged The North-South Connection (Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch) for the WWF Tag Team Championship in Madison Square Garden. The match ended in a double countout, and was Jack Brisco's last high-profile bout.\n\nJack left the business entirely in February 1985, while Jerry transitioned to a behind the scenes-role with the WWF/WWE which he kept until retiring in 2009 due to health problems.\n\nBrisco was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2005. Brisco lived in Florida where he ran the \"Brisco Brothers Body Shop\" with brothers Gerald and Bill for over 30 years. He has also made occasional wrestling appearances such as Florida's \"Wrestle Reunion\" in January 2005. Brisco is considered one of the great legendary wrestlers of the 1970s and has often been cited as such by Ric Flair during his emotional promos. Brisco and his brother, Gerald were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2008.\n\nOver the final few years of his life Jack suffered from bouts of pneumonia and back problems. He had been a heavy smoker. On February 1, 2010, Brisco died at the age of 68 from complications of open heart surgery. He was survived by his wife of over 30 years.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30160731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30160731", "title": "Liberian Declaration of Independence", "text": "Liberian Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Liberian Declaration of Independence is a document adopted by the Liberian Constitutional Convention on July 16, 1847 to announce that the Commonwealth of Liberia, a colony founded and controlled by the private American Colonization Society, was now an independent state known as the Republic of Liberia. The Declaration was written by Hilary Teague and adopted simultaneously with the first Constitution of Liberia. The anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration and accompanying Constitution is celebrated as Independence Day in Liberia.\n\nThe Declaration articulates the history of the Americo-Liberians that settled the Commonwealth and sets out the aspiration of Liberia to be accepted as a free and independent state within the \"comity which marks the friendly intercourse of civilized and independent communities.\" Listing the injustices committed against African Americans as a result of slavery in the United States, the Declaration notes the foundation of the colony by the American Colonization Society, as well as their gradual withdrawal from governance in favor of increasing self-governance by the immigrated colonists. The noted goal of Liberia is declared to be both to establish a state built upon the structure and principles of the law of nations and the Christianization and modernization of the indigenous peoples of the region.\n\nThe Declaration partially relied upon the United States Declaration of Independence, in particular its discussion of natural law:\n\nWe recognize in all men certain inalienable rights; among these are life, liberty, and the right to acquire, possess, enjoy, and defend property.\n\nFurthermore, its listing of injustices perpetrated by the United States parallels the charges set forth in the United States Declaration of Independence against King George III. However, the Liberian Declaration asserts no right of revolution, but instead frames its independence as the inevitable and planned purpose of the colony by the American Colonization Society. The Society, having surrendered all control of the colony in January 1846, had fully encouraged the independence of Liberia. The Commonwealth of Liberia declared its independence from the American Colonization Society on July 26, 1847 as the Republic of Liberia and Liberia became the first African nation on the African continent to gain its independence. On January 3, 1848 Joseph Jenkins Roberts an African-American from Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America, he was elected and became Liberia's first Black American president.\n\nThe Liberian constitution and flag was modeled after the Constitution of United States and the American flag because Liberia was the only African nation on the African continent that was a colony for the United States and Liberia was founded, colonized, established and controlled by freed American slaves and ex-caribbean slaves as settlers from the United States and the Caribbean islands with the help and support from the American Colonization Society, a private organization establishment.\n\nOn February 5, 1862 the United States finally accepted and recognized Liberia's Independence. From January 7, 1822 until the Liberian Declaration of Independence from the American Colonization Society, Liberia was the only African nation that was a colony for the United States and a protectorate. With the backing and support from the United States Liberia kept its independence during the colonial era. Liberia was never colonized or controlled by European powers making Liberia Africa's oldest republic nation on the African continent.\n\nTwelve delegates representing the three counties of Liberia signed the Declaration along with the Constitution of Liberia:\n\nMontserrado County\nGrand Bassa County\nSinoe County\n"}

{"id": "193629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193629", "title": "Mulatto", "text": "Mulatto\n\nMulatto () is a term used to refer to people born of one white parent and one black parent, or from two mulatto parents. In English usage, the term is today generally confined to historical contexts; modern English speakers of mixed white and black ancestry seldom choose to identify themselves as mulatto.\n\nThe English term \"mulatto\" is derived from the Spanish and Portuguese \"mulato\". The origin of \"mulato\" is uncertain.\n\nThe term may derive from \"mula\" (current Portuguese word, from the Latin \"mūlus\"), meaning mule, the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey. The Real Academia Española traces its origin to \"mulo\" in the sense of hybridity; originally used to refer to any mixed race person.\n\nSome dictionaries and scholarly works trace the word's origins to the Arabic term \"muwallad\", which means \"a person of mixed ancestry\". \"Muwallad\" literally means \"born, begotten, produced, generated; brought up\", with the implication of being born and raised among Arabs, but not of Arab blood. \"Muwallad\" is derived from the root word \"WaLaD\" (Arabic: ولد direct Arabic transliteration: \"waw, lam, dal\"), and colloquial Arabic pronunciation can vary greatly. \"Walad\" means, \"descendant, offspring, scion; child; son; boy; young animal, young one\".\n\nIn al-Andalus, \"Muwallad\" referred to the offspring of non-Arab/Muslim people who adopted the Islamic religion and manners. Specifically, the term was historically applied to the descendants of indigenous Christian Iberians who, after several generations of living among a Muslim majority, adopted their culture and religion. Notable examples of this category include the famous Muslim scholar Ibn Hazm. According to Lisan al-Arab, one of the earliest Arab dictionaries (c. 13th century AD), applied the term to the children of Non-Muslim (often Christian) slaves, or Non-Muslim children who were captured in a war and were raised by Muslims to follow their religion and culture. Thus, in this context, the term \"Muwalad\" has a meaning close to \"the adopted\". According to the same source, the term does not denote being of mixed-race but rather being of foreign-blood and local culture.\n\nIn English, printed usage of \"mulatto\" dates to at least the 16th century. The 1595 work \"Drake's Voyages\" first used the term in the context of intimate unions producing biracial children, with the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defining mulatto here as \"one who is the offspring of a European and a Black\". This earliest usage regarded \"black\" and \"white\" as discrete \"species\", with the \"mulatto\" constituting a third separate \"species\".\n\nAccording to Julio Izquierdo Labrado, the 19th-century linguist Leopoldo Eguilaz y Yanguas, as well as some Arabic sources \"muwallad\" is the etymological origin of \"mulato.\" These sources specify that \"mulato\" would have been derived directly from \"muwallad\" independently of the related word \"muladí,\" a term that was applied to Iberian Christians who had converted to Islam during the Moorish governance of Iberia in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) casts doubt on the \"muwallad\" theory. It states, \"The term \"mulata\" is documented in our diachronic data bank in 1472 and is used in reference to livestock mules in \"Documentacion medieval de la Corte de Justicia de Ganaderos de Zaragoza,\" whereas \"muladí\" (from \"mullawadí\") does not appear until the 18th century, according to [Joan] Corominas\".\n\nScholars such as Werner Sollors cast doubt on the mule etymology for mulatto. In the 18th and 19th centuries, racialists such as Edward Long and Josiah Nott began to assert that mulattoes were sterile like mules. They projected this belief back onto the etymology of the word mulatto. Sollors points out that this etymology is anachronistic: \"The Mulatto sterility hypothesis that has much to do with the rejection of the term by some writers is only half as old as the word 'Mulatto.'\"\n\nOf São Tomé and Príncipe's 193,413 inhabitants, the largest segment is classified as \"mestiço,\" or mixed race. 71% of the population of Cape Verde is also classified as such. The great majority of their current populations descend from unions between the Portuguese, who settled the islands from the 15th century onwards, and the black Africans they brought from the African mainland to work as slaves. In the early years, mestiços began to form a third-class between the Portuguese colonists and African slaves, as they were usually bilingual and often served as interpreters between the populations.\n\nIn Angola and Mozambique, the \"mestiço\" constitute smaller but still important minorities; 2% in Angola and 0.2% in Mozambique.\n\nMulatto and \"mestiço\" are not terms commonly used in Southern Africa to refer to people of mixed ancestry. The persistence of some authors to use this term out of historic context reflects the old-school essentialist views of race as a \"de facto\" biological phenomenon and the 'mixing' of race as legitimate grounds for the creation of a 'new race'. This is in disregard of cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity and/or differences between regions and globally in populations of mixed ancestry.\nIn Namibia, a current-day population of between 20,000 and 30,000 people, known as Rehoboth Basters, descend from liaisons between the Cape Colony Dutch and indigenous African women. The name Baster is derived from the Dutch word for \"bastard\" (or \"crossbreed\"). While some people consider this term demeaning, the Basters proudly use the term as an indication of their history.\n\nIn South Africa, Coloured is a term used to refer to individuals with some degree of sub-Saharan ancestry but subjectively 'not enough' to be considered black-African under the Apartheid era law of South Africa. Today people self-identify as 'Coloured'. Other Afrikaans terms used include \"Bruinmense\" (translates to \"brown people\"), \"Kleurlinge\" (translates to \"Coloured\") or \"Bruin Afrikaners\" (translates to \"brown Africans\" and is used to distinguish them from the main body of \"Afrikaners\" (translates to \"African\") who are white). Under Apartheid law there were seven categories of Coloured people: Cape Coloured, Cape Malay, Griqua and Other Coloured - the aim of subdivisions was to enhance the meaning of the larger category of Coloured by making it all encompassing. Legally and politically speaking, all people of colour were classified “black” in the non-racial terms of anti-Apartheid rhetoric of the Black Consciousness Movement. In addition to European ancestry, Coloured people usually also possess Asian ancestry from immigrants from India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, China and/or Saint Helena. Based on the Population Registration Act to classify people, laws were put in place prohibiting mixed marriages. Therefore, many people that were descendants of the \"Asian\" category were able to legally intermarry with \"mixed-race\" people because they shared the same nomenclature. There was extensive combining of these diverse heritages in the Western Cape, but in other parts of southern Africa, the coloured usually were descendants of two primary ethnic groups - primarily Africans of various tribes and European colonists of various tribes, with generations of coloured forming families. The use of the term 'Coloured' has changed over the course of history. For instance, in the first census after the South African war (1912) Indians were counted as 'Coloured' whereas before and after, they were counted as 'Asiatic'.\n\nIn KwaZulu-Natal, most Coloureds (that were classified as \"other coloureds\") had British and Zulu heritage, while Zimbabwean coloureds were descended from Shona or Ndebele mixing with British and Afrikaner settlers. Griqua, on the other hand, are descendants of Khoisan and Afrikaner trekboers as well as contributions from central Southern African groups. The Griqua were subjected to an ambiguity of other creole people within Southern African social order. According to Nurse and Jenkins (1975) the leader of this “mixed” group, Adam Kok I, was a former slave of the Dutch governor who was manumitted and provided land outside Cape Town in the eighteenth century. With territories beyond the Dutch East India Company administration, Kok delivered refuge to deserting soldiers, runaway slaves, and remaining members of various Khoikhoi tribes.\n\n\nMulattoes represent a significant part of the population of various Latin American and Caribbean countries: Dominican Republic (73%; all mixed-race people), Brazil (49.1% mixed-race, Gypsy and Black, Mulattoes (20.5%), Mestiços, Mamelucos or Caboclos (21.3%), Blacks (7.1%) and Eurasian (0.2%)), Belize (25%), Colombia (10,4%), Cuba (24.86%), Haiti (15%).\n\nIn colonial Latin America, \"mulato\" could also refer to an individual of mixed African and Native American ancestry. In the 21st century, persons with indigenous and black African ancestry in Latin America are more frequently called \"zambos\" in Spanish or \"cafuzo\" in Portuguese.\n\nIn the United States, due to the influence and laws making slavery a racial caste and later practices of hypodescent, white colonists and settlers tended to classify persons of mixed African and Native American ancestry as black, regardless of how they identified themselves, or sometimes as black Indians. But many tribes had matrilineal kinship systems and practices of absorbing other peoples into their cultures. Multiracial children born to Native American mothers were customarily raised in her specific tribal culture. Federally recognized Indian tribes have insisted that identity and membership is related to culture rather than race, and that individuals brought up within tribal culture are fully members, regardless of whether they have some European or African ancestry. Many tribes have had mixed-race members who identify primarily as members of the tribes.\n\nIf the children were born to slave women, they were classified under slave law as slaves, and more likely raised within the African-American community and considered black. A number of African Americans in contemporary United States have ancestry including some Native American.\n\nStudies carried out by the geneticist Sergio Pena conclude the average white Brazilian is 80% European, 10% Amerindian, and 10% African/black. Another study, carried out by the \"Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research\", concludes the average white Brazilian is (>70%) European.\n\nAccording to the IBGE 2000 census, 38.5% of Brazilians identified as \"pardo\", i.e. of mixed ancestry. This figure includes mulatto and other multiracial people, such as people who have European and Amerindian ancestry (called \"caboclos\"), as well as assimilated, westernized Amerindians, and mestizos with some Asian ancestry. A majority of mixed-race Brazilians have all three ancestries: Amerindian, European, and African. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics census 2006, some 42.6% of Brazilian identify as \"pardo,\" an increase over the 2000 census.\n\nAccording to genetic studies, some of those who identify as White Brazilians (48.4%) also have some mixed-race ancestry (both Subsaharan African and Amerindian ancestry). Brazilians who identify as \"de raça negra\" or \"de cor preta\", i.e. Brazilians of Black African origin, make up 6.9% of the population; genetic studies show their average total ancestry is still mixed: 40% African, 50% European, and 10% Amerindian, but they likely grew up within visibly black communities.\n\nSuch autosomal DNA studies, which measure total genetic contribution, continue to reveal differences between how individuals identify, which is usually based in family and close community, with genetic ancestry, which may relate to a distant past they know little about. Such DNA studies were conducted of students at a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro. It found that the multiracial \"pardos\" were genetically more than 80% European in ancestry. \"The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry\", say the researchers. The test results showed that the proportion of European genetic ancestry was higher than students expected. When questioned before the test, students who identified as \"pardos\", for example, identified as 1/3 European, 1/3 African and 1/3 Amerindian. On the other hand, students classified as \"white\" tended to overestimate their proportion of African and Amerindian genetic ancestry.\n\nMulattoes account for up to 5% of the nation’s population. In Haitian history, such mixed-race people, known in colonial times as free people of color, gained some education and property before the Revolution. In some cases, their white fathers arranged for multiracial sons to be educated in France and join the military, giving them an advance economically. Free people of color gained some social capital and political power before the Revolution, were influential during the Revolution and since then. The people of color have retained their elite position, based on education and social capital, that is apparent in the political, economic and cultural hierarchy in present-day Haiti. Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been people of color.\n\nThe struggle within Haiti between the people of color led by André Rigaud and the black Haitians led by Toussaint Louverture devolved into the War of Knives. In the early period of independence, former slaves of majority-black ancestry led the government, as it was the many more numerous slaves who had done most of the fighting in the North, where the largest plantations were, to achieve independence.\n\nIn a 2002 genetic study of maternal and paternal direct lines of ancestry of 800 Puerto Ricans, 61% had mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from an Amerindian female ancestor, 27% inherited MtDNA from a female African ancestor and 12% had MtDNA from a female European ancestor. Conversely, patrilineal direct lines, as indicated by the Y chromosome, showed that 70% of Puerto Rican males in the sample have Y chromosome DNA from a male European ancestor, 20% inherited Y-DNA from a male African ancestor, and less than 10% inherited Y-DNA from a male Amerindian ancestor. As these tests measure only the DNA along the direct matrilineal and patrilineal lines of inheritance, they cannot tell what total percentage of European or African ancestry any individual has.\n\nIn keeping with Spanish practice, for most of its colonial period, Puerto Rico had laws such as the \"Regla del Sacar\" or \"Gracias al Sacar.\" A person with African ancestry could be considered legally white if he could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had been legally white. People of black ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white, in contrast to the \"one-drop rule\" put into law in the early 20th century in the United States. In colonial and antebellum times in certain locations, persons of three-quarters or more white ancestry were considered legally white. If born to slave mothers, however, this status did not overrule their being considered slaves, like Sally Hemings, who was three-quarters white, and her children by Thomas Jefferson, who were seven-eighths white, and all born into slavery.\n\nHistorians have documented sexual abuse of slave women during the colonial and post-revolutionary slavery times by white men in power: planters, their sons before marriage, overseers, etc., producing multiracial children born into slavery. But, Paul Heinegg has documented that most of the free people of color in the 1790–1810 censuses in the Upper South were descended from unions and marriages during the colonial period in Virginia between white women, who were free or indentured servants, and African or African-American men, servant, slave or free. In the early colonial years, working-class people lived and worked closely together, and slavery was not as much of a racial caste. Slave law had established that children in the colony took the status of their mothers. This meant that multi-racial children born to white women were born free. The colony required them to serve lengthy indentures if the woman was not married, but nonetheless, numerous individuals with African ancestry were born free, and formed more free families. Many of these free people of color became leaders in the African-American community; others continued to marry into the white community. His findings have been supported by DNA studies as well.\n\nAccording to historian F. James Davis,\nSome mixed-race persons in the South became slave owners, and many who were accepted in the society supported the Confederacy during the Civil War. For example, William Ellison owned 60 slaves. Andrew Durnford of New Orleans, which had a large population of free people of color, mostly of French descent and Catholic culture, was listed in the census as owning 77 slaves. In Louisiana free people of color constituted a third class between white colonists and the mass of slaves.\n\nOther multiracial people became abolitionists and supported the Union. For example, Mary Ellen Pleasant and Thomy Lafon used their fortunes to support the abolitionist cause. Francis E. Dumas of New Orleans, a free person of color, emancipated all his slaves and organized them into a company in the Second Regiment of the Louisiana Native Guards.\n\nHistorically in the American South, the term mulatto was also applied at times to persons with mixed Native American and African American ancestry. For example, a 1705 Virginia statute reads as follows: \n\"And for clearing all manner of doubts which hereafter may happen to arise upon the construction of this act, or any other act, who shall be accounted a mulatto, Be it enacted and declared, and it is hereby enacted and declared, That the child of an Indian and the child, grand child, or great grand child, of a negro shall be deemed, accounted, held and taken to be a mulatto.\"\n\nIn early American history, the term mulatto was also used to refer to persons of Native American and European ancestry. Certain tribes of Indians of the Inocoplo family in Texas referred to themselves as \"mulatto\". At one time, Florida's laws declared that a person from any number of mixed ancestries would be legally defined as a mulatto, including White/Hispanic, Black/Indian, and just about any other mix as well. A daughter born to a South Asian father and Irish mother in Maryland in 1680 was classified as a \"mulatto\" and sold into slavery. Starting with Virginia in 1662, colonies adopted the principle of \"partus sequitur ventrem\" in slave law, which said that children in the colony were born into the status of their mother. Thus, children born to slave mothers were born into slavery, regardless of who their fathers were; children born to white mothers were free, even if mixed-race.\n\nMulatto was used as an official census racial category in the United States until 1930. (In the early 20th century, several southern states had adopted the one-drop rule as law, and southern Congressmen pressed the US Census Bureau to drop the mulatto category: they wanted all persons to be classified as \"black\" or \"white\".) At that time, the term was primarily applied as a category to persons of mixed African and European descent. During the colonial and early federal period, in the Southern colonies and states, it was sometimes applied to persons of any mixed ethnicity, including Native American and European. During the early census years of the United States beginning in 1790, \"mulatto\" was applied to persons who were identifiably of mixed African-American and Native American ancestry. Mulatto was also used interchangeably with terms like \"Turk\", leading to ambiguity when referring to North Africans and Middle Easterners, who were of limited number in the colonies. In the 2000 United States Census, 6,171 Americans self-identified as having mulatto ancestry. Since then, multi-racial people have been allowed to identify as having more than one type of ethnic ancestry.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49312554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49312554", "title": "Multiple Jeopardy", "text": "Multiple Jeopardy\n\nMultiple Jeopardy a term used by scholars such as Deborah K. King and Patricia Hill Collins describes the way in which oppressive barriers that individuals face contribute to the level of oppression faced due to these factors culminating together to cause further and greater oppression.“The modifier ‘multiple’ refers not only to several, simultaneous oppressions but to the multiplicative relationships among them as well. In other words, the equivalent formulation is racism multiplied by sexism multiplied by classism.\" - Deborah K. King Multiple Jeopardy stems off the term double jeopardy, which when used from a sociological perspective, refers to the additional obstacles individuals face when exposed to multiple disadvantages due to their unique being. When considering double jeopardy, often times there is an emphasis on just two aspects such as race and gender. An example of this would be the rights observed by black women. Not only are these individuals oppressed because they are female, but also because they are black. These women are a part of a dual oppressive system and are not only hindered by one trait, but by two. “Not only are colored women . . . handicapped on account of their sex, but they are almost everywhere baffled and mocked because of their race. Not only because they are women, but because they are colored women.\" – Mary Church Terrell“As blacks they suffer all the burdens of prejudice and mistreatment that fall on anyone with dark skin. As women they bear the additional burden of having to cope with white and black men.\" -Frances M. BealMultiple jeopardy differs from double jeopardy, by the fact that instead of just two factors playing into the disadvantages of individuals, there are multiple. Three common factors that are often observed are the factors of race, class, and gender. In Deborah King’s article, \"Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology\", she recounts the ill treatment of black women during the slavery era. During the slavery time period in America, all black people were subjected to demanding physical labor and harsh brutal punishments; this was due to their race and their class, or their position in society. However, what sets black women slaves apart is the fact that they often endured struggles that were only subjected to women, namely rape (King). As Angela Davis put it in her book \"Women, Race, and Class\", “If the most violent punishments of men consisted in floggings and mutilations, women were flogged and mutilated, as well as raped.\" In this scenario, black women could not identify with black males due to their gender and sexuality, nor could they identify with the sexual oppression of white women due to their race and class.\n\nBlack women often find it difficult to identify and relate with white women due to the difference of race and class. One way of viewing the differences between white women and black women would be to examine the way in which they combat the exploitation of women. Over the years there has been a number of political campaigns emphasizing the reformation of policies and laws involving reproductive rights, domestic violence, equal pay, women’s suffrage, sexual harassment, and other issues that particularly involve women; this movement is widely known as the feminist movement. Though this movement involves all women, there is a difference between the ways in which white women and black women experience and go about handling the exploitation. In her article, \"Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female\", Frances M. Beal expresses thathite women are faced with the sole issue of being considered less than men. They often blame their issues solely on male chauvinism and the ways in which society is built on male-encouraged values. They do not face issues based on their race, however, this is the case for black and other minority women of color. Black women are not only faced with male-bigoted views, but they also carry the task of finding equality through means of being black as well. In addition to there being racial differences amongst black women and white women, there are also class differences amongst the two. The white-woman’s feminist movement is often geared towards helping and improving the conditions of the middle-class. This is problematic when referring to the black women. Many, black women experience economic exploitation that, according to Beal, quite few white women endure or are faced with.\n\nThe topic of multiple jeopardy, relates to the understanding of the concept Matrix of Domination. This term, used by Patricia Hill Collins, refers to the sociological intersectional paradigms that describes the overall social organization within which oppressions that are fueled by the intersection of multiple disadvantaging factors, originate, develop, and are contained. By intersectional, it is meant that the disadvantaging factors that are discussed in the explanation of multiple jeopardy, intersect and overlap with one another just as an inseparable link; an interlocking system of oppression. In the United States, domination can be seen in institutions such as schools, employment, housing, the government, and other social elements. The domination of the superior group affects those who are/have been socially oppressed due to the factors that have historically caused them disadvantages. The idea of multiple jeopardy feeds into the concept of the Matrix of Domination because it is these multiple factors, gender, race, sex, class, religion and other social/cultural identities, that have historically caused many disadvantages for certain groups of people. For more information on the Matrix of Domination, follow the link.\n\nThe concept of multiple consciousness revolves around the idea of being aware of the intersectional factors that contribute to the levels of oppression. It acknowledges the fact that there are various intersecting, disadvantaging factors that places the odds against certain individuals. In her article Multiple Jeopardy, Multiple Consciousness: The Context of a Black Feminist Ideology, Deborah King expresses just how multiple consciousness plays a role when considering Black women's position in society: \"...a black feminist ideology fundamentally challenges the interstructure of the oppressions of racism, sexism, and classism both in the dominant society and within movements for liberation. It is in confrontation with multiple jeopardy that black women define and sustain a multiple consciousness essential for our liberation, of which feminist consciousness is an integral part.\" - Deborah K. King\n"}

The collection ranges from works created in the late nineteenth century when the recorded sound and film industries were in their infancy to those made in the present day.\n\nThe Archive was formally established as the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (within the then Commonwealth National Library) in 1935, becoming an independent cultural organisation in 1984. On 3 October, Prime Minister Bob Hawke officially opened the NFSA’s headquarters in Canberra.\n\nThe work of the Archive can be officially dated to the establishment of the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (part of the then Commonwealth National Library) by a Cabinet decision on 11 December 1935.\n\nAfter being part of the National Library of Australia, and its predecessors, for nearly 50 years, the National Film and Sound Archive was created as a separate Commonwealth collecting institution through an announcement in Parliament on 5 April 1984 that took immediate effect. At that time, an Advisory Committee was established to guide the institution.\n\nOn 21 June 1999, the name was changed to ScreenSound Australia, the National Collection of Screen and Sound, and changed again in early 2000 to ScreenSound Australia, National Screen and Sound Archive. It reverted to its original name, National Film and Sound Archive, in December 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, consequent on amendments to the Australian Film Commission Act which took effect on 1 July 2003, it ceased to be a semi-autonomous entity within the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and became an integrated branch, later a division, of the Australian Film Commission, a funding and promotional body.\n\nIn 2007, the Liberal Government announced the creation of a new agency to be called Screen Australia which would incorporate the main functions of the Film Finance Corporation, the Australian Film Commission (including the Archive), and Film Australia. Following elections in November 2007, however, the new Labor Government implemented an election promise to allow the NFSA to become a statutory authority, similar to other major cultural institutions including the National Library of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia and the National Museum of Australia. The NFSA Act became law on 20 March 2008 and came into effect on 1 July 2008, with celebrations held that day.\n\nThe Archive's first Board as a Statutory Authority comprised:\n\n\nThe National Collection includes more than 2.8 million items, encompassing sound, radio, television and film. In addition to discs, films, videos, audio tapes, phonograph cylinders and wire recordings, the Collection includes supporting documents and artefacts, such as personal papers and organisational records, photographs, posters, lobby cards, publicity, scripts, costumes, props, memorabilia and sound, video and film equipment.\n\nNotable holdings include:\n\nA 2010 study compared the curatorial practices of accessioning and cataloging for NFSA collections and for YouTube with regard to access to older Australian television programs. It found the NFSA to be stronger in current affairs and older programs, and YouTube stronger in game shows, lifestyle programs, and \"human interest\" material (births, marriages, and deaths). YouTube cataloging was found to have fewer broken links than the NFSA collection, and YouTube metadata could be searched more intuitively. The NFSA was found to generally provide more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates.\n\n\nThe building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of Sir Colin MacKenzie. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse Phar Lap.\n\nThe building is often classified as art deco, though its overall architectural style is technically \"Late 20th Century Stripped Classical\", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised. It features a symmetrical façade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer’s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.\n\nThe building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth.

The first German national film archive, it was opened in 1935, and based in Berlin. It ceased to exist in 1945, when its film stock was either destroyed or seized by the Soviet army.\n\nThe \"Reichsfilmarchiv\" was opened on 4 February 1935 in Harnack House, Dahlem, Berlin, in the presence of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Goebbels, with an enormous flurry of propaganda. It soon gained a high international reputation. When the \"Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film\" (FIAF) was established as an international joint film archive in Paris in 1938, the \"Reichsfilmarchiv\" was one of the four founding members. The Independent State of Croatia kept copies of its films at the archive, due to the lack of a sufficient archive of its own.\n\nAfter their arrival in Berlin in April 1945, Soviet troops seized the \"Reichsfilmarchiv\" and took possession of all its surviving film material. In 1947 its place was filled in West Germany by the \"Archiv für Filmwissenschaft\" (\"Archive of Film Science\"), set up in Marburg by Hanns Wilhelm Lavies, while in East Germany it was succeeded by the \"Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR\" (\"State Film Archive of the DDR\"), established in 1955.\n\nAt the time of its opening the film archive already held more than 1,200 films, some transferred from their previous place of deposit in the \"Reichsarchiv Potsdam\" (\"Imperial Archives, Potsdam\"), others provided by the film industry. By the end of the war in 1945, not only through the normal channels of acquisition, but also very largely through seizure and confiscation in the occupied territories, the collection had grown to 17,352 films.\n\nAfter the end of the war most of these films, many of which had been stored in the bell tower of the Berlin Olympic Stadium, were lost. 6,400 selected films eventually found their way into the Soviet film archive in Krasnogorsk near Moscow and from there into Soviet cinemas, where some of them were still showing up to 1956. When in 1955 the State Film Archive of the DDR was founded, it was permitted to take over a proportion of the collection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10022970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10022970", "title": "Research data archiving", "text": "Research data archiving\n\nResearch data archiving is the long-term storage of scholarly research data, including the natural sciences, social sciences, and life sciences. The various academic journals have differing policies regarding how much of their data and methods researchers are required to store in a public archive, and what is actually archived varies widely between different disciplines. Similarly, the major grant-giving institutions have varying attitudes towards public archival of data. In general, the tradition of science has been for publications to contain sufficient information to allow fellow researchers to replicate and therefore test the research. In recent years this approach has become increasingly strained as research in some areas depends on large datasets which cannot easily be replicated independently.\n\nData archiving is more important in some fields than others. In a few fields, all of the data necessary to replicate the work is already available in the journal article. In drug development, a great deal of data is generated and must be archived so researchers can verify that the reports the drug companies publish accurately reflect the data.\n\nThe requirement of data archiving is a recent development in the history of science. It was made possible by advances in information technology allowing large amounts of data to be stored and accessed from central locations. For example, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) adopted their first policy on data archiving in 1993, about three years after the beginning of the WWW. This policy mandates that datasets cited in AGU papers must be archived by a recognised data center; it permits the creation of \"data papers\"; and it establishes AGU's role in maintaining data archives. But it makes no requirements on paper authors to archive their data.\n\nPrior to organized data archiving, researchers wanting to evaluate or replicate a paper would have to request data and methods information from the author. The academic community expects authors to share supplemental data. This process was recognized as wasteful of time and energy and obtained mixed results. Information could become lost or corrupted over the years. In some cases, authors simply refuse to provide the information.\n\nThe need for data archiving and due diligence is greatly increased when the research deals with health issues or public policy formation.\n\nNB: \"Biotropica\" is one of only two journals that pays the fees for authors depositing data at Dryad.\n\nIn the United States, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has tightened requirements on data archiving. Researchers seeking funding from NSF are now required to file a data management plan as a two-page supplement to the grant application.\n\nThe NSF Datanet initiative has resulted in funding of the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) project, which will provide scientific data archiving for ecological and environmental data produced by scientists worldwide. DataONE's stated goal is to preserve and provide access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national data. The community of users for DataONE includes scientists, ecosystem managers, policy makers, students, educators, and the public.\n\nResearch data is archived in data libraries or data archives.\n\n\n"}

It was said that he killed and drank the blood of the millers when they came to mill their grains. Although he is usually said to have been the first Serbian vampire, there are claims that he was pre-dated in Serbian folklore by Petar Blagojević from Veliko Gradište, who died in 1724. Blagojević and the affair surrounding him came to European attention at the time, under the name Peter Plogojowitz, and represented one of the earliest examples of vampire hysteria.\n\nStill, Sava Savanović remains today as the best known vampire in Serbia.\n\nThe watermill is located from the Bajina Bašta-Valjevo road, in the deep valley of the Rogačica river. The location of the mill has been described as a \"narrow and dark ravine\". For the last several decades the watermill associated with Savanović has been owned by the Jagodić family, and is usually called \"Jagodića vodenica\" (\"Jagodići's watermill\"). It was in operation until the late 1950s. After its closure, it became a tourist site along with other attractions in Valjevo and nearby villages.\n\nBy the early 2010s, the ownership problems were resolved and the local administration to reconstruct the watermill made of wood and stone, and adapt it into the proper tourist attraction. Plans also included that the watermill will be operational again, producing the flour named after Sava Savanović while the local farmers would sell honey and rakia. A construction of the proper road to which would connect it to the main one was also planned. Author of the reconstruction project was architect Aleksandar Gavović.\n\nThe first finished project was the road, but just a month after it was completed, the mill collapsed in 2012. The municipal authorities issued a tongue-in-cheek public health warning, advising people that Savanović was now free to look for a new home. In 2011 it was evident that it may collapse soon, but local authorities hoped it will make it to the reconstruction. The project of recreating the watermill in its authentic form was made, but there was a lack of funding. Originally, only the roof collapsed but in the next years the wooden walls buckled, too.\n\nSava Savanović appears in the story \"Posle devedeset godina\" (\"After Ninety Years\"), written by the Serbian realist writer Milovan Glišić, and in the horror film \"Leptirica\" inspired by the story. He also appears in the novel \"Strah i njegov sluga\" (\"Fear and His Servant\") written by Mirjana Novaković.\n\nIn January 2010, city of Valjevo selected the mythical Sava Savanović as the touristic mascot of the city and the entire Kolubara region. Zarožje and Valjevo are on the opposing sides of the Povlen mountain, but both claim Savanović as their brand. Local community of Zarožje threatened to sue the city, but ultimately only reported to the police in Bajina Bašta that Savanović was \"stolen from them\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58632550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58632550", "title": "The Nature of Prejudice", "text": "The Nature of Prejudice\n\nThe Nature of Prejudice is a 1954 book by American psychologist Gordon Allport, considered to be a seminal work in social psychology on the topic of prejudice.\n\nThe book was already called a classic a decade after its initial publication, in 1965. Irwin Katz, writing in \"Political Psychology\" in 1991 on the topic of \"classics in political psychology\", called the book a landmark and \"one of the most influential and often-cited publications in the entire field of intergroup relations\". In 2016 Thomas F. Pettigrew and Kerstin Hammann described the book as \"probably the most read volume in the history of social psychology\", noting that it has received numerous translations and remains influential in the modern study of prejudice. In a volume published roughly on the fiftieth anniversary of the book's original debut, \"On the Nature of Prejudice: Fifty Years after Allport\" (2008), the authors referred to Allport's book as \"the fundamental work for social psychology of prejudice\" and the most widely cited work on the subject, still used in teaching and quoted in modern research.\n\nDescribing the book's significance, Katz noted that it \"defined the field of intergroup relations for social psychologist as the study of prejudice and its effects on group interactions\". He noted, however, that Allport's assumption that prejudice causes discrimination has still to be proven beyond doubt; though other scholars also stressed that many of other assumptions Allport expressed in the book have become accepted since its publication. Pettigrew and Hammann selected, as the book's most lasting contribution, its success in redefining the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice: while previously some scholars argued that contact between different groups leads to increased prejudice and conflict, Allport argued to the contrary, a view that Pettigrew and Hammann describe as supported by \"literally hundreds of studies from dozens of nations\". Another major influence of the book was the later formulation of the common ingroup identity theory. Pettigrew and Hammann also credit Allport's ideas with influencing government policies, in the United States and elsewhere, which have successfully reduced levels of prejudice.\n\nAnother idea introduced in the book became known as Allport's Scale, a measure of prejudice starting from antilocution and ending up at genocidal extermination. In simpler terms, Allport argued that even simple prejudice, if left unchecked, can develop into an extreme form.\n\nIn addition to being highly influential in the field of social psychology, the revised (and shortened) second edition of the book (\"The Nature of Prejudice: Abridged\") published in 1958 was also a success on the mass market, being written in a relatively simple way that was accessible to a general readership. One of the reasons for its success, in Pettigrew and Hammann's opinion, was the boldness of its topic: while targeting a white, Protestant, American, and mostly male readership, it discussed numerous examples of anti-African-American, anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic, and anti-female prejudices.\n\n"}
{"id": "9070810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9070810", "title": "The longest suicide note in history", "text": "The longest suicide note in history\n\n\"The longest suicide note in history\" is an epithet originally used by United Kingdom Labour MP Gerald Kaufman to describe his party's 1983 general election manifesto, which emphasised socialist policies in a more profound manner than previous such documents – and which Kaufman felt would ensure that the Labour Party (then in opposition) would fail to win the election.\n\n\"The New Hope for Britain\" was a 39-page booklet which called for unilateral nuclear disarmament; higher personal taxation for the rich; withdrawal from the European Economic Community; abolition of the House of Lords; and the re-nationalisation of recently privatised industries like British Telecom, British Aerospace, and the British Shipbuilders Corporation. The manifesto was based on an earlier and much longer policy paper with a similar title, \"Labour's Plan: the New Hope for Britain\".\n\nThe epithet referred not only to the orientation of the policies, but also to their marketing. Labour leader Michael Foot decided as a statement on internal democracy that the manifesto would consist of all resolutions arrived at in its party conference.\n\nThe document's more left-wing policies, along with the popularity gained by Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over the successful outcome of the Falklands War and the division of the opposition vote between the left-wing Labour Party and the centrist Social Democratic Party – Liberal Alliance, composed of breakaway Labour MPs on the right-wing of the party; contributed to a victory with a substantial majority in Parliament for the right-wing Conservative Party Government. The defeat was Labour's worst result since 1918, and led to a turning point in the history of the party- which thereafter gradually moved to the centre under the leadership of Neil Kinnock then, under the leadership of Tony Blair in the 1990s; rebranded itself as \"New Labour\" and Third Way, leading to a landslide victory at the 1997 general election, fourteen years and two general election defeats later.\n\nIt has subsequently been used by Peter Gutmann in his paper \"A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection\" to describe the digital rights management schemes in the Windows Vista operating system.\n\nDutch VVD politician Mark Rutte used the phrase in reference to the election programme of the Dutch Labour Party, during the May 2010 parliamentary election campaign, deliberately echoing Kaufman.\n\n\"Washington Post\" columnist Charles Krauthammer compared the 2012 Republican House Budget to the manifesto (in terms of comparable unpopularity) and then remarked about the House Budget, \"At 37 footnotes, it might be the most annotated suicide note in history.\"\n\nNeoconservative writer David Frum compared \"The Path to Prosperity\" proposed by congressman Paul Ryan in a similar light, saying \"This is how a great political party was impelled to base a presidential campaign on the Ryan plan—a plan that has now replaced the 1983 manifesto of the British Labour Party as 'the longest suicide note in history'.\"\n\nLabour's decision in 2015 to engrave promises for the upcoming election on a large stone monument nicknamed the \"EdStone\" was within hours dubbed the \"heaviest suicide note in history\".\n\n\n"}

The painting is part of the United Kingdom's Royal Collection.\n\nJohan Zoffany was a German-born painter who had become successful in London. One of his principal patrons was the Royal family. In the summer of 1772, Zoffany left London for Florence with a commission from Queen Charlotte to paint 'the Florence Gallery'. (Neither she nor her husband George III ever visited Italy in person.) The agreed price was high and Zoffany was paid £300. Felton Hervey, who had a large art collection and who knew the Royal family, met Zoffany in Florence. He was included in a prominent position in the painting by December 1772. Zoffany was still working on the painting late in 1777; he only finally returned to England in 1779. By this time Hervey had died.\n\nZoffany has varied the arrangement of the artworks and introduced others from elsewhere in the Medici collection. He gained special privileges, with the help of George, 3rd Earl Cowper, and Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, such as having seven paintings, including Raphael's Madonna della Sedia, temporarily brought in from the Pitti Palace so that he could paint them in situ in the Tribuna. In thanks, Zoffany included a portrait of Cowper looking at his recent acquisition, Raphael's Niccolini-Cowper Madonna (Cowper hoped to sell it on to George III; it is now in the Washington National Gallery of Art), with Zoffany holding it (to the left of the Dancing Faun).\n\nThe unframed \"Samian Sibyl\" on the floor was acquired for the Medici collection in 1777. It was a workshop copy of the pendant to Guercino's \"Libyan Sibyl\", recently bought by George III, and may be intended as a compliment to him.\nToday Medici's Ancient Roman statues are mostly in the main corridors of the Uffizi Gallery, except those which are still in the Tribuna, and except the smaller busts and statuettes (some antique, some pseudo-antique), owned by the National Archaeological Museum and permanently displayed at Villa Corsini a Castello, near Florence. Many of those painted by Zoffany are still to be identified, though. Other antiquities (Etruscan, Egyptian, Greek) are mostly in the National Archaeological Museum. Some very few Renaissance pieces from the Tribuna are now in the Bargello Museum. \n\nAll of the connoisseurs, diplomats and visitors to Florence portrayed are identifiable, making the painting a combination of the British 18th-century conversation piece or informal group portrait genre, with that of the predominantly Flemish 17th-century tradition of gallery views and wunderkammers. However, this inclusion of so many recognisable portraits led to criticism at the time by Zoffany's royal patrons, and by Horace Walpole, who called it \"a flock of travelling boys, and one does not know nor care whom.\"\n\nThe first group of people is around the Niccolini Madonna. From left, standing up, there are George, 3rd earl of Cowper, Sir John Dick baronet of Braid, Other Windsor, 6th Earl of Plymouth, and Johann Zoffany, the painter itself, followed on the other side of the painting by Mr. Stevenson and his companion George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth, while is sitting on a chair Charles Loraine Smith and behind him, bended, Richard Edgcumbe, later 2nd Earl of Mount Edgcumbe.\n\nTwo more connoisseurs are near the \"Satiro\". The first is reported to be Joseph Leeson, 2nd Earl of Milltown, even if his portrait does not match in age and resemblance those in the National Gallery of Ireland by Pompeo Batoni, and Valentine Knightley of Fawsley. \n\nFurther to the center of the painting Pietro Bastianelli, curator of the Uffizi Gallery, shows the Venus of Urbino di Titian to John Gordon, Thomas Patch (probably the man touching the \"Venus\"), Sir John Taylor and Sir Horace Mann. The sitting man, looking back towards, is the Hon. Felton Hervey. \n\nThe group around the \"Medici Venus\" include John Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea, Mr. Wilbraham (one of the sons of Roger Wilbraham of Natwich), Mr. Watts, Mr. Doughty and, on the orther side, Thomas Wilbraham (the second son) and James Bruce.\n\n"}
