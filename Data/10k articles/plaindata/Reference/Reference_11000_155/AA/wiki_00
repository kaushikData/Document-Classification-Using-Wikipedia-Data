A hylomorphism is the composition of an anamorphism followed by a catamorphism.\n\nConsider an initial \"F\"-algebra (\"A\", \"in\") for some endofunctor \"F\" of some category into itself. Here \"in\" is a morphism from \"FA\" to \"A\". Since it is initial, we know that whenever (\"X\", \"f\") is another \"F\"-algebra, i.e. a morphism \"f\" from \"FX\" to \"X\", there is a unique homomorphism \"h\" from (\"A\", \"in\") to (\"X\", \"f\"). By the definition of the category of \"F\"-algebras, this \"h\" corresponds to a morphism from \"A\" to \"X\", conventionally also denoted \"h\", such that formula_1. In the context of \"F\"-algebras, the uniquely specified morphism from the initial object is denoted by cata f and hence characterized by the following relationship:\n\n\nAnother notation found in the literature is formula_4. The open brackets used are known as banana brackets, after which catamorphisms are sometimes referred to as \"bananas\", as mentioned in . \nOne of the first publications to introduce the notion of a catamorphism in the context of programming was the paper “Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire”, by Erik Meijer \"et al.\", which was in the context of the Squiggol formalism.\nThe general categorical definition was given by Grant Malcolm.\nWe give a series of examples, and then a more global approach to catamorphisms, in the Haskell programming language.\n\nIteration-step prescriptions lead to natural numbers as initial object.\n\nConsider the functor codice_1 mapping a data type codice_2 to a data type codice_3, which contains a copy of each term from codice_2 as well as one additional term codice_5 (in Haskell, this is what codice_6 does). This can be encoded using one term and one function. So let an instance of a \"StepAlgebra\" also include a function from codice_3 to codice_2, which maps codice_5 to a fixed term codice_10 of codice_2, and where the actions on the copied terms will be called codice_12.\n\nAs a silly example, consider the algebra on strings encoded as codice_13, for which codice_5 is mapped to codice_15 and otherwise codice_16 is prepended. As codice_17 denotes the number four in codice_18, the following will evaluate to \"wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!\": . We can easily change the code to a more useful operation, say repeated operation of an algebraic operation on numbers, just by changing the F-algebra codice_19, which is passed to codice_20\n\nFor a fixed type codice_21, consider the functor mapping types codice_2 to the product type of those two types. We moreover also add a term codice_23 to this resulting type. An f-algebra shall now map codice_23 to some special term codice_10 of codice_2 or \"merge\" a pair (any other term of the constructed type) into a term of codice_2. This merging of a pair can be encoded as a function of type codice_28.\n\nAs an example, consider the algebra on numbers types encoded as codice_29, for which the number from codice_21 acts on the number from codice_2 by plain multiplication. Then the following will evaluate to 3.000.000: \n\nFor a fixed type codice_21, consider the functor mapping types codice_2 to a type that contains a copy of each term of codice_21 as well as all pairs of codice_2's (terms of the product type of two instances of the type codice_2). An algebra consists of a function to codice_2, which either acts on an codice_21 term or two codice_2 terms. This merging of a pair can be encoded as two functions of type codice_40 resp. codice_41.\n\nDeeper category theoretical studies of initial algebras reveal that the F-algebra obtained from applying the functor to its own initial algebra is isomorphic to it.\n\nStrong type systems enable us to abstractly specify the initial algebra of a functor codice_42 as its fixed point \"a = f a\". The recursively defined catamorphisms can now be coded in single line, where the case analysis (like in the different examples above) is encapsulated by the fmap. Since the domain of the latter are objects in the image of codice_42, the evaluation of the catamorphisms jumps back and forth between codice_21 and codice_45.\n\nNow again the first example, but now via passing the Maybe functor to Fix. Repeated application of the Maybe functor generates a chain of types, which, however, can be united by the isomorphism from the fixed point theorem. We introduce the term codice_46, which arises from Maybes's codice_5 and identify a successor function with repeated application of the codice_48. This way the natural numbers arise.\n\nAgain, the following will evaluate to \"wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!\": codice_49\n\nAnd now again the tree example. For this we must provide the tree container data type so that we can set up the codice_50 (we didn't have to do it for the codice_6 functor, as it's part of the standard prelude).\n\nThe following will evaluate to 4: codice_52\n\n\n"}

Nathaniel Jennison was a decisive court case in Massachusetts in 1783 which effectively abolished slavery in that state. It was the third in a series of cases which became known as the \"Quok Walker cases\".\n\nNathaniel Jennison was arrested for beating Quock Walker and indicted on a criminal charge of assault and battery in September 1781. The trial before the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was held in April 1783. Jennison's defense was that Walker was a runaway slave but Walker countered that the had made slavery illegal in 1780. Chief Justice William Cushing accepted this argument and directed the jury that the issue of whether Walker had been freed or not was irrelevant because slavery was no longer constitutional. The jury convicted Jennison who was fined forty shillings.\n\nThe case was not widely publicized but it made it clear that the law would not defend the property rights of slave-owners. Slavery (or the willingness to reveal its presence) declined so that, by the time of the 1790 census, no slaves were recorded in this state.\n\n"}

Three numbers made up a volume; many of the works were divided into several volumes. The price of a number was one shilling. The full series title was \"Constable's Miscellany of Original and Selected Publications, in the Various Departments of Literature, Science, and the Arts.\"\n\nArchibald Constable died in 1827, and the \"Miscellany\" was taken over by a consortium of Aitken, Henry Constable, and a London publisher. When the publisher went bankrupt in 1831, the project became relatively dormant. The entire list was later advertised by the London firm of Whittaker & Co. There were 80 volumes in all, the first appearing in 1826 and the last in 1835.\n\nProjected before the Panic of 1825, the \"Miscellany\" was dedicated to George IV of the United Kingdom, a privilege gained for Constable by Walter Scott. The initial plans were more ambitious; Constable himself became bankrupt in 1827, and this final project proceeded under constraints.\n\nThe \"Miscellany's\" first editor was John Aitken.

Previously, the Sultan and his family had lived at the Topkapı Palace, but as the medieval Topkapı was lacking in contemporary style, luxury, and comfort, as compared to the palaces of the European monarchs, Abdülmecid decided to build a new modern palace near the site of the former Beşiktaş Sahil Palace, which was demolished. Hacı Said Ağa was responsible for the construction works, while the project was realized by architects Garabet Balyan, his son Nigoğayos Balyan and Evanis Kalfa (members of the Armenian Balyan family of Ottoman court architects).\n\nThe construction cost five million Ottoman gold lira, or 35 tonnes of gold, the equivalent of ca. $1.5 billion in today's (2013) values. This sum corresponded to approximately a quarter of the yearly tax revenue. Actually, the construction was financed through debasement, by massive issue of paper money, as well as by foreign loans. The huge expenses placed an enormous burden on the state purse and contributed to the deteriorating financial situation of the Ottoman Empire, which eventually defaulted on its public debt in October 1875, with the subsequent establishment in 1881 of financial control over the \"sick man of Europe\" by the European powers.\n\nThe palace was home to six Sultans from 1856, when it was first inhabited, up until the abolition of the Caliphate in 1924: The last royal to live here was Caliph Abdülmecid Efendi. A law that went into effect on March 3, 1924 transferred the ownership of the palace to the national heritage of the new Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, used the palace as a presidential residence during the summers and enacted some of his most important works here. Atatürk spent the last days of his medical treatment in this palace, where he died on November 10, 1938.\n\nToday, the palace is managed by \"Milli Saraylar Daire Başkanlığı\" (Directorate of National Palaces) responsible to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.\n\nThe site of Dolmabahçe was originally a bay on the Bosphorus which was used for the anchorage of the Ottoman fleet. The area was reclaimed gradually during the 18th century to become an imperial garden, much appreciated by the Ottoman sultans; it is from this garden that the name \"Dolmabahçe\" (Filled-in Garden) comes from the Turkish \"dolma\" meaning \"filled\" and \"bahçe\" meaning \"garden.\" Various small summer palaces and wooden pavilions were built here during the 18th and 19th centuries ultimately forming a palace complex named Beşiktaş Waterfront Palace. The area of 110,000 m² is confined by Bosphorus on the east side, while a steep precipice bounds it on the west side, such that after the building of the new 45,000 m² monoblock Dolmabahçe Palace a relatively limited space has remained for a garden complex which would normally surround such a palace.\n\nDolmabahçe is the largest palace in Turkey. It has an area of , and contains 285 rooms, 46 halls, 6 baths (\"hamam\") and 68 toilets.\n\nThe design contains eclectic elements from the Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical styles, blended with traditional Ottoman architecture to create a new synthesis. The palace layout and décor reflect the increasing influence of European styles and standards on Ottoman culture and art during the Tanzimat period. The exterior, in particular the view from the Bosporus, shows a classical European two-wing arrangement which is divided by a big avant-corps with two side avant-corps.\n\nFunctionally, on the other hand, the palace retains elements of traditional Ottoman palace life, and also features of traditional Turkish homes. It is strictly separated structurally in a southern wing (\"Mabeyn-i Hümâyûn\", or \"Selamlık\", the quarters reserved for the men) which contains the public representation rooms, and a northern wing (\"Harem-i Hümâyûn\", the Harem) serving as the private residential area for the Sultan and his family. The two functional areas are separated by the big Ceremonial Hall (\"Muayede Salonu\") with a floor area of and a high dome. Since the harem had to be completely isolated from the outside world, the main entrance for the visitors is located on the narrow southern side. There, the representation rooms are arranged for receptions of visitors and of foreign diplomats. The harem area includes eight interconnected apartments for the wives of the sultan, for his favourites and concubines, and for his mother, each with its own bathroom.\n\nWhereas the Topkapı has exquisite examples of Iznik tiles and Ottoman carving, the Dolmabahçe palace is extensively decorated with gold and crystal. Fourteen tonnes of gold were used to gild the ceilings. The world's largest Bohemian crystal chandelier is in the Ceremonial Hall. The chandelier was assumed to be a gift from Queen Victoria, however in 2006 the receipt was found showing it was paid for in full. It has 750 lamps and weighs 4.5 tonnes. Dolmabahçe has the largest collection of Bohemian and Baccarat crystal chandeliers in the world. The famous \"Crystal Staircase\" has the shape of a double horseshoe and is built of Baccarat crystal, brass and mahogany.\n\nExpensive stones such as Marmara (Proconnesian) marble, Egyptian alabaster (calcite, also known as onyx-marble), and Porphyry from Pergamon were used for the decoration.\n\nThe palace includes a large number of Hereke palace carpets made by the Hereke Imperial Factory. Also featured are 150-year-old bearskin rugs originally presented to the Sultan as a gift by Tsar Nicholas I.\n\nA collection of 202 oil paintings is on display in the palace. A highlight of the collection are 23 paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky which he created as a court painter during his stays in Istanbul. The collection also includes paintings by Gustave Boulanger, Jean-Léon Gérôme, Eugène Fromentin, Stanisław Chlebowski, Félix Ziem, Karl Joseph Kuwasseg, Fausto Zonaro, Théo van Rysselberghe and Alexander Sandor Svoboda. There are also paintings by Turkish painters such as Osman Hamdi Bey, Halil Pasha and Osman Nuri Pasha in this art museum.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the palace's equipment implemented the highest technical standards. Gas lighting and water-closets were imported from Great Britain, whereas the palaces in continental Europe were still lacking these features at that time. Later, electricity, a central heating system and an elevator were installed.\n\nA visit to the Dolmabahce Palace begins at the Medhal Hall. Rooms leading off the Medhal are towards the sea and the land. The rooms facing the sea were used by the leading Ottoman officials, the Grand Vizier and the other state ministers, while the rooms facing the land were used by various administrators of the palace and the state, such as the Palace Marshall, Şeyhülislam, and members of the House of Representatives (\"Meclis-i Mebusan\") and the Senate (\"Meclis-i Ayan\").\n\nGuests would first wait in this hall and then would be led inside at the proper time by a palace protocol officer. On entering the Medhal, one sees Boulle tables on both sides of the room, which bear the monogram of Sultan Abdülmecid on top. The royal monogram of the sultan is also on the fireplace. The English chandelier hanging in the middle of this room has sixty arms. The Hereke fabrics used as upholstery for the furniture and as draperies are in the royal shade of red.\n\nThe second room after the Medhal to the right is the Clerk's Hall, also referred to as the \"Tiled Room.\" The largest painting in the palace collection, a depiction of the Surre Procession by Stefano Ussi, hangs on the left wall of this hall. Surre was used to refer to the caravans which travelled from Istanbul to Mecca during the religious month of Recep, bearing the monetary aid used to support the maintenance and the decoration of the Kaaba and to provide financial assistance to the local population of Hejaz.\n\nOn the wall to the right is a painting signed by Rudolf Ernst depicting the fire at the Paris Municipal Theater and another painting of a Dutch Village Girl by Delandre. Decorated with French style furniture, this room also contains very valuable porcelain vases.\n\nMustafa Kemal Atatürk spent the last days of his life in the palace as his health deteriorated. He died at 9:05 A.M. on November 10, 1938, in a bedroom located in the former harem area of the palace. All the clocks in the palace were stopped and set to 9:05 after his death. The clocks outside of his room now are set to the actual time in Turkey, but the clock in the room in which he died still points to 9:05.\n\nA number of further residential buildings are located near the palace including the palace of the Crown Prince (\"Veliaht Dairesi\"), the quarters of the gentlemen-in-waiting (\"Musahiban Dairesi\"), the dormitories of the servants (\"Agavat Dairesi\", \"Bendegan Dairesi\") and of the guards (\"Baltacilar Dairesi\"), the quarters of the Chief Eunuch (\"Kizlaragasi Dairesi\"). Further buildings include imperial kitchens (\"Matbah-i Amire\"), stables, an aviary (\"Kusluk\"), a plant nursery (\"Fidelik\"), a flour mill, a greenhouse (\"Sera\"), a Hereke carpet workshop (\"Hereke dökümhanesi\"), a glass manufactory, a foundry, a pharmacy etc.\n\nA baroque style mosque designed by Garabet Balyan was built near the palace in 1853—1855. It was commissioned by queen mother Bezm-i Âlem Valide Sultan. Since 1948 the building housed the Naval Museum, but the museum was moved to another location in 1960 after the coup d'état of May, 27th. In 1967 the mosque was returned for worship.\n\nA clock tower (\"Dolmabahçe Saat Kulesi\") was erected in front of the Imperial Gate (Saltanat Kapisi) on a square along the European waterfront of Bosphorus next to the mosque. The tower was ordered by Sultan Abdülhamid II and designed by the court architect Sarkis Balyan between 1890 and 1895. Its clock was manufactured by the French clockmaker house of Jean-Paul Garnier, and installed by the court clock master Johann Mayer.\n\n\n"}

By checking the digital signature, a DNS resolver is able to check if the information is identical (i.e. unmodified and complete) to the information published by the zone owner and served on an authoritative DNS server. While protecting IP addresses is the immediate concern for many users, DNSSEC can protect any data published in the DNS, including text records (TXT) and mail exchange records (MX), and can be used to bootstrap other security systems that publish references to cryptographic certificates stored in the DNS such as Certificate Records (CERT records, RFC 4398), SSH fingerprints (SSHFP, RFC 4255), IPSec public keys (IPSECKEY, RFC 4025), and TLS Trust Anchors (TLSA, RFC 6698).\n\nDNSSEC \"does not\" provide confidentiality of data; in particular, all DNSSEC responses are authenticated but not encrypted. DNSSEC \"does not\" protect against DoS attacks directly, though it indirectly provides some benefit (because signature checking allows the use of potentially untrustworthy parties; this is true only if the DNS server is using a self-signed certificate, not recommended for Internet-facing DNS servers).\n\nOther standards (not DNSSEC) are used to secure bulk data (such as a DNS zone transfer) sent between DNS servers. As documented in IETF RFC 4367, some users and developers make false assumptions about DNS names, such as assuming that a company's common name plus \".com\" is always its domain name. DNSSEC cannot protect against false assumptions; it can only authenticate that the data is truly from or not available from the domain owner.\n\nThe DNSSEC specifications (called \"DNSSEC-bis\") describe the current DNSSEC protocol in great detail. See RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035. With the publication of these new RFCs (March 2005), an earlier RFC, RFC 2535 has become obsolete.\n\nIt is widely believed that securing the DNS is critically important for securing the Internet as a whole, but deployment of DNSSEC specifically has been hampered () by several difficulties:\n\nMicrosoft Windows uses a \"stub resolver\"; Windows 7 and beyond in particular use a \"non-validating\" (but DNSSEC-aware) kind. For it to place any real reliance on DNSSEC services, this stub resolver must trust both the \"recursive name servers\" in question (which is usually controlled by the ISP) and the communication channels between itself and those name servers, using methods such as IPsec (use of which is not widespread), SIG(0), or TSIG.\n\nDNSSEC works by digitally signing records for DNS lookup using public-key cryptography. The correct DNSKEY record is authenticated via a chain of trust, starting with a set of verified public keys for the DNS root zone which is the trusted third party. Domain owners generate their own keys, and upload them using their DNS control panel at their domain-name registrar, which in turn pushes the keys via secDNS to the zone operator (e.g., Verisign for .com) who signs and publishes them in DNS.\n\nDNS is implemented by the use of several resource records. To implement DNSSEC, several new DNS record types were created or adapted to use with DNSSEC:\n\nWhen DNSSEC is used, each answer to a DNS lookup contains an RRSIG DNS record, in addition to the record type that was requested. The RRSIG record is a digital signature of the answer DNS resource record set. The digital signature is verified by locating the correct public key found in a DNSKEY record. The NSEC and NSEC3 records are used to provide cryptographic evidence of the non-existence of any RR. The DS record is used in the authentication of DNSKEYs in the lookup procedure using the chain of trust. NSEC and NSEC3 records are used for robust resistance against spoofing.\n\nDNSSEC was designed to be extensible so that as attacks are discovered against existing algorithms, new ones can be introduced in a backward-compatible fashion. The following table defines, as of April 2013, the security algorithms that are most often used:\n\nFrom the results of a DNS lookup, a security-aware DNS resolver can determine whether the authoritative name server for the domain being queried supports DNSSEC, whether the answer it receives is secure, and whether there is some sort of error. The lookup procedure is different for recursive name servers such as those of many ISPs, and for stub resolvers such as those included by default in mainstream operating systems. Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but DNSSEC-aware stub resolver.\n\nUsing the chain of trust model, a Delegation Signer (DS) record in a parent domain (DNS zone) can be used to verify a DNSKEY record in a subdomain, which can then contain other DS records to verify further subdomains. Say that a recursive resolver such as an ISP name server wants to get the IP addresses (A record and/or AAAA records) of the domain \"www.example.com\".\n\n\nThere are several exceptions to the above example.\n\nFirst, if \"example.com\" does not support DNSSEC, there will be no RRSIG record in the answer and there will not be a DS record for \"example.com\" in the \"com\" zone. If there is a DS record for \"example.com\", but no RRSIG record in the reply, something is wrong and maybe a man in the middle attack is going on, stripping the DNSSEC information and modifying the A records. Or, it could be a broken security-oblivious name server along the way that stripped the DO flag bit from the query or the RRSIG record from the answer. Or, it could be a configuration error.\n\nNext, it may be that there is not a domain name named \"www.example.com\", in which case instead of returning a RRSIG record in the answer, there will be either an NSEC record or an NSEC3 record. These are \"next secure\" records that allow the resolver to prove that a domain name does not exist. The NSEC/NSEC3 records have RRSIG records, which can be verified as above.\n\nFinally, it may be that the \"example.com\" zone implements DNSSEC, but either the \"com\" zone or the root zone do not, creating an \"island of security\" which needs to be validated in some other way. , deployment of DNSSEC to root is completed. The .com domain was signed with valid security keys and the secure delegation was added to the root zone on 1 April 2011.\n\nStub resolvers are \"minimal DNS resolvers that use recursive query mode to offload most of the work of DNS resolution to a recursive name server.\" A stub resolver will simply forward a request to a recursive name server, and use the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the response as a \"hint to find out whether the recursive name server was able to validate signatures for all of the data in the Answer and Authority sections of the response.\" Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but AD-bit-aware stub resolver.\n\nA \"validating stub resolver\" can also potentially perform its own signature validation by setting the Checking Disabled (CD) bit in its query messages. A validating stub resolver uses the CD bit to perform its own recursive authentication. Using such a validating stub resolver gives the client end-to-end DNS security for domains implementing DNSSEC, even if the Internet service provider or the connection to them is not trusted.\n\nFor the non-validating stub resolver to place any real reliance on DNSSEC services, the stub resolver must trust both the recursive name servers in question (which is usually controlled by the Internet service provider) and the communication channels between itself and those name servers, using methods such as IPsec, SIG(0), or TSIG. The use of IPsec is not widespread.\n\nTo be able to prove that a DNS answer is correct, one needs to know at least one key or DS record that is correct from sources other than the DNS. These starting points are known as trust anchors and are typically obtained with the operating system or via some other trusted source. When DNSSEC was originally designed, it was thought that the only trust anchor that would be needed was for the DNS root. The root anchors were first published on 15 July 2010.\n\nAn \"authentication chain\" is a series of linked DS and DNSKEY records, starting with a trust anchor to the authoritative name server for the domain in question. Without a complete authentication chain, an answer to a DNS lookup cannot be securely authenticated.\n\nTo limit replay attacks, there are not only the normal DNS TTL values for caching purposes, but additional timestamps in RRSIG records to limit the validity of a signature. Unlike TTL values which are relative to when the records were sent, the timestamps are absolute. This means that all security-aware DNS resolvers must have clocks that are fairly closely in sync, say to within a few minutes.\n\nThese timestamps imply that a zone must regularly be re-signed and re-distributed to secondary servers, or the signatures will be rejected by validating resolvers.\n\nDNSSEC involves many different keys, stored both in DNSKEY records, and from other sources to form trust anchors.\n\nIn order to allow for replacement keys, a key rollover scheme is required. Typically, this involves first rolling out new keys in new DNSKEY records, in addition to the existing old keys. Then, when it is safe to assume that the time to live values have caused the caching of old keys to have passed, these new keys can be used. Finally, when it is safe to assume that the caching of records using the old keys have expired, the old DNSKEY records can be deleted. This process is more complicated for things such as the keys to trust anchors, such as at the root, which may require an update of the operating system.\n\nKeys in DNSKEY records can be used for two different things and typically different DNSKEY records are used for each. First, there are key signing keys (KSK) which are used to sign other DNSKEY records. Second, there are zone signing keys (ZSK) which are used to sign other records. Since the ZSKs are under complete control and use by one particular DNS zone, they can be switched more easily and more often. As a result, ZSKs can be much shorter than KSKs and still offer the same level of protection while reducing the size of the RRSIG/DNSKEY records.\n\nWhen a new KSK is created, the DS record must be transferred to the parent zone and published there. The DS records use a message digest of the KSK instead of the complete key in order to keep the size of the records small. This is helpful for zones such as the .com domain, which are very large. The procedure to update DS keys in the parent zone is also simpler than earlier DNSSEC versions that required DNSKEY records to be in the parent zone.\n\nDNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is an IETF working group with the goal of developing protocols and techniques that allow Internet applications to establish cryptographically secured communications with TLS, DTLS, SMTP, and S/MIME based on DNSSEC.\n\nThe new protocols will enable additional assurances and constraints for the traditional model based on public key infrastructure. They will also enable domain holders to assert certificates for themselves, without reference to third-party certificate authorities.\n\nSupport for DNSSEC stapled certificates was enabled in Google Chrome 14, but was later removed. For Mozilla Firefox, support is provided by an add-on while native support is currently awaiting someone to start working on it.\n\nDNS is a critical and fundamental Internet service, yet in 1990 Steve Bellovin discovered serious security flaws in it. Research into securing it began, and progressed dramatically when his paper was made public in 1995. The initial RFC 2065 was published by the IETF in 1997, and initial attempts to implement that specification led to a revised (and believed fully workable) specification in 1999 as IETF RFC 2535. Plans were made to deploy DNSSEC based on RFC 2535.\n\nUnfortunately, the IETF RFC 2535 specification had very significant problems scaling up to the full Internet; by 2001 it became clear that this specification was unusable for large networks. In normal operation DNS servers often get out of sync with their parents. This isn't usually a problem, but when DNSSEC is enabled, this out-of-sync data could have the effect of a serious self-created denial of service. The original DNSSEC required a complex six-message protocol and a lot of data transfers to perform key changes for a child (DNS child zones had to send all of their data up to the parent, have the parent sign each record, and then send those signatures back to the child for the child to store in a SIG record). Also, public key changes could have absurd effects; for example, if the \".com\" zone changed its public key, it would have to send 22 million records (because it would need to update all of the signatures in all of its children). Thus, DNSSEC as defined in RFC 2535 could not scale up to the Internet.\n\nThe IETF fundamentally modified DNSSEC, which is called \"DNSSEC-bis\" when necessary to distinguish it from the original DNSSEC approach of RFC 2535. This new version uses \"delegation signer (DS) resource records\" to provide an additional level of indirection at delegation points between a parent and child zone. In the new approach, when a child's master public key changes, instead of having to have six messages for every record in the child, there is one simple message: the child sends the new public key to its parent (signed, of course). Parents simply store one master public key for each child; this is much more practical. This means that a little data is pushed to the parent, instead of massive amounts of data being exchanged between the parent and children. This does mean that clients have to do a little more work when verifying keys. More specifically, verifying a DNS zone's KEY RRset requires two signature verification operations instead of the one required by RFC 2535 (there is no impact on the number of signatures verified for other types of RRsets). Most view this as a small price to pay, since it makes DNSSEC deployment more practical.\n\nCryptographically proving the absence of a domain requires signing the response to every query for a non-existent domain. This is not a problem for online signing servers, which keep their keys available online. However, DNSSEC was designed around using offline computers to sign records so that zone-signing-keys could be kept in cold storage. This represents a problem when trying to authenticate responses to queries for non-existent domains since it is impossible to pre-generate a response to every possible hostname query.\n\nThe initial solution was to create NSEC records for every pair of domains in a zone. Thus if a client queried for a record at the non-existent codice_1, the server would respond with an NSEC record stating that nothing exists between codice_2 and codice_3. However, this leaks more information about the zone than traditional unauthenticated NXDOMAIN errors because it exposes the existence of real domains.\n\nThe NSEC3 records (RFC 5155) were created as an alternative that which hashes the name instead of listing them directly. Over time, advancements in hashing using GPUs and dedicated hardware meant that NSEC3 responses could be cheaply brute forced using offline dictionary attacks. NSEC5 has been proposed to allow authoritative servers to sign NSEC responses without having to keep a private key that can be used to modify the zone. Thus stealing an NSEC5KEY would only result in the ability to more easily enumerate a zone.\n\nDue to the messy evolution of the protocol and a desire to preserve backwards compatibility, online DNSSEC signing servers return a \"white lie\" instead of authenticating a denial of existence directly. The technique outline in RFC 4470 returns a NSEC record in which the pairs of domains lexically surrounding the requested domain. For example, request for codice_1 would thus result in an NSEC record proving that nothing exists between the (fictitious) domains codice_5 and codice_6. CloudFlare pioneered another approach in which proves that \"the record exists but the requested record type does not\" that has the advantage of a significantly reduced payload size.\n\nThe Internet is critical infrastructure, yet its operation depends on the fundamentally insecure DNS.\nThus, there is strong incentive to secure DNS, and deploying DNSSEC is generally considered to be a critical part of that effort.\nFor example, the U.S. \"National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace\" specifically identified the need to secure DNS.\nWide-scale deployment of DNSSEC could resolve many other security problems as well, such as secure key distribution for e-mail addresses.\n\nDNSSEC deployment in large-scale networks is also challenging. Ozment and Schechter observe that DNSSEC (and other technologies) has a \"bootstrap problem\": users typically only deploy a technology if they receive an immediate benefit, but if a minimal level of deployment is required before \"any\" users receive a benefit greater than their costs (as is true for DNSSEC), it is difficult to deploy. DNSSEC can be deployed at any level of a DNS hierarchy, but it must be widely available in a zone before many others will want to adopt it. DNS servers must be updated with software that supports DNSSEC, and DNSSEC data must be created and added to the DNS zone data. A TCP/IP-using client must have their DNS resolver (client) updated before it can use DNSSEC's capabilities. What is more, any resolver must have, or have a way to acquire, at least one public key that it can trust before it can start using DNSSEC.\n\nDNSSEC implementation can add significant load to some DNS servers. Common DNSSEC-signed responses are far larger than the default UDP size of 512 bytes. In theory, this can be handled through multiple IP fragments, but many \"middleboxes\" in the field do not handle these correctly. This leads to the use of TCP instead. Yet many current TCP implementations store a great deal of data for each TCP connection; heavily loaded servers can run out of resources simply trying to respond to a larger number of (possibly bogus) DNSSEC requests. Some protocol extensions, such as TCP Cookie Transactions, have been developed to reduce this loading. To address these challenges, significant effort is ongoing to deploy DNSSEC, because the Internet is so vital to so many organizations.\n\nEarly adopters include Brazil (.br), Bulgaria (.bg), Czech Republic (.cz), Namibia (.na) Puerto Rico (.pr) and Sweden (.se), who use DNSSEC for their country code top-level domains; RIPE NCC, who have signed all the reverse lookup records (in-addr.arpa) that are delegated to it from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). ARIN is also signing their reverse zones. In February 2007 TDC became the first Swedish ISP to start offering this feature to its customers.\n\nIANA publicly tested a sample signed root since June 2007. During this period prior to the production signing of the root, there were also several alternative trust anchors. The IKS Jena introduced one on January 19, 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced another on March 27 of the same year, while ICANN themselves announced a third on February 17, 2009.\n\nOn June 2, 2009, the Public Interest Registry signed the .org zone. The Public Interest Registry also detailed on September 26, 2008, that the first phase, involving large registrars it has a strong working relationship with (\"friends and family\") would be the first to be able to sign their domains, beginning \"early 2009\". On June 23, 2010, 13 registrars were listed as offering DNSSEC records for .ORG domains.\n\nVeriSign ran a pilot project to allow .com and .net domains to register themselves for the purpose of NSEC3 experimentation. On February 24, 2009, they announced that they would deploy DNSSEC across all their top level domains (.com, .net, etc.) within 24 months, and on November 16 of the same year, they said the .com and .net domains would be signed by the first quarter of 2011, after delays caused by technical aspects of the implementation. This goal was achieved on-schedule and Verisign's DNSSEC VP, Matt Larson, won InfoWorld's Technology Leadership Award for 2011 for his role in advancing DNSSEC.\n\nDNSSEC was first deployed at the root level on July 15, 2010. This is expected to greatly simplify the deployment of DNSSEC resolvers, since the root trust anchor can be used to validate any DNSSEC zone that has a complete chain of trust from the root. Since the chain of trust must be traced back to a trusted root without interruption in order to validate, trust anchors must still be configured for secure zones if any of the zones above them are not secure. For example, if the zone \"signed.example.org\" was secured but the \"example.org\" zone was not, then, even though the \".org\" zone and the root are signed, a trust anchor has to be deployed in order to validate the zone.\n\nPolitical issues surrounding signing the root have been a continuous concern, primarily about some central issues:\n\nIn September 2008, ICANN and VeriSign each published implementation proposals and in October, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) asked the public for comments. It is unclear if the comments received affected the design of the final deployment plan.\n\nOn June 3, 2009, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced plans to sign the root by the end of 2009, in conjunction with ICANN, VeriSign and the NTIA.\n\nOn October 6, 2009, at the 59th RIPE Conference meeting, ICANN and VeriSign announced the planned deployment timeline for deploying DNSSEC within the root zone. At the meeting it was announced that it would be incrementally deployed to one root name server a month, starting on December 1, 2009, with the final root name server serving a DNSSEC signed zone on July 1, 2010, and the root zone will be signed with a RSA/SHA256 DNSKEY. During the incremental roll-out period the root zone will serve a \"Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone\" (DURZ) that uses dummy keys, with the final DNSKEY record not being distributed until July 1, 2010. This means the keys that were used to sign the zone use are deliberately unverifiable; the reason for this deployment was to monitor changes in traffic patterns caused by the larger responses to queries requesting DNSSEC resource records.\n\nThe .org top-level domain has been signed with DNSSEC in June 2010, followed by .com, .net, and .edu later in 2010 and 2011. Country code top-level domains were able to deposit keys starting in May 2010. more than 25% of top-level domains are signed with DNSSEC.\n\nOn January 25, 2010, the L (ell) root server began serving a \"Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone\" (DURZ). The zone uses signatures of a SHA-2 (SHA-256) hash created using the RSA algorithm, as defined in RFC 5702. As of May 2010, all thirteen root servers have begun serving the DURZ. On July 15, 2010, the first root full production DNSSEC root zone was signed, with the SOA serial 2010071501. Root trust anchors are available from IANA.\n\nUnderneath the root there is a large set of top level domains that must be signed in order to achieve full DNSSEC deployment. The List of Internet top-level domains provides details about which of the existing top level domains have been signed and linked to the root.\n\nIn March 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced the DNSSEC Lookaside Validation registry. DLV was intended to make DNSSEC easier to deploy in the absence of a root trust anchor. At the time it was imagined that a validator might have to maintain large numbers of trust anchors corresponding to signed subtrees of the DNS. The purpose of DLV was to allow validators to offload the effort of managing a trust anchor repository to a trusted third party. The DLV registry maintains a central list of trust anchors, instead of each validator repeating the work of maintaining its own list.\n\nTo use DLV, a validator that supports it is needed, such as BIND or Unbound, configured with a trust anchor for a DLV zone. This zone contains DLV records; these have exactly the same format as DS records, but instead of referring to a delegated sub-zone, they refer to a zone elsewhere in the DNS tree. When the validator cannot find a chain of trust from the root to the RRset it is trying to check, it searches for a DLV record that can provide an alternative chain of trust.\n\nGaps in the chain of trust, such as unsigned top-level domains or registrars that do not support DNSSEC delegations, meant administrators of lower-level domains could use DLV to allow their DNS data to be validated by resolvers which had been configured to use DLV. This may have hindered DNSSEC deployment by taking pressure off registrars and TLD registries to properly support DNSSEC. DLV also adds complexity by adding more actors and code paths for DNSSEC validation. Further uncertainty arises because not all validating resolvers support or use DLV. Clients querying one resolver might get DLV-validated responses while clients using a different validating resolver would not.\n\nDLV was not widely used. By May 2015, ISC's DLV registry contained under 5,000 domain names and fewer than 10% of these had an unsigned parent domain name. ISC has announced plans to decommission its DLV registry. It is not clear yet if or when DLV support will be removed from BIND and other implementations of validating resolvers.\n\nThe Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sponsors the \"DNSSEC Deployment Initiative\".\nThis initiative encourages \"all sectors to voluntarily adopt security measures that will improve security of the Internet's naming infrastructure, as part of a global, cooperative effort that involves many nations and organizations in the public and private sectors.\"\nDHS also funds efforts to mature DNSSEC and get it deployed inside the U.S. federal government.\n\nIt was reported that on March 30, 2007, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security proposed \"to have the key to sign the DNS root zone solidly in the hands of the US government.\" However no U.S. Government officials were present in the meeting room and the comment that sparked the article was made by another party. DHS later commented on why they believe others jumped to the false conclusion that the U.S. Government had made such a proposal: \"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is funding the development of a technical plan for implementing DNSSec, and last October distributed an initial draft of it to a long list of international experts for comments. The draft lays out a series of options for who could be the holder, or \"operator,\" of the Root Zone Key, essentially boiling down to a governmental agency or a contractor. \"Nowhere in the document do we make any proposal about the identity of the Root Key Operator,\" said Maughan, the cyber-security research and development manager for Homeland Security.\"\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published NIST Special Publication 800-81 Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide on May 16, 2006, with guidance on how to deploy DNSSEC. NIST intended to release new DNSSEC Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements in NIST SP800-53-R1, referencing this deployment guide. U.S. agencies would then have had one year after final publication of NIST SP800-53-R1 to meet these new FISMA requirements. However, at the time NSEC3 had not been completed. NIST had suggested using split domains, a technique that is known to be possible but is difficult to deploy correctly, and has the security weaknesses noted above.\n\nOn 22 August 2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum requiring U.S. Federal Agencies to deploy DNSSEC across .gov sites; the .gov root must be signed by January 2009, and all subdomains under .gov must be signed by December 2009. While the memo focuses on .gov sites, the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency says it intends to meet OMB DNSSEC requirements in the .mil (U.S. military) domain as well. NetworkWorld's Carolyn Duffy Marsan stated that DNSSEC \"hasn't been widely deployed because it suffers from a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma... with the OMB mandate, it appears the egg is cracking.\"\n\nSeveral ISPs have started to deploy DNSSEC-validating DNS recursive resolvers. Comcast became the first major ISP to do so in the United States, announcing their intentions on October 18, 2010 and completing deployment on January 11, 2012.\n\nAccording to a study at APNIC, the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation rose to 8.3% in May 2013. About half of these clients were using Google's public DNS resolver.\n\nIn September 2015, Verisign announced their free public DNS resolver service, and although unmentioned in their press releases, it also performs DNSSEC validation.\n\nBy the beginning of 2016, APNIC's monitoring showed the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation had increased to about 15%.\n\nGoogle Public DNS is a freely provided, public DNS service, fully supporting DNSSEC.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, Google Public DNS enabled the DNSSEC validation by default; meaning all queries will be validated unless clients explicitly opt out.\n\nBIND, the most popular DNS management software, enables DNSSEC support by default since version 9.5.\n\nQuad9 enables DNSSEC by default on its main servers. However, they also provide servers that don't use DNSSEC on different IP addresses.\n\nIt has been known to break proper MX record lookup on Microsoft Exchange 2013 and older causing #550 4.4.7 QUEUE.Expired errors.\n\nDNSSEC deployment requires software on the server and client side. Some of the tools that support DNSSEC include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "796657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=796657", "title": "Faceted classification", "text": "Faceted classification\n\nA Faceted classification is a classification scheme used in organizing knowledge into a systematic order. A faceted classification uses semantic categories, either general or subject-specific, that are combined to create the full classification entry. Many library classification systems use a combination of a fixed, enumerative taxonomy of concepts with subordinate facets that further refine the topic.\n\nThere are two primary types of classification used for information organization: enumerative and faceted. An enumerative classification contains a full set of entries for all concepts. A faceted classification system uses a set of semantically cohesive categories that are combined as needed to create an expression of a concept. In this way, the faceted classification is not limited to already defined concepts. While this makes the classification quite flexible, it also makes the resulting expression of topics complex. To the extent possible, facets represent \"clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive aspects of a subject. The premise is that any subject or class can be analyzed into its component parts (i.e., its aspects, properties, or characteristics).\" Some commonly used general-purpose facets are time, place, and form.\n\nThere are few purely faceted classifications; the best known of these is the Colon Classification of S. R. Ranganathan, a general knowledge classification for libraries. Some other faceted classifications are specific to special topics, such as the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the faceted classification of occupational safety and health topics created by D. J. Foskett for the International Labour Organization.\n\nMany library classifications combine the enumerative and faceted classification techniques. The Dewey Decimal Classification, the Library of Congress Classification, and the Universal Decimal Classification all make use of facets at various points in their enumerated classification schedules. The allowed facets vary based on the subject area of the classification. These facets are recorded as tables that represent recurring types of subdivisions within subject areas. There are general facets that can be used wherever appropriate, such as geographic subdivisions of the topic. Other tables are applied only to specific areas of the schedules. Facets can be combined to create a complex subject statement.\n\nDaniel Joudrey and Arlene Taylor describe faceted classification using an analogy: “If one thinks of each of the faces of a cut and polished diamond as a facet of the whole, one can picture a classification notation that has small notations standing for subparts of the whole topic, which are pieced together to create a complete classification notation.\"\n\nFaceted classifications exhibit many of the same problems as classifications based on a hierarchy. In particular, some concepts could belong in more than one facet, so their placement in the classification may appear to be arbitrary to the classifier. It also tends to result in a complex notation because each facet must be distinguishable as recorded.\n\nSearch in systems with faceted classification can enable a user to navigate information along multiple paths corresponding to different orderings of the facets. This contrasts with traditional taxonomies in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed and unchanging. It is also possible to use facets to filter search results to more quickly find desired results.\n\nThe Colon Classification developed by S. R. Ranganathan is an example of general faceted classification designed to be applied to all library materials. In the Colon Classification system, a book is assigned a set of values from each independent facet. This facet formula uses punctuation marks and symbols placed between the facets to connect them. Colon classification was named after its use of the colon as the primary symbol in its notation.\n\nRanganathan stated that hierarchical classification schemes like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) or the Library of Congress Subject Headings are too limiting and finite to use for modern classification and that many items can pertain information to more than one subject. He organized his classification scheme into 42 classes. Each class can be categorized according to particular characteristics, that he called facets. Ranganathan said that there are five fundamental categories that can be used to demonstrate the facets of a subject: personality, material, energy, space and time. He called this the PMEST formula: \n\nAnother example of a faceted classification scheme is the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC), the UDC is considered to be a complex multilingual classification that can be used in all fields of knowledge.\nThe Universal Decimal Classification scheme was created at the end of the nineteenth century by Belgian bibliographers Paul Otlet and Henri la Fontaine. The goal of their system was to create an index that would be able to record knowledge even if it is stored in non-conventional ways including materials in notebooks and ephemera. They also wanted their index to organize material systematically instead of alphabetically.\n\nThe UDC has an overall taxonomy of knowledge that is extended with a number of facets, such as language, form, place and time. Each facet has its own symbol in the notation, such as: \"=\" for language; \"-02\" for materials, \"[...]\" for subordinate concepts.\n\nD. J. Foskett, a member of the Classification Research Group in London, developed classification of occupational safety and health materials for the library of the International Labour Organization. After a study of the literature in the field, he created the classification with the following facets:\n\n\nNotation was solely alphabetic, with the sub-facets organized hierarchically using extended codes, such as \"g Industrial equipment and processes\", \"ge Machines\".\n\nWhile not strictly a classification system, the AAT uses facets similar to those of Ranganathan's Colon Classification:\n\n\nHierarchical classification refers to the classification of objects using one \"single\" hierarchical taxonomy. Faceted classification may actually employ hierarchy in one or more of its facets, but allows for the use of more than one taxonomy to classify objects.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "464479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=464479", "title": "Ghost Festival", "text": "Ghost Festival\n\nThe Ghost Festival, also known as the Hungry Ghost Festival, Zhongyuan Jie (中元节), Gui Jie (鬼节) or Yulan Festival () is a traditional Buddhist and Taoist festival held in certain Asian countries. According to the Chinese calendar (a lunisolar calendar), the Ghost Festival is on the 15th night of the seventh month (14th in southern China).\n\nIn Chinese culture, the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar is called Ghost Day and the seventh month in general is regarded as the Ghost Month (), in which ghosts and spirits, including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the lower realm. Distinct from both the Qingming Festival (or Tomb Sweeping Day, in spring) and Double Ninth Festival (in autumn) in which living descendants pay homage to their deceased ancestors, during Ghost Festival, the deceased are believed to visit the living.\n\nOn the fifteenth day the realms of Heaven and Hell and the realm of the living are open and both Taoists and Buddhists would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is veneration of the dead, where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a papier-mâché form of material items such as clothes, gold and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals (often vegetarian meals) would be served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former only includes older generations. Other festivities may include, buying and releasing miniature paper boats and lanterns on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities.\n\nEvidence of ancestral veneration in Chinese culture appears as early as its earliest records, with the Shang kings offering sacrifices to their forefathers. Many aspects of the present festival celebrated across East Asia derive from such native rituals in ancient China.\n\nThe timing and origin story of the modern Ghost Festival, however, ultimately derives from the Mahayana scripture known as the Yulanpen or Ullambana Sutra.The sutra records the time when Maudgalyayana achieves abhijñā and uses his new found powers to search for his deceased parents. Maudgalyayana discovers that his deceased mother was reborn into the preta or hungry ghost realm. She was in a wasted condition and Maudgalyayana tried to help her by giving her a bowl of rice. Unfortunately as a preta, she was unable to eat the rice as it was transformed into burning coal. Maudgalyayana then asks the Buddha to help him; whereupon Buddha explains how one is able to assist one’s current parents and deceased parents in this life and in one’s past seven lives by willingly offering food, etc., to the sangha or monastic community during Pravarana (the end of the monsoon season or vassa), which usually occurs on the 15th day of the seventh month whereby the monastic community transfers the merits to the deceased parents, etc.,\n\nThe Theravadan forms of the festival in South and Southeast Asia (including Cambodia's Pchum Ben) are much older, deriving from the Petavatthu, a scripture in the Pali Canon that probably dates to the 3rdcentury. The Petavatthu account is broadly similar to that later recorded in the Yulanpen Sutra, although it concerns the disciple Sāriputta and his family rather than Moggallāna.\n\nThe Ghost Festival is held during the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of Buddhist monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community. During this month, the gates of hell are opened up and ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment. These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who forgot to pay tribute to them after they died, or those who were never given a proper ritual send-off. They have long needle-thin necks because they have not been fed by their family, or as a punishment so that they are unable to swallow. Family members offer prayers to their deceased relatives, offer food and drink and burn hell bank notes and other forms of joss paper. Joss paper items are believed to have value in the afterlife, considered to be very similar in some aspects to the material world, People burn paper houses, cars, servants and televisions to please the ghosts. Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune. A large feast is held for the ghosts on the fourteenth day of the seventh month, when people bring samples of food and place them on an offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. Lotus-shaped lanterns are lit and set afloat in rivers and out onto seas to symbolicly guide the lost souls of forgotten ancestors to the afterlife.\n\nIn some East Asian countries today, live performances are held and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats are always empty as this is where the ghosts sit. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes as the sound is believed to attract and please the ghosts. Some shows include Chinese opera, dramas, and in some areas, even burlesque shows. Traditionally Chinese opera was the main source of entertainment but the newer shows, concerts, dramas, wars and so forth are referred to as Getai. These acts are better known as \"Merry-making\".\n\nFor rituals, Buddhists and Taoists hold ceremonies to relieve ghosts from suffering, many of them holding ceremonies in the afternoon or at night (as it is believed that the ghosts are released from hell when the sun sets). Altars are built for the deceased and priests and monks alike perform rituals for the benefit of ghosts. Monks and priests often throw rice or other small foods into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.\n\nDuring the evening, incense is burnt in front of the doors households. Incense stands for prosperity in Chinese culture, so families believe that there is more prosperity in burning more incense. During the festival, some shops are closed as they want to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it.\n\nFourteen days after the festival, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to hell, people float water lanterns and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a paper boat. The lanterns are used to direct the ghosts back to the underworld, and when they go out, it symbolizes that they have found their way back.\n\nConcert-like performances are a prominent feature of the Ghost Festival in Singapore and Malaysia. Those live concerts are popularly known as Getai in Mandarin or \"Koh-tai\" in Hokkien Chinese. They are performed by groups of singers, dancers, entertainers and opera troops or puppet shows on a temporary stage that is set up within a residential district. The festival is funded by the residents of each individual district. During these \"Getai\" the front row is left empty for the special guests—the ghosts. It is known to be bad luck to sit on the front row of red seats, if anyone were to sit on them, they would become sick or similarly ailed. \n\nIn Singapore, people would pray to ghosts/Spirits or ancestors with offerings and fruits outside their homes for the start of the 7th month. Most patriotic events were held on 7th Month for Singapore, which includes general and presidential elections, the Olympics and the National Day Parade. This is where the number of outings were minimised.\n\nIn Indonesia, the festival popularly known as \"Cioko\", or \"Sembahyang Rebutan\" in Indonesian, (Scrambling prayer). People gather around temples and bring an offering to a spirit who died in an unlucky way, and after that, they distribute it to the poor. The way people scramble the offerings is the origin of the festival name.\n\nTraditionally, it is believed that ghosts haunt the island of Taiwan for the entire seventh lunar month, when the mid-summer \"Ghost Festival\" is held. The month is known as \"Ghost Month\". The first day of the month is marked by opening the gate of a temple, symbolizing the gates of hell. On the twelfth day, lamps on the main altar are lit. On the thirteenth day, a procession of lanterns is held. On the fourteenth day, a parade is held for releasing water lanterns. Incense and food are offered to the spirits to deter them from visiting homes and spirit paper money is also burnt as an offering. During the month, people avoid surgery, buying cars, swimming, moving house, marrying, whistling and going out or taking pictures after dark. It is also important that addresses are not revealed to the ghosts.\n\n, also , is an annual event in Japan on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month, when people give gifts to their superiors and acquaintances. Originally it was an annual event for giving gifts to the ancestral spirits.\n\nOne of the three days that form the of Daoism, it is sometimes considered a \"zassetsu\", a type of seasonal day in the Japanese calendar.\n\n\"Obon\" (sometimes transliterated \"O-bon\"), or simply \"Bon\", is the Japanese version of the Ghost Festival. It has since been transformed over time into a family reunion holiday during which people from the big cities return to their home towns and visit and clean the resting places of their ancestors.\n\nTraditionally including a dance festival called Bon Odori, Obon has existed in Japan for more than 500 years. In modern Japan, it is held on July 15 in the eastern part (Kantō), on August 15 in the western part (Kansai), and in Okinawa and the Amami Islands it is celebrated as in China on the 15th day of the 7th lunar month.\n\nThis festival is known as \"Tết Trung Nguyên\" and is viewed as a time for the pardoning of condemned souls who are released from hell. The \"homeless\" should be \"fed\" and appeased with offerings of food. Merits for the living are also earned by the release of birds and fish. The lunar month in which the festival takes place is colloquially known as \"Tháng Cô Hồn\" - the month of lonely spirits, and believed to be haunted and particularly unlucky.\n\nInfluenced by Buddhism, this holiday coincides with \"Vu Lan\"，the Vietnamese transliteration for Ullambana.\n\nIn modern times, Vu Lan is also seen as Mother's Day. People with living mothers would bear a red rose and would give thanks while those without can choose to bear a white rose; and attend services to pray for the deceased.\n\nIn Asian Theravadin Buddhist countries, related traditions, ceremonies and festivals also occur. Like its \"Ullambana Sutra\"-origins in Mahayana Buddhist countries, the Theravada scripture, the \"Petavatthu\" gave rise to the idea of offering food to the hungry ghosts in the Theravada tradition as a form of merit-making. In stories published in the \"Petavatthu\" Maudgalyayana, who also plays the central role in the rise of the concept in the Mahayana tradition, along with Sariputta also play a role in the rise of the concept in the Theravada tradition. Similarly to the rise of the concept in Mahayana Buddhism, a version of \"Maudgalyayana Rescues His Mother\", where Maudgalyayana is replaced by Sariputta is recorded in the \"Petavatthu\" and is in part the basis behind the practice of the concept in Theravadin societies. The concept of offering food to the hungry ghosts is also found in early Buddhist literature, in the \"Tirokudda Kanda\".\n\nIn Cambodia, a fifteen-day-long annual festival known as \"Pchum Ben\" occurs generally in September or October. Cambodians pay their respects to deceased relatives up to seven generations. The gates of hell are believed to open during this period and many people make offerings to these hungry ghosts.\n\nIn Laos, a festival known as, \"Boun khao padap din\" usually occurs in September each year and goes on for two weeks. During this period, it is believed that hungry ghosts are freed from hell and enter the world of the living. A second festival known as \"Boun khao salak\" occurs directly after the conclusion of \"Boun khay padab din\". During this period, food offerings are made to the hungry ghosts.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, food offerings are made to the hungry ghosts on the seventh day, three months and one year after the death day of a deceased person. It is a ceremony conducted after death as part of traditional Sri Lankan Buddhist funeral rites and is known as \"mataka dānēs\" or \"matakadānaya\". The offerings that are made acquire merit which are then transformed back into the equivalent goods in the world of the hungry ghosts. The offering that is offered on the seventh day, comes a day after personalized food offerings are given in the garden to the spirit of the deceased relative, which occurs on the sixth day. The deceased who do not reach the proper afterworld, the Hungry Ghost realm, are feared by the living as they are believed to cause various sicknesses and disasters to the living. Buddhist monks are called upon to perform \"pirit\" to ward off the floating spirits. The rite is also practiced in Thailand and Myanmar and is also practiced during the Ghost Festival that is observed in other Asian countries.\n\nIn Thailand, a fifteen-day-long annual festival known as \"Sat Thai\" is celebrated between September and October in Thailand especially in southern Thailand, particularly in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat. Like related festivals and traditions in other parts of Asia, the deceased are believed to come back to earth for fifteen days and people make offerings to them. The festival is known as \"Sat Thai\" to differentiate it from the Chinese Ghost Festival which is known as \"Sat Chin\" in the Thai language.\n\n\n\n"}

The published inventory describes jewels and silver-plate belonging to Elizabeth I of England with detailed references to other source material.\n\nThe sources used by Collins were British Library Harley MS. 1560 and Stowe MS.555. The manuscripts represent the \"Quenis Majesties juelles plate and other stuff\" in 1574 and additions by gift or purchase over the next 20 years which were kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. Collins also collated information from other books and manuscripts to cross-reference information about the objects listed. Gifts of plate to the queen passed from the Privy Chamber to the Jewel House. Some pieces were melted down and others were given as diplomatic gifts. When the queen travelled, the towns she visited often gave her gifts of silver-gilt cups.\n\nIn 1574 the office of the Jewel House was located in a two-storey building on the south side of the White Tower. This contained the records of the jewels and packing materials for sending jewels to court. Until the Restoration in 1660, the Jewel House contained the monarch's personal collection of jewellery as well as the royal plate and the inalienable state regalia. The coronation regalia were kept separately at Westminster Abbey. Many items of personal jewellery from the Jewel House were pawned or sold by Charles I during the early 17th century, and most of the plate and regalia were melted down and turned into coins by Parliament during the English Civil War. A surviving jewel is the Chequers Ring.\n\nA list of jewels in the possession of Anne of Denmark in 1606 was published by Diana Scarisbrick.\n\nThe 1574 inventory was made John Astley, Master and Treasurer of the Jewel House. The Master had an annual salary of £50 and was able to exact payments from goldsmiths appointed to work for the Jewel House, and those who transported plate from the House to diplomats. The post was lucrative, but some of the perquisites of the role were exaggerated or overstated by Sir Gilbert Talbot, who was made Master in 1660 and in 1680 wrote a treatise entitled \"Of the Jewel house\".\n\nIn the inventory the items were listed in categories; below the main categories are given with some examples of the 1,605 entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5458371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5458371", "title": "Leitkultur", "text": "Leitkultur\n\nLeitkultur is a German concept, which can be translated as 'guiding culture' or 'leading culture', less literally as 'common culture', 'core culture' or 'basic culture'. The term was first introduced in 1998 by the German-Arab sociologist Bassam Tibi \nand from 2000 onward the term figured prominently in the national political debate in Germany about national identity and immigration. The term then became associated with a monocultural vision of German society, with ideas of European cultural superiority, and with policies of compulsory cultural assimilation.\n\nBassam Tibi first suggested a 'Leitkultur' in his 1998 book \"Europa ohne Identität\" ('Europe without identity'). He defined it in terms of what are commonly called western values, and spoke of a \"European\" rather than a German 'Leitkultur'. \"The values needed for a core culture are those of modernity: democracy, secularism, the Enlightenment, human rights and civil society.\" (B. Tibi, Europa ohne Identität, p. 154). These core values are similar to those of the 'liberal-democratic basic order' (\"Freiheitlich-demokratische Grundordnung\") which is considered the foundational value of the post-war West Germany, and the unified German state after the German reunification of 1990. Tibi advocated a cultural pluralism based on a value consensus, rather than monoculturalism. However, he also opposed a value-blind multiculturalism, and the development of parallel societies where immigrant minorities live and work, isolated from the western society around them. Tibi advocated a structured immigration policy, and opposed illegal immigration into Germany.\n\nTheo Sommer, then publisher of Die Zeit, was one of the first to use the term 'German core culture', as part of a debate about the assimilation of immigrants in Germany, and national core values: \"Integration necessarily implies a far-reaching assimilation onto the German guiding culture and its core values\" („Der Kopf zählt, nicht das Tuch“, Zeit 30/1998).\n\nHowever, the term only became a national political issue in October 2000. Friedrich Merz, then leader of the Christian-Democratic CDU in the Bundestag wrote an article for Die Welt, rejecting multiculturalism, and advocated controls on immigration and compulsory assimilation in a German core culture. Merz, after being reminded of the earlier article by Theo Sommer, referred to Sommer as the inspiration for this policy. Sommer, in turn, claimed he was only advocating integration of immigrants, and distanced himself from the call for restriction of immigration (\"Einwanderung ja, Ghettos nein - Warum Friedrich Merz sich zu Unrecht auf mich beruft\", Zeit 47/2000). Merz, supported by the Brandenburg interior minister Jörg Schönbohm (CDU), proposed an annual immigration limit of 200 000, about 0.25% of the German population. Anything more, according to Merz, would exceed the absorptive capacity of German society. Immigrants had a duty, according to Merz, to adopt the basic cultural values of Germany.\n\nBassam Tibi now protested, that politicians had appropriated his proposal for their own purposes, and pronounced the entire debate a 'failure'. Most of the reactions to Merz's proposals were negative, and the debate split along party lines, with the government coalition (social-democratic SPD and the Green Party) rejecting a German Leitkultur. Cem Özdemir (then Bundestag member, Green Party) and others defended 'integration' as against 'assimilation' of immigrants. Forcing immigrants to assimilate at any price would in any case, according to Özdemir, deny the reality that Germany was a multicultural society. Some reactions in media outside Germany likened the Leitkultur proposals to the enforced Germanisation in territories occupied by Nazi Germany, where the population was usually forbidden to speak local languages.\n\nIn 2005, the new presiding chairman of the Bundestag, Norbert Lammert (CDU), proposed a re-opening of the debate on a Leitkultur. The proposal, he said in an interview in Der Zeit, has been summarily dismissed without argument; \"The noticeable thing about the very short national debate is that the Leitkultur concept was widely rejected, as a negative reflex, but that there was a wide recognition of the problems underlying the debate\" (\"Das Parlament hat kein Diskussionsmonopol\", Zeit 43/2005). There was no noticeable reaction to his suggestion at first: Lammert then proposed to move the discussion to a European level, to establish a \"European\" core identity. In an article in Die Welt, he wrote: \"If Europe wishes to preserve the multiplicity of nation identities, and yet establish a collective identity, it must develop a political core ideal, a set of foundational values and convictions. Such a European core ideal must necessarily be based on the common cultural roots of Europe, on its shared history, and on shared religious tradition,\" (Die Welt, 13 December 2005).\n\nIn early 2006, the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy led to violent protests in Islamic countries, against depictions of Muhammad in a Danish newspaper. Lammert now restated his demand for a re-opening of the Leitkultur debate. The cartoon protests, he said, show that German society must reach a consensus on its \"foundational values and a minimal standard of value orientation.\" The 'constitutional patriotism' (proposed by the philosopher Jürgen Habermas) would not suffice, since all constitutions are based on non-random cultural assumptions. Fundamental rights, such as freedom of the press and freedom of expression must be fully supported by a social consensus. Given the background of a multicultural society in Germany, according to Lammert, rights must be linked to certain cultural values, and a nationwide debate on this issue was necessary, to re-establish such a link. The idea of multiculturalism, was \"perhaps originally well-intentioned\", but had reached the end of its useful life. Multiculturalism could not be allowed to create a society where all values were equal - and therefore in practice had no values. In conflicts of values, society had to decide which values were valid, and which were not. Lammert insisted that he had never spoken of a \"German\" Leitkultur. The essential elements of the German culture were not specifically German, he said, and it would be better to speak of a \"European\" Leitkultur. (Deutschlandfunk interview with Lammert, reported in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 8 February 2006).\n\nJörg Schönbohm also remains a vigorous advocate of a German core culture: in 2006 he suggested changing the name of the Berlin radio station \"radiomultikulti\" into 'Radio Schwarz-Rot-Gold' (black-red-gold, the colours of the flag of Germany).\n\nThe concept of Leitkultur figured prominently in the national debate about a test for immigrants to Germany. These tests are known in English as 'citizenship tests', see Life in the United Kingdom test, but they often apply to all immigrants, not just those seeking naturalisation. In Germany, the federal parliament (Bundestag) ultimately decided against a national immigrant test, but the 16 states can set their own tests, which can be based on an officially defined German culture and values.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2274000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2274000", "title": "Lidérc", "text": "Lidérc\n\nA lidérc () is a unique supernatural being of Hungarian folklore. It has three known varieties, which often borrow traits from one another.\n\nThe first, more traditional form of the lidérc is as a miracle chicken, \"csodacsirke\" in Hungarian, which hatches from the first egg of a black hen kept warm under the arm of a human. Some versions of the legend say that an unusually tiny black hen's egg, or any egg at all, may become a lidérc, or that the egg must be hatched by placing it in a heap of manure.\nThe lidérc attaches itself to people to become their lover. If the owner is a woman, the being shifts into a man, but instead of pleasuring the woman, it fondles her, sits on her body, and sometimes sucks her blood, making her weak and sick after a time. From this source comes a Hungarian word for nightmare -- \"lidércnyomás\", which literally means \"lidérc pressure\", from the pressure on the body while the being sits on it. Alternate names for the lidérc are \"iglic\", \"ihlic\" in Csallóköz, \"lüdérc\", \"piritusz\" in the south, and \"mit-mitke\" in the east.\nThe lidérc hoards gold and thus makes its owner rich. To dispose of this form of the lidérc, it must be persuaded to perform an impossible task, such as haul sand with rope, or water with a sieve. It can also be destroyed by locking it into a tree hollow.\n\nThe second variety of the lidérc is as a tiny being, a temporal devil, \"földi ördög\" in Hungarian. It has many overlapping qualities with the miracle chicken form, and it may also be obtained from a black hen's egg, but more often it is found accidentally in rags, boxes, glass bottles, or in the pockets of old clothes. A person owning this form of the lidérc suddenly becomes rich and is capable of extraordinary feats, because the person's soul has supposedly been given to the lidérc, or even to the Devil.\n\nThe third variety is as a Satanic lover, \"ördögszerető\" in Hungarian, quite similar to an incubus or succubus. This form of the lidérc flies at night, appearing as a fiery light, a will o' the wisp, or even as a bird of fire. In the northern regions of Hungary and beyond, it is also known as \"ludvérc\", \"lucfir\". In Transylvania and Moldavia it goes by the names of \"lidérc\", \"lüdérc\", and sometimes \"ördög\", literally, the Devil. While in flight, the lidérc sprinkles flames. On earth, it can assume a human shape, usually the shape of a much lamented dead relative or lover. Its footprints are that of a horse. The lidérc enters houses through chimneys or keyholes, brings sickness and doom to its victims. It leaves the house with a splash of flames and dirties the walls. Burning incense and birch branches prevent the lidérc from entering one's dwelling. In the eastern regions of Hungary and beyond, it is said the lidérc is impossible to outrun, it haunts cemeteries, and it must disappear at the first crow of a rooster at dawn.\n\nA lidérc is mentioned in the famous historical novel \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco.\n\nA shape-shifting lidérc is revealed in \"Lost Girl\" episode \"Caged Fae\" (301).\n\n"}

Prefixes indicating prepositions, conjunctions and articles (such as ב, ד, ה, ו, כ, ל, ש) have generally been removed, with the following exceptions:\n\nIn addition, suffixes modifying abbreviations have been removed using the same guidelines. When searching for an abbreviation ending in a plural, adjectival, or possessive suffix like ית, ים, י, ה, ו, ות, the suffix should be removed if not an integral part of the abbreviation, as described in regard to prefixes above. Depending on the typography, note that the gershayim (״) may either:\n\n\nWhere only part of a term is abbreviated (for example, תנא דבי אליהו abbreviates as תנא דב״א), the entry is sorted on the abbreviated portion (דב״א), and the unabbreviated portion appears in square brackets ([תנא]) to produce תנא] דב״א].\n\nSome abbreviations included here are actually gematria (Hebrew numeronyms), but the number is so closely associated with some noun that it is grammatically used as a noun and is synonymous with it, for example ב״ן, Ban.\n\nOther abbreviations contain a variable gematria component alongside other words, like the chapter references פי״א perek yud-alef (chapter 11) or פ״ט perek tet (chapter 9). Rather than list separate entries for every possible gematria, or use only one example number, the gematria component is replaced with [x] to produce (for example) [x]פ״.\n\nSome Aramaic and Yiddish abbreviations may not be included here; more may be found in the List of Aramaic acronyms and the List of Yiddish acronyms, respectively.\n\nMany of the abbreviations here may be similar or identical to those in the other lists of acronyms. In fact, a work written in Hebrew may have Aramaic acronyms interspersed throughout (ex. Tanya), much as an Aramaic work may borrow from Hebrew (ex. Talmud, Midrash, Zohar). Although much less common than Aramaic abbreviations, some Hebrew material contains Yiddish abbreviations too (for example, Chassidic responsa, commentaries, and other material).\n\nNot all lexemes containing a geresh (׳) or gershayim (״) are abbreviations, and such non-abbreviations do not appear in this list. Therefore, if after much effort an abbreviation still cannot be deciphered, it is sometimes helpful to try an alternate mode of interpretation. For instance, aside from abbreviations, the geresh and gershayim marks may also be used:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn modern editions of many Hebrew books with technical jargon, it is common to find lists of the abbreviations used in the work, for example, in the back near the index, or sometimes near the table of contents.\n\n\nWhile the other above lists of abbreviations played a supporting role in the creation of this list, most of these abbreviations were encountered in and added directly from primary and secondary sources. It is impractical to cite the source of every item in the list above in its original place. Instead, an effort will be made here to list the sources where these abbreviations were found and expanded from their originally published form, or repeated in their source in their expansion, often with explanations, annotations and translations:\n\n\nIn addition, Kehot's Chabad Heritage Series of translated, elucidated and vowelized maamorim of the Rebbes of Lubavitch were extremely helpful.\n"}

This challenge was on the ground that the provision violated his right to privacy by authorising inspectors to search his commercial premises and to seize items without a warrant. While the section authorised inspections of both licensed and unlicensed premises, he confined his challenge to inspections of unlicensed premises.\n\nThe court held that it had been established in \"Mistry v Interim National Medical and Dental Council of South Africa\" that \"the scope of a person's privacy extends only to those aspects to which a legitimate expectation of privacy can be harboured.\"\n\nThe court also made it clear that a regulated business's right to privacy was softened the more its business was public, closely regulated and potentially hazardous to the public.\n\nThe question to be answered was whether the statute authorising the regulatory inspection could achieve its ends through means less damaging to the right to privacy: for example, by requiring a warrant. In other words, the court had to consider the applicant's expectation of privacy and the breadth of the legislation.\n\nThe court held that section 65 served the worthy goal of ensuring enforcement of the statute's regulation of the gambling industry, and that, although the owner or occupier of a gambling business generally had a low reasonable expectation of privacy in the gambling premises, the provisions relating to unlicensed premises were aimed at collecting evidence for criminal prosecution, and thus constituted significant intrusions. Their breadth extended the scope of permissible searches beyond situations in which the expectation of privacy was low, thereby endangering the privacy of property owners and occupiers who were not adequately informed of the limits of the inspection.\n\nFurthermore, it was held that section 65 could achieve its purpose of promoting enforcement of the Act while simultaneously protecting the right to privacy of persons who were subjected to searches. Section 65 was accordingly held to be an unreasonable limitation of section 14 of the Constitution, and therefore unconstitutional. The application for leave to appeal was thus upheld, as was the appeal.\n"}

His assets had subsequently disappeared under suspicious circumstances, leaving only liabilities.

The noses, some made of marble and others of plaster, were all originally exhibited on the Greek and Roman statues in the glyptotek itself.\n\nThe white marble favored by Classical sculptors is easily broken, and many antique statues have been damaged since their creation by accidents, iconoclasm, or vandalism. During the 19th century, it was common practice for museums to exhibit such marble sculptures in a \"restored\" state, with damaged parts repaired or reconstructed to make the statue look as much as possible as it did when it was first created. The noses of antique statues are especially likely to be damaged or missing, so many Greek or Roman statues acquired new noses during this era. Modern exhibition practice may differ from museum to museum. The minimalist approach prescribes removing such 19th-century additions in the interest of authenticity, as has been done in Copenhagen.\n\nThe Ny Carlsberg museum, which has an extensive collection of Greek and Roman marble statues, participated both in 19th-century restoration and in 20th-century \"de-restoration.\" As a result, many Roman portrait heads are now noseless again, with their restored noses removed to the museum's nasothek.\n\nThe museum display explains its contents in both Danish and English.

The Centre \"strives to enhance the appreciation of Australian children's literature by collecting, preserving and making available wide-ranging resources\", including \"both the literature and the historical and cultural context in which it was created\".\n\nIn 1974 Lu Rees, then President of the ACT Branch of The Children's Book Council of Australia, proposed to the other branches, that the ACT Branch would begin a collection of biographical files on Australian children's authors and illustrators and a collection of their works. Lu Rees offered her personal collection of several hundred works \"as a first step.\" The collection was maintained in the home of a member of The Children's Book Council of Australia, and developed with donations mainly from Children's Book Council of Australia members. In 1979, in response to the International Year of the Child, Lu Rees initiated a plan to collect overseas translated editions of Australian authors.\n\nIn 1980, Belle Alderman first suggested that the collection, which had outgrown the home of Lu Rees, could be housed at the Canberra College of Advanced Education (now the University of Canberra), where it could be accessed by students and researchers. In the same year, the Library of the Canberra College of Advanced Education, under Chief Librarian the late Victor Crittenden O.A.M. (first Chair of the Lu Rees Archives Management Committee), agreed to house the collection, catalogue the resources and provide in kind support. At the time of handing over in July 1980, the collection became known as the Lu Rees Archives, after its founder. The collection then held around 1000 books and 50 research files on authors and illustrators. In 1981 Australian publishers agreed to donate their children's books, a practice which has continued.\n\nLu Rees, who received both an M.B.E. (in 1964) and was created a member of the Order of Australia (A.M.) (in 1983) for her services to children's literature, died on 23 January 1983. Posthumously, Mrs Rees was awarded the Dromkeen Medal for services to children's literature.\n\nSince 1983, the Archives has been managed by the Lu Rees Archives Management Committee, members of which include representatives of the local and national Children's Book Council of Australia, the University of Canberra Library, national and public libraries and tertiary institutions in Canberra, as well as those managing the Archives and its activities. The Children's Book Council of Australia ACT Branch took over management of the Archives in 1990. The following year, the University and The Children's Book Council of Australia ACT Branch signed a formal agreement outlining roles and responsibilities, and the agreement was renewed in 2003. Up until 1989, when the University of Canberra Library was restructured, part-time staffing was available from the Library, and until a part-time position funded by The Children's Book Council of Australia began in 1995, administration of the Archives was undertaken by volunteers. Management of the Archives is guided by the Lu Rees Archives Strategic Plan.\n\nAn honorary position of Collections Development Manager has existed since 1990 and Dr Belle Alderman, Emeritus Professor of Children's Literature, has occupied this position since its establishment.\n\nAn outline of the collection development objectives can be found in the current collection development policy, the Lu Rees Archives of Australian Children's Literature Strategic Plan, and on the webpage ‘List of item types held at the archives.’ The Lu Rees Archives has collected material by and about Australian children's book authors and illustrators, including manuscripts, artworks, books (over 20,000 works, including over 2400 translations in more than 53 languages), artifacts, reference material, theses, rare books, periodicals, and over 390 research files featuring thirty different categories of materials. The Archives houses two publishers' archives, the Walter McVitty Books (donated in 2000) and Omnibus Books (donated in 2004), and has extensive photographic and audio material relating to Australian children's literature. An ongoing project to develop 'Artwork Frameworks' to record artwork held by the Archive to aid with cataloguing and research began in 2009. An aim of the Archives is to collect all the individual editions of published works.\n\n\nTo secure the future of The Lu Rees Archives, \"the Archives aims to create an endowment fund of $1,000,000 by 2020\".\n\nThe Archives has a strong volunteer body with various expertise who pursue specific projects (e.g. preservation of works) and progress the strategic plan. The volunteer program is permanent and essential to daily functioning of the Archive. Currently, the positions of Collections Development Manager, and Editor of the ‘Lu Rees Archives : Notes, Books and Authors’ Journal, are voluntary. In 2010, volunteers contributed over 2013 hours of unpaid work to the archives.\n\n‘The Lu Rees Archives : Notes, Books and Authors’ (ISSN 0725-7015) journal, begun in 1981, is published once per year and contains articles by authors, illustrators and publishers on children's literature, as well as news from the Archive (an index of the journal is available online). The Archives annual reports and Strategic Plan are available online.\n\nThe Archives has an extensive website http://www.canberra.edu.au/lu-rees, and information on how to access the catalogue and author/illustrator files online.

{"id": "56398981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56398981", "title": "Nunes memo", "text": "Nunes memo\n\nThe Nunes memo (formally titled Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) is a four-page memorandum written for U.S. Representative Devin Nunes by his staff and released to the public by the Republican-controlled committee on February 2, 2018. The memo alleges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \"may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources\" to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant in October 2016 and in three subsequent renewals on Trump adviser Carter Page in the early phases of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. \nOn July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released heavily redacted versions of four FISA warrant applications for Carter Page which showed that key assertions made in the Nunes memo were false or misleading, corroborating the rebuttal made by Democrats. \n\nNunes is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a supporter of FISA surveillance extension. Former Trump campaign CEO and chief strategist Steve Bannon has described Nunes as Trump's second-strongest ally in Congress. In April 2017, Nunes stepped aside from chairing the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee conducted an inquiry into whether Nunes had violated applicable ethics rules with respect to his apparent secret coordination with White House officials. Nunes then began his own parallel secret investigation. The Ethics Committee investigation ended in December 2017, after which Nunes claimed that he had never recused himself.\n\nRepublican legislators who favored public release of the memo argued that the memo presents evidence that a group of politically biased FBI employees abused the FISA warrant process for the purpose of undermining the Donald Trump presidency. These congressmen alleged that there was excessive and improper dependence on the Trump–Russia dossier, which was funded in part by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, when the Justice Department applied to the FISA court to conduct electronic surveillance on Trump aide Carter Page during the course of the campaign. Political allies of Donald Trump attempted to use the memo to pivot attention away from the Special Counsel investigation of the Trump presidential campaign's role in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Prior to release of the memo, news media reported that Trump told his associates that release of the memo would discredit the investigation.\n\nA social media campaign, under the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo, emerged in mid-January 2018 to publicly release the memo despite some of its classified contents. Journalist and national security advocacy groups reported that Russian-linked bots on Twitter helped spread the controversial hashtag.\n\nTrump approved release of the Republican document over the objections of the FBI and the U.S. Intelligence Community. The FBI issued a rare statement expressing \"grave concerns\" about factual omissions and the accuracy of the memo. Within Congress, anticipation of the release of the memo sparked controversy, mainly along political lines. House Republicans released the memo on February 2, 2018.\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee prepared a classified 10 page rebuttal of claims in the Nunes memo, which was initially blocked for release. After the Nunes memo was released to the public, the House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to release the Democrats' memo. On February 9, Trump blocked release of the Democrats' memo, saying the committee should redact classified and sensitive material before releasing it to the public. A redacted version of the Democratic memo was ultimately released on February 24.\nThe memo states that a FISA warrant on Carter Page was sought and obtained on October 21, 2016, and that there were three subsequent 90-day renewals. The memo notes that FISA submissions are classified information.\n\nThe memo “raise[s] concern as to the legitimacy and legality” of the FISA application process relating to Page, and that probable cause was not made in the warrant application. It makes five main points. First it alleges that the Steele dossier \"formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application.\" The memo asserted that Christopher Steele was paid $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, and that this information was not disclosed in the initial October 2016 FISA application or subsequent renewals. However, the FBI's application for a FISA warrant did describe, in a footnote, the origins and political background of the dossier, a fact conceded by Nunes and other Republican leaders on February 5, after the memo's release.\n\nSecond, the memo alleges that the FISA application relied \"extensively\" on a \"Yahoo! News\" report from September 2016 by Michael Isikoff, which referenced Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow and used information from Steele. It asserts that the article was \"derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.\" Isikoff has stated that the information he got from Steele was actually information that the FBI already had. He also described Steele as serious and credible.\n\nThird, the memo accuses Steele of being biased against the candidacy of Donald Trump, stating he was \"desperate\" and \"passionate\" that Trump would lose. It goes on to say Bruce Ohr knew about this bias and that it was not reflected in the FISA applications. Ohr however did not work on counter intelligence matters and had no role in obtaining the FISA warrants on Page.\n\nThe memo's fourth point quotes Bill Priestap saying that the corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its \"infancy\" in October 2016 during the FISA application. The memo further alleges that Andrew McCabe testified that \"no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) without the Steele dossier information.\" Other members of the House Intelligence Committee and sources close to the matter have stated that the Nunes memo \"misquoted\" and \"mischaracterized\" McCabe's testimony, which was given in private and has not been made public.\n\nThe memo also confirms that the spark for the FBI investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russians was not the Steele dossier, but rather the comments made by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, who told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that the Russians possessed \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of hacked emails. That confirmation contradicts earlier claims by some that the investigation had been triggered by the Steele dossier. The memo notes that Papadopoulos is mentioned in the Page FISA application, and says \"there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos.\" It also says the FBI's Russian investigation was opened by Peter Strzok, who is accused of having \"a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton.\"\n\nThe memo also shows that the FISA warrant on Page was renewed three times. In each instance, the FBI had to show the signing judge that the warrant had merit. News accounts in 2017 indicated that because of the nature of his ties to Russia, Page had been under FBI scrutiny and had already been the subject of a FISA warrant in 2014, at least two years before the Trump campaign.\n\nFinally, the memo asserts that former FBI Director James Comey testified to Congress that the Steele dossier was \"salacious and unverified.\" However, Comey's prepared remarks show that he was referring specifically to \"some personally sensitive aspects\" of the dossier, not the entire dossier.\n\nThe memo was produced by a small group of House Republicans and staff, led by Devin Nunes, as part of an investigation into how the FBI used the Trump–Russia dossier. Democratic committee members were not informed about the investigation into the FBI or the preparation of the memo, a possible violation of committee rules. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that Nunes had not read all of the relevant source material, although Nunes had argued for months that the FBI and DOJ had taken part in a conspiracy. \n\nNunes had previously recused himself from the committee's investigation into Russia's interference in U.S. elections due to a House ethics investigation into Nunes' coordination with the Trump administration. The House Ethics Committee stated that \"Nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct\" (the ethics investigation ended when the committee was unable to obtain the relevant classified information). However, after offering to step aside from the investigation into Russian interference, Nunes began his own \"parallel\" investigation, whose purpose appeared to be to undermine the original ongoing investigation.\n\nSince January 18 a growing number of Republicans began calling for the release of the memo.\n\nAdam Schiff released a statement and a letter to Nunes on January 31, 2018, stating that Nunes had \"made material changes to the memo he sent to White House – changes not approved by the Committee\" and that the White House was \"reviewing a document the Committee has not approved for release.\" In response Peter King, who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, stated, \"My understanding is this was agreed on beforehand among Republicans. There's one small part in the memo which in no way affects the substance in the memo.\" He said it involved removing only \"three or four words\" and came at the request of the FBI.\n\nA social media campaign under the hashtag \"#ReleaseTheMemo\" emerged on January 19, 2018, to publicly release the memo despite some of its classified contents.\n\nAccording to the \"Hamilton 68\" project run by the bipartisan Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) which tracks Russian propaganda efforts on Twitter, the hashtag was promoted by Russian twitter bot accounts, with a 230,000 percent spike in the promotion of the hashtag by these accounts. Clint Watts, one of the founding researchers of ASD, said the social media campaign started trending after Julian Assange advocated for the memo's release, which was then repeated by Russian influence networks. Twitter stated that a \"preliminary analysis of available geographical data for tweets with the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo ... has not identified any significant activity connected to Russia with respect to tweets posting original content to this hashtag.\" According to an analysis by CNN the hashtag was pushed by over a thousand newly created accounts, of which 460 were without a profile picture. CNN also noted that the hashtag was promoted by prominent American conservatives and Republicans, including Donald Trump Jr. and Mark Meadows.\n\nCarter Page originally came to the attention of the FBI counterintelligence unit in 2013, prior to his becoming a Trump campaign adviser, when the unit learned that Russian spies were trying to use Page as a source of information and to recruit him as an agent; this resulted in Page being interviewed by the FBI in June 2013. He was under secret intelligence surveillance beginning in 2014. Page claimed that the information he provided to the Russians was innocuous. Page was the subject of at least one FISA warrant, going back to 2014, when he was alleged to have been colluding with the Russian government or knowingly working as an agent on its behalf. In March 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump listed the little-known Page as one of his foreign policy advisers.\n\nIn a May 2016 meeting in London, Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos told the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, that the Russians possessed \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of hacked emails. Two months later, Australian officials passed this information to American officials. This began the inquiry into Trump's relationship to Russia.\n\nIn July 2016, Page traveled to Moscow for five days,<ref name=\"Prokop_2/2/2018\"></ref> where he spoke at two meetings on July 7 & 8. Page had received permission from the Trump campaign to make the trip. On July 8, Page emailed Trump campaign officials about his presentation at the New Economic School in Moscow and described meeting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich. He said Dvorkovich \"expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the vast range of current international problems.\" Page was later forced, under oath, to reveal he had also met Dvorkovich during the visit.\n\nThe Trump–Russia dossier alleges that in July, Carter Page secretly met Rosneft chairman Igor Sechin in Moscow, together with a \"senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN\"; that Sechin offered Trump a 19% stake in Rosneft (worth about $11 billion) in exchange for lifting the sanctions against Russia after his election,<ref name=\"Bertrand_11/6/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Weindling_1/11/2017\"></ref> and that Page confirmed, on Trump's \"full authority\", that he intended to lift the sanctions.<ref name=\"Withnall_Sengupta_1/12/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Bertrand_1/27/2017\"></ref><ref name=\"Tracy_11/7/2017\"></ref>\n\nIn September, after reports surfaced about Page's July trip to Russia, the Trump campaign said Page was not part of the campaign and never had been. Page then said he was taking a leave of absence.\n\nA month later, in October 2016, and after Page left the campaign, the FBI sought a FISA warrant to investigate his connections to Russia. The warrant was granted by a FISA court judge and has since been renewed thrice, with each 90-day extension requiring new evidence \"pertinent to intelligence-related collection\" in order to back up the original application and to show that the warrant continues to be productive.\n\nShortly after the release of the memo, \"Time\" magazine reported that in 2013, Carter Page bragged about being an \"informal adviser to the Kremlin\" in a letter to the editor. Page was asked about this admission on February 6, 2017, on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" program, and had trouble explaining how he reconciled his dual roles as Trump adviser and Kremlin adviser. Page also claimed that he, despite being named foreign policy adviser, had never actually met Trump, contradicting his earlier statements in which he said he had been in a \"number of meetings\" with Trump and had \"learned a tremendous amount from him\".\n\nRepublicans posited that politically-motivated FBI employees attempted to undermine the Trump presidency, citing the Trump–Russia dossier, which they say was an essential part of the evidence used for obtaining a FISA warrant to wiretap Page.<ref name=\"Kiely_2/27/2018\"></ref> According to this argument, the FBI did not disclose to the FISA court that their request for a warrant depended on evidence in the Trump–Russia dossier, a document funded by the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee; according to this line of argument, Rod Rosenstein, Trump's Deputy Attorney General, knew of the funding from Democrats, and his approval of an application that failed to disclose that fact potentially implies that Rosenstein harbors some form of anti-Trump bias. Republicans did eventually concede that the FBI disclosed this information in a footnote.\n\nFusion GPS, the firm behind the document, started its research into Trump with funding from the conservative news outlet \"The Washington Free Beacon\". However, the news outlet stopped funding this research when Donald Trump received the Republican nomination. Attorney Marc Elias then hired Fusion GPS on behalf of his clients, the Democratic National Committee and the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, to continue this research and compile what would become the Donald Trump–Russia dossier. Fusion GPS paid Christopher Steele to write the dossier, and the FBI also paid Steele for the expenses he incurred on \"a trip to Rome to meet with FBI officials\".<ref name=\"Robertson_2/7/2018\"></ref>\n\nAllies of Trump tried to move focus away from the Trump presidential campaign's alleged role in the Russian election interference by attempting to use the Nunes memo to portray the Special Counsel investigation as the real scandal. In the hours before the expected release of the memo, sources reported that Trump told his associates that release of the memo would discredit the investigation and give him reason to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the supervisor of the Special Counsel investigation.\n\nOn February 3, 2018, Trump praised the Nunes memo and tweeted: \"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their [sic] was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction.\" Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) disagreed, stating on February 4 on CBS’ \"Face the Nation\": \"I actually don't think it has any impact on the Russia probe.\" He went on to say:\nGowdy went on to say he was \"100 percent\" behind Mueller: \"Look, Russia tried to interfere with our election in 2016 with or without a dossier.\"<ref name=\"Shafer_2/10/2018\"></ref>\n\nGlenn Kessler, a fact checker for \"The Washington Post\", analyzed an accusation made by Devin Nunes in a February 7, 2018, interview on the Hugh Hewitt Show. Kessler's \"Pinocchio Test\" rating was: \" is no evidence that Clinton was involved in Steele's reports or worked with Russian entities to feed information to Steele. That's where Nunes's claim goes off the rails—and why he earns Four Pinocchios.\"<ref name=\"Kessler_2/9/2018\"></ref> According to Kessler \"Four Pinocchios\" equals a \"Whopper\" (the equivalent of an outright lie).<ref name=\"Kessler_9/11/2013\"></ref>\n\nShortly after becoming a trending topic, the memo drew polarizing reactions from government officials and the media, and generally along party lines for lawmakers. The Justice Department (DOJ) released a letter to Congress calling a release of the memo without review \"reckless\" because it could expose intelligence sources and methods. FBI Director Christopher Wray was allowed to read the memo and did so on January 28. On January 29, the majority of the House Intelligence Committee disregarded the DOJ's warnings and voted to approve the memo's release. In response, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee drafted a ten-page rebuttal memo on January 24. Both memos were released to the full House. The Republicans voted against making public the competing memo Democrats had crafted, and rejected a proposal to give the Justice Department and FBI more time to vet the document. The President then had up to five days to review it before it could be officially released.\n\nRepublicans sought a committee vote that would request the release through the President, which would keep the memo confined to committee members until the President responded. The memo could be made public by a vote in the House of Representatives if the President did not act or denied the request, but no vote was scheduled for the full House.\n\nNunes and the House Intelligence Committee denied access to the memo by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the FBI, which expressed a desire to investigate any alleged wrongdoing. The Department of Justice sent a letter to Nunes and called the release of the memo \"extraordinarily reckless.\" Nunes' panel refused to allow the FBI and the Justice Department to view the memo despite their requests.\n\nAdam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement saying it was \"[r]ife with factual inaccuracies\" and was \"meant only to give Republican House members a distorted view of the FBI.\" Schiff also said the memo omits key information on evidence other than Steele's dossier, used in the application for the FISA warrant. \n\nOn July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released a heavily redacted version of the October 2016 FISA warrant application for Carter Page, which stated in part \"The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government\" and \"the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1's campaign.\"\n\nOn January 24, 2018, Trump expressed support for releasing the Nunes memo. He reportedly told close advisers that he believed the memo would reveal the FBI's bias against him, and provide grounds for him to fire Rod Rosenstein. White House Counsel Don McGahn wrote that \"the memorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors\" and that the reason for its release was \"significant public interest in the memorandum.\" After its release, Trump claimed in a tweet that the memo \"totally vindicates\" him.\n\nBefore the memo was released, House Speaker Paul Ryan warned his fellow Republicans against overplaying the contents of the memo and tying it to the Mueller investigation. After the memo was released, Ryan said, \"The matter of concern outlined in this memo is a specific, legitimate one. Our FISA system is critical to keeping America safe from real and evolving threats. It is a unique system with broad discretion and a real impact on Americans' civil liberties.\" Ryan also supported the release of the Democrats' counter-memo.\n\nRepresentative Trey Gowdy, the only Republican on the House Intelligence Committee who actually read the underlying classified material, said the FISA application cited other material besides the dossier, but in his opinion the warrant would not have been authorized without the dossier. He added that the dossier does not invalidate the Russia investigation, which would have been launched with or without it. He said he has confidence in Rosenstein, Wray, and Mueller. \n\nOn February 2, John McCain rebuked his fellow Republicans with the statement, \"The latest attacks against the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests―no party's, no president's, only Putin's. ... If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him.\"<ref name=\"Murdock_2/2/2018\"></ref>\n\nDemocratic leaders in Congress—House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer—called upon House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee, accusing him of abusing his \nposition as committee chairman and of working in coordination with the White House that the committee is supposed to be investigating. Pelosi referred to the document as a \"bogus\" memo which was part of a Republican cover-up campaign; she also said Nunes had disgraced the House committee. Schumer said that the memo aimed to spread \"conspiracy theories\" and attacked federal law enforcement in order to protect Trump from investigation. Democratic House Whip Steny Hoyer also called for Nunes to be removed, saying Nunes' behavior had undermined the American people's trust in his chairmanship of the committee.\n\nJerry Nadler of New York, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, issued a six-page analysis rebutting the memo's legal basis and accusing Republican House members of being part of \"an organized effort to obstruct\" Mueller's investigation. Nadler, who reviewed the classified material used to obtain the FISA warrant, called the memo \"deliberately misleading and deeply wrong on the law.\" He argued the FISA Court had probable cause to believe Page was acting as \"an agent of a foreign power.\"\n\nAdam Schiff has stated that the \"Nunes memo is designed to...[\"put the government on trial\"] by furthering a conspiracy theory that a cabal of senior officials within the FBI and the Justice Department were so tainted by bias against President Donald Trump that they irredeemably poisoned the investigation.\"<ref name=\"Schiff_2/1/2018\"></ref>\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee drafted a classified ten-page rebuttal memo on January 24. However, when the committee voted along partisan lines to release the Nunes memo, it also voted not to release the Democratic memo. On February 5 the committee voted unanimously to release the Democrat’s minority memo, subject to Trump's approval. On February 9, Trump declined to release the rebuttal memo, with the White House suggesting sensitive sections be removed before the memo is made public. McGahn stated this was because of its \"numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages.\" After redactions in consultation with the FBI, the Democratic memo, titled \"Correcting the Record -- The Russia Investigation\", was released on February 24.<ref name=\"Prokop_2/24/2018\"></ref> This rebuttal memo has also been referred to as the Schiff memo after Adam Schiff.\n\nRevelations about the Nunes memo and its surrounding controversy, including speculation about the potential firing of Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, gave rise to comparisons to the Saturday night massacre, alluding to the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox by President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.\n\nGlenn Greenwald called the Republican-led campaign to release the memo \"a bizarre spectacle\" since the Republicans were \"holding a document that only they can release, while pretending to be advocating for its release.\"\n\nIn response to the release of Nunes's document, former FBI director James Comey wrote, \"That's it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what?\" \n\nIn an interview on \"Meet the Press\", former CIA director John O. Brennan said that Nunes had presented only \"one side, in a very selective, cherry-picked memo.\" He said that for Nunes and the Republicans to deny the Democratic minority the ability to release their own memo \"is just appalling, and it clearly underscores just how partisan Mr. Nunes has been.\" Brennan accused Nunes of an abuse of power in the use of his position on the House Intelligence Committee. \"I don't say that lightly,\" he added.\n\nThree former CIA analysts (Jeff Asher, Nada Bakos and Cindy Otis) wrote that the \"politically motivated, recklessly drafted\" Nunes memo \"does not support its main thesis\" alleging abuse by the FBI and Department of Justice regarding their investigation of Carter Page as it \"doesn't offer any evidence of the potential abuse and, in fact, the memo undermines itself\".\n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse has accused the authors of the memo of \"using selective declassification as a tactic—they use declassified information to tell their side, and then the rebuttal is classified.\" Jane Mayer stated that this leaves Christopher Steele's defenders no possibility \"to respond without breaching national-security secrets\".<ref name=\"Mayer_3/12/2018\"></ref>\n\nPaul Rosensweig, former Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and former Whitewater investigator, has analyzed the Nunes memo and explained several reasons for why he believes \"it makes no sense\", is \"not a serious effort at oversight\", and \"fails to make its case\": the timing of the FISA warrant shows that any findings would first have come to light after the election and thus could not have affected it; Carter Page was no longer a member of the Trump campaign at the time of the application; it ignores that Page was under FISA surveillance as early as 2013 because of his proven Russian connections; the attempt to tie the October FISA application to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein is flawed because Rosenstein was a U.S. attorney for the district of Maryland at the time and had nothing to do with that application; the memo \"uses language that is intended to create a misimpression\" by implying that the Trump–Russia dossier was central to the FISA application, when it was only a part of it; and that the memo \"tries to bury\" its \"admission deep in the document\", in the final paragraph, that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections was not triggered by the Steele dossier but by information from Trump advisor Papadopoulos.<ref name=\"Rosenzweig_2/2/2018\"></ref>\n\nOn July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released heavily redacted versions of four FISA warrant applications for Carter Page which showed that key assertions made in the Nunes memo were false or misleading, corroborating the rebuttal made by Democrats. The Nunes memo:\n\n\n\n\nMultiple sources also noted that after its publication, the wiretap warrant was approved, and later renewed, four times by four different judges, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents. Similarly, all four judges — Rosemary Collyer, Anne Conway, Raymond Dearie and Michael Mosman — were assigned to serve on the FISA court by Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative.\n\nThe day after the applications were released, Trump asserted without evidence that they confirmed the Justice Department and FBI had misled the FISA court and as a result his campaign had been illegally spied on to benefit the Clinton campaign. Trump also quoted conservative writer Andrew McCarthy, who had called into question the integrity of the FISA court itself.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1564115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1564115", "title": "Sailors' Snug Harbor", "text": "Sailors' Snug Harbor\n\nSailors' Snug Harbor, also known as Sailors Snug Harbor, Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, and, informally, Snug Harbor, is a collection of architecturally significant 19th-century buildings set in an 83-acre park along the Kill Van Kull on the north shore of Staten Island in New York City, United States. It was once a home for aged sailors. Some of the buildings and the grounds are used by arts organizations under the umbrella of the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden.\n\nSailors' Snug Harbor includes 26 Greek Revival, Beaux Arts, Italianate and Victorian style buildings. The site is considered Staten Island's \"crown jewel\" and \"an incomparable remnant of New York's 19th-century seafaring past.\" It is a National Historic Landmark District.\n\nSnug Harbor was founded through a bequest after the death of Revolutionary War soldier and ship master Captain Robert Richard Randall, namesake of the nearby neighborhood of Randall Manor. Randall left his country estate in Manhattan, bounded by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, 10th Street, and the southern side of 8th Street adjacent to what is now Washington Square, to build an institution to care for \"aged, decrepit and worn-out\" seamen. Randall's disappointed heirs contested the will extensively, delaying the opening of the sailors' home for decades. By the time the will challenge was settled, the once-rural land around the Manhattan estate had become well-developed. Snug Harbor's trustees (appointed by Randall's will, they included the mayor of New York City, the president and vice president of the Marine Society, senior ministers of the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, and the chancellor of the State) decided to maximize the profits on the Manhattan property. They changed the proposed site of the institution to another piece of land bequeathed by Randall: a 130-acre plot on Staten Island overlooking the Kill Van Kull.\n\nSailors' Snug Harbor finally opened in 1833, the country's first home for retired merchant seamen. The residents were referred to as \"inmates\" in the parlance of the day. The institution began with a single building, now the centerpiece in the row of five Greek Revival temple-like buildings on the New Brighton waterfront. From 1867 to 1884, Captain Thomas Melville, a retired sea captain and brother of \"Moby-Dick\" author Herman Melville, was governor of Snug Harbor. In 1890, Captain Gustavus Trask, the governor of Snug Harbor, built a Renaissance Revival church, the Randall Memorial Chapel and, next to it, a music hall, both designed by Robert W. Gibson. At its peak in the late 19th century, about 1,000 retired sailors lived at Snug Harbor, then one of the wealthiest charities in New York. Its Washington Square area properties yielded a surplus exceeding the retirement home's costs by $100,000 a year.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, however, Snug Harbor was in financial difficulty. Once-grand structures fell into disrepair, and some were demolished; the ornate white-marble Randall Memorial Church was torn down in 1952. With the arrival of the Social Security system in the 1930s, demand for accommodation for old sailors declined; by the mid-1950s, fewer than 200 residents remained.\n\nIn the 1960s, the institution's trustees proposed to redevelop the site with high-rise buildings; the new New York City Landmarks Commission stepped forward to save the remaining buildings, designating them landmark structures, and listing them on the National Register of Historic Places. A series of legal battles ensued, but the validity of landmark designation was ultimately upheld and it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. In the 1970s, the trustees moved the institution to Sea Level, North Carolina and sold the Staten Island site to the City of New York. Today, Randall's Trust no longer operates a retirement home, but the Trustees of the Sailors' Snug Harbor in the City of New York continues its work, using funds from the endowment to help mariners all over the country. \n\nOn September 12, 1976, the Snug Harbor Cultural Center was opened to the public. In 2008, the Cultural Center and the Staten Island Botanical Garden merged to become the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden.\n\nThe Sailors' Snug Harbor Archives are preserved at the Stephen B. Luce Library at SUNY Maritime College in the Bronx.\n\nA station on the now-defunct North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway bore the name Sailors Snug Harbor; a retaining wall and stairways from the station still exist. Now, the travels from and to the St. George Terminal, stopping at Snug Harbor's front gate.\n\nThe five interlocking Greek Revival buildings at Snug Harbor are regarded as \"the most ambitious moment of the classic revival in the United States\" and the \"most extraordinary\" suite of Greek temple-style buildings in the country. Built around the 1833 Building C, the buildings \"form a symmetrical composition on Richmond Terrace, an eight-columned portico in the center and two six-columned porticoes on either end.\"\n\nPaul Goldberger wrote, \"Snug Harbor has something of the feel of a campus, something of the feel of a small-town square. Indeed, these rows of classical temples, set side-by-side with tiny connecting structures recessed behind the grand facades, are initially perplexing because they fit into no pattern we recognize — they are lined up as if on a street, yet they are set in the landscape of a park. They seem at once to embrace the 19th-century tradition of picturesque design and, by virtue of their rigid linear order, to reject it.\"\n\nThe 1833 administration building by Minard Lafever is a \"magnificent\" Greek Revival building with a monumental Ionic portico, and is the architect's oldest surviving work. It was renovated in 1884 with \"an eye-popping triple-height gallery with stained glass and ceiling murals,\" and restored in the 1990s.\n\nAll five buildings are individually landmarked, as are: the 131-year-old chapel, which has been renovated as a recital and concert space; the Italinate Richmond Terrace gate house (1873), the mid-19th-century iron fence surrounding the property, and the interiors of Building C and the chapel.\n\nThe buildings are set in extensive, landscaped grounds, surrounded by an individually landmarked, 19th-century cast-iron fence. They include a \"beautiful\" 1893 zinc fountain featuring the god Neptune, now indoors with a replica in its place. According to the New York Times, \"He sits in the middle, astride a shell held aloft by sea monsters, his trident raised. Jets of water spurt from the fountain's center and from bouquets of metal calla lilies to its sides. Visitors to Snug Harbor stop and watch, sitting on benches surrounding the scene, while workmen eat their lunches. It is quiet. Noisy New York and its busy harbor only away, beyond Richmond Terrace, might just as well be on Mars. Or at least at the other end of His Majesty's sea.\"\n\nAlso on the grounds is a bronze statue of Robert Randall by Augustus Saint-Gaudens.\n\nSnug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden is a nonprofit, Smithsonian-affiliated organization that operates Sailors' Snug Harbor. Its primary purpose is \"to operate, manage and develop the premises known as Sailors Snug Harbor as a cultural and educational center and park.\" In 2005, it was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg. In 2006, the revenues and expenses of the nonprofit were both around US$3.7 million, and its year-end assets were $2.6 million. \nIt is home to the Staten Island Children's Theater Association (SICTA) and the Staten Island Conservatory of Music. Other components include:\n\nThe Staten Island Botanical Garden maintains extensive gardens including the White Garden, inspired by Vita Sackville-West's famous garden at Sissinghurst; Connie Gretz's Secret Garden, complete with a castle, a maze and walled secret garden; and the New York Chinese Scholar's Garden, an authentic, walled, Chinese garden built in 1998 in the style of the famous gardens of Suzhou.\n\nEstablished in 1977, the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art exhibits the works of local and international artists. The center, which also provides artist-in-residence exhibitions, gallery space. It was founded in 1977 inside the architecturally significant Greek Revival buildings of Sailors Snug Harbor.\n\nAlthough the Newhouse was founded with a focus is on artists who live or have their studios in Staten Island and art that reflects the history of Staten Island or Snug Harbor, the Newhouse moved on to a broader focus on contemporary art. Unlike many New York museums, the Newhouse has the space to mount large shows and large works, and can add outdoor sculpture to the mix.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection is a museum with a particular emphasis on the work of artist/lithographer/sailor John A. Noble (1913–1983). The Washington Post called the exhibit of a houseboat that Noble converted into an artist's studio \"compelling...It is a home on the water and an artist's lair all in one, complete with wooden surfaces, portholes, an engineer's bed, a drawing table, and printmaking and etching implements. Inside, it's easy to envision the boat moored in nearby waters while the son of painter John \"Wichita Bill\" Noble sketched maritime subjects from the 1930s until his death in 1983. The younger Noble made regular rowboat excursions to observe and document the working life of the waterfront. The Noble collection is a testament to a vibrant culture of ships, docks and laborers that has mostly disappeared from New York.\"\n\nThe New York Sun called the Noble collection \"an unsung gem among New York museums.\"\n\nThe Staten Island Children's Museum features a rotating collection of hands-on exhibits and an extensive year round live animal collection of exotic arthropods. The Children's Museum consists of the main building which was originally built in 1913 and the old snug harbor barn where the livestock was originally kept to feed the residents of Sailors Snug Harbor. When the museum was developed, a modern walkway was built connecting the two structures to create one museum building.\n\nThe Staten Island Museum opened a location at Snug Harbor in September 2015. After operating two locations for almost two years, the museum closed the St. George location and consolidated its operations to the current building, Building A, at Snug Harbor. The Museum hopes to expand to building B by 2022.\n\nArt Lab is a school of fine and applied art, founded in 1975 and offering art instruction and exhibitions. \nA 686-seat Greek Revival auditorium, the Music Hall hosts performing arts. It is the second-oldest music hall in New York City, having opened in July 1892 with a performance of a cantata, \"The Rose Maiden.\" In attendance were some 600 residents of the home who sat on plain wooden seats, and 300 trustees and their guests who occupied the venue's upholstered balcony seats.\n\nThe residents of sailors snug harbor were buried on the grounds in what was called \"monkey hill\". The location of the cemetery is across the road from the current snug harbor complex in Allison Pond Park which used to be part of the original snug harbor campus. The Lake in Alisons Park served as a water supply for the snug harbor facility until 1939. The cemetery portion (surrounded by a red brick wall) is still owned by the Snug Harbor center while the remaining land was sold in 1975 to the city and turned into a public park with hiking trails. The majority of the over thousand bodies (including those of military naval sailors) lay in unmarked graves because their headstones were removed in the 80's and put into a storage room on the main campus for \"preservation\".\n\nOn January 30, 1863 at 9 A.M the chaplain of Snug Harbor, Reverend Robert Quinn was shot by a sailor resident named Herman Ingalls with a double barrel pistol outside the snug harbor chapel.

It denotes the process by which caste or tribes placed lower in the caste hierarchy seek upward mobility by emulating the rituals and practices of the upper or dominant castes. It is a process similar to passing in sociological terms. This term was made popular by Indian sociologist M. N. Srinivas in the 1950s. According to Christophe Jaffrelot a similar heuristic is described in \"\" by B. R. Ambedkar. Jaffrelot goes on to say, \"While the term was coined by Srinivas, the process itself had been described by colonial administrators such as E. T. Atkinson in his \"Himalayan Gazetteer\" and Alfred Lyall, in whose works Ambedkar might well have encountered it.\"\n\nM.N. Srinivas defined sanskritisation as a process by which \"a \"low\" or \"middle\" Hindu caste, or tribal or other group, changes its customs, ritual ideology, and way of life in the direction of a high and frequently \"twice-born\" caste. Generally such changes are followed by a claim to a higher position in the caste hierarchy than that traditionally conceded to the claimant class by the local community ... .\"\n\nOne clear example of sanskritisation is the adoption, in emulation of the practice of twice-born castes, of vegetarianism by people belonging to the so-called \"low castes\" who are traditionally not averse to non-vegetarian food.\n\nVishwakarma Caste claim to Brahmin status is not generally accepted outside the community, despite their assumption of some high-caste traits, such as wearing the sacred thread, and the Brahminisation of their rituals. For example, the sociologist M. N. Srinivas, who developed the concept of sanskritisation, juxtaposed the success of the Lingayat caste in achieving advancement within Karnataka society by such means with the failure of the Vishwakarma to achieve the same. Their position as a left-hand caste has not aided their ambition.\n\nAccording to M.N. Srinivas, Sanskritisation is not just the adoption of new customs and habits, but also includes exposure to new ideas and values appearing in Sanskrit literature. He says the words \"Karma, dharma, paap, maya, samsara and moksha\" are the most common Sanskritic theological ideas which become common in the talk of people who are sanskritised.\n\nThis phenomenon has also been observed in Nepal among Khas, Magar, Newar and Tharu people.\n\nM.N. Srinivas first propounded this theory in his D.Phil. thesis at Oxford University. The thesis was later brought out as a book titled \"Religion and Society Among the Coorgs of South India.\" Published in 1952, the book was an ethnographical study of the Kodava (Coorgs) community of Karnataka. M.N. Srinivas writes in the book:\n\n\"The caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time. Movement has always been possible, and especially in the \" middle regions of the hierarchy\". A caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritising its ritual and pantheon. In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of the Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden. This process has been called 'Sanskritisation' in this book, in preference to 'Brahminisation', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes.\"\n\nThe book challenged the then prevalent idea that caste was a rigid and unchanging institution. The concept of sanskritisation addressed the actual complexity and fluidity of caste relations. It brought into academic focus the dynamics of the renegotiation of status by various castes and communities in India.\n\nYogendra Singh has critiqued the theory as follows: \n\n\"... Sanskritisation fails to account for many aspects of cultural changes in the past and contemporary India as it neglects non-sanskritic traditions. It may be noted that often a non-sanskritic element of culture may be a localised form of sanskritic tradition. ... Sanskritic rites are often added to non-sanskritic rites without replacing them.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "164260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164260", "title": "Sinicization", "text": "Sinicization\n\nSinicization, sinicisation, sinofication, or sinification is a process whereby non-Chinese societies come under the influence of Chinese culture, particularly Han Chinese culture and societal norms. Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, \"Sinicization\" may refer to policies of acculturation, assimilation, or cultural imperialism imposed by China onto neighboring East Asian countries. Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, architectural style, and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of Japan, Korea and Vietnam for example, in the adoption of the Chinese writing system as the script of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the Sinosphere as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.\n\nThe integration policy is a type of nationalism aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among population. Proponents believe integration will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country’s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that integration destroys ethnic diversity, language diversity, and cultural diversity. Analogous to North America with approximately 300 Native American languages and distinct ethnic groups, in China there are 292 non-Mandarin languages spoken by native peoples of the region. There are also a number of immigrant languages, such as Khmer, Portuguese, English, etc.\n\nBefore sinicization, non-Chinese indigenous peoples of Southern China, termed collectively by the Chinese as Baiyue inhabited the coastline of China from as far north as the Yangtze River to as far south as the Gulf of Tonkin. Analysis of DNA recovered from human remains shows high frequencies of Haplogroup O1 in Liangzhu culture linking this culture to modern Austronesian populations. It is believed that Liangzhu culture was the ancestral homeland of Proto-Austronesian populations before they spread to Taiwan. Over time, the southward spread of Han Chinese led to the sinicization of most of the Baiyue populations that remained in Southern China, whether in the Yangtze Valley or in coastal areas from the mouth of the Yangtze to the Gulf of Tonkin. The remnants of these peoples who were not sinicized are now recognized officially as the ethnic minorities of the PRC.\n\nDescendants of Uyghurs who migrated to Taoyuan County, Hunan have largely assimilated into the Han Chinese and Hui population and practice Chinese customs, speaking Chinese as their language.\n\nDuring the 8th and 9th centuries in the Tang dynasty, Chinese male soldiers moved into Guizhou (Kweichow) and married native non-Chinese women, their descendants being known as \"Lao-han-jen\" (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese people who colonized Guizhou at later times. They still speak an archaic dialect. Many immigrants to Guizhou were descended from these soldiers in garrisons who married non-Chinese women.\n\nThe Mongol Yuan dynasty appointed a Muslim from Bukhara, Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, as governor of Yunnan after conquering the Kingdom of Dali. Sayyid Ajjall then promoted Sinicization and Confucianization of the non-Han Chinese peoples in Yunnan during his reign. Sayyid Ajjal founded a \"Chinese style\" city where modern Kunming is today, called Zhongjing Cheng. He ordered that a Buddhist temple, a Confucian temple, and two mosques be built in the city. Advocating Confucianism was part of his policy. The Confucian temple that Sayyid Ajjall built in 1274, which also doubled as a school, was the first Confucian temple ever to be built in Yunnan.\n\nBoth Confucianism and Islam were promoted by Sayyid Ajall in his \"civilizing mission\" during his time in Yunnan. Sayyid Ajall viewed Yunnan as \"backward and barbarian\" and utilized Confucianism, Islam, and Buddhism for \"civilizing\" the area.\n\nIn Yunnan, the widespread presence of Islam is credited to Sayyid Ajjal's work.\n\nSayyid Ajjal was first to bring Islam to Yunnan. He promoted Confucianism and Islam by ordering construction of mosques and temples of Confucianism. Sayyid Ajjal also introduced Confucian education into Yunnan. He was described as making 'the orangutans and butcherbirds became unicorns and phonixes and their felts and furs were exchanged for gowns and caps', and praised by the Regional Superintendent of Confucian studies, He Hongzuo.\n\nShams al-Din constructed numerous Confucian temples in Yunnan, and promoted Confucian education. He is best known among Chinese for helping sinicize Yunnan province. He also built multiple mosques in Yunnan as well.\n\nConfucian rituals and traditions were introduced to Yunnan by Sayyid Ajall. Several Confucian temples and schools were founded by him. Chinese social structures, Chinese funeral rituals and Chinese marriage customs were spread to the natives by Sayyid Ajall.\n\nThe aim of Sayyid Ajall's policy of promoting Confucianism and education in Yunnan was to \"civilize\" the native \"barbarians\". Confucian rituals were taught to students in newly founded schools by Sichuanese scholars, and Confucian temples were built. The natives of Yunnan were instructed in Confucian ceremonies like weddings, matchmaking, funerals, ancestor worship, and kowtow by Sayyid Ajall. The native leaders has their \"barbarian\" clothing replaced by clothing given to them by Sayyid Ajall.\n\nBoth Marco Polo and Rashid al-Din recorded that Yunnan was heavily populated by Muslims during the Yuan Dynasty, with Rashid naming a city with all Muslim inhabitants as the 'great city of Yachi'. It has been suggested that Yachi was Dali City (Ta-li). Dali had many Hui people.\n\nHis son Nasir al-Din became Governor of Yunnan in 1279 after sayyid Ajjal died.\n\nThe historian Jacqueline Armijo-Hussein has written on Sayyid Ajall's Confucianization and Sinicization policies, in her dissertation \"Sayyid 'Ajall Shams al-Din: A Muslim from Central Asia, serving the Mongols in China, and bringing 'civilization' to Yunnan\", the paper \"The Origins of Confucian and Islamic Education in Southwest China: Yunnan in the Yuan Period\", and \"The Sinicization and Confucianization in Chinese and Western Historiography of a Muslim from Bukhara Serving Under the Mongols in China\".\n\nMassive military campaigns were launched by the Ming dynasty during the Miao Rebellions against the southern indigenous Miao, Yao, and other tribes, settled thousands of Han and Hui in their land after exterminating most of the former indigenous tribes.\n\nDuring the Ming conquest of Yunnan Chinese military soldiers were settled in Yunnan, and many married the native women.\n\nThe Manchu people became the rulers during the Qing dynasty. The \"orthodox\" historical view emphasized the power of Han Chinese to \"sinicize\" their conquerors, although more recent research such as the New Qing History school revealed Manchu rulers were savvy in their manipulation of their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, the emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used Central Asian models of rule as much as Confucian ones. There is however evidence of sinicization. For example, Manchus originally had their own separate style of naming from the Han Chinese, but eventually adopted Han Chinese naming practices.\n\nManchu names consisted of more than the two or one syllable Chinese names, and when phonetically transcribed into Chinese, they made no sense at all. The meaning of the names that Manchus used were also very different from the meanings of Chinese names. The Manchus also gave numbers as personal names.\n\nThey gave their children Chinese names, which were separate from the Manchu names, and even adopted the Chinese practice of generation names, although its usage was inconsistent and error ridden, eventually they stopped using Manchu names.\n\nThe Niohuru family of the Manchu changed their family name to Lang, which sounded like \"wolf\" in Chinese, since wolf in Manchu was Niohuru.\n\nAlthough the Manchus replaced their Manchu names with Chinese personal names, the Manchu bannermen followed their traditional practice in typically used their first/personal name to address themselves and not their last name, while Han Chinese bannermen used their last name and first in normal Chinese style.\n\nUsage of surnames was not traditional to the Manchu while it was to the Han Chinese.\n\nVietnamese Nguyen Emperor Minh Mạng sinicized ethnic minorities such as Cambodians, claimed the legacy of Confucianism and China's Han dynasty for Vietnam, and used the term Han people 漢人 to refer to the Vietnamese. Minh Mang declared that \"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\" These policies were directed at the Khmer and hill tribes. The Nguyen lord Nguyen Phuc Chu had referred to Vietnamese as \"Han people\" in 1712 when differentiating between Vietnamese and Chams.\n\nMinh Mang used the name \"Trung Quốc\" 中國 to refer to Vietnam.\n\nChinese clothing was adapted by the Vietnamese people under Nguyễn.\n\nThe Kuomintang pursued a sinicization policy, which foreign observers understood as \"the time had come to set about the business of making all natives either turn Chinese or get out.\" It was noted that \"Chinese colonization\" of \"Mongolia and Manchuria\" led to the conclusion \"to a conviction that the day of the barbarian was finally over.\"\n\nHui Muslim General Ma Fuxiang created an assimilationist group and encouraged the integration of Muslims into Chinese society. Ma Fuxiang was a hardcore assimilationist and said that Hui should assimilate into Han.\n\nThe Hui Muslim 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army) governed southern Xinjiang in 1934–1937. The administration that was set up was colonial in nature, putting up street signs and names in Chinese, which used to be in only Uighur language. They lived much like Han Chinese, importing Han cooks and baths. The Hui also switched carpet patterns from Uyghur to Han in state owned carpet factories.\n\nAfter the Republic of China took control of Taiwan in 1945 and relocated its capital to Taipei in 1949, the intention of Chiang Kai-shek was to eventually go back to mainland China and retake control of it. Chiang believed that to retake mainland China, it would be necessary to re-Sinicize Taiwan's inhabitants who had undergone assimilation under Japanese rule. Examples of this policy included the renaming of streets with mainland geographical names, use of Mandarin Chinese in schools and punishments for using other regional languages, and teaching students to revere traditional ethics, develop pan-Chinese nationalism, and view Taiwan from the perspective of China. Other reasons for the policy were to combat the Japanese influences on the culture that had occurred in the previous 50 years, and to help unite the recent immigrants from mainland China that had come to Taiwan with the KMT and among whom there was a tendency to be more loyal to one's city, country or province than to China as a nation.\n\nThe process of re-asserting non-Chinese identity, as in the case of ethnic groups in Taiwan, is sometimes known as desinicization.\n\nThe sinicization of Tibet is the change of Tibetan society to Han Chinese standards, by means of cultural assimilation, immigration, and political reform.\n\nIn some forms of fiction, due to China's communist statehood, Soviet-themed characters are de-Sovietized and switched over to become Chinese to fit modern (post-Cold War) times. The original cut of the 2012 \"Red Dawn\" remake depicted a Chinese invasion before having said information leaked to the \"Global Times\", sparking controversy in China and threatening its airing in the country (the invaders were changed to North Koreans). In 2006, Chinese versions of the Crimson Dynamo and the Abomination were created and made members of the \"Liberators\" in Marvel Comics, the comic book \"The Ultimates 2\".\n\n"}

They are composed of one or two digits coding for the state, typically two letters coding for the county or county-equivalent within the state, and one or more sequential digits representing the order in which the site was listed in that county. The Smithsonian Institution developed the site number system in the 1930s and 1940s. (Trinomials are now assigned by the individual states.) The 48 states then in the union were assigned numbers in alphabetical order. Alaska was assigned number 49 and Hawaii was assigned number 50 after those states were admitted to the union. There are no Smithsonian trinomial numbers assigned for the District of Columbia or any United States territories.\n\nMost states use trinomials of the form \"nnAAnnnn\", but some specify a space or dash between parts of the identifier, i.e., \"nn AA nnnn\" or \"nn-AA-nnnn\". Some states use variations of the trinomial system. Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont use two-letter abbreviations of the state name instead of the Smithsonian number. Alaska uses three-letter abbreviations for USGS map quadrangles in place of the county code. Arizona uses a five-part identifier based on USGS maps, specifying quadrangles, then rectangles within a quadrangle, a sequential number within the rectangle, and a code identifying the agency issuing the sequential number. California uses a three-letter abbreviation for counties. Connecticut and Rhode Island do not use any sub-state codes, with site identifiers consisting of the state abbreviation and a sequential number series for the whole state. Delaware uses a single letter code for counties and adds a block code (A-K) within each county, with sequential numbers for each block.

{"id": "316842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316842", "title": "Social distance", "text": "Social distance\n\nSocial distance describes the distance between different groups in society and is opposed to \"locational distance\". The notion includes differences such as social class, race/ethnicity, gender or sexuality, but also the fact that the different groups mix less than members of the same group. The term is often applied in cities, but its use is not limited to that. \n\nAn old concept, in 1924 Robert E. Park defined social distance as \"an attempt to reduce to something like measurable terms the grade and degrees of understanding and intimacy which characterizes personal and social relations generally\". It is the measure of nearness or intimacy that an individual or group feels towards another individual or group in a social network or the level of trust one group has for another and the extent of perceived likeness of beliefs..\n\nThe concept of social distance as applied to the study of racial attitudes and racial relations. Journal of Applied Sociology, 8, 339-344.</ref> In the sociological literature, social distance is conceptualized in several different ways.\n\n\nIt is possible to view these different conceptions as \"dimensions\" of social distance, that do not necessarily overlap. The members of two groups might interact with each other quite frequently, but this does not always mean that they will feel \"close\" to each other or that normatively they will consider each other as the members of the same group. In other words, interactive, normative and affective dimensions of social distance might not be linearly associated.\n\nSocial distance was also used in a different meaning by anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher, Edward T. Hall, to describe the psychological distance which an animal can stand to be away from its group before beginning to feel anxious. This phenomenon can be seen in human babies and toddlers who can only walk or crawl so far from their parents or guardians before becoming anxious and quickly returning to the safe space. The babies' social distance is quite small.\n\nHall also notes that this concept of social distance has been extended by technological advances such as the telephone, walkie talkie, and television, among others. Hall’s analysis of social distance came before the development of the internet, which has expanded social distance exponentially. Social distance is now even expanding beyond our planet as we send people into outer space on space missions and even personal trips to space.\n\nIt is said|date=June 2016}} that every individual regards his or her own culture as being superior to all other cultures, and other cultures as being inferior due to their differences from his or her own culture. The social distance between two cultures may ultimately manifest in the form of hatred. A consequence of this distance and hatred is prejudices, that different cultural groups assume to be true for differing social groups. For example, the Brahmins are believed to possess the highest, and the shudras the lowest status in Hindu society. If a Brahmin child ever touches the child of some shudra, the former is given a bath to rid him of his supposed defilement caused by his touch. As a result of this strict formulation of his activities, the Brahmin child forms a prejudice in his mind that shudras are untouchable and impure.\n\nSome ways social distance can be measured include: direct observation of people interacting, questionnaires, speeded decision making tasks, route planning exercises, or other social drawing tasks (see sociogram).\n\nIn questionnaires, respondents are typically asked members of which groups they would accept in particular relationships. For example, to check whether or not they would accept a member of each group as a neighbor, as a fellow worker as a marriage partner. The social distance questionnaires may not accurately measure what people actually would do if a member of another group sought to become a friend or neighbour. The social distance scale is only an attempt to measure one's feeling of unwillingness to associate equally with a group. What a person will actually do in a situation also depends upon the circumstances of the situation.\n\nIn speeded decision making tasks, studies have suggested a systematic relationship between social distance and physical distance. When asked to either indicate the spatial location of a presented word or verify a word’s presence, people respond more quickly when \"we\" was displayed in a spatially proximate versus spatially distant location and when \"others\" was displayed in a\nspatially distant versus a spatially proximate location. This suggests that social distance and physical distance are conceptually related.\n\nRoute planning exercises have also hinted at a conceptual link between social distance and physical distance. When asked to draw a route on a map, people tend to draw routes closer to friends they pass along the way and further away from strangers. This effect is robust even after controlling for how easy it is for the people passing one another to communicate. \n\nThere is some evidence that reasoning about social distance and physical distance draw on shared processing resources in the human parietal cortex.\n\n\"Social periphery\" is a term often used in conjunction with social distance. It refers to people being 'distant' with regard to social relations. It is often implied that it is measured from the dominant \"city élite\". The social periphery of a city is often located in the centre.\n\n\"Locational periphery\" in contrast is used to describe places physically distant from the heart of the city. These places often include suburbs which are socially close to the core of the city. In some cases the locational periphery overlaps with the social periphery, such as in Paris' \"banlieues\".\n\nIn 1991, Mulgan stated that \"The centres of two cities are often for practical purposes closer to each other than to their own peripheries.\" This reference to social distance is especially true for global cities.\n\n"}

There are two common types of subpoena:\n\nThe term \"subpoena\" is from the Middle English \"suppena\" and the Latin phrase \"sub poena\" meaning \"under penalty\". It is also spelled \"subpena\". The subpoena has its source in English common law and it is now used almost with universal application throughout the English common law world. John Waltham, Bishop of Salisbury, is said to have created the writ of subpoena in the reign of Richard II. However, for civil proceedings in England and Wales, it is now described as a witness summons, as part of reforms to replace Latin terms with Plain English understandable to the layman.\n\nSubpoenas are usually issued by the clerk of the court in the name of the judge presiding over the case. Additionally, court rules may permit lawyers to issue subpoenas themselves in their capacity as officers of the court. Typically subpoenas are issued \"in blank\" and it is the responsibility of the lawyer representing the plaintiff or defendant on whose behalf the testimony is to be given to serve the subpoena on the witness. If a witness is reluctant to testify, then the personal service of subpoena is usually required with proof of service by non-party server.\n\nThe subpoena will usually be on the letterhead of the court where the case is filed, name the parties to the case, and be addressed by name to the person whose testimony is being sought. It will contain the language \"You are hereby commanded to report in person to the clerk of this court\" or similar, describing the specific location, scheduled date and time of the appearance. Some issuing jurisdictions include an admonishment advising the subject of the criminal penalty for failure to comply with a subpoena, and reminding him or her not to leave the court facilities until excused by a competent authority. In some situations the person having to testify or produce documents is paid.\n\n\"Pro se\" litigants who represent themselves, unlike lawyers, must ask a court clerk to officially issue them subpoena forms when they need to call witnesses by phone or in person, or when they need to officially request documents to be sent to them and/or directly to court. Any documents that have not been subpoenaed to court or verified by a witness may be dismissed by the opposite party as hearsay, unless excepted by hearsay rules or permitted by the judge. If the witness is called via long-distance phone call, then the requesting party is responsible for initiating the call and providing a payment with a prepaid phone card. Most states (including California) have further restrictions on subpoena use in criminal cases. \n\nSome states (as is the case in Florida) require the subpoenaing party to first file a Notice of Intent to Serve Subpoena, or a Notice of Production from Non-Party ten days prior to issuing the subpoena, so that the other party may have ample time to file any objections.\n\nAlso, the party being subpoenaed has the right to object to the issuance of the subpoena, if it is for an improper purpose, such as subpoenaing records that have no relevance to the proceedings, or subpoenaing persons who would have no evidence to present, or subpoenaing records or testimony that is confidential or privileged.\n\nIn New South Wales, a court may set aside the whole, or part of, a subpoena on the basis that it is a \"fishing expedition\". In \"Lowery v Insurance Australia Ltd\", the NSW Court of Appeal held that where documents requested in the schedule of a subpoena are deemed to have no relevance to the proceedings in dispute, the subpoena may be set aside as it has no legitimate forensic purpose. It was also held that it was not the role of the Court to redraft the subpoena and narrow its scope to those issues in dispute. \n\n"}

It also houses a botanic library, a herbarium and the International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research (IOS).\n\nThe greenhouses are located in district of Enge, on Zürichsee (Lake Zurich). They are a part of the Quaianlagen promenades, and are located on the southwestern lake shore. The collection is separated by the Mythenquai road from the lower lake shore promenade and the Enge harbour area, at the park facilities of the Mythenquai lido near the lower entrance to the Rieterpark.\n\nAt the end of the 1920s, Jakob Gasser, a cactus grower from Zürich, tried to sell his collection of about 1,500 succulents to the city government of Zürich, but the venture failed. in 1929, Julius Brann Gassersche, a store owner, acquired the unique collection and made a gift of it to the city of Zürich. The collection was housed in the greenhouses at the former site of the municipal gardens (\"Stadtgärtnerei\") at Mythenquai, and established as \"Städtische Kakteensammlung\", meaning urban cactus collection.\n\nFormally established in 1931, the collection houses one of the largest and most important collections of succulent plants. The main complex was built in 1947 and inaugurated in 1948. The succulent collection started in the existing greenhouse at Mythenquai, and was extended in 1948, 1954, 1961, 1984. In 2011, the entrance area was rebuilt and information for visitors improved. There are plans to redesign the Mythenquai area, including a renovation of the greenhouses.\n\nSucculents are plants from arid areas that survive by storing water, including Agaves, Aloes and stonecrop family, in addition to Cacti and thick leaf plants. The collection features more than 6,500 different types of succulent plants from more than 80 different plant families of \"Orchidaceae\", \"Crassulaceae\", \"Euphorbiaceae\", \"Aizoaceae\", \"Cactaceae\" and \"Apocynaceae\". The collection is funded by Grün Stadt Zürich and by the booster association, \"Förderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich\". Although internationally known for its scientific objectives, the Sukkulenten-Sammlung is perceived by the public as a collection. Periodic special displays provide an insight into the survival mechanisms used by succulents.\n\nSurrounded by a park on the lake, the facilities house over 25,000 exotic plants in about 6,500 species and varieties on , including in six greenhouses, 16 heated cold frame boxes and an outdoor area. The staff consists of nine employees who take care of to 50,000 visitors annually. The greenhouses are open daily.\n\nSince about 1947, the institution has been involved in an international seed exchange between botanical institutes and gardens around the world. Currently, there are more than 200 botanical gardens involved. In addition, Sukkulenten-Sammlung houses a specialized library on succulent plants. These books are not allowed to leave the library, but can be seen when the collection is open. The library contains more than 30,187 titles.\n\nThe herbarium was founded in 1950, simultaneously with the International Organizations for Succulent Plant Research (IOS), and has an extensive archive of plants with approximately 20,000 specimens and a meticulous tracking database. It is now under the patronage of the Swiss UNESCO commission.\n\nDespite the uniqueness of the collection, in 1996 the municipal council (\"Gemeinderat\") of the city of Zürich sought to either outsource the collection of succulents or to close the collection entirely. This political pressure led to the founding of the boosting association \"Förderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich\". The council then decided to suspend the motion, until it became clear whether the Canton of Zürich and the federal authorities would become involved in co-financing.\n\nSukkulenten-Sammlung Zürich is listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a \"Class A\" object of national importance.\n\n\n"}

Botanists often refer to the book simply as Jepson. It is produced by the University and Jepson Herbaria, of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\n\"The Jepson Manual\" is considered a revision of the first major California flora publication, the \"Manual of the Flowering Plants of California\" by Willis Linn Jepson. It was originally published in 1925. \n\n\"The Jepson Manual\" also follows Philip A. Munz and David D. Keck in their \"A California Flora and Supplement\" of 1958 and 1968.\n\nLike other florae, \"The Jepson Manual\" builds upon these prior publications. Except for the number of line drawings, it has more in common with Munz's 1968 book than with Jepson's 1923 book. \n\nThe first edition of \"The Jepson Manual\" was published in 1993 as The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California (TJM93), and was edited by James C. Hickman.\n\nThe second edition was published in 2012, as \"The Jepson Manual: Vascular Plants of California, Thoroughly Revised and Expanded\" (TJM2), and was edited by Bruce G. Baldwin, Douglas Goldman, David J Keil, Robert Patterson, and Thomas J. Rosatti. The second edition features 7,601 California plant species, subspecies and varieties. \n\nWhile the book is named in honor of Jepson, \"The Jepson Manual\" is not simply a new edition of Jepson's 1923 book, but a new work which Baldwin calls \"“the most time-consuming undertaking of my career.\" \n\n\n"}

It is also included second among the \"Shitong\" (The Ten Encyclopedias), compiled in the Qing dynasty. The \"Tongzhi\" became a model for most of the later encyclopedias.\n\n\"Tongzhi\" is arranged in 200 volumes (\"juan\"), plus three volumes of notes. The historical information covers from earliest times to the end of the Tang dynasty. The contents include basic annals, yearly chronicles, hereditary houses, ranked biographies, and twenty monographs (\"lüe\" 略) on various topics, the last of which are considered the most original part. The twenty monographs, which comprise 52 volumes, deal with clans, the six classes of characters, phonetics, astronomy, geography, capital cities, rituals, posthumous names, vessels and robes, music, official titles, the examination system, punishment, food and money, arts and literature, collation, images, metal and stone, disasters and fortunes, insects and plants. The comprehensivity of these monographs has long been noted; the \"Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao\" (completed in 1798) praised them in particular.\n\nThe chapter on images (\"Tu pu lüe\" 图谱略) has attracted considerable interest among art theorists. In this section, he gives images primacy in transmitting values, using metaphor that compares the images as the warp (\"jing\" 經) and the text as the weft (\"wei\" 緯).\n\nThe chapter on arts and literature (\"Yi wen lüe\" 藝文略) has the most detailed bibliographic scheme in pre-modern China.\n\n"}
