It featured works by 250 sculptors from around the world, and ran from May 15 to September 11, 1949. The exhibition was organized by the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) under the terms of a bequest made to the Association by the late Ellen Phillips Samuel.\n\nEllen Phillips Samuel was a member of the Fairmount Park Art Association and a supporter of many cultural activities in Philadelphia. When she died in 1913, she left the bulk of her estate in trust to the Art Association, specifying that the income be used to create a series of sculptural monuments “emblematic of the history of America.” When these funds became available upon the death of her husband in 1929, the Art Association appointed a planning committee, which decided that the Samuel Memorial should express major ideas and spiritual forces as well as chronological developments in American history.\n\nTo identify sculptors, the committee organized three international exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. These Sculpture Internationals, in 1933, 1940, and 1949, brought together the works of hundreds of sculptors from the United States and abroad. The exhibitions contributed not only to the Samuel Memorial but also to the general awareness of contemporary sculpture throughout the Philadelphia area.\nAmong the sculptors who exhibited were:\nThe June 20, 1949, issue of \"Life\" magazine featured the photograph \"70 Sculptors\" by Herbert Gehr. It showed 70 of the sculptors seated on the staircase of the museum's Great Hall and surrounded by a number of their works. Gehr took the photograph on May 14, 1949, the day before the exhibition's opening. An intensive search has been underway since 2002 to identify all 70 sculptors in the photograph.\n\n"}

MS 19.2.1, currently forms part of the collection of the National Library of Scotland. It is an illuminated manuscript copied on parchment in the 14th century in London. The manuscript provides a glimpse of a time of political tension and social change in England. The English were continuing to reclaim their language and national identity, and to distance themselves from the Norman conquerors who had taken over the country after the Battle of Hastings 300 years before.\n\nThe manuscript is named after Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, who was a lawyer and supreme court judge in Edinburgh, Scotland. Lord Auchinleck lived from 1706 to 1782, and was the father of James Boswell who wrote The \"Life of Samuel Johnson\". It is not known how Lord Auchinleck came to possess the manuscript, but it is believed he acquired it in 1740 and gave the book to the Advocates Library in Edinburgh in 1744. It is a mystery who owned the book in the four hundred years from the time it was completed to when Lord Auchinleck first laid hands on it, but there are clues within. On some of the pages are names that have been added in, which are presumed to be previous owners and their family members. One of the quires of the manuscript is a list of Norman aristocracy, now assumed to be a version of the Battle Abbey Roll, and at the end of this list has been entered, in a different hand, the list of members from a family named Browne. Also sprinkled throughout the text, others have entered their names individually for posterity, such as Christian Gunter and John Harreis. These names have never been researched against church or town records.\n\nAuchinleck is believed to have been produced in London around 1340, by professional scribes, who were laymen, not monks as was usually the case. The number of scribes involved in the production is a source of debate with scholars of Middle English. The controversy involves not only the number of scribes who actually wrote the text out, but if they, in fact, only copied the work from the exemplar, the original, or translated the works from French or Latin, inadvertently into their own Middle English dialects.\n\nThrough the use of palaeography, or the study of ancient handwriting, it has been determined that there had to be at least four, perhaps five, different scribes. Some scholars have argued that there were six scribes, yet most agree that the majority of the manuscript is in the hand of one man, who it is believed translated most of the literature. With this knowledge, when one looks at the photographs of the manuscript found on the website of the National Library of Scotland, it is easy to see the discrepancies in the actual handwriting of the scribes. Some is tight and regimented, attributed to Scribe 1, while some more loose, as if the scribe did not make the correct adjustments for space and repeatedly ran out of room at the ends of the lines. While this makes for fun visual entertainment when looking at the folios, or pages, the historical importance is that it gives clues into how the book might have been produced in a time when the commerce of making books for private clients in a secular bookshop began to flourish.\n\nThe Auchinleck, in its present state, consists of forty-three pieces of literature. All of these works are in Middle English but the language used has been determined to be several differing dialects that would have been used in different parts of England. These dialects further serve to determine the origins of the scribes, such as London as opposed to south-west Midlands, as they would have written the language in the manner they spoke as well as the spelling they were taught, which furthers the question of translation.\n\nSince the language is consistent within each text, it is surmised the scribes worked independently on each whole story as opposed to the manner more commonly used in monasteries in which the monks would copy text directly from the exemplars, only one page at a time, with a catchword inscribed at the bottom corner for later collation. Although there are catchwords in the manuscript, each scribe would have been responsible for all of the pages of each of his assignments. This newer method of production suggests that one production manager was responsible for contracting the work, gave each scribe assignments that included whole stories, while overseeing the project, and being the contact person to the client if the book was indeed bespoke, or special order.\n\nAlso of significance is that the Auchinleck manuscript is the first known anthology of English literature, particularly the largest collection of English romances up until that time. Previously the use of Latin or French had been almost exclusive in books, but English was beginning to be an acceptable language for pamphlets and literature. It was during this time that the English were beginning to shift away from French and to form a separate identity, socially and politically, so it would follow that the use of \"Inglisch\", as it is referred to in the manuscript, in the written word would be a source of national unification.\n\nThe Auchinleck manuscript was illuminated, although not as ornately as the religious books of the era, such as Books of Hours. Unfortunately, many of the miniatures in the manuscript have been lost to thieves or people peddling the images for profit. The four remaining miniatures and the historiated letters suggest it was beautifully, yet modestly, decorated at one time. It has been determined through comparing artistic styles that the illustration was done by a handful of artists who illuminated other manuscripts commercially produced in the London area. This points to a group of illuminators, who it is believed collaborated on other works that have been preserved from the Middle Ages, who have been studied independently, and whose work is now being seen in a new light as a collective community.\n\nThe Auchinleck manuscript is not well known outside of scholarly circles, yet it is one of the most important English documents surviving from the Middle Ages. Within its folios, it tracks not only the literature of the period, reflecting the tastes of readers in Chaucer's time and how its subjects were increasingly diverging from religious topics, but also the development of a language as part of a national self-image. It speaks to us of the independence of spirit with which the English people wanted to identify themselves as separate from their French cousins by claiming their own language in a fundamental expression, in their literature. As such, the manuscript is important in scholarship of the medieval romances, of London codicology (manuscript studies), of dialect and linguistic studies, and for the possibility (though unproven) that Chaucer himself may have had personal use of Auchinleck, based on claimed correspondences to his writings.\n\nThe Auchinleck manuscript is a codex of medieval narratives ranging from Saints' vitae to conversion tales. The order of the contents (and respective folio numbers) is as follows:\n\n\n"}

The \"tituli\" are in Medieval Latin.\n\nThe Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by William the Conqueror's half-brother, Bishop Odo, possibly at the same time as Bayeux Cathedral's construction in the 1070s, and completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication. It is embroidered in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for detailing and lettering. \nA dark blue wool, almost black, is used for most of the tapestry's lettering but towards the end other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.\n\nThe content of the hanging is primarily pictorial but \"tituli\" are included on many scenes of the action to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted. The text is in Latin (which for the most part is grammatically correct), and is extremely direct, with each statement being closely tied to the scenes depicted in a given section. The text is frequently abbreviated as indicated by tildes placed over words at the place of omission of a letter. The words themselves are often demarcated by two points (which Lucien Musset likens to colons); sometimes, more important section breaks are demarcated by three points. Many personal names, mostly in English, are not Latinised and the same applies for names of places in England and for Beaurain \"Belrem\" in France. In places the spelling shows an English influence, such as the phrase \"at Hestenga ceasrta\", which in proper Latin would be \"ad Hastingae castra\"). Some French names are either archaic (\"Rednes\") or anglicised (\"Bagias\"). Sometimes \"Franci\" is used to describe the Normans who at that time certainly did not regard themselves as French.\n\nThe end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final \"titulus\" \"Et fuga verterunt Angli\" is said by Lucien Musset to be \"entirely spurious\", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment. The first word on the tapestry \"Edward\" is also a restoration.\n\nThe English translation provided here is of a literal nature, to reflect the simplicity of the captions themselves. The numbering scheme uses the scene numbers on the tapestry's backing cloth, which were added sometime around 1800.\n\n\n"}

On August 6, 2001, the Central Intelligence Agency delivered a President's Daily Brief to President Bush, who was vacationing at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.\n\nPresident Bush did not appear to take particular interest in what he had been told, telling his CIA briefer: \"All right. You've covered your ass, now.\"\n\nThe existence of the memo was secret until it was leaked in 2002. \"CBS Evening News\" reported on the document on May 15.\n\nThe PDB was declassified and approved for release to the 9/11 Commission on April 10, 2004, and reported in the \"9/11 Commission Report\" on July 22, 2004. According to the National Security Archive, President Bush was the first sitting president to release a PDB to the public.\n\nIn an attempt to excuse the Administration's failure to act in any way on the contents of the brief, Bush-appointed U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and General Richard Myers have claimed that contrary to repeated statements, the CIA's PDB did not warn the President of a specific new threat but \"contained historical information based on old reporting\".\n\nPresident Bush later claimed that if he had \"had any inkling whatsoever that the people were going to fly airplanes into buildings we would have moved heaven and earth to save the country.\" The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted a training exercise in the two years prior to September 11, 2001, in which it simulated a civilian airliner being hijacked and used as a missile to crash into buildings in the United States, including the World Trade Center. In October 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense had conducted exercises rehearsing a plane crashing into the Pentagon. The National Reconnaissance Office had scheduled an exercise for September 11, 2001 simulating the crash of a jet into one of its own buildings in northern Virginia.\n\n"}

It was built in the 14th century replacing the Count's castle.\n\nAround 1100 a wooden building was constructed on the location of the current \"Gravenzaal\" of the City Hall. Traces of this building were found in 1955.\n\nAfter large fires in 1347 and 1351, William II, Count of Holland donated the remains of the Gravenzaal to the city's municipality. A new building was built there. The central square building dates from the Middle Ages, but the distinctive façade of the building was designed by architect Lieven de Key and built from 1602-1604. The way it originally looked can be seen in a painting from 1460 by the Master of Bellaert. Originally the city hall was just the front of the building, and the rear cloister belonged to the Dominican brotherhood. After the Protestant Reformation this came into the possession of the city council and it is now a large complex with offices and meeting rooms. Both the Frans Hals Museum and the Haarlem Public Library originally were located in the city hall.\n\nThe town hall is still used for civic weddings and nearly every Friday in Spring, brides can be seen entering and leaving by the main stairway. All year on Saturdays and Mondays there is a big market in front of the City Hall, where on Saturdays mainly flowers, household goods, and food is sold, though on Mondays the products are mainly cloth, sewing accessories and clothing. Although the market is frequented by the local population, it is also a tourist attraction and worth a visit, if only to try the raw herring from the fish stand, or \"stroop wafels\" from the stroop wafel stand. The town hall is also still used for state visits, most recently when the King and Queen paid a visit to Haarlem on 14 June 2013. They heard the local choir \"Zang en Vriendschap\" sing and received a book about all the previous royal state visits to Haarlem. \n\nThe town hall was traditionally a gathering place for various gentlemen, and the Dutch Society of Science started meeting there in 1752, which was the beginning of a municipal museum for natural history, that today no longer exists, though its \"competitor\" founded in 1781 still does; namely the Teylers Museum. When they moved out, the paintings stayed and they became the Haarlem municipal museum, which moved out in 1913 to become the Frans Hals museum.\nA large number of paintings and objects from Haarlem's rich history can be found inside the building. One series of paintings depict the various counts of Holland, starting from Dirk I to Maximilian from Austria. In the Middle Ages these paintings were hanging in the Carmelieten Cloister in Haarlem; they were painted between 1486 and 1491. In 1570 it is mentioned in city archives that the paintings were hanging in the City Hall; possibly they were moved there in 1566 to protect them from the iconoclastic riots. Other paintings and objects are either part of the original interior, or too big to fit in the Frans Hals Museum. \n\n"}

It is based in Cardiff, Wales with offices located near the headquarters of the Admiral Group. The Admiral Group floated on the London Stock Exchange in September 2004, it is currently the only FTSE100 listed company headquartered in Wales.\n\nConfused.com is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nConfused.com has undergone a high degree of management churn in recent years. At the top level, founding Managing Director Kate Armstrong, an IT consultant originally from Sydney, retired from the business in 2005, following the successful flotation of the Admiral Group. She was succeeded by Deborah Williams who took the reins from 2005 to 2007. The business underwent expansive growth in this period with profit hitting £36 million in 2007. It was with some degree of surprise therefore that the industry received news of Williams' departure to join a relatively unknown insurance broker. Williams was succeeded by Carlton Hood in the newly created position of CEO. The sector was shaken up by the ground breaking Compare the Market campaign in 2009; Confused.com, along with other established competitors, lost market share. Hood resigned abruptly in 2010 and was succeeded by Group FD Kevin Chidwick as an interim measure.\n\nChidwick remained in place until January 2012 and was succeeded by Admiral Group senior manager Nic Weng Kan followed by Martin Coriat. Coriat was MD of Admiral-owned French comparison site LeLynx.fr until he took up the position of Confused.com CEO in October 2013.\n\nThe marketing department came under new management in July 2010 when Mike Hoban formally passed a six-month probation period and stepped into the role of marketing director. Prior to joining Confused.com, he spent 18 months as the Communications Director of Directgov, helping to position their website as the ‘nation’s official website'.\n\nIn August 2012, Mike Hoban stepped down as marketing director and Joby Russell stepped into the role. After overseeing the launch of the 'Brian the Robot' campaign and later toy promotions, Russell left the role in May 2015 to take up the role of CMO at online estate agents Purplebricks.com. In late 2015 Paul Troy was appointed the CMO role at Confused.com. Troy had previously worked for Moneysupermarket between 2011 and 2013 where he created the 'You're so money supermarket' campaign.\n\nIn September 2017, Louise O'Shea was appointed as CEO of Confused.com taking over from Martin Coriat who himself was appointed as chief executive of Admiral-owned French comparison website LeLynx. O'Shea was promoted to the CEO position from her role as finance director at Confused.com.\n\nIn May 2018, Confused.com announced the appointment of Sam Day as chief marketing officer, replacing Troy.\n\nConfused.com have been recipients of a number of marketing and industry awards:\n\nIn early years, Confused.com achieved success with a simple, repetitive direct response advertising format, in which a man with a megaphone shouted about exactly what Confused.com was offering. This led to the longest running of Confused.com’s campaigns, featuring simple cardboard props on a white background, later with a man and later a youth with out megaphones saying they were \"So confused.com!\" by the depicted marketplace. In later years as competitors Moneysupermarket.com, Gocompare.com and Comparethemarket.com have entered the market, Confused.com has tried numerous different advertising vehicles. None have emulated the success of the initial campaign and Confused.com has slipped from the position of market leader to being the fourth largest car insurance comparison website in the UK. The popularity of the company's slogan 'Confused.com' rose to prominence after the success of the 2001 campaign. A 2002 study by Webster showed that the slogan was the third most used phrase of the year behind 'Hey you' and 'Naughty Soldier'.\n\nLater adverts containing real life testimonials, featuring customers and prolific social media users talking about their experiences while using the website, as well as showcasing the website’s simplicity by explaining how it works.\n\nAdverts in early 2010 focused on the concept of regret and featured members of the public lamenting that they could have purchased something they wanted if they had purchased their car insurance through Confused.com.\n\nIn September 2010, Confused.com introduced the character of \"Cara Confused\" a wild-haired animated version of the original company mascot that was present on the former Confused.com logo. The inspiration for the creation of Cara came from Kate Armstrong, the founder and former managing director of Confused.com. The campaign used the tagline, \"it pays to be Confused.com\". In February 2011 an advert started featuring Cara (voiced by West End star Louise Dearman) singing the Diana Ross track \"Chain Reaction\". Marketing Director Mike Hoban claimed that this campaign gained Confused.com 2 million customers since launch.\n\nOn 1 June 2013 a campaign launched featuring a robot named Brian, depicted as being on a mission to help people to \"save pounds\". On 24 December 2014, an advert was launched where scrap dealers kidnap Brian. Instead of melting him down straight away, they leave him hanging through the night on a magnet. However, his robot friends at headquarters receive his distress call and go to help him. A couple of weeks later the succeeding advert shows the same five co-robots, known as the Herberts (Chief Herbert, Miss Herbert, Stunt Herbert, Clever Herbert and Baby Herbert), go to help Brian. They stop the incinerator at the last moment, saving Brian and continuing the 'Brian' advertising campaigns after they repair him. In 2015, an advert was launched featuring Brian and the Herberts dancing to \"Jump on It!\" promoting the brand new Brian toy available by buying insurance through Confused.com. In early 2016, two more toys were launched, Miss Herbert and Stunt Herbert, with a corresponding campaign showing both characters competing with each other.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, the adverts featuring the Robots were scrapped in favour of a new advertisement featuring James Corden. \n\nOn 17 August 2018, following a run of 6 adverts, James Corden was replaced in favour of a new direction and new frontman Timothy Murphy. The advert features Murphy driving a car through a busy mass of confusing messaging and advertising before ending with Murphy driving down a clear road.\n\nConfused.com has sponsored programmes on ITV such as Ninja Warrior UK, Sunday Night at the Palladium, Celebrity Squares and Catchphrase and The Simpsons on Sky 1.

There are several subcategories, dominantly focusing on rock, pop, or urban music. Used alone, \"CHR\" most often refers to the CHR-pop format. The term \"contemporary hit radio\" was coined in the early 1980s by \"Radio & Records\" magazine to designate top 40 stations which continued to play hits from all musical genres as pop music splintered into adult contemporary, urban contemporary and other formats\n\nThe term \"top 40\" is also used to refer to the actual list of hit songs, and, by extension, to refer to pop music in general. The term has also been modified to describe top 50; top 30; top 20; top 10; hot 100 (each with its number of songs) and hot hits radio formats, but carrying more or less the same meaning and having the same creative point of origin with Todd Storz as further refined by Gordon McLendon as well as Bill Drake. The format became especially popular in the sixties as radio stations constrained disc jockeys to numbered play lists in the wake of the payola scandal.\n\nAlso known as CHR/pop or teen CHR. Plays pop, and dance, and sometimes urban, alternative, rock, and country crossover as well. Often referred as \"top 40\"; in terms of incorporating a variety of genres of music, CHR/pop is the successor to the original concept of top 40 radio which originated in the 1950s. WHTZ in New York City, KIIS in Los Angeles, Jovem Pan in Brazil, KRBE in Houston, WIOQ in Philadelphia, WBBM in Chicago, WFLZ in Tampa/St. Petersburg, WHYI in Miami, WNCI in Columbus, WZPL, in Indianapolis, and KDWB in Minneapolis/St. Paul are the best-known CHR/pop stations in the U.S. \"See also: Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)\"\n\nThese stations typically are hybrids of the contemporary hit radio (CHR/pop) and hot AC formats. This format contains a strong focus on current chart, contemporary and recurrent hits as well as placing a minority of older, classic hits from the 1990s and 2000s onto the playlist. Adult CHR stations play pop-friendly rhythmic, dance and hip hop titles from artists such as Rihanna, Beyoncé, Pitbull, Flo Rida, Britney Spears, Usher or Ne-Yo while still shying away from hardcore hip hop.\n\nExamples in the U.S. include WKRQ in Cincinnati, WWMX in Baltimore, WKFR-FM in Kalamazoo, WROK in Rockford, Illinois, WKCI in Hartford/New Haven, WZYP in Huntsville, KBMX in Duluth, WMXZ in Charleston, Sirius XM Hits 1, WNDV in South Bend, WIXX in Green Bay, KLTG in Corpus Christi and KZZO in Sacramento. United Kingdom (UK) media regulator Ofcom states: \"where a format requires a contemporary and chart music service, the main diet must be of modern music, reflecting the charts of today and recent months. Older, classic tracks would not be out of place, but only as spice to the main offering.\"\n\nThe adult CHR format is sometimes utilized by stations which are heritage Top 40/CHR outlets in their respective markets which have been in the format since the 1970s or 1980s or FM successors to former AM top 40s. \"See also: Adult Top 40, a US Billboard chart.\"\n\nAlso known as CHR/rhythmic, or CHR/urban. These stations focus on hip-hop and dance-pop. There are differences between CHR/rhythmic and the urban contemporary format; urban stations will often play R&B and soul songs that CHR/rhythmic stations will not, and CHR/rhythmic stations, despite playlists heavy with urban product, sometimes have white disc jockeys and will include EDM and rhythmic pop music that urban outlets will not play. KYLD in San Francisco, WQHT in New York, and KPWR in Los Angeles are among the most successful CHR/rhythmic stations in the U.S. and among the pioneers of the format.\n\nPlaying dance remixes of popular songs with perhaps some current hits from the dance charts. Pure dance-music radio stations (as opposed to CHR/rhythmic and rhythmic AC formats such as MOViN) are not very common but tend to have loyal audiences in the markets where they do exist. Examples include KDHT-FM in Denver, WPTY on Long Island, NY and KNHC in Seattle.\"see also: Dance/Mix Show Airplay\"\n\nStations with this format are similar in some ways to the adult CHR and mainstream CHR/pop formats, but also incorporate modern rock and modern AC titles in an upbeat presentation. Examples include KSXY in Santa Rosa, California KKCK in Marshall, Minnesota.\n\nThere are also ethnic variations, such as CHR/español (Latin pop), and CHR/Tejano (Tex-Mex and Tejano) which are commonly found in Arizona, Texas, California, and Mexico.\n\nCredit for the format is widely given to Todd Storz, who was the director of radio station KOWH-AM in Omaha, Nebraska in 1951. At that time typical AM radio programming consisted largely of full-service \"block programming\" — pre-scheduled, sponsored programs of a wide variety, including radio dramas and variety shows. Local popular music hits, if they made it on the air at all, had to be worked in between these segments. Storz noted the great response certain songs got from the record-buying public and compared it to the way certain selections on jukeboxes were played over and over. He expanded his domain of radio stations, purchasing WTIX-AM in New Orleans, Louisiana, gradually converted his stations to an all-hits format, and pioneered the practice of surveying record stores to determine which singles were popular each week. Storz found that the more people heard a given song on the radio or from the jukebox, the more likely they were to buy a copy; a conclusion not obvious in the industry at the time. In 1952 he purchased what was then WLAF-AM in Lafayette, Indiana and constructed WAZY-AM/FM which is still the longest running top 40 FM station in existence to this day. In 1954, Storz purchased WHB-AM, a high-powered station in Kansas City, Missouri which could be heard throughout the Midwest and Great Plains, converted it to an all-hits format, and dubbed the result \"top 40\". Shortly thereafter WHB debuted the first \"top 40 countdown\", a reverse-order playing of the station's ranking of hit singles for that week. Within a few years, top 40 stations appeared all over the country to great success, spurred by the burgeoning popularity of rock and roll music, especially that of Elvis Presley. A 1950s employee at WHB, Ruth Meyer, went on to have tremendous success in the early to mid-60's as program director of New York's premiere top 40 station at that time, WMCA.\n\nStorz Broadcasting Company consisted of six AM radio stations, all featuring top 40 in the sixties.\n\nAlthough Todd Storz is regarded as the father of the top 100 format, Gordon McLendon of Dallas, Texas is regarded as the person who took an idea and turned it into a mass media marketing success in combination with the development in that same city of PAMS jingles. McLendon's successful Mighty 1190 KLIF in Dallas, along with his two other Texas Triangle stations, 610 KILT (AM) Houston and 550 KTSA San Antonio, which went top 40 during the mid to late 1950s, soon became perhaps the most imitated radio stations in America. With careful attention to programming, McLendon presented his stations as packages to advertisers and listeners alike. It was the combination of top 40 and PAMS jingles which became the key to the success of the radio format itself. Not only were the same records played on different stations across America, but so were the same jingle music beds whose lyrics were resung repetitively for each station to create individual station identity. To this basic mix were added contests, games and disc jockey patter. Various groups (including Bartell Broadcasters) emphasized local variations on their top 40 stations.\n\nGordon McLendon would operate approximately a dozen and a half AM, FM and TV stations at various times, experimenting with formats other than top 40 (including beautiful music and all-news).\n\nIn the early 1960s Rick Sklar also developed the top 40 format for radio station WABC in New York City which was then copied by stations in the eastern and mid-western United States such as WKBW and WLS.\n\nBill Drake built upon the foundation established by Storz and McLendon to create a variation called boss radio. This format began in California in early 1961 at KSTN (Stockton), then in 1962-63 at KYNO (Fresno), in 1964 at KGB (San Diego), and finally to KHJ Los Angeles in May 1965, and was further adapted to stations across the western USA. It was later broadcast by American disc jockeys as a hybrid format on Swinging Radio England which broadcast from on board a ship anchored off the coast of southern England in international waters. At that time there were no commercial radio stations in the UK, and BBC radio offered only sporadic top 40 programming. Other noteworthy North American top 40 stations that used the \"Drake\" approach included KFRC in San Francisco; CKLW in Windsor, ON; WRKO in Boston; WHBQ in Memphis, TN; WOLF in Syracuse, NY; and WOR-FM in New York City. Most listeners identified boss radio with less talk, shorter jingles and more music.\n\nMike Joseph's \"hot hits\" stations of the late 1970s and early 1980s attempted to revitalize the format by refocusing listeners' attention on current, active \"box-office\" music. Thus, hot hits stations played only current hit songs - no oldies unless they were on current chart albums - in a fast, furious and repetitive fashion, with fast-talking personalities and loud, pounding jingles. In 1977, WTIC-FM in Hartford, CT, dropped its long-running classical format for Joseph's format as \"96 Tics\" and immediately became one of the top radio stations in the market. The first Joseph station to use the term \"hot hits\" on the air was WFBL (\"Fire 14\", which played its top 14 hits in very tight rotation) in Syracuse, NY, in 1979. Then WCAU-FM in Philadelphia switched to hot hits as \"98 Now\" in the fall of 1981 and was instantly successful. Other major-market stations which adopted the hot hits format in the early 1980s included WBBM-FM Chicago, WHYT (now WDVD) Detroit, WMAR-FM (now WWMX) Baltimore, which we might add was not successful against market leader WBSB B104, KITS San Francisco, and WNVZ Norfolk.\n\nDon Pierson took the formats of Gordon McLendon, boss radio and PAMS jingles to the UK in the form of Wonderful Radio London, (a pirate radio ship) and subsequently revolutionized the popular music format. On 14 August 1967 The Marine Offences Act was introduced in the UK and the pirate stations were shut down.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation were chosen by the UK government to come up with a station to replace the pirates, and so in 1967 BBC Radio 1 started broadcasting, employing many of the DJ's from the pirate stations (Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett and John Peel etc.) and obtaining re-sings of the PAMS jingles.\n\nIn fact it was Tony Blackburn who played the first pop record on Radio 1, The Move's \"Flowers In The Rain\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The painting is dated to approximately 1630. Caravaggio was an important influence in Stanzione’s artistic style and this painting illustrates a combination of styles from Caravaggio’s brutally realistic elements and dramatic lighting to classical 17th-century artistic trends including the lyrical style of Bologna artists. This painting shows David in an elegant posture, which softens the goriness, i.e. the dismembered head of Goliath. The theatrical lighting of this painting is a perfect demonstration of the chiaroscuro interpretation by Stanzione. Guido Reni and Caravaggio can be credited for Stanzione’s interpretation of chiaroscuro; they were supposedly his teachers. It was only after the painting was donated, that experts noticed under gallery lighting some aberrations in the canvas such as unevenness and crackle patterns. Those aberrations, along with the fact that young David appears to be gazing at something in the lower left corner led to suspicions that the canvas had been altered. By 1999, with the use of x-rays and careful removal of surface paint, the original paint of Goliath’s forehead was revealed. After intensive restoration, Goliath’s full face was uncovered and the painting restored to its original form. The full painting depicts Goliath’s dismembered head in the lower left corner, with David, knife in hand, gazing down to the lower left corner. It is believed that the head of Goliath was painted over in order to make the painting less gory and more appealing to potential buyers.\n\n"}

It is a sequel to Bava's 1985 film \"Demons\" and stars David Knight, Nancy Brilli, Coralina Cataldi Tassoni as well as Argento's youngest daughter, Asia Argento, in her debut film performance at age 10. The film was also known as Demons 2: The Nightmare Returns. The demons from the first film invade the real world through a television broadcast, turning the residents of an apartment building into bloodthirsty monsters.\n\nThe film opens as if the events of the first film took place in reality, but this is a film within a film that the various residents of a high-rise apartment building are watching. Its story follows several teens who trespass into a city that was deserted as a result of the outbreak. Finding the lifeless corpse of a demon, one of the teens revives it accidentally by dripping blood from a scratch into its mouth. \n\nIn reality, frustrated party girl Sally Day locks herself in her bedroom when her boyfriend does not attend her sixteenth birthday party. As her friends try to persuade her to return to the party, she watches part of the film on television. Suddenly, the demon notices her, climbs through the television and attacks her. Sally is transformed into a demon and attacks her friends, turning all but two of them into vile, bloodthirsty monsters.\n\nThe creatures' bile seeps through the building, burning through the ceiling and into other apartments and shorting out the electrical system. In one apartment, a dog licks up the bile and transforms into a vicious beast that attacks and kills its owner. A young boy left alone by his parents avoids Sally and her rampaging demon friends but is ultimately poisoned by the bile and becomes a monster. The demon boy attacks Hannah, a pregnant woman waiting for her husband to come home. She kills the demon boy, but a flying demon bursts out of his body to further terrorize her. Her husband, George, has been trapped in the elevator with another woman. As they escape through a service hatch, a demon bursts through the elevator door and infects the woman. She in turn attacks George, but he kills her before entering his and Hannah's apartment in time to kill the flying demon with an umbrella.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of bodybuilders led by gym instructor Hank have barricaded themselves in the underground car park, along with a group of tenants. Unable to break down the garage doors, they stand their ground and defend themselves with shotguns and makeshift weapons, such as Molotov cocktails. The demons eventually force their way in. Although they heavily outnumber the demons, the uninfected are relatively easily defeated and are either turned into demons themselves or killed.\n\nThe infected start making their way back up the building. George causes a leak in the gas pipes that kills all the infected except Sally in an explosion. Hannah and George search for a way out and go into Sally's apartment, finding the two hidden partygoers. The group make their way to the roof but are stopped by Sally. She infects the two partygoers, but George dispatches them. George and Hannah lower themselves to the roof of an adjacent building, fighting Sally as they go. Inside the neighboring building, Hannah gives birth to the couple's child. George defeats the resilient Sally in mortal combat, and he and Hannah exit with their newborn child.\n\nFor the sequel, Boswell chose to use British new wave bands such as The Smiths, The Cult, Dead Can Dance, and the Art of Noise on the soundtrack as opposed to the heavy metal of the original film. Songs featured in the film are:\n\n\n\"Demons 2\" was released theatrically in Italy on 9 October 1986.\n\n\"Demons 2\" has an approval rating of 60% on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews. AllMovie's review was negative, writing, \"putting aside the simplistic plot, lousy dialogue and atrocious acting, \"Demons 2\" is watchable for one reason: the bloody mechanical and makeup effects by Sergio Stivaletti.\" Reviewing the film on Blu-ray, Budd Wilkins of \"Slant Magazine\" rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that it \"trades in its predecessor's penchant for wall-to-wall gore in favor of surreal shocks and quasi-Cronenbergian craziness\". Writing in a retrospective for Dread Central, Matt Serafini called it \"much more a mixed bag than its predecessor\" but questioned why it never led to a franchise. Serafini suggested a new generation of Italian filmmakers continue the series, including the practical effects and new wave music of \"Demons 2\".\n\nArrow Video released the first two films on Blu-ray and DVD on 30 April 2012 with a two-part comic included, entitled \"Demons 3\". Part 1 came with \"Demons\" and the last part with \"Demons 2\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1691035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1691035", "title": "Ed Farhat", "text": "Ed Farhat\n\nEdward George Farhat (June 7, 1926 – January 18, 2003) was a Lebanese-American professional wrestler best known by his ring name The Sheik (sometimes called The Original Sheik to distinguish him from The Iron Sheik, who debuted in 1972). He is also one of the originators of what became the hardcore wrestling style, as the promoter of Big Time Wrestling, and the uncle of ECW wrestler Sabu.\n\nHe started out wrestling in the Chicago area as The Sheik of Araby after having served in the U.S. Army. He often teamed with Gypsy Joe. Later on he went to Texas. During his early career, his biggest match was one he didn't even wrestle in. He was set to face NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz in Chicago for his title but Thesz had a reputation for embarrassing \"gimmick\" wrestlers so The Sheik bailed from the ring and hid under a bus. The publicity from the event helped push the Sheik character to a more prominent level. He went to New York for Vincent J. McMahon where he teamed with Dick The Bruiser and Bull Curry in feuds against Mark Lewin and Don Curtis as well as the team of Antonino Rocca and Miguel Pérez in Madison Square Garden. He returned when McMahon formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation to feud with Bruno Sammartino in the WWWF's major markets in the late 1960s.\n\nThe Sheik's wrestling was centered on his character of a rich wild man from Syria. Before each match, he would use stalling tactics as he would kneel on a prayer rug to pray to Allah. He would lock on choke holds and refuse to break them, and use a camel clutch hold leading to submission. The hold would have him sit over his opponent's back as he applied a chinlock. He used hidden pencils and other \"foreign objects\" to cut open his opponent's faces. Often, the tactic backfired and the opponent got The Sheik's pencil, leading to the extensive scarring on Farhat's forehead. The other illegal move was his fireball that he threw into his opponents' faces, sometimes burning their face severely. ( He had pieces of paper soaked in lighter fluid which he quick lit with a cigarette lighter hidden in his trunks. ) He didn't speak on camera, apart from the incomprehensible, oft-uttered phrase \"aloo, aloo!\" which he repeated in the ring. He was actually saying quickly Kalamazoo. At the start of his career his wife Joyce played the part of his valet Princess Saleema who would burn incense in the ring. He had three different managers during his career to cut promos on his behalf. His first manager was Abdullah Farouk but when Farouk managed full-time in the WWF, Eddy Creatchman became his manager. When Creatchman was unable to work with him later in his career, Sheik had Supermouth Dave Drason.\n\nThe Sheik's biggest feud was his seemingly career-long conflict with Bobo Brazil in Big Time Wrestling in Detroit. The two feuded over Sheik's version of the United States Championship, frequently selling out Cobo Hall. This is seen briefly on the \"documentary\" movie, \"I Like to Hurt People.\" The two took the feud to several markets, most notably Memphis, Tennessee and Los Angeles, California. His other major opponent in Los Angeles was Fred Blassie. Sheik and Blassie faced off several times, including cage matches in the Grand Olympic Auditorium.\n\nIn 1968, he was brought into the WWWF for title matches with then-champion Bruno Sammartino. They met three times in Madison Square Garden—Sheik won the first via count out, he was disqualified in the second, and he lost to Bruno in a Texas Death Match via submission when Bruno grabbed a foreign object (pen) and hammered Sheik's arm to a bloody pulp. Sammartino and Sheik also had a series of matches in Boston, including one sell out the day after a crippling snow storm, and public transportation not yet restored.\n\nStarting in 1969, he also wrestled regularly in Toronto, where he was undefeated for 127 matches at Maple Leaf Gardens. He defeated the likes of Whipper Billy Watson, Lou Thesz, Gene Kiniski, Bruno Sammartino, Édouard Carpentier, Ernie Ladd, Chief Jay Strongbow, Tiger Jeet Singh, Johnny Valentine and even André the Giant during Andre's first extensive tour of North America in 1974. It was Andre who put an end to the Sheik's Toronto winning streak in August 1974 by disqualification. In 1976 he lost by pinfall to Thunderbolt Patterson and Bobo Brazil. Sheik continued to headline most shows in Toronto until 1977, but business dropped off significantly over the last three years. Few fans were aware of the fact that he was actually the booker within Frank Tunney's promotion following the retirement of Whipper Billy Watson in 1971. He was also the promoter at Cobo Hall in Detroit for many years. As business in Toronto failed, he worked for indy promoter Dave McKigney in Ontario and ran his own Big Time Wrestling promotion out of his home near Lansing, Michigan.\n\nLate in his career, Sheik ventured to a promotion in Japan. His run was successful, but management was in financial ruin, so when the company went bankrupt, Sheik jumped to Baba's All Japan Pro Wrestling. He then jumped a year later to Inoki's New Japan Pro Wrestling, but had a falling out with Inoki, and left Japan to return to wrestling full-time in Detroit. He returned in 1977 for All Japan, teaming, and feuding with, Abdullah the Butcher. His match with Abdullah the Butcher against Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk where Terry fought off Butcher and Sheik with his arm in a sling is credited for turning the foreign Funks into faces in Japan.\n\nIn 1980, he wrestled for various independent promotions throughout the United States and Japan through the 1980s. It was while in Japan that he suffered his first heart attack while boarding a taxi.\n\nDuring the 1990s, he mainly wrestled in Japan for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling and had various dangerous death matches. On May 6, 1992, The Sheik had a \"fire deathmatch\" with Sabu against Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto, where the ring ropes were replaced with flaming barbed wire and he got third-degree burns and went into a coma.\n\nIn 1994, he had a brief run in Extreme Championship Wrestling where he teamed with Pat Tanaka against Kevin Sullivan and Taz. He wrestled his last match in Japan in 1998.\n\nWhen Sabu joined WCW in 1995, Farhat joined him as his manager. During a match with Jerry Lynn, who was wrestling as \"Mr. JL\" at the time, Farhat's leg was broken by the wrestlers during a spot he was previously unaware of.\n\nFarhat retired to his estate and died on January 18, 2003, of heart failure. In his later years, Farhat provided extensive interviews to his biographer with the intent of publishing a book on his life. These interviews provided a highly explosive look into the world of wrestling, especially on the early days of the WWWF/WWF and Japanese wrestling organizations. As a result, the interviews and draft book were sealed at the time of his death. Despite large offers for movie rights to this book, it is unknown when, or if, Farhat's family will allow his biographer to release the book.\n\nThe Sheik was seen as one of professional wrestling's biggest box office attractions, and as a pioneer of \"hardcore wrestling\" which became a major part of professional wrestling in the 1990s. On March 31, 2007, The Sheik was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by his nephew, Sabu, and Rob Van Dam, who he had trained. He had also trained Scott Steiner, and most notably, boxer Muhammad Ali before Ali's famous \"boxer vs wrestler match\" with Antonio Inoki in 1976 in Tokyo.\n\nHis wife, and former valet, Joyce, died on November 27, 2013, in Michigan. They are buried at Mount Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Williamston, Michigan.\n\n\n\n"}

It stars young Sofia Vassilieva as Eloise, an irrepressible six-year-old girl who lives in the penthouse at the top of the Plaza Hotel in New York City.\n\nThis film was produced by Handmade Films and DiNovi Pictures for Walt Disney Television with distribution handled by the ABC Television Network, and released on both VHS and DVD by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 2003.\n\nEloise is a fun-loving six-year-old girl with a knack for finding adventure every place she looks. While under the care of her \"rawther\" wonderful nanny (Julie Andrews), Eloise tries to play matchmaker to a lonely prince and wrangle an invitation to the society event of the season.\n\nAlessandra Stanley from The New York Times, praised the film fidelity to the book and the actor's performances. Reel Film Reviews gave the film two out of four stars, stating: \"Eloise at the Plaza is mildly entertaining, if only because it seems to consist of one caper after another. The film's structure soon becomes perfectly obvious - Eloise gets into a madcap adventure, adults chase her around, Nanny admonishes her, etc - and the fast pace is clearly in place to keep younger viewers interested. But, though there are a number of talented actors in the cast, Eloise just isn't a compelling enough character to sustain an entire movie. There's no doubt that the movie will act as wish fulfillment for kids - who wouldn't want to run amuck and get away with it? - but when you get right down to it, Eloise is awfully thin and one-dimensional (not to mention annoying).\" DVDizzy.com wrote: \"The film even ascends beyond the second-tier quality that most television movies are satisfied to achieve. Eloise deserves praise not merely as a more bearable Wonderful World of Disney presentation, but as a genuinely entertaining family film, regardless of format.\"\n\nFor his work in \"Eloise at the Plaza\", Bruce Broughton won one Primetime Emmy Award in the category of \"Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special (Dramatic Underscore)\".\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, \"Eloise at the Plaza\" currently holds 68% of audience aprovation.\n\n"}

It is located on the piano nobile in the eastern wing of the Winter Palace, and is the larger, and principal, of two churches within the Palace. A smaller, more private church was constructed in 1768, near the private apartment in the northwest part of the wing. The Grand Church was designed by Francesco Rastrelli, and has been described as \"one of the most splendid rooms\" in the Palace. Today, the church is an unconsecrated exhibition hall of the State Hermitage Museum.\n\nConstruction of the church began on 14 October 1753 (Julian calendar). Six years later, the interior design was executed by the Italian artists Carlo Zucci, Francesco Martini, Giovanni Antonio Veneroni and the sculptor G. B. Gianni. Rastrelli was personally in charge of the three-tier iconostasis where the icons were painted by Ivan Ivanovich Belsky and Ivan Vishnyakov. The Italian Francesco Fontebasso painted the evangelists in the church's spandrels and the \"Resurrection of Christ\" plafond in the vestibule.\n\nThe Grand Church was one of the final parts of the palace to be completed. When the Palace was first inhabited on 6 April 1762, the cathedral was not yet completed, so a temporary church of the Resurrection of Christ was consecrated by Archbishop Dimitry Sechenov of Novgorod.\n\nOn 12 July 1763, Archbishop Gavriil Kremenetsky of St Petersburg consecrated the Grand Church in the name of the Not-Made-by-Hand Image of Our Saviour. This eponymous icon, painted by Feodor Ukhtomsky in 1693, lavishly decorated with gold and diamonds, was placed near the sanctuary.\n\nThe Grand Church and the Palace's Jordan Staircase are one of the few parts of the palace to retain the original rococo decorative scheme devised by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli. This was faithfully copied by Vasily Stasov when he was commissioned to rebuild the palace following the disastrous fire that destroyed most of the original palace interiors in 1837. However, the new intricate decoration was mostly made of moulded papier-mâché, rather than wood.\n\nAs before the fire, the church is sub-divided by Corinthian columns and pilasters into three distinct areas, brightly lit by large windows on opposite sides, the central area being covered by a dome. The walls of the church are richly embellished with gilded stucco in rococo design. The ceiling depicts the Ascension of Christ by Pyotr Basinm, while the lunettes beneath the dome depict Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke and John by Fiodor Bruni. The restored cathedral was consecrated on 25 March 1839 by Metropolitan Filaret (Drozdov) of Moscow.\n\nThe Cathedral was the repository of multiple relics and memorabilia related to the Romanovs. It was used as the imperial family's private place of worship, with the imperial family's members usually praying in a special room beyond the sanctuary. This was the place where Nicholas II prayed at the liturgy before exiting onto the balcony to face the crowd on the day of declaring war on Germany in 1914.\n\nIn May 1918, the Cathedral was officially closed for worship. It is now used as an exhibition hall of the Hermitage Museum. Restoration work undertaken from 2012 until 2014 is described by the State Museum as a \"recreation of the original design of the Court Cathedral\" and \"The icons, the candelabra, the standard lamps and pieces of the iconostasis, the pulpit, the lantern and the altar canopy were returned to their original place\".\n"}

The Great North Museum project has been made possible with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, TyneWear Partnership, One NorthEast, the European Regional Development Fund, Newcastle University, Newcastle City Council, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Wolfson Foundation and The Northern Rock Foundation, as well as numerous other trusts and foundations. The building architects were Terry Farrell and Partners; Sir Terry Farrell is a native of Newcastle, and had previously been a student at Newcastle University.\n\nOn 21 November 2008, the 'Be Part of It' campaign was launched, and it was announced that the Great North Museum: Hancock would be opening in 2009.

At first dispassionate observers, they find themselves caught up in the increasingly chaotic and nihilistic violence. The film received the André Cavens Award for Best Film by the Belgian Film Critics Association (UCC). Since its release, the picture has become a cult film, and received a rare NC-17 rating for its release in the U.S.\n\nBen (Benoît Poelvoorde) is a witty, charismatic serial killer who holds forth at length about whatever comes to mind, be it the \"craft\" of murder, the failings of architecture, his own poetry, or classical music, which he plays with his girlfriend Valerie (Valérie Parent). A film crew joins him on his sadistic adventures, recording them for a fly on the wall documentary. Ben takes them to meet his family and friends while boasting of murdering many people at random and dumping their bodies in canals and quarries. The viewer witnesses these grisly killings in graphic detail.\n\nBen ventures into apartment buildings, explaining how it is more cost-effective to attack old people than young couples because the former have more cash at home and are easier to kill. In a following scene, he screams wildly at an elderly lady, causing her to have a heart attack. As she lies dying, he casually remarks that this method saved him a bullet. Ben continues his candid explanations and appalling rampage, shooting, strangling, and beating to death anyone who comes his way: women (he is misogynistic), immigrants (he is a racist xenophobe), and postmen (his favorite targets).\n\nThe camera crew becomes more and more involved in the murders, first as accomplices but eventually taking an active part in them. When Ben invades a home and kills an entire family, they help him hold down a young boy and smother him. They meet a competing camera crew and take turns shooting the three men. During filming, two of Ben's crew are killed; their deaths are later called \"occupational hazards\" by a crew member.\n\nWhen Ben takes a couple hostage in their own home, he holds the man at gunpoint while he and the crew gang-rape the woman. The following morning, the camera dispassionately records the aftermath: the woman has been butchered with a knife, her entrails spilling out, and the man has been shot to death. Ben's violence becomes more and more random until he kills an acquaintance in front of his girlfriend and friends during a birthday dinner. Spattered with blood, they act as though nothing horrible has happened, continuing to offer Ben presents. The film crew disposes of the body for Ben.\n\nAfter a victim flees before he can be killed, Ben is arrested, but he escapes. At this point someone starts taking revenge on him and his family. Ben discovers that his parents have been killed, along with his girlfriend Valerie: a flautist, she has been murdered in a particularly humiliating manner, with her flute inserted into her anus. This prompts Ben to decide that he must leave. He meets the camera crew to say farewell, but in the middle of reciting a poem he is abruptly shot dead by an off-camera gunman. The camera crew is then picked off one by one. After the camera falls, it keeps running, and the film ends with the death of the fleeing sound recordist.\n\nThe film is shot in black and white and was produced on a shoe-string budget by four student filmmakers, led by director Rémy Belvaux. The film's writers, Belvaux, Poelvoorde and Bonzel, all appear in the film using their own first names: Poelvoorde as Ben, the killer; Belvaux as Rémy, the director; and Bonzel as André, the camera operator. The genesis of the idea came from shooting a documentary without any money. This film is rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong graphic violence\".\nAlthough it is never shown or suggested in the film itself that Benoit kills a baby, the original poster features an image of a baby's pacifier with spattering blood coming from an unseen target at the end of Benoit's gun. For foreign release posters (not including the Region 4/Australian release), the baby's pacifier was changed to a set of dentures. In the R-rated version of the film that was made for the U.S. video audience (as NC-17 rated films were never allowed to be stocked at Blockbuster Video), the scenes where Ben and the crew work together to kill a young child are excised; the following scenes where Ben rapes a woman and the camera crew joins in are included but edited to have less nudity and gore.\n\n\"Man Bites Dog\" received positive reviews upon release. Based on 18 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 72%, with an average score of 7.1/10. LA Times film critic Kenneth Turan highly praises the film upon its release \"\"Man Bites Dog\" defines audacity. An assured, seductive chamber of horrors, it marries nightmare with humor and then abruptly takes the laughter away. Intentionally disturbing, it is close to the last word about the nature of violence on film, a troubling, often funny vision of what the movies have done to our souls... The deserving winner of the International Critics Award at Cannes ...\" Film critic Rob Gonsalves called the film \"[an] original, a stark and (sorry) biting work far more complex, both stylistically and thematically, than first meets the eye.\" \n\nThe film was screened at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival where it won the International Critics’ Prize, the SACD award for Best Feature and the Special Award of the Youth for directors Rémy Belvaux, André Bonzel and Benoît Poelvoorde. The film's controversial content and extreme violence was off-putting to some viewers, and resulted in the film being banned in Sweden. In 2003, the video was banned in Ireland.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56329", "title": "Necromancy", "text": "Necromancy\n\nNecromancy () is a practice of magic involving communication with the deceased – either by summoning their spirit as an apparition or raising them bodily – for the purpose of divination, imparting the means to foretell future events or discover hidden knowledge, to bring someone back from the dead, or to use the deceased as a weapon, as the term may sometimes be used in a more general sense to refer to black magic or witchcraft.\n\nThe word \"necromancy\" is adapted from Late Latin \"necromantia\", itself borrowed from post-Classical Greek νεκρομαντεία (\"nekromanteía\"), a compound of Ancient Greek νεκρός (\"nekrós\"), \"dead body\", and μαντεία (\"manteía\"), \"divination by means of\"; this compound form was first used by Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century AD. The Classical Greek term was ἡ νέκυια (\"nekyia\"), from the episode of the \"Odyssey\" in which Odysseus visits the realm of the dead and νεκρομαντεία in Hellenistic Greek, rendered as \"necromantīa\" in Latin, and as \"necromancy\" in 17th-century English.\n\nEarly necromancy was related to – and most likely evolved from – shamanism, which calls upon spirits such as the ghosts of ancestors. Classical necromancers addressed the dead in \"a mixture of high-pitch squeaking and low droning\", comparable to the trance-state mutterings of shamans.\nNecromancy was prevalent throughout Western antiquity with records of its practice in ancient Egypt, Babylonia, Greece and Rome. In his \"Geographica\", Strabo refers to νεκρομαντία (\"nekromantia\"), or \"diviners by the dead\", as the foremost practitioners of divination among the people of Persia, and it is believed to have also been widespread among the peoples of Chaldea (particularly the Sabians, or \"star-worshipers\"), Etruria and Babylonia. The Babylonian necromancers were called \"manzazuu\" or \"sha'etemmu\", and the spirits they raised were called \"etemmu\".\n\nThe oldest literary account of necromancy is found in Homer’s \"Odyssey\". Under the direction of Circe, a powerful sorceress, Odysseus travels to the underworld (\"katabasis\") in order to gain insight about his impending voyage home by raising the spirits of the dead through the use of spells which Circe has taught him. He wishes to invoke and question the shade of Tiresias in particular; however, he is unable to summon the seer's spirit without the assistance of others. The \"Odyssey\"'s passages contain many descriptive references to necromantic rituals: rites must be performed around a pit with fire during nocturnal hours, and Odysseus has to follow a specific recipe, which includes the blood of sacrificial animals, to concoct a libation for the ghosts to drink while he recites prayers to both the ghosts and gods of the underworld.\n\nPractices such as these, varying from the mundane to the grotesque, were commonly associated with necromancy. Rituals could be quite elaborate, involving magic circles, wands, talismans, and incantations. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and unfermented grape juice. Some necromancers even went so far as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses. These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of interment or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased’s ghostly spirit instead.\n\nWhile some cultures considered the knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades knew only certain things. The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death. Ovid writes in his \"Metamorphoses\" of a marketplace in the underworld where the dead convene to exchange news and gossip.\n\nThere are also several references to necromancers – called \"bone-conjurers\" among Jews of the later Hellenistic period – in the Bible. The Book of Deuteronomy () explicitly warns the Israelites against engaging in the Canaanite practice of divination from the dead: Though Mosaic Law prescribed the death penalty to practitioners of necromancy (), this warning was not always heeded. One of the foremost examples is when King Saul had the Witch of Endor invoke the Spirit of Samuel, a judge and prophet, from Sheol using a ritual conjuring pit (). However, the so-called witch was shocked at the presence of the real spirit of Samuel for in I Sam 28:12 it says, \"when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice.\" Samuel questioned his reawakening asking, \"Why hast thou disquieted me?\" Saul did not receive a death penalty (his being the highest authority in the land) but he did receive it from God himself as prophesied by Samuel during that conjuration – within a day he died in battle along with his son Jonathan.\n\nSome Christian writers later rejected the idea that humans could bring back the spirits of the dead and interpreted such shades as disguised demons instead, thus conflating necromancy with demon summoning. Caesarius of Arles entreats his audience to put no stock in any demons or gods other than the Christian God, even if the working of spells appears to provide benefit. He states that demons only act with divine permission and are permitted by God to test Christian people. Caesarius does not condemn man here; he only states that the art of necromancy exists, although it is prohibited by the Bible. On the other hand, some Christians believe that necromancy is real (along with other facets of the occult \"magic\") but God has not suffered Christians to deal with those spirits (Deuteronomy 18:14). Still others believe the phantom of Samuel to be a trick, like the hoax séances conducted by many early 20th century illusionist spiritualists, which fooled those recording the events of Samuel's life.\n\nMany medieval writers believed that actual resurrection required the assistance of God. They saw the practice of necromancy as conjuring demons who took the appearance of spirits. The practice became known explicitly as maleficium, and the Catholic Church condemned it. Though the practitioners of necromancy were linked by many common threads, there is no evidence that these necromancers ever organized as a group.\n\nMedieval necromancy is believed to be a synthesis of astral magic derived from Arabic influences and exorcism derived from Christian and Jewish teachings. Arabic influences are evident in rituals that involve moon phases, sun placement, day and time. Fumigation and the act of burying images are also found in both astral magic and necromancy. Christian and Jewish influences appear in the symbols and in the conjuration formulas used in summoning rituals.\n\nPractitioners were often members of the Christian clergy, though some nonclerical practitioners are recorded. In some instances, mere apprentices or those ordained to lower orders dabbled in the practice. They were connected by a belief in the manipulation of spiritual beings – especially demons – and magical practices. These practitioners were almost always literate and well educated. Most possessed basic knowledge of exorcism and had access to texts of astrology and of demonology. Clerical training was informal and university-based education rare. Most were trained under apprenticeships and were expected to have a basic knowledge of Latin, ritual and doctrine. This education was not always linked to spiritual guidance and seminaries were almost non-existent. This situation allowed some aspiring clerics to combine Christian rites with occult practices despite its condemnation in Christian doctrine.\n\nMedieval practitioners believed they could accomplish three things with necromancy: will manipulation, illusions, and knowledge:\n\n\nThe act of performing medieval necromancy usually involved magic circles, conjurations, and sacrifices such as those shown in the \"Munich Manual of Demonic Magic\":\n\n\nThe rare confessions of those accused of necromancy suggest that there was a range of spell casting and related magical experimentation. It is difficult to determine if these details were due to their practices, as opposed to the whims of their interrogators. John of Salisbury is one of the first examples related by Richard Kieckhefer, but as a Parisian ecclesiastical court record of 1323 shows, a \"group who were plotting to invoke the demon Berich from inside a circle made from strips of cat skin\" were obviously participating in what the Church would define as \"necromancy\".\n\nHerbert Stanley Redgrove claims necromancy as one of three chief branches of medieval ceremonial magic, alongside black magic and white magic. This does not correspond to contemporary classifications, which often conflate \"nigromancy\" (\"black-knowledge\") with \"necromancy\" (\"death-knowledge\").\n\nIn the wake of inconsistencies of judgment, necromancers and other practitioners of the magic arts were able to utilize spells featuring holy names with impunity, as any biblical references in such rituals could be construed as prayers rather than spells. As a consequence, the necromancy that appears in the \"Munich Manual\" is an evolution of these theoretical understandings. It has been suggested that the authors of the \"Manual\" knowingly designed the book to be in discord with ecclesiastical law. The main recipe employed throughout the \"Manual\" used the same religious language and names of power alongside demonic names. An understanding of the names of God derived from apocryphal texts and the Hebrew Torah required that the author of such rites have at least a casual familiarity with these sources.\n\nWithin the tales related in occult manuals are found connections with stories from other cultures' literary traditions. For instance, the ceremony for conjuring a horse closely relates to the Arabic \"One Thousand and One Nights\" and French romances; Chaucer’s \"The Squire's Tale\" also bears marked similarities. This becomes a parallel evolution of spells to foreign gods or demons that were once acceptable, and frames them into a new Christian context, albeit demonic and forbidden. As the material for these manuals was apparently derived from scholarly magical and religious texts from a variety of sources in many languages, the scholars who studied these texts likely manufactured their own aggregate sourcebook and manual with which to work spells or magic.\n\nIn the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, it is stated that \"Of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which deals with the belief in Necromancy, the sister of Alchemy, which gives birth to simple and natural things.\"\n\nIn the present day, necromancy is more generally used as a term to describe the pretense of manipulation of death and the dead, often facilitated through the use of ritual magic or some other kind of occult ceremony. Contemporary séances, channeling and Spiritualism verge on necromancy when supposedly invoked spirits are asked to reveal future events or secret information. Necromancy may also be presented as sciomancy, a branch of theurgic magic.\n\nBecause of their themes of spirit contact, the long-running show Supernatural Chicago and the annual Harry Houdini séance, both of which are held at the Excalibur nightclub in Chicago, Illinois, dub their lead performer \"Neil Tobin, Necromancer\".\n\nAs to the practice of necromancy having endured in one form or another throughout the millennia, \"An Encyclopædia of Occultism\" states: \n\nNecromancy appears in many works of fantasy fiction, often by villains who use it to raise armies of zombies the heroes must slay. Necromancy is a popular plot element in video games, such as \"Diablo 2\", \"\", \"\", \"World of Warcraft\", \"Gothic\" and \"Mortal Kombat\", as well as in the tabletop role-playing game \"Dungeons & Dragons\". In the film \"Army of Darkness\" (1992) the protagonist Ash fights a skeletal army raised by the \"Necronomicon\". Necromancer is the main protagonist of Tony Vilgotsky's novel \"Shepherd of the Dead\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Chronicles are among the most extensive monuments of Old Russian literature and one of the leading genres of it.\n\nChronicles were main form of Russian historical narrative until the middle of the 16th century, the time of Ivan the Terrible, when they gave primacy to another historiographical genre — chronographs.\n\nOld Russian Chronicles survive in some hundreds сopies (codices). Some Chronicles known in multiple сopies, others - in only one copy. Every chronicle was a \"svod\", i.e. collection because it included (collected) materials from some previous chronicles, which were revised, shortened or added, and entries on the events of the last years or decades belonged to the chronicler. The scholar determined several tens of svods.\n\nChroniclers were mainly churchmen. Old Russian Chronicles were composed in monasteries, at the princely (see: knyaz) courts (later at the tsar's courts) and in the offices of Metropolitan. Chronicles often contradicted each other on estimation of events and in factual basis. Chronicles were a set of annual entries, that is messages about the events which happened in each year. Mostly there were short factual entries, but sometimes chronicler used literary form of the narrative on the most significant events of Russian history. In annual entries, chronicler often included addresses and dialogues of princes, literary phrases: stable speech formulas, epithets, rhetorical figures and others.\n\nAleksey Shakhmatov was the largest expert in textology of Old Russian Сhronicles, and he considered that the main part of сhronicle texts were \"svods\", that is collections of separate records from different sources, and every new сhronicle was a svod of some previous сhronicles and new historical records However, in recent studies, besides svods, considerable part of chronicle text is admitted as annual records, which were regularly being conducted at certain state or church office - as West European annals. For example, hypothetical \"Novrorod Archbishop Сhronicle\" was being conducted at the office of Novgorod archdiocese from 12th to 14th centuries and was main basis of Novgorod First Chronicle of 15th century.\n\nSources for the oldest chronicles, including Primary Chronicle, were Byzantine and South Slavic texts (on sacred history and other subjects), including Chronicle of George Hamartolos on Table of Nations (in Primary Chronicle) and some historical events, native legends, native legal documents: Rus'–Byzantine Treaties (in Primary Chronicle) and Short redaction of Russkaya Pravda (in Novgorod First Chronicle), native historical records and others.\n\nPrimary Chronicle of the beginning of the 12th century is the oldest survived Russian chronicle, narrating the earliest history of Rus'. However Shakhmatov paid attention on abundance of entries of 11th century about Novgorod, which are read in Novgorod First Chronicle (of the 15th century), but absent in Primary Chronicle. This and some others textual facts were a base for his theory on the beginning of Novgorod First Chronicle includes text, older than Primary Chronicle. The scholar named it \"Primary Svod\" (Collection) and dated as the end of 11th century. This svod was also a basis for Primary Chronicle. If two or more сhronicle coincide with each other up to a certain year, one сhronicle copied from another (this is rarely) or this сhronicles had a common source, arrived to this year - older svod. Shakhmatov discovered and developed a method of study on chronicle (svod) genealogy. Rested on deep textual analysis, Shakhmatov built extensive genealogy of Old Russian Chronicles. He connected most of this chronicles and created genealogy table, in which extant chronicles of 14th-17th centuries went back not only to \"Primary Svod\", but also to earlier hypothetical svods of 11th century and even to historical records of the end of 10th century. Shakhmatov's method and theories began a mainstream in Russian Chronicle studies.\n\nAccording to scholars who are the followers of Shakhmatov, Russian Chronicles were systematically being conducted since the middle of the 11th century. There were two centers of Russian Chronicle conduct in the early period: Kiev (the capital of early Rus') and Novgorod. A result of Kievan and Novgorodian chronicle records of 11th century was Primary Chronicle (of the beginning of the 12th century), and also text containing in Novgorod First Chronicle. Primary Chronicle survives in Laurentian and Hypatian chronicles (codices). This two centers, South and North, were remaining later. Chronicles of South Russian princedoms (knyazhestva) of 12th-13th centuries survives in Hypatian Chronicle: hypothetical \"Kievan Chronicle\", chosen from Hypatian Chronicle, was a continuation of Primary Chronicle and covered events from 1118 to 1200; Galician–Volhynian Chronicle, also containing in Hypatian Chronicle, covered events in Galician and Volhynian princedoms from 1201 to 1292. Chronicles of Rostov, Vladimir and Pereyaslavl of Suzdal of the end of 12th - the beginning of the 13th century better remained in Laurentian, Radziwill chronicles (codices) and Chronicler of Pereyaslavl of Suzdal.\n\nHypatian Chronicle of the end of the 13th - the beginning of the 14th centuries is an All-Russian svod in south redaction (presumedly). It survives in сopies of 15th-18th centuries. Laurentian Chronicle of 14th century is a svod from North-East Rus' (Vladimir-Suzdal). One copy of 1377.\n\n\"Tverian svod\" of 1375 reflected in Rogozhskiy Chronicler and Tverian Collection of 16th century. Chronicle svod, related with Cyprian, Metropolitan of Moscow, was continued up to 1408 and survived in Troitskaya (\"Trinity\") Chronicle, which burnt in 1812 Fire of Moscow. It was reconstructed by Mikhail Prisyolkov. Chronicle svod was made in Tver about 1412, it reflected additional revision (similar to Troitskaya Chronicle) of All-Russian svod of the end of the 14th - the beginning of the 15th century. This \"Tverian svod\" reflected in Simeon Chronicle and Rogozhskiy Chronicler. \"Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod\" of the 1430s (or \"Svod of 1448\" according to Shakhmatov) was compiled at office of Moscow Metropolitan and united All-Russian and Novgorodian chronicles. The svod was preserved in Sofia First and Novgorod Fourth chronicles.\n\nFirst known Moscow grand princely appeared at the middle of the 15th century. \"Chronicle Svod of 1472\" reflected in Vologda-Perm and Nicanor chronicles. Basis of \"Svod of 1472\" was \"Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod\", edited by Moscow grand princely chronicler, who brought censorship, excluded in particular the mentions of Novgorodian liberty, because Novgorod State was joint to Moscow Grand Princedom. In the end of the 1470s, \"Novgorodsko-Sofiysky Svod\", the svod similar to Troitskaya Chronicle and other sources was compiled together. This compilation was censored even more than \"Svod of 1472\". The \"Compilation of the 1470s\" reflected in \"Moscow Grand Princely Svod of 1479\", surviving in copy of 18th century, and in its later redaction was continued up to 1492. This \"Svod of 1479\" underlied all of official сhronicles of the end of the 15th - the 16th centuries. The compilation of the 1470s also reflected in the first part of Yermolin Chronicle. The \"Svod of Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery\" contained text, independent of Moscow Grand Princedom. This svod reflected in the second part of Yermolin Chronicle and in so-called Abridged Chronicle Svods of the end of the 15th century. \"Rostov Archbishop Svod\" of the 1480s reflected in Typographical Chronicle. Another \"Chronicle Svod of 1480s\", made in unofficial church sphere, reflected in \"Svod of 1518\", which in turn reflected in Sofia Second Chronicle and Lvov Chronicle. Ioasaf Chronicle was made the end of the 1520s at office of Moscow Metropolitan. It covered events of 1437-1520. In the same years, the first redaction of Nikon Chronicle. Immediate source of Nikon Chronicle was Ioasaf Chronicle. Nikon Chronicle was the largest Russian Chronicle. Voskresenskaya (\"Resurrection\") Chronicle was another extensive chronicle, it was made between 1542-1544. In the second half of the 1550s, in the reign of Ivan the Terrible, initial redaction of Nikon Chronicle was united with passages from Voskresenskaya Chronicle and Chronicler of the Beginning of Tsardom - chronicle of events of 1533-1552, i.e. the beginning of Ivan's reign (as grand prince, and since 1547 as tsar). In 1568—1576, also in the reign of Ivan the Terrible, multivolume Illustrated Chronicle Svod. This svods was the last All-Russian Chronicles, they give place to another form of historiographical texts — chronographs. Chronicles of 17th-18th centuries were local, provincial texts, like Siberian Chronicles of the late 16th - 18th centuries.\n\nDevelopment of Old Russian Chronicles were Lithuanian Chronicles of 15th - 16th centuries and Ukrainian Chronicles of 17th - 18th centuries.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13424899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13424899", "title": "Pace memorandum", "text": "Pace memorandum\n\nThe Pace memorandum was a 1990 memorandum written by Glenn L. Pace, a general authority in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), describing to a committee of the church the complaints of sixty members of the church that claimed they had been subjected to satanic ritual abuse (SRA) by family members and other members of the church. The state of Utah conducted a 30-month investigation of the claims after the Pace memorandum was leaked to the press in 1991, concluding that there was no evidence found to substantiate the testimony of the alleged victims.\n\nThe SRA moral panic began in the 1980s as children in the United States, subjected to coercive interviewing techniques at the hands of zealous social workers, made unsubstantiated allegations of bizarre Satanic rituals and horrific sexual and physical abuse at the hands of day care workers. As the decade unfolded, clients of believing therapists began to make similar allegations, which are now generally seen as confabulations caused by iatrogenic therapeutic techniques such as hypnosis and automatic writing rather than the discovery of repressed memories. Despite the similarities between the allegations of adults and children, investigations produced only circumstantial, and in many cases contradictory evidence of the patients' disclosures. The court cases surrounding SRA allegations (such as the iconic McMartin preschool trial) were among the most expensive and lengthy in history and produced no convictions or convictions based solely on the testimony of children that were frequently overturned or dismissed upon appeal. The panic subsided in the late 1990s, but in the early 1990s while it was still a substantial concern, adherents in the LDS Church began telling leaders of the church that they had been subjected to SRA by their relatives—often parents—and other members of the church.\n\nIn July 1990, Pace, who at the time was a member of the church's presiding bishopric, fulfilled a request by the church's Strengthening Church Members Committee by writing a memorandum about his investigations into alleged incidents of SRA among Latter-day Saints in Utah, Idaho, California, Mexico, and elsewhere. The memorandum was leaked to the press in October 1991. In his memo, Pace stated that he had met with sixty victims who had recovered memories of ritualistic abuse during their childhood. Pace reported that children were being \"instructed in satanic doctrine\" and that as eight-year-olds they were \"baptized by blood into the satanic order which is meant to cancel out their baptism into the Church\". Forty-five of Pace's witnesses claimed to have witnessed or participated in human sacrifice, including the killing of babies. Pace said that the alleged perpetrators included \"Young Women leaders, Young Men leaders, bishops, a patriarch, a stake president, temple workers, and members of the Tabernacle Choir\" and that some of the abuse took place in church meetinghouses. Pace wrote that \"when sixty witnesses testify to the same type of torture and murder, it becomes impossible for me, personally, not to believe them.\"\n\nPace compared these allegations to stories in LDS Church scriptures about secret combinations and Cain's combination with Satan to become Master Mahan. Pace also suggested that the alleged abusers were using and corrupting the oaths in the church's temple endowment ceremony as part of the Satanic abuse, and that many victims had flashbacks when they attended the temple for the first time and were asked to participate in the ceremonies.\n\nIn 1991, the Utah State Legislature appropriated $250,000 for the Attorney General's office to investigate the RSA allegations in the state of Utah. Over a two and one half year span the investigators interviewed hundreds of alleged victims, but none of the incidents reported were corroborated with any evidence beyond their testimony and the 1995 report stated that there was no evidence from any of the alleged victims that would warrant an investigation of homicide. Mike King, the coauthor of the report, told news media that the specific accusations against church leaders were \"absurd\", and Jerry Lazar, the head of psychiatry at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, said he \"has never been able to independently verify memories of satanic ritual abuse\".\n\nThe LDS Church has made no official statement related to the allegations related in the Pace memorandum. However, one commentator has suggested that apostle Richard G. Scott's sermon in the April 1992 general conference of the church may have been related to the SRA allegations. In his remarks, Scott warned Latter-day Saints:\n\nI caution you not to participate in ... improper therapeutic practices that may cause you more harm than good. ... Detailed leading questions that probe your past may unwittingly trigger thoughts that are more imagination or fantasy than reality. They could lead to condemnation of another for acts that were not committed. While likely few in number, I know of cases where such therapy has caused great injustice to the innocent from unwittingly stimulated accusations that were later proven false. Memory, particularly adult memory of childhood experiences, is fallible. Remember, false accusation is also a sin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56739900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56739900", "title": "Parable of the Polygons", "text": "Parable of the Polygons\n\nParable of the Polygons is a 2014 interactive blog post created by Vi Hart and game developer Nicky Case. The article focuses on a society of blue squares and yellow triangles which have slight personal biases against diversity, which leads to social segregation. It is based on game theorist Thomas Schelling's papers about residential segregation. The article was well-received, especially its visual and playable aspects, and was called a useful educational tool for topics like racial segregation.\n\nThe article is an interactive blog post, \"part story and part game\". It has a model consisting of a society of blue squares and yellow triangles, presented in a grid. At the top of the article, a crowd of triangles and squares are wiggling. Just under, it says, \"This is a story of how harmless choices can make a harmful world.\" The article first demonstrates step-by-step how institutional bias can occur even when there is little personal bias against diversity, and individuals are well-intentioned. The article describes the squares and triangles as \"slightly shapist\". In the first example, a square or triangle is happy only if at least a third of its neighbors are of the same shape as it is. The shapes merely adopt a meh face in a homogeneous neighborhood. \n\nAt this point, the article lets the reader interact with the model. The reader's goal is to make all residents happy with where they live, by moving only unhappy shapes. At first, the bias is easily managed; however, as the population grows, the shapes' bias quickly leads to visually segregated areas. The article reads: \"Sometimes a neighborhood just becomes square, and it's not their fault if no triangles wanna stick around. And a triangular neighborhood would welcome a square, but they can't help it if squares ain't interested.\" \n\nThe reader can later execute automated simulations, and increase and decrease the shapes' bias. When the bias is increased, the segregation is more prominent. A subsequent iteration of the game shows that decreasing bias does not make a difference if the population started out segregated. Shapes then have to reject the default scenario of segregation in favor of seeking out the other shapes. Finally, the reader can generate new models using a sandbox. \n\nThe article departs from Schelling's work by discussing a demand for \"even the smallest bit of diversity\" which reverses residential segregation; Case said that the article teaches that such segregation is \"easily offset\" with a \"small amount of anti-bias\", even if bias is still present. The article also departs from Schelling by concluding with encouraging words on how to enact change. The article concludes with: \"If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life – that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors.\"\n\nVi Hart and Nicky Case, creator of \"Coming Out Simulator 2014\", teamed up following a talk on the lack of tech event diversity and women in STEM delivered by Hart, which convinced Case \"of the necessity of active measures\". The article applies ideas from game theorist and economist Thomas Schelling's 1978 paper \"Micromotives and Macrobehaviour\" which describes how small personal bias against diversity leads to greater segregation in the general population. It is also based on Schelling's 1971 paper \"Dynamic Models of Segregation\". \n\nCase described Schelling's model as \"perfect – simple and fun to play\"; Schelling played his own model on a chess board or graph paper with nickels and dimes, moving them one by one. Case said that he was \"fascinated with taking models/systems from the arts [and] humanities, and translating them into game models/systems\". The second part of the article was based on a \"new surprising aspect of Schelling's model\", which introduced a nonconformity bias. Case said that by playing around with variables, they found that \"just as a \"small\" bias can turn a society segregated, a \"small\" anti-bias can reverse that\". Hart said they knew that nonconformity would mix up the population, but that they were \"pleasantly surprised to see it work even [at a] very minimum level\". Case said that the article ends on an \"optimistic note\" that \"small local changes really can change institutions from the bottom-up\". Development of the article began in September 2014.\n\nThe goal of \"Parable of the Polygons\" was for readers to \"learn to demand diversity\". People are represented by abstract shapes because marking their races and genders would be \"really weird\" and \"have the unfortunate implication that [the races and genders] are binary and immutable\". A triangle was chosen because it appears in Hart's videos. The article contains few words, and the ability to move shapes is introduced \"slowly and deliberately\". Hart said that they felt that \"it was important to start with moving the shapes by hand, so that later when shapes move automatically [the reader would know] there's nothing going on behind [their] back\". The article provides readers with interactive sections governed by simple rules to help them prove the counter-intuitive results to themselves. Case said that there was \"an effort made to keep players from being scared off by the big stuff\"; thus, the article includes jokes, slang, and \"cute and friendly shapes\". Hart said that they wanted to make sure to explain systemic bias without changing the readers' \"minds\". Case said that a main message was \"[not to] take it personally\" because \"large collective bias can exist even with small individual bias\".\n\nThe article was released in December 2014; Hart noted that \"matters of systematic bias [were] even more topical [at the moment]\", and Case said, \"There's a huge gap between the racial proportions of the police force and the neighborhoods they're policing, that both reinforces and results from racial tensions.\" Case said that Schelling's models could be identified in that \"a black officer [had led] the police force one night\" amidst the Ferguson unrest. A remixed version which includes a green pentagon was made the same year and is featured at the bottom of the article. Hart described the reaction to the article as \"more positive than anything [Hart's] ever done\" and \"almost disturbingly eerie\". Case said: \"It's been surprisingly positive and polite, especially for something that touches on a touchy subject!\" Hart said that they planned to \"tweak some stuff after release\", but did not because the reception was \"so overwhelmingly positive\". Case said that the article was doing \"shockingly well\", so any fixes \"might weaken or confuse the message\" when applied.\n\nThe critical reception for the article was overwhelmingly positive. Joanna Rothkopf of \"Salon\" called the article \"an adorable and eloquent primer on issues of segregation\". \"Columbia Journalism Review\" Chava Gourarie described the article as \"a cute, engaging, playable explanation\". Aatish Bhatia of \"Wired\" described the design and characters as \"charming\" and \"delightfully animated\".\n\nThe playable aspect of the article received praise. \"Kill Screen\" Jess Joho wrote, \"\"Parable of the Polygons\" asks you to tackle Schelling's concepts in a way only a game could.\"\nBhatia called the article \"a truly interactive way of communicating an idea\".\nJesse Singal of \"The Cut\" called the article \"a really well-done use of the web\".\n\nSingal noted the article's parallels to human behavior.\nBhatia said that the article delivers an \"effective, lucid and very relevant\" lesson on real-world segregation, race and equality.\nLaura Moss of \"Mother Nature Network\" said that it \"accurately illustrates racially segregated neighborhoods\", and noted that the article illustrates \"Schelling's three major findings\": the effect of slight individual bias, the starting game state and the reluctancy to become more diverse, and the necessity of intervention \"in creating and maintaining diversity\".\nJoho said that \"demonstrating a difficult reality while still maintaining a sense of actionable hope\" was the article's \"greatest achievement by far\".\n\n\"Gamasutra\" Phill Cameron praised the article for using triangles and squares and effectively dissociating itself from \"the prejudices of real life\".\nBhatia said that the article does not get \"embroiled in a heated political debate\".\nJoho wrote that the article is \"careful not to throw blame around\", and that it constantly emphasizes that personal biases might be \"unexamined, unintentional, or even unconscious\".\n\"The Washington Post\" Ana Swanson said that the call to action is a \"powerful\" message.\n\"Polygon\" Megan Farokhmanesh wrote, \"Half game, half informational post, \"Parable of the Polygons\" wants to encourage people to talk about topics like racism and sexism in healthy, constructive ways.\"\n\nAmanda Montañez wrote in a \"Scientific American\" blog that the shapes assume that \"their individual preference for diversity is sufficient to propel their society toward integration\", but that \"the social system in which they operate prohibits it\". Montañez said that \"true progress requires a more active, dramatic shift than expected\" and that, in the article, \"the complacent squares and triangles must abandon their preconceptions about the nature of 'shapism' and adopt a new, activist stance on integration\". Montañez compared the idea of using two-dimensional geometric shapes to represent people to the 1884 illustrated novella \"Flatland\" by Edwin Abbott Abbott.\n\n"}
{"id": "8877314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8877314", "title": "Persianization", "text": "Persianization\n\nPersianisation or persification is a sociological process of cultural change in which something becomes \"Persianate\". It is a specific form of cultural assimilation that often includes language assimilation. The term applies not only to cultures but also to individuals, as they acclimate to Persian culture and become \"persianised\" or \"persified\".\n\nHistorically, the term was commonly applied to changes in the culture of non-Iranian peoples living within the Iranian cultural sphere, especially during the early and the middle Islamic periods such as Arabs, and various Caucasian (such as Georgian, Armenian, and Dagestani) and Turkic peoples including the Seljuqs, Ottomans and Ghaznavids. The term has also been applied to the transmission of aspects of Persian culture, including language, to the non-Persian peoples in area surrounding Persia (modern-day Iran), such as Anatolia and South Asia.\n\nUnlike the Ancient Greeks and the Roman Empire, the ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire was not concerned with spreading its culture to the many peoples that it conquered. Arguably, the first recorded episode of persianization dates back to Alexander the Great, who, after conquering the Persian Empire in the 4th century BCE, adopted Persian dress, customs and court mannerisms; married a Persian princess, Stateira II and made subjects cast themselves on their faces when approaching him, in Persian-style, known to Greeks as the custom of proskynesis, a symbolic kissing of the hand that Persians paid to their social superiors. Persian dress and practices were also observed by Peucestas, who was later made satrap of Persis, where he conciliated the favour of the Persians to his rule in exchange for those of the Macedonians.\n\nAfter the fall of the Sasanian dynasty in 651, the Umayyad Arabs adopted many of the Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were either persianized Arameans or ethnic Persians; certainly, Persian remained the language of official business of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the 7th century, when, in 692, minting began at the caliphal capital, Damascus. The new Islamic coins evolved from imitations of Sasanian and Byzantine coins, and the Pahlavi script on the coinage was replaced with Arabic.\n\nThe Abbasids, after 750, established their capital in what is now Iraq, eventually at Baghdad. A shift in orientation toward the east is discernible, which was encouraged by increased receptiveness to Persian cultural influence and the roots of the Abbasid revolution in Khorasan, now in Afghanistan A proverb complained about the Persianization of morals by Turks.\n\nTwo major powers in West Asia rose, the Persian Safavids and Ottoman Turks. The Safavids reasserted Persian culture and hegemony over Caucasus, Eastern Anatolia, Mesopotamia and other regions. Many khans, begs and other rulers adopted Persian customs and clothing and patronized Persian culture. They founded the city of Derbent in the North Caucasus (now in Dagestan, Russia). Many ethnic peoples adopted many aspects of Persian culture and contributed to their persianization.\n\nAt the same time, the Ottomans and their predecessors, the various Beylerbergs and the Sultanate of Rum, patronized so heavily of Persian culture that they became fully Persianate. The Ottomans, for example, adopted Persian names; made Persian an official and prestigious language; adopted Persian titles; adopted Persian cuisine, dances, and literature and added many Persian words to their own language.\n\nIn modern times, the term is often used in connection with non-Persian speakers like the Azeri and the Kurds.\n\nIt has been argued that modern Iranian nationalism was established during the Pahlavi era and was based on the aim of forming a modern nation-state. What is often neglected is that Iranian nationalism has its roots before the Pahlavi, in the early 20th century. On the eve of World War I, Pan-Turkist propaganda focused on the Turkic-speaking lands of Iran, the Caucasus and Central Asia. The ultimate purpose of persuading these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and to join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azerbaijanis, which contrary to Pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azerbaijani intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran. After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies emanating from modern Turkey and threatening Iran’s territorial integrity. It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others. Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azerbaijanis. They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and modern state. Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations. The adoptions of this integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group’s cultural nationalism.\n\nAccording to Tadeusz Swietochowski, in 1930s, the term was used to describe the official policy pursued by Reza Shah Pahlavi to assimilate the ethnic minorities in Iran (Iranians as well as Non-Iranians). In particular, within this policy the Azerbaijani language was banned for use on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies and in the publication of books. Swietochowski writes:\n\nThe Mughal Empire was an Islamic imperial power that ruled a large portion of the Indian Subcontinent and Afghanistan in South Asia. From 1526, the Moguls invaded the Indian Subcontinent, from their initial base in Kabul, and they eventually ruled most of Hindustan (South Asia) by the late 17th and the early 18th centuries until the mid-19th century. The emperors were descendants of the Timurids who had embraced Persian culture, converted to Islam and resided in Turkestan, and they were the ones responsible for the spread of Persian and Islamic culture to Central Asia. At the height of their power around 1700, they controlled most of the Indian Subcontinent and Afghanistan and spread Persian culture throughout, just as their predecessors the Turkic Ghaznavids and the Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate had done. In general, from its earliest days, Persian culture and language was spread in South Asia by various Persianised Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties.\n\nBabur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, identified his lineage as Timurid and Chaghatay-Turkic, and his origin, milieu, training and culture were Persian culture. He was largely responsible for the fostering of the culture by his descendants and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian Subcontinent (and Afghanistan), with brilliant literary, artistic and historiographical results. Many works of art such as the Taj Mahal, Humayun's Tomb and the Badshahi Mosque are of Persian Islamic architecture, with Persian names. Persian was the official language of the Mughal courts, until replaced with Urdu by the British.\n\nAfghanistan's persianization can be demonstrated in several aspects since it occurred as early as its foundation in 1747 as Persian customs, particularly the use of the Dari language, was brought into the country by the Durrani mercenaries after their sojourn in Iran. The Afghan royal family was also considered persianized Pashtuns so that by the twentieth century they hardly spoke Pashto and this indicates that at least for the elite and bureaucracy, the Persian culture and language were deeply entrenched. By 1964, the Afghanistan Constitution cited Dari as one of its two official languages alongside Pashto. Although the latter is the designated national language, Dari remains the \"lingua franca\". \n\nThere are modern initiatives that attempt to \"Pashto-ize\" all governmental communication. Since Dari is the language of the bureaucracy, Persian-speaking Afghans dominated it. Persianization is especially seen in the case of the \"Kabulis\", the long-established families from Kabul (usually Pashtuns completely immersed in Persian culture).\n\nPersianization is also reinforced by the incidence of urbanization in the country, which influenced the characteristics of the Afghan ethnic groups. The two most significant ethnic groups in Afghanistan are the Pashtuns, who are speakers of the Pashto language, and the Tajiks, who are Persian speaking agriculturalists and townspeople. While Pashtuns dominated the country since they constitute the majority of the Afghan population, Persian culture still permeated. In the early history of Afghanistan as an independent country, many Pashtuns moved into urbanized areas and adopted Dari as their language. As a result, many ethnic Pashtuns in Afghanistan identify themselves as Tajiks but still have Pashtun names (such as a last name with the suffix \"-zai\") simply because they speak Dari and are assimilated into Tajiki culture in the country within a process known as \"de-tribalization\". An account cited, for instance, that Mohammad Naim, the Afghan foreign minister during the 1950s, was unable to reply when - in a visit to Pakistan - Pakistan's Yaqob Khan spoke with him in Pashto. \n\nIn Pakistan, a similar pattern occurs with urbanization, when Pashtuns assimilate into the country's national Urdu-speaking culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "9484485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9484485", "title": "Pluralism (political theory)", "text": "Pluralism (political theory)\n\nClassical pluralism is the view that politics and decision making are located mostly in the framework of government, but that many non-governmental groups use their resources to exert influence. The central question for classical pluralism is how power and influence are distributed in a political process. Groups of individuals try to maximize their interests. Lines of conflict are multiple and shifting as power is a continuous bargaining process between competing groups. There may be inequalities but they tend to be distributed and evened out by the various forms and distributions of resources throughout a population. Any change under this view will be slow and incremental, as groups have different interests and may act as \"veto groups\" to destroy legislation. The existence of diverse and competing interests is the basis for a democratic equilibrium, and is crucial for the obtaining of goals by individuals. A polyarchy—a situation of open competition for electoral support within a significant part of the adult population—ensures competition of group interests and relative equality. Pluralists stress civil rights, such as freedom of expression and organization, and an electoral system with at least two parties. On the other hand, since the participants in this process constitute only a tiny fraction of the populace, the public acts mainly as bystanders. This is not necessarily undesirable for two reasons: (1) it may be representative of a population content with the political happenings, or (2) political issues require continuous and expert attention, which the average citizen may not have.\n\nImportant theorists of pluralism include Robert A. Dahl (who wrote the seminal pluralist work, \"Who Governs?\"), David Truman, and Seymour Martin Lipset.\n\nThe list of possible sources of power is virtually endless: legal authority, money, prestige, skill, knowledge, charisma, legitimacy, free time, and experience. Pluralists also stress the differences between potential and actual power as it stands. Actual power means the ability to compel someone to do something and is the view of power as a causation. Dahl describes power as a \"realistic relationship, such as A's capacity for acting in such a manner as to control B's responses\" [\"A Preface to Democratic Theory\"]. Potential power refers to the possibility of turning resources into actual power. Cash, one of many resources, is only a stack of bills until it is put to work. Malcolm X, for example, was certainly not a rich person growing up, but received money from many groups after his prison term and used other resources such as his forceful personality and organizational skills. He had a greater impact on American politics than most wealthy people. A particular resource like money cannot automatically be equated with power because the resource can be used skillfully or clumsily, fully or partially, or not at all.\n\nThe pluralist approach to the study of power, states that nothing categorical about power can be assumed in any community. The question then is not who runs a community, but if any group in fact does. To determine this, pluralists study specific outcomes. The reason for this is that they believe human behavior is governed in large part by inertia. That said, actual involvement in overt activity is a more valid marker of leadership than simply a reputation. Pluralists also believe that there is no one particular issue or point in time at which any group must assert itself to stay true to its own expressed values, but rather that there are a variety of issues and points at which this is possible. There are also costs involved in taking action at all not only losing, but expenditure of time and effort. While a structuralist may argue that power distributions have a rather permanent nature, this rationale says that power may in fact be tied to issues, which vary widely in duration. Also, instead of focusing on actors within a system, the emphasis is on the leadership roles itself. By studying these, it can be determined to what extent there is a power structure present in a society.\n\nThree of the major tenets of the pluralist school are (1) resources and hence potential power are widely scattered throughout society; (2) at least some resources are available to nearly everyone; and (3) at any time the amount of potential power exceeds the amount of actual power.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most important, no one is all-powerful unless proven so through empirical observation. An individual or group that is influential in one realm may be weak in another. Large military contractors certainly throw their weight around on defense matters, but how much sway do they have on agricultural or health policies? A measure of power, therefore, is its scope, or the range of areas where it is successfully applied as observed by a researcher. Pluralists believe that with few exceptions power holders usually have a relatively limited scope of influence. Pluralism does leave room for an elitist situation- Should a group A continuously exert power over multiple groups. For a pluralist to accept this notion, it must be empirically observed and not assumed so by definition.\n\nFor all these reasons power cannot be taken for granted. One has to observe it empirically in order to know who really governs. The best way to do this, pluralists believe, is to examine a wide range of specific decisions, noting who took which side and who ultimately won and lost. Only by keeping score on a variety of controversies can one begin to identify actual power holders. Pluralism was associated with behavioralism.\n\nA contradiction to pluralist power is often cited from the origin of one's power. Although certain groups may share power, people within those groups set agendas, decide issues, and take on leadership roles through their own qualities. Some theorists argue that these qualities cannot be transferred, thus creating a system where elitism still exists. What this theory fails to take into account is the prospect of overcoming these qualities by garnering support from other groups. By aggregating power with other organizations, interest groups can over-power these non-transferable qualities. In this sense, political pluralism still applies to these aspects.\n\nElite pluralists agree with classical pluralists that there is \"plurality\" of power; however, this plurality is not \"pure\" as some people and groups have more power than others. For example, some people have more money than others, so they can pay to have their opinion put across better (i.e. more advertising) than the working class can. This inequality is because society has \"elites\"; people who have more power, perhaps through money, inheritance or social tradition than others.\n\nBasically, it claims that elites play a big role in decision making. The idea behind reads as follow: in democracies the people participate in electing the elites who will represent them and, at the end, the ones who are going to make the laws. As Davita S. Glasberg and Deric Shannon highlights, \"political elites are not a monoholitic, unified interest group representing their own narrow group of interests but rather are diverse, competitive elites representing a wide range of interests\". They have to compete in \"the political market place\" in order to gain voters being the power equally distributed between all the potential voters. Moreover, the stability in the system is achieved through this competition among the elites, as they have to negotiate in order to pass a bill. And, sometimes, they have to change their positions and points of view in order to reach a common point. Elites respect and follow the policy-making procedures because they are accountable of their acts and they can be replaced through legal procedures of through new elections.\n\nWhile Pluralism as a political theory of the state and policy formation gained its most traction during the 1950s and 1960s in America, some scholars argued that the theory was too simplistic (see Connolly (1969) \"The Challenge to Pluralist Theory\") leading to the formulation of neo-pluralism. Views differed about the division of power in democratic society. Although neo-pluralism sees multiple pressure groups competing over political influence, the political agenda is biased towards corporate power. Neo-pluralism no longer sees the state as an umpire mediating and adjudicating between the demands of different interest groups, but as a relatively autonomous actor (with different departments) that forges and looks after its own (sectional) interests. Constitutional rules, which in pluralism are embedded in a supportive political culture, should be seen in the context of a diverse, and not necessarily supportive, political culture and a system of radically uneven economic sources. This diverse culture exists because of an uneven distribution of socioeconomic power. This creates possibilities for some groups while limiting others in their political options.\nIn the international realm, order is distorted by powerful multinational interests and dominant states, while in classical pluralism emphasis is put on stability by a framework of pluralist rules and free market society.\n\nThere are two significant theoretical critiques on pluralism: Corporatism and Neo-Marxism.\n\nCharles E. Lindblom, who is seen as positing a strong neo-pluralist argument, still attributed primacy to the competition between interest groups in the policy process but recognized the disproportionate influence business interests have in the policy process.\n\nClassical pluralism was criticized as it did not seem to apply to Westminster-style democracies or the European context. This led to the development of corporatist theories. Corporatism is the idea that a few select interest groups are actually (often formally) involved in the policy formulation process, to the exclusion of the myriad other 'interest groups'. For example, trade unions and major sectoral business associations are often consulted about (if not the drivers of) specific policies.\n\nThese policies often concern tripartite relations between workers, employers and the state, with a coordinating role for the latter. The state constructs a framework in which it can address the political and economic issues with these organized and centralized groups. In this view, parliament and party politics lose influence in the policy forming process.\n\nFrom the political aspect, 'pluralism' has a huge effect on the process and decision-making in formulating policy. In international security, during the policy making process, different parties may have a chance to take part in decision making. The one who has more power, the more opportunity that it gains and the higher possibility to get what it wants. According to M. Frances (1991), \"decision making appears to be a maze of influence and power.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4598910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4598910", "title": "SANU Memorandum", "text": "SANU Memorandum\n\nThe Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, known simply as the SANU Memorandum (), was a draft document produced by a 16-member committee of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) from 1985 to 1986. Excerpts of the draft were leaked, published by daily \"Večernje novosti\" in September 1986.\n\nThe memo immediately captured the public's attention in Yugoslavia as it gave voice to controversial views on the state of the nation and argued for a fundamental reorganization of the state. The main theme was decentralisation leading to the disintegration of Yugoslavia and that the Serbs were discriminated against by Yugoslavia's constitutional structure. It claimed that Serbia's development was eroded by support to other parts of Yugoslavia. It was officially denounced in 1986 by the government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the government of the Socialist Republic of Serbia for inciting nationalism. Some consider its publication to be a key moment in the breakup of Yugoslavia and a contributor to the Yugoslav wars.\n\nIn the 1980s, a major issue in Yugoslavia was the problem of massive debts occurred in the 1970s and the resulting policies of austerity. Yugoslavia had debts initially valued at $6 billion US dollars, but which turned out to actually be a sum equal to $21 billion U.S. dollars, a staggering debt load for a poor country. The high debt load led to repeated programmes of austerity in the 1980s imposed by the IMF, and which in turn led to the exposure of so much corruption of the part of the Communist authorities to the extent of causing a crisis of faith in the Communist system by the mid-1980s. The revelation that corruption was systematic in Yugoslavia and that the Communist elites were plundering the public coffers to support luxurious lifestyles for themselves well beyond the means of ordinary people sparked much resentment, especially at a time of austerity. The fact that it was the Communist elites who had run up the debts in the 1970s that led to the austerity policies imposed in the 1980s not only made them unpopular, but also created grave doubts about the basic competence of the elites to govern the country. Making the economic crisis more difficult was the fact that Croatia and Slovenia were more wealthier than Serbia, and objected to transferring their wealth to support Serbia in times of austerity.\n\nIn May 1985, after Stambolić urged the government to discuss Kosovo for the first time since 1981, SANU selected a committee of sixteen distinguished academics to draft a memorandum addressing causes for the economic- and political crisis and how to tackle the problems. It was planned to be endorsed by the academy prior to being presented to the Communist Party and state organs. The last draft, however, was leaked to a regime tabloid, the Serbian newspaper \"Večernje novosti\" in September 1986. The newspaper attacked it, describing it as reactionary and nationalist, but did not publish it. An official campaign by the Serbian state and party officials began against it.\n\nThe memo is divided into two parts: one on the \"Crisis in the Yugoslav Economy and Society\", the other on the \"Status of Serbia and the Serb Nation\". The first section focuses on the economic and political fragmentation of Yugoslavia that followed the promulgation of the 1974 constitution. The memo argued that because Marshal Josip Broz Tito was a Croat that he had designed the Yugoslav federation in such a way to unduly balance the entire economic and political system in favor of his native Croatia together with Slovenia. In this way, the memo claimed that the burden of austerity policies imposed by the IMF fell almost entirely on the Serbs while at the same time allowing Croatia and Slovenia to keep too much of their wealth to themselves. The second section focuses on what the authors saw as Serbia's inferior status in Yugoslavia, while describing status of Serbs in the province of Kosovo and in Croatia in such a way to make its point. The memo argued that because the provincial authorities in both Kosovo and Vojvodina could deal directly with the federal government, that this had made them into de facto republics outside of the control of the Serbian socialist republic. Since March 1981, there had been regular riots in Kosovo between the ethnic Albanian majority and its Serb minority, which in turn had been caused by competition for jobs in a time of austerity as the university system produced far more graduates than what there were jobs for. The memo written before the worse of the rioting in Kosovo between 1987-1990 claimed that the other republics, especially Croatia, were supporting the Albanian provincial government in Kosovo as part of a plot to force out the Serb minority. Kosta Mihailović made contributions on the economy, Mihailo Marković on self-management, and Vasilije Krestić on the status of the Serbs of Croatia.\n\nThe memo claimed that at the end of World War II, Josip Broz Tito deliberately weakened Serbia by dividing up the majority of Serbian territory, namely present day Serbia, Montenegro, the Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Croatia with Serb majority populations. The memo argued that Tito further weakened the Socialist Republic of Serbia by dividing its territory and creating the autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, which was not reciprocated in the other Yugoslav republics. A major theme of the memo was that of alleged Serbian victimization at the hands of the other republics, who were portrayed as having profited at Serbia's expense. The authors of the memo wrote that it was time to \"...remove this historical guilt off of the Serbian people and to refute officially the claims that they had an economically privileged position between the two wars and that there would be no denying of their liberating role throughout history and their contribution in the creation of Yugoslavia...The Serbs in their history have never conquered or exploited others. Through the two world wars, they liberated themselves, and when they could, help others to liberate themselves\".\n\nThe theme of alleged Serb victimization at the hands of others was at least in part a response to the economic crisis of the 1980s to suggest that the burden of austerity should fall mostly on the other republics, but the most powerful consequence was that for the first time since 1945 a historical narrative had been aired which portrayed the Serbs as a uniquely and innately virtuous and honorable people who were the perpetual victims of others. The British historian Richard Crampton wrote the real significance of the memo was it for the first time openly stated what many ordinary Serbian people had been thinking and that because of the intellectual prestige of its authors conferred a sort of pseudo-scientific legitimacy on the widespread feelings that it was the Serbs who were being unjustly singled out by the policies of economic austerity. At a time of widespread economic pain and suffering, the message of the memo that the Serbs were being forced unjustly to suffer more than they should have been was very popular. The message of the memo that the solution to the economic crisis of the 1980s was for the Serbs to aggressively reassert their interests in Yugoslavia, abolish the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina, and bring the \"prečani\" Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia into Serbia led to much alarm with the other peoples of Yugoslavia who saw the memo as a call for Serbian domination of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Austrian scholar Doris Gödl wrote this theme in the memo of Serbs as perpetual victims strongly suggested that they could do no wrong and everything that had gone wrong in Yugoslavia was the work of others. Gödl wrote that though the memo was true in the sense that the Serbs at times had indeed been victimized, the picture of history presented in the memo of continuous Serb victimization from the times of the Ottoman Empire to the present was extremely one-sided and distorted, ignoring the fact that the Serbs at times had victimized the other peoples of Yugoslavia. Gödl concluded this version of history which portrayed the other peoples of Yugoslavia, especially the Croats, as perpetual aggressors and the Serbs as constant victims did much to fuel the nationalism that Slobodan Milošević tapped into starting in 1987.\n\nThe memo was denounced by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, including Slobodan Milošević, the future president of Serbia, who publicly called the memo \"nothing else but the darkest nationalism\", and Radovan Karadžić, the future leader of Serbs in Bosnia, who stated \"Bolshevism is bad, but nationalism is even worse\". Despite these declarations, Milošević, Karadžić, and other Serb politicians publicly agreed with most of the memo and would form close political connections with the writers of the memo such as Mihailo Marković, who became the vice-president of the Socialist Party of Serbia and Dobrica Ćosić who was appointed president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992. Starting in 1987, Milošević, the party boss of the Serbian Communist Party, started to cynically appeal to Serbian nationalism to distract public attention from the extent of massive corruption within the Communist Party, a gambit that worked very well. However, Milošević's appeal to Serb nationalism, which however successful it was in distracting the attention of ordinary Serbs away from corruption and the debt crisis, inevitably sparked fears in the other republics that he was attempting a power play to make Yugoslavia into a Serb-dominated nation. Milošević's decision to end the autonomy for Kosovo in 1989 and his deployment of ethnic Serbian policemen to violently crush protests by Kosovar Albanians led to secessionist feelings in the other republics who wanted out of Yugoslavia before Milošević imposed Serb domination on all of Yugoslavia. Within the other republics, it was noted that the SANU memo called for ending Kosovo's autonomy, and so the ending of Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 caused fears that Milošević would carry out the other parts of the memo, through it is not clear if that was his intention in 1989.\n\nGödl wrote that by 1989, a similar version of history to the one presented in the SANU memo was being preached in Croatia with the only difference being that the Croats were portrayed as perpetual victims and the Serbs as perpetual aggressors. Especially popular in this regard was the 1990 book \"The Drina River Martyrs\" written by an ultra-nationalist Bosnian Croat Roman Catholic priest, Father Anto Baković, which portrayed both the Chetnik and Partisan movements in World War II as extremely anti-Croat and anti-Catholic, presenting the history of Yugoslavia as one of continuous violent trauma inflicted by the Serbs against the Croats. Father Baković used what are now known within the Catholic circles as the Blessed Martyrs of Drina, a group of Bosnian Croat nuns who were victimized by the Chetniks in December 1941, as a microcosm of the \"martyrdom\" of the Croats in World War II. Gödl wrote the popularity of books like \"The Drina River Martyrs\" were at partly a response to the SANU memorandum and similar other Serb nationalist works, which by emphasizing crimes committed in the immediate post-World War II era by the Partisans was meant to cancel out the memory of \"Ustashe\" crimes which played such a central role in the Serb memory of the past. Gödl contended that by 1989 that many Serbs and Croats were both caught up in historical narratives that portrayed their own group as innately pure and virtuous and the other as innately vicious and cruel, seeing themselves as perpetual victims and the other as perpetual victimizers. Gödl wrote that it was the popularity of these narratives of perpetual victimization with both Croats and Serbs in the 1980s that portended the violent break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991-1992.\n\n\nThe commission consisted of 16 Serb intellectuals:\n\n"}

(\"Special Search List Great Britain\") was a secret list of prominent British residents to be arrested, produced in 1940 by the \"SS\" as part of the preparation for the proposed invasion of Britain codenamed \"Unternehmen Seelöwe\" (Operation Sea Lion). After the war, the list became known as The Black Book.\n\nThe information was prepared by the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) under Reinhard Heydrich. Later, SS-Oberführer Walter Schellenberg claimed in his memoirs that he had compiled the list, starting at the end of June 1940. It contained 2,820 names of people, including British nationals and European exiles, who were to be immediately arrested by \"SS\" Einsatzgruppen upon the invasion, occupation, and annexation of Great Britain to the Third Reich. Abbreviations after each name indicated whether the individual was to be detained by RSHA Amt IV (the Gestapo) or Amt VI (Ausland-SD, Foreign Intelligence).\n\nThe list was printed as a supplement or appendix to the secret \"Informationsheft G.B.\" handbook, which Schellenberg also claimed to have written. This handbook noted opportunities for looting, and named potentially dangerous anti-Nazi institutions including Masonic lodges, the Church of England and the Boy Scouts. On 17 September 1940, SS-Brigadeführer Dr Franz Six was designated to a position in London where he would implement the post-invasion arrests and actions against institutions, but on the same day, Hitler postponed the invasion indefinitely. In September 1945, at the end of the war, the list was discovered in Berlin. Reporting included the reactions of some of the people listed.\n\nThe list was similar to earlier lists prepared by the SS, such as the Special Prosecution Book-Poland () prepared before the Second World War by members of the German fifth column in cooperation with German Intelligence, and used to target the 61,000 Polish people on this list during Operation Tannenberg and Intelligenzaktion in occupied Poland between 1939 and 1941.\n\nRapid German victories led quickly to the Fall of France and British forces had to be withdrawn during the Dunkirk evacuation, with the Nazi spearhead reaching the coast on 21 May 1940. It was only then that the prospect of invading Britain was raised with Hitler, and the German high command did not issue any orders for preparations until 2 July. Eventually, on 16 July, Hitler issued his Directive no. 16 ordering preparation for invasion, codenamed Operation Sea Lion. \n\nGerman intelligence set out to provide their invading forces with encyclopaedic handbooks giving useful information. Seven maps, each covering the whole of the British Isles, covered different topographical aspects. A book provided 174 photographs, mostly aerial photography, supplemented with views cut out from newspapers and magazines. A mass of information was included in a book on \"Military-Geographical Data about England\". Only one book was marked secret, the \"Informationsheft GB\". Walter Schellenberg wrote in his memoirs that \"at the end of June 1940 I was ordered to prepare a small handbook for the invading troops and the political and administrative units that would accompany them, describing briefly the most important political, administrative and economic institutions of Great Britain and the leading public figures.\"\n\nThe \"Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.\" was an appendix or supplement to the secret handbook \"Informationsheft Grossbritannien\" (\"Informationsheft GB\") which provided information for German security services about institutions thought likely to resist the Nazis, including the private public schools, the Church of England and the Boy Scouts. A general survey of British museums and art galleries suggested opportunities for looting. The handbook described the organisation of the British police, and had a section analysing the British intelligence agencies. Following this, four pages had around 30 passport-sized photographs of individuals who also appeared in the appendix.\n\nThe appendix, of 104 pages, was a list in alphabetical order of 2,820 names, some of which were duplicated. The term \"Fahndungsliste\" translates into \"wanted list\", and \"Sonderfahndungsliste\" into \"specially\" or \"especially wanted list\". The instructions \"Sämtliche in der Sonderfahndungsliste G.B. aufgefürten Personen sind festzunehmen\" (all persons listed in the Special Wanted List G.B. are to be arrested) made this clear.\n\nBeside each name was the number of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) to which the person was to be handed over. Churchill was to be placed into the custody of Amt VI (Ausland-SD, Foreign Intelligence), but the vast majority of the people listed in the Black Book would be placed into the custody of Amt IV (Gestapo). The book had some significant errors, such as people who had died (Lytton Strachey, died in 1932) or were no longer based in the UK (Paul Robeson, moved back to the United States in 1939), and omissions (such as George Bernard Shaw, one of the few English language writers whose works were published and performed in Nazi Germany).\n\nThe dimension of the booklet is given as , and Geheim! (Secret!) is printed on the cover. The facsimile version shows the printing in red, on a pale grey-green cover, and has 376 pages.\n\nA print run of the list produced around 20,000 booklets but the warehouse in which they were stored was destroyed in a bombing raid and only two originals are known to survive. One is in the Imperial War Museum in London, and one is noted in the Hoover Institution Library and Archives.\n\nOn 14 September 1945, \"The Guardian\" reported that the booklet had been discovered in the Berlin headquarters of the Reich Security Police (Reich Main Security Office). When told the previous day that they were on the Gestapo's list, Lady Astor (\"enemy of Germany\") said \"It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called 'Cliveden Set' was pro-Fascist\", while Lord Vansittart said \"The German black-list might indicate to some of those who now find themselves on it that their views, divergent from mine, were somewhat misplaced. Perhaps it will be an eye-opener to them\", and the cartoonist David Low said \"That is all right. I had them on my list too.\"\n\nBeing included on the list was considered a mark of honour. Noël Coward recalled that, on learning of the book, Rebecca West sent him a telegram saying \"My dear—the people we should have been seen dead with.\"\n\n\n\n"}

An effort was made to make the list as diverse as possible in terms of directors, actors, countries, and genres represented.\n\nThe list also included a section on the \"10 Best Soundtracks\" of all time, as chosen by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss. \n\nAcademy Award winner A.R. Rahman's acclaimed debut album for the Tamil film Roja made it to this list, making A.R. Rahman the only debut composer to attain this distinguished honor.\n\nAccording to Richard Corliss, the list's web pages attracted a record 7.8 million page views in its first week, including 3.5 million on May 23, its opening day.\n\n\"Thousands of readers have written in to cheer or challenge our selections, and thousands more have voted for their own favorites. The response simply underscores Richard's and my long-held belief that everybody has two jobs: his own and movie critic.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "476378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476378", "title": "Völva", "text": "Völva\n\nA ' or ' (Old Norse and Icelandic, respectively; plural forms and , sometimes anglicized vala; also ' or ') is a female shaman and seer in Norse religion and a recurring motif in Norse mythology.\n\nThe were referred to by many names. Old Norse means \"wand carrier\" or \"carrier of a magic staff\", and it continues Proto-Germanic , which is derived from a word for \"wand\" (Old Norse ). \"Vala\", on the other hand, is a literary form based on .\n\nAnother name for the is (plenty of knowing) indicating she knew , and . A practitioner of is known as a \"-woman\" or a \"-man\".\n\nA or \"-woman\" (with an Old English cognate, ) is a specialised ; a \"seer, one who sees\", from the Old Norse word or referring to prophesying and which is cognate with the present English word \"spy\", continuing Proto-Germanic and the Proto-Indo-European root *\"\" (to see, to observe) and consequently related to Latin (\"I see\") and Sanskrit and (, \"to see\").\n\nVǫlur practiced seiðr, spá and galdr, practices which encompassed shamanism, sorcery, prophecy and other forms of indigenous magic associated with women. Seiðr in particular had connotations of \"ergi\" (unmanliness), a serious offense in Norse society.\n\nHistorical and mythological depictions of vǫlur show that they were held in high esteem and believed to possess such powers that even the father of the gods, Odin himself, consulted a vǫlva to learn what the future had in store for the gods. Such an account is preserved in the \"Völuspá\", which roughly translates to \"Prophecy of the Vǫlva\". In addition to the unnamed seeress (possibly identical with Heiðr) in the \"Vǫluspá\", other examples of vǫlur in Norse literature include Gróa in \"Svipdagsmál\", Þórbjǫrgr in the \"Saga of Erik the Red\" and Huld in \"Ynglinga saga\".\n\nThe vǫlur were not considered to be harmless. The goddess who was most skilled in magic was Freyja, and she was not only a goddess of love, but also a warlike divinity who caused screams of anguish, blood and death, and what Freyja performed in Asgard, the world of the gods, the vǫlur tried to perform in Midgard, the world of men. The weapon of the vǫlva was not the spear, the axe or the sword, but instead they were held to influence battles with different means, and one of them was the wand, (see the section wands and weaving, below).\n\nThe earliest descriptions of Germanic prophetesses appear in Roman accounts about the Cimbri, whose priestesses were aged women dressed in white. They sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood in order to prophesy coming events.\n\nIn his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\" (1, 50) Julius Caesar writes in the course of clashes with Germanic tribesmen under Ariovistus (58 BCE):\nTacitus also writes about prophetesses among the Germanic peoples in his \"Histories\" 4, 61 - notably a certain Veleda: \"by ancient usage the Germans attributed to many of their women prophetic powers and, as the superstition grew in strength, even actual divinity.\"\n\nJordanes relates in his \"Getica\" (XXIV:121) of Gothic \"haliurunnas\", witches who were driven into exile by King Filimer when the Goths had settled in Oium (Ukraine). The name is possibly a corruption of a Gothic \"Halju-runnos\", meaning \"hell-runners\" or \"runners to the realm of the dead\". These witches were condemned to seek refuge far away and, according to this account, engendered the Huns.\n\nThe Lombard historian Paul the Deacon, who died in Southern Italy in the 790s, wrote on how his people once had departed from southern Scandinavia. He tells of a conflict between the early Lombards and the Vandals. The latter turned to one Godan (presumably Odin), while Gambara, the mother of the two Lombard chieftains Ibor and Aio, turned to Godan's spouse Frea (presumably Freyja/Frigg). Frea helped Gambara play a trick on Odin and thanks to the Gambara's good relations with the goddess, her people won the battle.\n\nA detailed eyewitness account of a human sacrifice by what may have been a vǫlva was given by Ahmad ibn Fadlan as part of his account of a diplomatic mission to Volga Bulgaria in 921. In his description of the funeral of a Scandinavian chieftain, a slave girl volunteers to die with her master. After ten days of festivities, she is stabbed to death by an old woman (a sort of priestess who is referred to as \"Angel of Death\") and burnt together with the deceased in his boat (see Oseberg Ship).\n\nIn Norse society, a vǫlva was an elderly woman who had released herself from the strong family bonds that normally surrounded women in Norse clans. She travelled the land, usually followed by a retinue of young people, and she was summoned in times of crisis. She had immense authority and she charged well for her services.\n\nIn addition, many aristocratic Viking women wanted to serve Freyja and represent her in Midgard. They married Viking warlords who had Odin as a role model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of Valhalla. In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the einherjar, the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by Valkyries. However, the duties of the mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses were out in battle. Scholars no longer believe that these women waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the \"Darraðarljóð\".\n\nIt is difficult to draw a line between the aristocratic lady and the wandering vǫlva, but Old Norse sources present the vǫlva as more professional and she went from estate to estate selling her spiritual services. The vǫlva had greater authority than the aristocratic lady, but both were ultimately dependent on the benevolence of the warlord that they served. When they had been attached to a warlord, their authority depended on their personal competence and credibility.\n\nIn \"Flateyjarbók\", toward the end of \"Norna-Gests þáttr\", Norna-Gest states that \"spákonur traveled around the country-side and fore-told the fates of men.\"\n\nIn Landnámabók, a Volva named \"Þuríðr Sundafyllir\" gained the epithet of \"filler of inlets\" during a famine in Iceland, when she used her magic powers to fill the fjords with fish.\n\n\"The Saga of Eric the Red\" relates that the settlers in Greenland c. 1000 were suffering a time of starvation. In order to prepare for the future, the \"vǫlva Þórbjǫrgr lítilvǫlva\" (\"the little vǫlva\") was summoned. Before her arrival the whole household was thoroughly cleaned and prepared. The high seat, which was otherwise reserved for the master and his wife, was furnished with down pillows.\n\nThe vǫlva appeared in the evening, dressed in a foot-length blue or black cloak decked with gems to the hem. In her hand she wielded a wand, the symbolic distaff (\"seiðstafr\"), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In the saga of Örvar-Oddr, the seiðkona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant than the fact that it was intended to signify the otherness of the seiðkona.\n\nThe \"Saga of Eric the Red\" further relates that around her neck she wore a necklace of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of amadou from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.\n\nAs the vǫlva entered the room, she was hailed with reverence by the household, and then she was led to the high seat, where she was provided with dishes prepared only for her. She had a porridge made of goat milk and a dish made of hearts from all the kinds of animals at the homestead. She ate the dishes with a brass spoon and a knife whose point was broken off.\n\nThe vǫlva was to sleep at the farm during the night and the next day was reserved for her dance. In order to dance the seiðr, she needed special tools. First, she positioned herself on a special elevated platform and a group of young women sat down around her. The girls sang special songs intended to summon the powers that the vǫlva wished to communicate with. The session was a success because the vǫlva was permitted to see far into the future and the famine was averted.\n\nIn the prologue of the \"Prose Edda\", related by a vǫlva, the origin of Thor's wife Sif is detailed, where she is said to be a \"spákona\". Snorri contextually correlates Sif with the oracular seeress Sibyl on this basis.\n\nScandinavian archaeologists have discovered wands in about 40 female graves, and they have usually been discovered in rich graves with valuable grave offerings which shows that the vǫlvas belonged to the highest level of society.\n\nOne example is a grave in Fyrkat, Denmark which turned out to be the richest grave in the area. She had been buried in a wagon from which the wheels had been removed. She had been plainly clad in what was probably only a long dress. Around her toes, she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed. At her head, she had a Gotlandic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from Finland and Russia. At her feet, she had a box which contained her magic tools, comprising a pellet from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of Hyoscyamus niger (\"henbane\"). If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying. In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump. When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the vǫlva performed her rituals and Hlidskjalf from which Odin watched across the world.\n\nAnother notable grave was the Oseberg Ship in Norway that revealed two women who had received a sumptuous burial. One of the women was most likely a high-ranking lady who knew how to practice seiðr as she had been buried with a wand of wood. In the grave, there were also four cannabis seeds, which probably had been in the pillows that supported the corpses. Additional cannabis seeds were discovered in a small leather pouch.\n\nAround the ninth century, a vǫlva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in Östergötland, Sweden. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja's necklace, Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself, the most prominent vǫlva of them all.\n\nIn Birka, a vǫlva and a warrior were once buried together. Above them, a spear was positioned in order to dedicate the dead couple to Odin. They had probably served Freyja and Odin, two deities of war, and he had done so with his spear and she with her wand.\n\nIn theory, invisible fetters and bonds could be controlled from a loom, and if a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero. But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving. The men may have fought on the battle field in sweat and blood, but in a spiritual way, their women took part. It is not by coincidence that archaeologists find weaving tools and weapons side by side.\n\nA distaff possessed magical powers, and in the world of the gods, the Norns twined the threads of fate. In \"Helgakviða Hundingsbana I\", norns arrive at the birth of Helgi Hundingsbane and twined his fate as a hero, and it is possible that these Norns were not divine beings but vǫlur. Many of the wands that have been excavated have a basket-like shape in the top, and they are very similar to distaffs used for spinning linen. One theory for the origin of the word seiðr is \"thread spun with a distaff\", and according to this theory, practicing magic was to send out spiritual threads. Since the Norsemen believed that the Norns controlled people's fate by spinning, it is very likely that they considered individual fates to be controllable with the same method.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that women are called \"peace-weavers\" in \"Beowulf\", and since Freyja had started the first war, it was on the part of the vǫlva to decide when to start wars by practicing magic. This is probably why Harald Bluetooth, who was at war with the Holy Roman Emperor apparently kept a vǫlva at Fyrkat.\n\nThe Wife's Lament could be a poem about a peace-weaver.\n\nToday, it is generally accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testifies to such rites is a small phallic statuette that was found in Rällinge in Sweden in the early 20th century. The appearance of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother Freyr. Adam of Bremen tells of the phallic statue of Freyr in the Temple at Uppsala and of the ribald songs that were sung during the rituals. In \"Völsa þáttr\", there is an account on how a horse's penis was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.\n\nSome wands that have been excavated cannot be associated with distaffs, but instead appear to represent a phallus, and moreover the use of magic had close associations with sexuality in Old Norse society. In the \"Lokasenna\", due to his interest in seiðr, Loki is depicted accusing Odin of being \"ergi\", which suggests that he could be perceived as unmanly, cowardly and accepting the 'female' role in sexual intercourse. As early as 1902, an anonymous German scholar (he did not dare publish in his own name) wrote on how seiðr was connected with sex. He argued that the wand was an obvious phallic symbol and why magic should otherwise be considered taboo for men. It was possible that the magic practices included sexual rites. As early as 1920, it was noted that the name of the male magic practitioner Ragnvald Rettilbein referred to such practices, as \"rettilbein\" means \"straight member\".\n\nThe vǫlur were known for their art of seduction, which was one of the reasons why they were considered dangerous. One of the stanzas in \"Hávamál\" warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill. Freyja, who is the mistress of seiðr, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.\n\nOne of the methods for seducing men may have been the use of drugs. In Fyrkat, the grave of a vǫlva revealed the use of henbane, a drug which not only produces hallucinations but can also be a powerful aphrodisiac. If Freyja was the goddess of love in Asgard, the vǫlva was her counterpart in Midgard.\n\nThe vǫlur could also employ drums during their sessions as in Sami shamanism. All vǫlur were not surrounded by the same retinue and preparations as Þórbjǫrgr, but she could also perform the seiðr alone, which was called \"útiseta\" (literally, \"sitting out\"). This practice appears to have involved meditation or introspection, possibly for the purpose of divination. Blain (2001) sees it as an aspect of seiðr reminiscent of shamanism. The term is derived from a 13th-century Law of Iceland, which outlawed \"útiseta at vekja trǫll upp ok fremja heiðni\" \"sitting out to wake up trolls and practicing heathenry\". Although the theoretical legal punishment for this offense was death, nobody was convicted under it until a minor witch craze reached Iceland in the 17th century. Keyser (1854) describes it as \"a peculiar kind of sorcery [...] in which the magician sat out at night under the open sky [...] especially to inquire into the future\".\n\nDuring the Christianization of Norway, King Olaf Trygvasson had seidmen tied up and thrown on a skerry at ebb. Men who practiced sorcery or magic were not received with the same respect but killed like animals and tortured to death because they were dealing with a practice that was held to be in the domain of women. This offense was considered \"ergi\", \"unmanliness, sexually perverse\". The \"Heimskringla\" relates that Ragnvaldr Rettilbein, one of Harald Fairhair's sons by the Sami woman Snæfrid was a seiðmaðr. The king had him burnt to death inside a house with a large group of fellow male practitioners.\n\nIn \"Lokasenna\", Loki taunts Odin for having practiced magic on Samsø, something which was considered \"ergi\".\n\nIncreasing conversions to Christianity began to displace the Norse religion, leading to the disappearance of the vǫlur; aided by Church and civil laws enacted against them, as in this Anglo-Saxon Canon law:\n\nThey were persecuted and killed in the course of Christianization, which also led to an extreme polarization of the role of females in Germanic society.\n\nResurgence of the traditions of the vǫlur are apparent in Europe and the United States within Heathen reconstructionism and the Christian community.\n\nThe term Spaewife was used as the title for several fictional works: Robert Louis Stevenson's poem \"The Spaewife\"; John Galt's historical romance \"The Spaewife: A Tale of the Scottish Chronicles\"; and John Boyce's \"The Spaewife, or, The Queen's Secret\" (under the pen-name Paul Peppergrass).\n\nFrancis Melville describes a spae-wife as a type of elf in \"The Book of Faeries\".\nNo taller than a human finger, fairy spae wives are usually dressed in the clothes of a peasant. However, when properly summoned, the attire changes from common to magnificent: blue cloak with a gem-lined collar and black lambskin hood lined with catskin, calfskin boots, and catskin gloves. Like human spae wives, they can also predict the future, through runes, tea leaves and signs generated by natural phenomena, and are good healers. They are said to be descended from the erectors of the standing stones.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46943392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46943392", "title": "With the People from the Bridge", "text": "With the People from the Bridge\n\nWith the People from the Bridge (Greek: \"Με τους ανθρώπους από τη γέφυρα\") is the second part of the \"Poena Damni\" trilogy by Greek author Dimitris Lyacos. The book deals with the theme of loss and the return of the dead in the context of Christian teleology. The text is encased in a post-theatrical ritual drama form, drawing on various philosophical and literary sources as well as ancient and modern Greek folklore. The plot-line centers around an Orpheus-like journey of the main protagonist LG who joins his deceased companion in the grave and is subsequently led by her to a liminal realm ahead of the imminent Resurrection Day. The work has been categorized by critics to belong to both the Modernist and the Post-Modernist tradition, while at the same time bearing strong affinities to a variety of canonical texts, among others Homer, Dante, Kafka, Joyce and Beckett. \n\"With the People from the Bridge\" follows the main line of narrative of \"\", the first book of the Poena Damni trilogy. The work opens with a first-person account of the narrator of \"Z213: Exit\", who recounts his arrival at a derelict train station named Nichtovo in search of a place where, he has been told, an improvised performance is being staged by, what appear to be, a band of social outcasts. The narrator joins the few members of the audience present and goes on to record in his journal the setting as well as the events taking place \"on stage” as the performance is about to begin. A group of four women in the role of a Chorus and three other protagonists (LG, NCTV, Narrator) are making their final preparations in front of a dilapidated car among machine parts and the noise of a generator. As the lights \"on stage\" are lowered the performance sets off with the Chorus's opening monologue followed in turn by the sequence of recitations of the other characters. The story unfolds during the timeline of a calendar day dedicated to the dead, a kind of All Souls' Day or Saturday of Souls. The plot-line originates in the Bible incident (Mark, 5:9), according to which the Gerasene demoniac begs Jesus to spare him from his torments. In the play enacted, LG assumes and expands on the role of the demoniac, recounting his past condition and describing how he has ended up taking residence in a cemetery. In a kind of simultaneous narration, LG recounts how he has opened the grave of his deceased companion (NCTV), prompted by voices he has been hearing. He enters, finds her body inside and feels compelled to stay with her, eventually making the realization that she is gradually coming back to life. Meanwhile, the Chorus are making preparations in anticipation of the yearly visit of their deceased kin and LG and NCTV eventually join them after having broken off from a crowd of revenants aroused on the occasion of the Soul Saturday. As the day comes to an end, LG and NCTV leave and become again part of the crowd they had broken off from. Despite trying to hold on to each other they are finally absorbed in an indefinite collective of souls moving ahead and cross “the bridge between the worlds\" as a Christian-like resurrection appears on the horizon. The book concludes with the epilogue of the on-stage(internal) Narrator recounting the process by which a mob gathered in a cemetery unearths two bodies, ritually “killing” the female by driving a stake in her chest, in a manner akin to handling vampires in the Slavonic tradition. A final narrative twist is offered by the presence of a tabloid clipping which delivers the reader back to a stark and gruesome every-day reality.\n\nWith the people from the bridge is a cross-genre work combining prose narrative with dramatic monologues written in poetry form. Verse soliloquies, elements of staging and ritual as well as choral incantations and simple descriptions are combined to create a polyvalent text approximating both poetry and drama. The makeshift stage as well as the presence of actors give the text its dramatic character, while action and setting, filtered through a spectator's perspective, bring to prominence the dimension of storytelling. Self-reflexive theatricality achieved through a clear-cut presentation of the division of spectators, actors and director and accounted for by the unifying voice of an external narrator leads to the work's classification as a piece of metatheatre. Further, and due to a constellation of elements including broken narrative, fragmented characters and illusory/imagistic setting, conveyed in the form of a personal experience of an audience member, the work has been categorized as a dinstinctively postmodern play. However, because of its allegiance and focus on a Grand Narrative reconstruction it seems to stand at a distance from postmodern associations.\n\n \nThe book exhibits a version of postmodern eclecticism, alternating poetry with prose parts. Despite its postmodern affinities, it can be construed, however, in line with the High Modernist tradition setting aside the postmodern playfulness for a serious and earnest handling of subject. The text develops in a series of intermittent monologues interspersed with biblical excerpts and the comments of the first-order narrator. The biblical elements together with vampiric and dystopian images work in tandem, creating a sense of foreboding and entrapment.Language is sparse and fragmentary, leaving enough loopholes to be completed by the reader and making no explicit mention of its vampire-related theme in order to reveal its storyline in a gradual and minimalist manner. Short declarative sentences are used to convey immediacy and facticity in the depiction of a grim world. Allusions and a wealth of cultural references are conveyed through sparse and seemingly casual monologues and which, at the same time, account for the text heading simultaneously at different directions. On occasions, the monologues seems to be ungrammatical and on others the characters seem to be turning back on their words. There is an effect akin to stream of consciousness, the text, however, develops in a linear way among the overlapping stories of the four protagonists. Ellipsis in narrative conjoined with simplicity of stage movement and the framework of a predominantly static performance, point to ritual as well as ritualistic theatre.\nThe work is structured in the form of an external-frame narrative by a first-order, unreliable narrator (the narrator of ) who sets the stage for the development of the inside story. Within this master narrative, four hyponarratives by Narrator (internal/second-order), Chorus, LG and NCTV contribute fragments of the story from their own point of view. As different narratives within the play intertwine, new elements come to the foreground but there is also a sense in which each individual narration overlaps with the others creating an effect of multiple focalization. The language of the text is simple and idiomatic while the syntax is occasionally disrupted by lacunae as well as incomplete sentences. Partial fragmentation combines, however, with a more conventional (although most of the time elliptical) linguistic use for the purpose of bringing forward the storytelling-like character of the work.\n\nAn earlier version of the text, similar in subject matter and structure but significantly different in content and style was published in 2001 in Greek and German and in 2005 in English under the title Nyctivoe. The term Nyctivoe, a rare ancient Greek adjective, appears in an incantation to the goddess of the moon in Magical Papyri, a syncretic compilation of texts from the Hellenistic Period focusing on sorcery and folk religion. In the previous version of the book, Nyctivoe is a proper name ascribed to the female character of the story, substituted in the new version by NCTV (the sequence of consonants in Nyctivoe).\n\nThe current title makes reference both to the setting where the events in the book are described to take place as well as to the bridge crossed by the crowd in the final part of the book. The bridge as the symbol of passage from the world of the living to the realm of the dead relates to the Chinvat bridge in the Zoroastrian religion. Also, the bridge is a symbol of a non-place relating to the name of the station(Nichtovo) the narrator of the book recalls to have arrived at. From a perspective of social commentary on contemporary events the title has been also interpreted to point to the \"living bridge\" of illegal immigrants seeking a Promised Land of plenty.\n\nThe first edition of With the People from the Bridge had received a number of twenty-one unanimously positive international reviews until autumn 2017. The book has been the subject of a considerable amount of scholarly criticism and also appears in the course contents of various university curricula on postmodern fiction. A second edition is scheduled for October 2018 ().\n\nhttp://poeticsresearch.com/article/a-column-of-cloud-and-a-column-of-fire-dimitris-lyacos-poena-damni-by-robert-zaller/\n\nhttp://www.cleavermagazine.com/poena-damni-trilogy-by-dimitris-lyacos-reviewed-by-justin-goodman/\n\n"}
