Pre-flight safety demonstrations, either conducted by the flight attendants or through a video presentation, instruct passengers to familiarize themselves with the safety cards prior to take-off. \n\nThe cards are frequently laminated or made of plastic and contain instructions that are specific to the model of the airplane in which they are found. The contents are usually in the form of pictures, graphically illustrating such procedures as buckling the seat belts, bracing for impact in an airplane crash, dealing with depressurization, opening the emergency exit door or inflating life rafts in the event of a water landing. The graphic representation allows the cards to be accessible to those speaking a different language from the flight attendants, as well as to children and illiterate passengers. Braile cards are also offered on many mainstream airlines.\n\nAircraft safety cards are a collectible item among the aviation enthusiast community since they are a reflection of an airline, an aircraft type, a culture, and a historical period.

The applicant was required to provide a completed application form, passport (for applicants 16 years old or older) and two identification photos. The system was voluntary for shorter-term visitors.\n\nAlien registration was a prerequisite to many activities in Japan, such as purchasing a mobile phone, opening a bank account or obtaining a driver's license.\n\nAs described below, the alien registration system was replaced with a foreign residents' registration system on July 9, 2012. The new system of foreign resident registration was passed from the local municipal level to the national level.\n\nThe information stored in the alien registration system included:\n\n\nThis information was recorded in a physical document called a , kept by the municipality in which the subject lived. Any changes in registered information had to be reported to the municipal office.\n\nIf a resident alien moved within Japan, they were required to report their move to the new municipality of residence, which then took possession of the \"tōroku genpyō\". The \"tōroku genpyō\" was closed when the alien left Japan without a re-entry permit, and was then kept in an archive at the Ministry of Justice. Any subsequent entry to Japan by the same person required a new registration which was kept on a new \"tōroku genpyō\".\n\nAfter a person registered as an alien, they were issued a photographic identity document called a , abbreviated (as is common in Japan) to , and colloquially referred to in English as an \"alien registration card\" (\"ARC\") or \"gaijin card.\" All aliens in Japan were required to carry their passport or ARC at all times. The issuance of an ARC generally took about two weeks from the filing of the application.\n\nAlien registration could also be evidenced by a , which is an A4-sized printed copy of the information currently on file, similar in form to the residency registration certificates used by Japanese nationals. Because this form of certificate did not contain the subject's photograph, it was not as widely accepted as the ARC for identity verification purposes, and was mainly used as a temporary certificate when an ARC was unavailable.\n\nThe ARC had to be surrendered when the foreigner left Japan unless they had a valid re-entry permit in their passport.\n\nRegistered aliens are allowed to adopt an or as a second legal name. This resembles the that Japanese are allowed to use — for example, to continue using a maiden name at work and on bank accounts after marriage. Foreigners who are long-term residents of Japan, particularly ethnic Koreans whose families have lived in Japan for generations, often adopt Japanese names as aliases in order to integrate within society. Ethnic Japanese who live in Japan as resident aliens may use a legal alias to reflect their ancestral name. Legal aliases are also used when registering a seal in a different script than the applicant's legal name (e.g., in katakana rather than Latin script).\n\nA person is generally required to use their alias in public relations before registering it. The exact criteria vary by locality, but the most common evidence is mail addressed to the alias name. One common technique which applicants use to create this evidence is to label the post box at their registered residence using the alias, and then mail themselves a postcard or letter addressed to the alias. One may also pay one's NHK television fee under the alias, and then receive official bills using that alias.\n\nAliases may be registered upon initial alien registration. If the alias is registered subsequently, upon registration of the alias, the registrant receives a handwritten notation indicating the legal alias on the reverse side of their alien registration card. Any registration certificate which is subsequently issued will show the alias in type in parentheses just below the holder's name.\n\nA registered alias may be used on credit cards, health insurance, bank accounts and other documents. However, such documents may cause difficulties in foreign countries where the holder does not have personal identification showing their Japanese alias; thus documents in the registrant's foreign name may be preferable in non-Japanese speaking locales. Foreigners may obtain a Japanese credit card with a photo.\n\nJapanese nationals often use aliases for non-official purposes. For example, women often continue to use their maiden names following marriage, even though they are required to adopt the same family name as their husband for their legal name. However, Japanese nationals are not permitted to use an alias for legal purposes: their name on any official document (e.g. domestic use Japanese identification) must match the name appearing in their family register and resident register. Japanese passports may contain alternate names in parentheses next to the family name or the given name if the Japanese can show a legal connection and use of these names overseas. Multiple alternate names are separated by slashes. Non-standard non-Hepburn romanization may also be used for the main names if one can show a legal connection using these spellings.\n\nFrom 1952 onward, alien registration required the applicant to provide fingerprints from all fingers. Resident Koreans and other groups opposed this provision as a human rights violation. Kathleen Morikawa saw fingerprinting as violating the Golden Rule and fought for a level playing field. The fingerprinting system was repealed for Special Permanent Residents in the 1980s and for other aliens in 1999.\n\nThe fingerprint law was described in an Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights report, \"Prevention of Discrimination: The Rights of Non-Citizens\" (final report of the special rapporteur David Weissbrodt), as follows:\n\nThe Japanese government has since introduced fingerprinting and photographing of foreigners, claiming that this is a terrorism control measure. Fingerprinting is conducted at the immigration checkpoint when entering Japan and is only conducted using the two index fingers. Japanese nationals and Special Permanent Residents are exempt from the procedure; long-term residency holders are requested to give fingerprint scans regardless.\n\nWhen enforced, 95 people out of 700,000 who had entered Japan in one month were refused entry.\n\nThe alien registration system was similar to, but completely separate from, the \"koseki\" system used to record Japanese families and the \"juminhyo\" system used to record individual residents. If a household contained any non-Japanese members, those people would not appear in the \"koseki\" or \"juminhyo\" alongside the Japanese members. However, both Japanese and non-Japanese members of a registered alien's family appear in the alien's registration certificate; therefore one alien registration certificate can be used to prove their familial relationship.\n\nOne side effect of this situation was that it was impossible for an alien married to a Japanese national to be registered as the head of their household on a \"koseki\" or \"juminhyo\". It was possible, however, to add a footnote to the Japanese spouse's records indicating that the alien is a .\n\nThe Japanese government passed a law replacing the alien registration system with a residents' registration system. This new system started from July 9, 2012. The changes see non-Japanese residents recorded alongside Japanese residents in the \"jūminhyō\" system. (Note the distinction between the koseki system, which has not changed, and the jūminhyō).\n\nUnder the new system, foreigners are issued a new identification card known as a by immigration authorities. Local city officials stopped issuing Alien Registration Cards and all foreigners are now issued Residence Cards by immigration authorities. Use of the old card was permitted until 8 July 2015, or when the resident's current status expired, whichever came first.\n\nWith the system, the maximum length of a status (other than statuses such as ' long-term residence or ' special long-term residence) for foreign residents was extended from three to five years, and shorter periods for Students and dependent statuses are permitted; the maximum length of multiple re-entry permits also has been extended to 5 years (eiju status) or 6 years (teiji), in addition for stays of up to one year, a special re-entry permit can be applied for at the point of departure at no charge rather than having to apply to an Immigration bureau in advance.\nResidency status renewals are automatically reported to City Offices. Immigration Dept. penalties for failing to promptly report changes in address to the City Office may be quite severe. As was the case for Alien Registration, penalties for not carrying registration cards at all times are still likely to be heavy.\n\nSpecial Permanent Residents such as special Korean residents of Japan have a Special Permanent Resident Certificate instead of a Residence Card.\n\n\n"}

It is maintained by the Canadian Football League (CFL). It includes displays about the CFL, Canadian university football and Canadian junior football history.\n\nThe Hall previously had a main feature in the central portion of the museum where inducted members, each with a metal bust depicting their head, were displayed prior to the physical building being closed. There were also featured displays that highlight each CFL team's history, and an interactive field goal kicking exhibit. The CFHOF is currently changing to a de-centralized model, which does not included a main museum building (see \"Today\" below).\n\nOnce during every CFL season, the Hall sponsors the induction ceremony of former players. Included in the \"Hall of Fame Weekend\" is a regular season game, usually (but not always) affiliated with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Traditionally, the inducted players will come to the Hall and make an acceptance speech in front of the building where their newly sculpted bust is unveiled. A player must be retired from the game for at least three years before being eligible for consideration. A Hall of Fame voting committee is composed of sports writers, selected CFL executives and inducted members.\n\nThe Canadian Hall of Fame officially opened on November 28, 1972. It is located in downtown Hamilton, beside the former Hamilton City Hall and Family Courts Building, which is inside the former Andrew Carnegie library on Main Street, between Bay Street and MacNab Street. The Canadian Hall of Fame was awarded to the City of Hamilton in June 1963 following the invitation of Mayor Lloyd Douglas Jackson. The Hamilton Parks Board offered a space near Civic Stadium. Ivan Miller, former sports editor of The Spectator, was named the first curator. Soon after, the Board of Education purchased the land and building. The Hall moved to this location in 1972 and closed on September 19, 2015. In 2015, responsibility for the museum moved from the City of Hamilton to the CFL.\n\nThe old Canadian Hall of Fame building was easily identified by the slightly-larger-than-life metal sculpture \"Touchdown\", featuring a successful receiver being tackled. As of May 2018, this sculpture will be moved to Tim Hortons Field Gate 3. Tim Hortons Field will also have 3 display areas - the Grey Cup display at Gate 3, the Media Hall of Fame Wing in the press box area, and the main display area in the premium level concourse. The main display area will feature all 296 busts (as of March 2018) and rotating displays of various artifacts. The displays will be accessible during Hamilton Tiger-Cats home games (club level display open to all ticket holders 15 minutes after the end of the game), as well as Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings to the public at no charge.

It was finished in 1197 during the reign of the Grand Prince Vsevolod the Big Nest of Vladimir-Suzdal to the honour of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki. Being an important component of the White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal, the cathedral belongs to the World Heritage of UNESCO. Currently, the cathedral is a part of the Vladimir-Suzdal open-air museum.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Dmitrii in Vladimir, Russia was built by Vsevolod III in 1193-7. It was one of several large churches he had built which also include the much larger Cathedral of Dormition, 1158-60, also in Vladimir, Russia. The cathedral was dedicated to St. Dmitrii of Salonika (St. Demetrios of Thesseloinka in Greek). The Cathedral of St. Dmitrii was originally connected directly with Vsevolod’s palace and was for his personal use. The palace no longer exists and the church has been renovated many times since it was first built but it has kept is predominant features and iconographic program. The most extensive renovation was in 1832 when the some attached structures which used to connect it to the palace were removed. At that time, some of the exterior blocks were moved and some replaced with newly carved blocks.\n\nThe cathedral is masonry and made from local white limestone blocks. It is cubic in form similar to many earlier churches in Bogolyubovo especially the \"Church of the Intercession on the Nerl\" (1165). It has four columns on the interior which supports drum and cupola. The exterior walls are separated into three bays each with the one in the middle larger than the others. Each bay contains a \"zakomara\" at the top. They are also separated at mid-level by a horizontal arcade frieze. One side of the cathedral contains an apse which is also separated into three parts. The windows and doors are deeply recessed with extensive carved ornamentation. \n\nThe most striking feature of the cathedral are the extensive shallow relief carvings which cover the upper half of the exterior walls above the arcade frieze and the drum below the cupola. The source of the artisans and provenance for these carvings seems to be an amalgam of many influences. The most likely are earlier Bogoluiubovo churches, Balkan churches and Armenian churches. Vladimir, at end of the 12th century, was a cosmopolitan and artistic center. Architects and artisans from both the east and west resided there are were used in the construction of the church. In addition, Vsevolod’s mother was a Byzantine princess and Vsevolod lived in Constantinople for several years during his childhood. Another source of inspiration may also have been portable carvings such as Byzantine ivories.\n\nThe carvings consist of animals and plants as well as figures in rows and scenes in the \"zakomary\". Some carvings are also ornamental patterns. The patterns, plants and animals (both real and imaginary) might be based pagan beliefs and traditions, traditional Russia folklore or Christian theological themes. These types of carvings make of the majority of the decoration on the cathedral. In each zakomara, there is a figural scene. The most prominent, on the west façade in the central bay, is a scene featuring King David surrounded by angels and chimeras. King David is also featured on the south façade central bay surrounded by warrior saints. Other prominent figures, in addition to Christ and Mary, include Solomon, Alexander the Great, Hercules, warrior saints and churchmen. The final piece of this theme being the \"zakomara\" of the north façade left showing the donor, Vsevolod with his sons. In a time when power and territory were taken and held by military might, the building of churches and palaces which support the prince’s authority are important. This cathedral, not unlike the Cathedral of Dormition by its size and grandeur, by its iconographic program reinforces the prince’s authority by linking it to ancient kings and philosophers, biblical figures and military leaders.\n\nWhile a few carvings are still intact inside the cathedral, the most important original feature of the interior are a few frescoes above and around the west entrance that have survived since the late 12th century. The quality of the work varies. The best work in the faces of saints and angels in the Last Judgement scene are likely the work of Byzantine masters with their Russian pupils completing less important parts such as drapery and background. The lines and shading of the better parts is comparable to the best work in Greece and Byzantium. The icon of the Virgin of Vladimir was also known to be in the nearby Cathedral of Dormition at the time the frescoes were painted so was likely a source of inspiration and training.\n\n\n"}

Reuben Clark, concerned the United States' use of military force to intervene in Latin American nations. This memorandum was officially released in 1930 by the Herbert Hoover administration. \n\nThe Clark memorandum rejected the view that the Roosevelt Corollary was based on the Monroe Doctrine. However, it was not a complete repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary but was rather a statement that any intervention by the U.S. was not sanctioned by the Monroe Doctrine but rather was the right of America as a state. This separated the Roosevelt Corollary from the Monroe Doctrine by noting that the Monroe Doctrine only applied to situations involving European countries. One main point in the Clark Memorandum was to note that the Monroe Doctrine was based on conflicts of interest only between the United States and European nations, rather than between the United States and Latin American nations.\n\nDuring the late 1920s, a number of American foreign policy leaders started to argue for a softer tone in US relations with Latin American nations, which had been chafing under decades of intervention by the United States. Under secretary of State, and later Ambassador to Mexico, J. Reuben Clark (1871–1961) held these conciliatory views and completed work on the 236-page Memorandum late in the Coolidge administration. Clark argued the following:\n\nWhile sometimes regarded as an outright repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary, Clark was simply advancing his belief that the corollary was separate from the Monroe Doctrine and that American intervention in Latin America, when necessary, was sanctioned by U.S. rights as a sovereign nation, not by the Monroe Doctrine. \n\nClark's views were not made public until March 1930 during the Hoover administration, when Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson was guiding American diplomacy toward the beginning of a Good Neighbor Policy with its Latin American neighbors.\n\nThe memorandum also used the term \"national security\" in its first known usage.\n"}
{"id": "35629101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35629101", "title": "Cod as food", "text": "Cod as food\n\nThis article is about cod and other cod-like fishes from the family of Gadidae, such as haddock, pollock and whiting, regarded as food.\n\nCod is popular as a food with a mild flavour and a dense, flaky white flesh. Young Atlantic cod or haddock prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod. Cod's soft liver can be canned or fermented into cod liver oil, providing an excellent source of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Cod flesh is moist and flaky when cooked and is white in colour. In the United Kingdom Atlantic cod is one of the most common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and plaice. Cod can be easily turned into various other products, such as cod liver oil, omega pills, etc.\n\nHaddock is a very popular food fish, sold fresh, smoked, frozen, dried, and, to a small extent, canned. Haddock, along with cod and plaice, is one of the most popular fish used in British fish and chips.\n\nFresh haddock has a clean white flesh and can be cooked in the same ways as cod. Freshness of a haddock fillet can be determined by how well it holds together, as a fresh one will be firm; also, fillets should be translucent, while older fillets turn a chalky hue. Young, fresh haddock and cod fillets are often sold as scrod in Boston, Massachusetts; this refers to the size of the fish which have a variety of sizes, i.e. scrod, markets, and cows. Haddock is the predominant fish of choice in Scotland in a fish supper. It is also the main ingredient of Norwegian fishballs (fiskeboller).\n\nUnlike the related cod, haddock does not salt well and is often preserved by drying and smoking.\n\nThe smoking of haddock is something that was highly refined in Grimsby. Traditional Grimsby smoked fish (mainly haddock, but sometimes cod) is produced in the traditional smoke houses in Grimsby, which are mostly family-run businesses that have developed their skills over many generations. Grimsby fish market sources its haddock from the North East Atlantic, principally Iceland, Norway and Faroe. These fishing grounds are sustainably managed and have not seen the large scale depreciation in fish stocks seen in EU waters.\n\nOne popular form of haddock is Finnan haddie, named for the fishing village of Finnan or Findon in Scotland, where it was originally cold-smoked over peat. Finnan haddie is often served poached in milk for breakfast.\n\nThe town of Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland produces the Arbroath Smokie. This is a hot-smoked haddock which requires no further cooking before eating.\n\nSmoked haddock naturally has an off-white color; it is very often dyed yellow, as are other smoked fish. Smoked haddock is the essential ingredient in the Anglo-Indian dish kedgeree.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International has added the haddock to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n\nAtlantic pollock is largely considered to be a whitefish, although it is a fairly strongly flavored one. Traditionally a popular source of food in some countries, such as Norway, in the United Kingdom it has previously been largely consumed as a cheaper and versatile alternative to cod and haddock. However, in recent years pollock has become more popular due to over-fishing of cod and haddock. It can now be found in most supermarkets as fresh fillets or prepared freezer items. For example, it is used minced in fish fingers or as an ingredient in imitation crab meat.\n\nBecause of its slightly gray color, pollock is often prepared, as in Norway, as fried fish balls, or if juvenile sized, breaded with oatmeal and fried, as in Shetland. Year-old fish are traditionally split, salted and dried over a peat hearth in Orkney, where their texture becomes wooden and somewhat phosphorescent. The fish can also be salted and smoked and achieve a salmon-like orange color (although it is not closely related to the salmon), as is the case in Germany where the fish is commonly sold as \"Seelachs\" or sea salmon. In Korea, pollock may be repeatedly frozen and melted to create \"hwangtae\", half-dried to create \"ko-da-ri\", or fully dried and eaten as \"book-o\".\n\nIn 2009, U.K. supermarket Sainsbury's renamed pollock 'Colin' in a bid to boost ecofriendly sales of the fish as an alternative to cod. The supermarket also suggested some shoppers may be too embarrassed to ask for the species under its proper title, due to its reputation as an inferior fish, and its similarity to a popular English swear word (bollocks). Sainsbury's, which said the new name was derived from the French for cooked pollock (), launched the product under the banner \"Colin and chips can save British cod.\"\n\n"}

The \"Fragmente\" was first published in 1903, was later revised and expanded three times by Diels, and was finally revised in a fifth edition (1934–7) by Walther Kranz and again in a sixth edition (1952). In Diels-Kranz, each passage, or item, is assigned a number which is used to uniquely identify the ancient personality with which it is concerned, and the type of item given. Diels-Kranz is used in academia to cite pre-Socratic philosophers, and the system also encompasses Sophists and pre-Homeric poets such as Orpheus.\n\nStephanus pagination is the comparable system for referring to Plato, and Bekker numbering is the comparable system for referring to Aristotle.\n\nThe works of the pre-Socratics have not survived extant to the present day. Our knowledge of them exists only through references in the works of later philosophers (known as doxography) in the form of quotations and paraphrases. For example, our knowledge of Thales of Miletus comes largely from the works of Aristotle, who lived centuries after him. Another interesting example of such a source is Hippolytus of Rome, whose polemic \"Refutation of All Heresies\" is a source of many direct quotations of Heraclitus as well as of other philosophers, thereby perpetuating the work of those he was refuting.\n\nThese quotations, paraphrases and other references to pre-Socratic philosophers were collected by Diels and Kranz in their book, which became a standard text in modern pre-Socratic education and scholarship. Because of its influence, Diels-Kranz numbering became the standard way of referencing the material: in literature, conferences, and even in conversation.\n\nThe number corresponding to an item was made up of three parts:\n\n\nWhy, take the case of Thales, Theodorus. While he was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.\n\nThe above text has a DK number of 11A9, since it refers to Thales who is, as mentioned above, chapter 11's subject. The source is \"Theaetetus\" (one of Plato's dialogues), and gives an account of Thales' life, hence it is a \"testimonium\", represented by the letter \"A\". Finally, it is the ninth item in its chapter, giving it the overall number of DK 11A9.\n\nSometimes, the chapter (personality) number may simply be replaced by the name, which can be helpful in cases where the former is the same as the passage number, to avoid ambiguity. For example:\n\nThose who seek for gold dig up much earth and find a little.\n\nRather than \"22B22\" the above may also instead be referred to as \"Heraclitus B22\" as it is a direct transmission of the words of Heraclitus (thus, B) and is the 22nd item in the chapter about Heraclitus (whose chapter number is also 22) in the \"Fragmente\".\n\nThe following table gives the Diels-Kranz numbering of Pre-Socratic philosophers. Note that the numbering scheme presented is that of the fifth edition of \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\", the first to be revised by Kranz. The fifth edition's numbering is the scheme which has since gained the most traction in modern Pre-Socratic scholarship, and it is the one used consistently throughout this article. It should not be confused with the numberings given in other versions, which changed frequently depending on the particular edition of the \"Fragmente\".\n\nMost entries (78) are concerned with a single, named individual, while the remaining minority of entries (12) have more complex context. Of these latter, eight (10, 19, 39, 46, 53-56) are each concerned with groups of named personalties, who typically have a clear relationship of some kind to justify their association in each entry. Two entries (58, 79) are devoted not to individuals, but to schools of thought (Pythagoreanism and Sophism), and the last two (89, 90) reproduce contemporaneous anonymous texts. Although \"the Seven Sages of Greece\" implies a clearly defined set of seven people, historical disagreement renders intractable the problem of exactly who they were, with multiple sources suggesting several different candidates. If one takes the Seven Sages as a group of seven and includes the later Iamblichus, Diels-Kranz encompasses 106 named personalities and two anonymous authors. The chapter on Sophism is concerned with the named sophists who take up most of the rest of the scheme, and \nper Freeman with regard to the chapter on Pythagoreanism, a catalogue due to Iamblichus lists 218 named men and 17 named women as Pythagoreans, along with other probable, anonymous adherents.\n\nIn several cases, the personalities listed are so obscure that they are merely mentioned by name in other sources, commonly with hints as to their geographical and philosophical associations, and without even surviving \"paraphrases\" of any of their ideas, or what they might have written. That is, these more obscure personalities survive in the historical record only as names cited by others, and so came to be included in Diels-Kranz for the sake of scholarly completeness.\n\n\n"}

Formulated under the political guidance of Eduard Bernstein, August Bebel, and Karl Kautsky, it superseded the earlier Gotha Program.\n\nThe program declared the imminent death of capitalism and the necessity of socialist ownership of the means of production. The party intended to pursue these goals through legal political participation rather than by revolutionary activity. Kautsky argued that because capitalism, by its very nature, must collapse, the immediate task for socialists was to work for the improvement of workers' lives rather than for the revolution, which was inevitable.\nThe draft programme was criticised by Friedrich Engels for its opportunist, non-Marxist views on the state in a criticism sent by Engels to Kautsky on 29 June 1891.\n\nKautsky wrote the official SPD commentary on the program in 1892, which was called \"The Class Struggle\". The simplified Marxism exemplified by \"The Class Struggle\" is sometimes referred to as 'vulgar Marxism' or the 'Marxism of the Second International'. The popular renderings of Marxism found in the works of Kautsky and Bebel were read and distributed more widely in Europe between the late 19th century and 1914 than Marx's own works. \"The Class Struggle\" was translated into 16 languages before 1914 and became the accepted popular summation of Marxist theory. This document came to define 'orthodox' socialist theory before the October Revolution of 1917 caused a major split in the international socialist movement.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26629524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26629524", "title": "Haitian Declaration of Independence", "text": "Haitian Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Haitian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1804 in the port city of Gonaïves by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, marking the end of 13-year long Haitian Revolution. The declaration marked Haiti's becoming the first independent nation of Latin America and only the second in the Americas after the United States.\n\nNotably, the Haitian Declaration of Independence signalled the culmination of the only successful slave revolution in history. Only two copies of the original printed version exist. Both of these were discovered by Julia Gaffield, a Duke University postgraduate student, in The National Archives (UK) in 2010 and 2011. They are currently held by The National Archives, Kew.\n\nThe declaration itself is a three-part document. The longest section, \"Le Général en Chef Au Peuple d’Hayti\", which is known as the \"proclamation,\" functions as a prologue. It has one signatory, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the senior general and a former slave. Due to Dessalines being illiterate and unable to speak French, his secretary Louis Boisrond-Tonnerre then read out the proclamation, followed by the act of independence, which were both written by the latter. This declaration was later followed by an independence day speech from Dessalines - recited in Haitian Creole - in which he denounced France.\n\nIn particular, the declaration demands vengeance against the French White Creoles, who committed atrocities against the African-Haitian population. Dessalines claimed that:\"\"It is not enough to have expelled the barbarians who have bloodied our land for two centuries; … We must, with one last act of national authority, forever assure the empire of liberty in the country of our birth; we must take any hope of re-enslaving us away from the inhuman government …. In the end we must live independent or die.\"\" These words presaged the 1804 Haiti massacre, which was supervised by Dessalines.\n\nPhilippe Girard, a Guadeloupean academic, has noted that the document is multi-layered with references to six different audiences: \"the French, Creoles, Anglo-Americans, Latin Americans, mixed-race Haitians, and black Haitians\". Moreover, the Haitian declaration was important because it marked the end of a revolution, not the beginning, unlike most revolutionary struggles prior to the mid-twentieth century. Also, the primary motive behind this revolution was not independence, but rather racial equality and emancipation.\n\nAlthough the declaration repeatedly alluded to \"freedom from slavery\", there was no mention of \"republican rights\" within the text. As a result, the new nation under Dessalines came to be known as the l’État d’Haïti (The State of Haiti), rather than the Haitian Republic. Following independence, Dessalines accorded all power to himself as the \"head of state\", which was made possible by the support of the 17 senior officials that signed the third section of the declaration.\n\nUnlike many other colonial American freedom struggles, the central issue for the Haitian revolution was not independence, but rather freedom from their enslavement under France. In its social and political complexity, the Haitian Revolution resembled the simultaneous revolution in France, since the demand of the revolutionaries was secession from the ruling-class of France. Moreover, unlike mainland colonies, Haiti was an easily blockaded Caribbean island with a small population, which made independence a less viable option for them.\n\nFor the black slaves, a revolution and the subsequent declaration of independence was a route to emancipation and racial equality, following the re-establishment of slavery in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte. This decision, in particular, catalyzed the revolution among the slaves who had become more content after the abolition of slavery in 1793. This motive resonated with Dessalines, who was a slave himself. Hence, the eventual declaration in 1804 made several mentions of emancipation and freedom from the \"cruelties of the French\", rather than a \"de jure\" claim of independence.\n\nA similar attempt to attain independence was carried out on the night of 21 August 1791, when the slaves of Saint Domingue rose in revolt and plunged the colony into civil war. Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. However, the Legislative Assembly in France granted rights to the free people of colour, in addition to dispatching 6,000 French soldiers to the island. As a result, a complete secession from France was not undertaken at the time, and only came into effect after slavery was brought back.\n\nFor the white Creole revolutionaries, the declaration of independence connoted to political autonomy. Nevertheless, the ensuing 1804 Haiti massacre meant that their aims were not fulfilled, and Haiti became the first black sovereign state. The massacre—which took place in the entire territory of Haiti—was carried out from early February 1804 until 22 April 1804. During February and March, Dessalines travelled among the cities of Haiti to assure himself that his orders were carried out. This ensured that the social and political power then rested with the blacks and those of mixed-descent, thereby completely changing the status quo post-independence. As such, emancipation gave Dessalines an avenue to exercise revenge on the former slave-owners, who were systematically persecuted.\n\nOn 1 January 1804, Dessalines, the new leader under the dictatorial 1801 constitution, declared Haiti a state in the name of the Haitian people. Dessalines' secretary Boisrond-Tonnerre stated, \"For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!\". Incidentally, it is claimed that Boisrond-Tonnerre was chosen to author the declaration by Dessalines due to this statement itself.\n\nDessalines assigned all power to himself, by taking the title \"governor-general for life,\" which he replaced nine months later with \"emperor\". His establishing of a de facto dictatorship was, in fact, implied within the declaration text as well:\"Remember that I sacrificed everything to rally to your defense; family, children, fortune, and now I am rich only with your liberty; my name has become a horror to all those who want slavery. Despots and tyrants curse the day that I was born. If ever you refused or grumbled while receiving those laws that the spirit guarding your fate dictates to me for your own good, you would deserve the fate of an ungrateful people.\" Additionally, there is no assertion of 'republican rights', or any 'rights' whatsoever within the declaration. Instead, the idea of independence in this context was restricted to freedom from slavery, not liberalisation. This can be traced from the 1791 slave rebellion to the 1801 constitution by Loverture, who created an authoritarian society that transferred absolute control from the French to Dessalines. The militaristic rule of Dessalines - with the support of 17 of the 37 senior army officers that denounced France - bore similarity to the French Revolution that culminated with the ascent of Napoleon as a dictator in France.\n\nFurthermore, even though it was successful, Dessalines opted for a revolution only \"in one country\". This has been linked with the need to assuage his British neighbours' fears of rebellion, due to Britain’s navy controlling the sea-lanes at the time. In three conciliatory paragraphs that contrast with the strident tone of the rest of the document, Dessalines asks his countrymen to: \"Ensure, however, that a missionary spirit does not destroy our work; let us allow our neighbours to breathe in peace; may they live quietly under the laws that they have made for themselves, and let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawgivers of the Caribbean, nor let our glory consist in troubling the peace of the neighbouring islands. Unlike that which we inhabit, theirs has not been drenched in the innocent blood of its inhabitants; they have no vengeance to claim from the authority that protects them.\" Despite this, however, the Haitian Revolution and its consequent independence were unlike other revolutions of the time. The general post-independence autocratic tradition in Haiti differentiated it from most other Latin American societies that became republics following a revolution, with the exception of a select few that became monarchies. It was only after the assassination of emperor Dessalines in 1806, that the freed slaves - also signatories of the declaration - went on to establish Haiti's first republic.\n\nThe Act of Independence was supposed to be held at the National Archives building in Port-au-Prince and it was there until the government of Fabre Nicolas Geffrard until it was sold to a German who wanted to exhibit in the British Museum. After the 2010 earthquake, in April 2010, a Canadian graduate student at Duke University was studying in London found the only surviving copy in the British National Archives.\n"}

{"id": "49476618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49476618", "title": "Huanglan", "text": "Huanglan\n\nThe Huanglan or Imperial Mirror was the oldest Chinese encyclopedia or \"leishu\" \"classified dictionary\". Cao Pi, the first emperor of the Wei, ordered its compilation upon his accession to the throne in 220 and it was completed in 222. The purpose of the \"Huanglan\" was to provide the emperor and ministers of state with conveniently arranged summaries of all that was known at the time. Complete versions of the \"Huanglan\" existed until the Song dynasty (960-1279), when it became a lost work, although some quotations did survive in other encyclopedias and anthologies. The \"Huanglan\" was the prototype of the classified encyclopedia and served as a model for later ones such as the (624) Tang \"Yiwen Leiju\" and the (1408) Ming \"Yongle dadian.\n\nThe title combines \"huáng\" 皇 \"emperor; imperial\" and \"lǎn\" 覽 \"see; look at; watch; inspect; display\" (compare the \"Taiping Yulan\" encyclopedia). This character 覽 redundantly combines \"jiàn\" 見 \"‘see\" and the phonetic element \"jiān\" 監 < Old Chinese *\"kˁram\" \"see; look at; inspect\", which was an ancient graphic variant character for \"jiàn\" < *\"kˁram-s\" 鑑 or 鑒 \"mirror\", cognate with \"jìng\" 鏡 *\"qraŋ-s\" \"mirror\".\n\nFive centuries before the title \"Huanglan\" first occurred, but the words \"huang\" (before it meant \"emperor\") and \"lan\" co-occur in the \"Chuci\" poem Li Sao \"Encountering Sorrow\", believed to be written by Qu Yuan (c. 340-278 BCE). The 1st line establishes the poet's noble ancestry from Zhuanxu, the legendary Yellow Emperor's grandson, the 2nd describes his auspicious birth, and the 3rd line says, \"My father, seeing the aspect of my nativity (皇覽揆余初度兮), Took omens to give me an auspicious name\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 68). In this context, \"huang\" 皇 means \"august; stately; revered\" in reference to the poet's father and \"lan\" 覽 means \"see\".\n\nThe \"mirror\" meaning of the Chinese \"lan\" in \"Huanglan\" parallels the Medieval genre of speculum literature that aimed to encompass encyclopedic knowledge in a single work (e.g., Albertus Magnus's \"Speculum astronomiae\"), and the modern scholarly survey article that summarizes a field of knowledge.\n\nAlthough the title is usually transliterated \"Huanglan\" or \"Huang Lan\", some English translations are:\n\nBeginning with the 3rd-century \"Huanglan\", the first Chinese \"encyclopedia\" genre was the \"imperial florilegium\" that compiled excerpts from other writings and arranged them under appropriate headings for the convenience of the emperor and his ministers (Needham et al. 1986: 200). Chinese traditional \"leishu\" encyclopedias differ from Western encyclopedias in that they consist almost entirely of selected quotations from written sources and arranged by a set of categories, the name encyclopedia having been applied to them because they embrace the whole realm of knowledge (Teng and Biggerstaff 1971: 81).\n\nThe emperor summoned a group of Confucian scholars to compile a completely new type of reference work that would provide the emperor and his ministers with a quick source for finding moral and political precedents (Zurndorfer 2013: 505). The chief editor Mou Xi 繆襲 (186-245) collaborated with Liu Shao, Huan Fan, Wang Xiang 王象, Wei Dan 韋誕, and other scholars (Needham et al. 1986: 569, Theobald 2013).\n\nCao Pi instructed his officials to collect all the available classical philosophical texts and their commentaries, and to arrange them in \"suilei xiangcong\" 隨類相從 \"successive categories\" (Zurndorfer 2013: 509). The \"Huanglan\" compilers adopted the macrostructure of the (c. 3rd century BCE) \"Erya\" dictionary with explicitly labelled sections, the microstructure of the (c. 239 BCE) \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 225). The original \"Huanglan\" was divided into over 40 sections and comprised over 1000 chapters.\n\nDuring the Six dynasties period (222-589), a number of works like the \"Huanglan\" were compiled, including the (c. 530) Liang dynasty \"Hualin bianlue\" 華林遍略 \"An Arrangement of the Whole Company of Flowers\" by Xu Mian 徐勉 and (c. 550) Northern Qi \"Xiuwendian yulan\" 修文殿御覽 \"Imperial Speculum of the Hall of the Cultivation of Literature\" (tr. Needham et al. 1986: 207, 571). Both of these were lost. Between the 3rd and 18th centuries, some 600 \"leishu\" were compiled, of which only 200 are still extant (Zurndorfer 2013: 505).\n\nThe textual history of the \"Huanglan\" is recorded in the bibliography sections of the standard \"Twenty-Four Histories\". The (636) \"Book of Sui\" bibliography section records \"Huanglan\" 皇覽 editions in a 120-chapter version edited by Moui Xi 繆襲 and others, a Liang dynasty 680-chapter version, a 123-chapter version by the astronomer He Chengtian 何承天, and a 50-chapter version by Xu Yuan 徐爰. It also records the lost 4-chapter \"Huanglanmu\" 皇覽目 index, and the 12-chapter \"Huanglan chao\" 皇覽抄 revised by Prince Xiao Chen 蕭琛. The (945) \"Old Book of Tang\" bibliography records a 122-chapter version by He Chengtian, and an 84-chapter one by Xu Yuan. Subsequent standard histories do not record the \"Huanglan\". By the year 1000, the complete version \"Huanglan\" was definitively known to be lost (Drege 1991: 24).\n\nSeveral Qing dynasty (1644-1911) scholars collected surviving fragments of the lost encyclopedia (e.g., the \"Commentary on the Water Classic\" quotes it 15 times). For example, Huang Shi 黃奭's \"Wei Huanglan\" 魏皇覽 and Wang Mo's \"Huanglan yili\" 皇覽逸禮.\n\n"}

For their investigative work in the field of steroids, Williams and Fainaru-Wada were given the 2004 George Polk Award.\n\nIn the course of their investigative research, Williams and Fainaru-Wada were the first to report that:\n\nOn May 5, 2006, Fainaru-Wada and Williams were subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury about how they obtained leaked grand jury testimony. On May 31, the authors urged United States District Judge Martin Jenkins of San Francisco to excuse them from testifying. This appeal was supported by affidavits from \"Washington Post\" reporters Carl Bernstein and Mark Corallo, a former press secretary to former Attorney General John Ashcroft, but was denied on August 15, 2006.\n\nOn Sept 21, 2006, the journalists were sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. The two have repeatedly stated that they would go to prison before revealing their sources. The two avoided jail time, however, when attorney Troy Ellerman pleaded guilty on Feb. 14, 2007, to leaking the information, lying to prosecutors, obstructing justice and disobeying a court order not to disclose grand jury information. The two reporters were awarded the 2007 Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Journalism.\n\nFainaru-Wada left the \"Chronicle\" in November 2007 to join ESPN. In August 2009, Williams left the \"Chronicle\" for California Watch, a new West Coast division of the Center for Investigative Reporting.\n\nOn August 15, 2006, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White ordered Fainaru-Wada and Williams to comply with their subpoenas and testify, saying that, if they do not, they will be held in contempt and incarcerated until such time as they decide to talk or if the grand jury expires and has to be thrown out. They may also be freed from this obligation if a higher court reverses the ruling. The reporters have previously stated that they would rather go to jail than testify.\n\nFollowing Judge White's decision to uphold the subpoena, public controversy stirred concerning whether or not the two reporters should be forced to reveal their sources. While many contend that confidential sources have been utilized by the press since the beginning of its existence, others believe that by not revealing their confidential sources, Fainaru-Wada and Williams are, in effect, obstructing justice and should be punished accordingly.\n\nThose who believe that confidential sources are necessary in reporting often point to the work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of \"The Washington Post\" and their mysterious source, \"Deep Throat,\" to whom they refer several times in their articles detailing the Watergate scandal.\n\nIn an affidavit, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer stated that, \"To jail a journalist because he protected his source is an assault not only on the press, but on Californians as well.\"\n\nEve Burton, who has been the Hearst Corporation lawyer for the two reporters, said, \"I think that they [Fainaru-Wada and Williams] have the constitutional right to protect their sources. I think law-enforcement's interest in determining who leaked the information to the press has to be balanced against the significant public-reporting that these guys did. Without the laws that have protected journalists for the past thirty years,\" she contended, \"We wouldn't have had Watergate, we wouldn't have had BALCO, and we won't have the next government corruption case that comes along. That's the importance to the public in this. The reporters [must] be able to provide public information, and without the use of confidential sources -- carefully conceived, properly used -- we will not learn about important matters that involve our government.\"\n\nLance Williams also expressed a similar concern, saying, \"As far as the government coming after us, the world has changed since this story was published. In [the days of Woodward and Bernstein], the government was not going around the country subpoenaing reporters. This is a very new development. It's really an innovation of the current Attorney General, as far as I can tell. But the number of reporters subpoenaed in the past decade is not very great. And the number subpoenaed recently is a large proportion of the number subpoenaed in the past 20 to 25 years. We didn't know we were risking jail, we thought [the government] would try to find out the sources, but we really did not anticipate that it would get to this point. Because as a matter of practice, that wasn't what they were doing in those days.\"\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2007, John Conyers and Tom Davis sent Alberto Gonzales a letter asking him to withdraw the subpoenas.\n\nOn August 21, 2006, in an interview with Forrest Wilkinson of RealGM, Lance Williams was quoted as saying, \"We always thought there was a disconnect between the government's interest in steroid use. There's no question that the people who put the case [against BALCO] together bent over backwards to protect the users of the drugs, first they condoned their use of illegal drugs, then they excised all of their names from the court filings. It goes on to this day -- this attempt to protect these wealthy athletes.\"\n\nFainaru-Wada also questioned the government's motives, \"You have these high-profile athletes, multi-million dollar athletes in some cases, who were the users of the drugs and, wanting to clean up sports,\" he contended, \"[Congress] probably [should] expose those people, and yet, all those athletes are protected and their names were hidden from public file, or retracted by using generic names such as 'A Major League Baseball player', 'an NFL player', those types of things.\"\n\nAfter having published \"Game of Shadows\", it has become a topic for debate as to whether it should be acceptable to profit from material illegally disclosed to them. Both Fainaru-Wada and Williams claim that they have received little-to-no profit from their book, to this point. \"We haven't seen anything from royalties yet. All I can say is, we're not getting rich, we're not retiring, we're not buying new houses, we're not buying mansions or anything like that. I'm not going to change my status (Laughs). And I would just say, even if it did, it's not relevant. I didn't do this for the money, Lance didn't do this for the money; we did this because we love reporting, because this is a great story, and because it's an important one, and that's why we did it,\" Fainaru-Wada said in the RealGM article. He also remarked, \"Lance has a 'semi-joke' that, he did the math, and he makes, in a year, as a reporter for the Chronicle, what [Barry] Bonds makes in three innings.\" Williams went even further, saying that they had actually received an advance-payment so that they could afford to take time off work to write \"Game of Shadows\".\n\n"}
{"id": "18328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18328", "title": "Library classification", "text": "Library classification\n\nA library classification is a system of knowledge organization by which library resources are arranged and ordered. Library classifications use a notational system that represents the order of topics in the classification and allows items to be stored in that order. Library classification systems group related materials together, typically arranged in a hierarchical tree structure. A different kind of classification system, called a faceted classification system, is also widely used which allows the assignment of multiple classifications to an object, enabling the classifications to be ordered in multiple ways. The library classification numbers can be considered identifiers for resources but are distinct from the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) system.\n\nLibrary classification is an aspect of library and information science. It is distinct from scientific classification in that it has as its goal to provide a useful ordering of documents rather than a theoretical organization of knowledge. Although it has the practical purpose of creating a physical ordering of documents, it does generally attempt to adhere to accepted scientific knowledge.\n\nLibrary classification is distinct from the application of subject headings in that classification organizes knowledge into a systematic order, while subject headings provide access to intellectual materials through vocabulary terms that may or may not be organized as a knowledge system.\nThe characteristics that a bibliographic classification demands for the sake of reaching these purposes are: a useful sequence of subjects at all levels, a concise memorable notation, and a host of techniques and devices of number synthesis\n\nLibrary classifications were preceded by classifications used by bibliographers such as Conrad Gessner. The earliest library classification schemes organized books in broad subject categories. The earliest known library classification scheme is the Pinakes by Callimachus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria during the Third Century BCE. During the Renaissance and Reformation era, \"Libraries were organized according to the whims or knowledge of individuals in charge.\" This changed the format in which various materials were classified. Some collections were classified by language and others by how they were printed. \n\nAfter the printing revolution in the sixteenth century, the increase in available printed materials made such broad classification unworkable, and more granular classifications for library materials had to be developed in the nineteenth century.\n\nAlthough libraries created order within their collections from as early as the fifth century B.C., the Paris Bookseller's classification, developed in 1842 by Jacques Charles Brunet, is generally seen as the first of the modern book classifications. Brunet provided five major classes: theology, jurisprudence, sciences and arts, belles-lettres, and history.\n\nThere are many standard systems of library classification in use, and many more have been proposed over the years. However, in general, classification systems can be divided into three types depending on how they are used:\n\n\nIn terms of functionality, classification systems are often described as:\n\n\nThere are few completely enumerative systems or faceted systems; most systems are a blend but favouring one type or the other. The most common classification systems, LCC and DDC, are essentially enumerative, though with some hierarchical and faceted elements (more so for DDC), especially at the broadest and most general level. The first true faceted system was the Colon classification of S. R. Ranganathan.\n\nClassification types denote the classification or categorization according to the form or characteristics or qualities of a classification scheme or schemes. Method and system has similar meaning. Method or methods or system means the classification schemes like Dewey Decimal Classification or Universal Decimal Classification. The types of classification is for identifying and understanding or education or research purposes while classification method means those classification schemes like DDC, UDC.\nThe most common systems in English-speaking countries are:\n\nOther systems include:\n\n\n\nNewer classification systems tend to use the principle of synthesis (combining codes from different lists to represent the different attributes of a work) heavily, which is comparatively lacking in LC or DDC.\n\nLibrary classification is associated with library (descriptive) cataloging under the rubric of \"cataloging and classification\", sometimes grouped together as \"technical services\". The library professional who engages in the process of cataloging and classifying library materials is called a \"cataloger\" or \"catalog librarian\". Library classification systems are one of the two tools used to facilitate subject access. The other consists of alphabetical indexing languages such as Thesauri and Subject Headings systems.\n\nLibrary classification of a piece of work consists of two steps. Firstly, the \"aboutness\" of the material is ascertained. Next, a call number (essentially a book's address) based on the classification system in use at the particular library will be assigned to the work using the notation of the system.\n\nIt is important to note that unlike subject heading or thesauri where multiple terms can be assigned to the same work, in library classification systems, each work can only be placed in one class. This is due to shelving purposes: A book can have only one physical place. However, in classified catalogs one may have main entries as well as added entries. Most classification systems like the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and Library of Congress Classification also add a cutter number to each work which adds a code for the author of the work.\n\nClassification systems in libraries generally play two roles. Firstly, they facilitate subject access by allowing the user to find out what works or documents the library has on a certain subject. Secondly, they provide a known location for the information source to be located (e.g. where it is shelved).\n\nUntil the 19th century, most libraries had closed stacks, so the library classification only served to organize the subject catalog. In the 20th century, libraries opened their stacks to the public and started to shelve library material itself according to some library classification to simplify subject browsing.\n\nSome classification systems are more suitable for aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, Universal Decimal Classification, which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is more difficult to use for the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly faceted classification schemes are more difficult to use for shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order.\n\nDepending on the size of the library collection, some libraries might use classification systems solely for one purpose or the other. In extreme cases, a public library with a small collection might just use a classification system for location of resources but might not use a complicated subject classification system. Instead all resources might just be put into a couple of wide classes (travel, crime, magazines etc.). This is known as a \"mark and park\" classification method, more formally called reader interest classification.\n\nAs a result of differences in notation, history, use of enumeration, hierarchy, and facets, classification systems can differ in the following ways:\n\n\n"}

In a ceremony held at the Merdeka Stadium, the proclamation document was read out at exactly 0930 a.m in the presence of thousands of Malayan citizens, Malay Rulers and foreign dignitaries. The proclamation acknowledges the establishment of an independent and democratic Federation of Malaya, which came into effect on the termination of the British protectorate over nine Malay states and the end of British colonial rule in two Straits Settlements, Malacca and Penang.\n\nThe document of the declaration was signed by Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was appointed as the nation's first Prime Minister. The event is celebrated annually in Malaysia with national day \"Hari Merdeka\".\n\nThe date for Federation of Malaya's Independence on 31 August 1957 was determined after Tunku Abdul Rahman, Haji Sulaiman Palestin, Haji Ahmad Badawi, and a number of other UMNO leaders sought the views of Syeikh Abdullah Fahim, a notable \"Ulama\" from Kepala Batas, Penang. According to Syeikh Abdullah Fahim, if the British would not grant independence to Malaya on 31 August 1957, the next fitting date should be 31 August 1962. The Saturday 31 August 1957 was referred by Syeikh Abdullah Fahim as \"am khair atana\" (عام خير اتانا) in Arabic which means 'Good Year Has Come to Us'. It was confirmed in a February 1956 Alliance rally in Melaka after the Tunku had just arrived from the United Kingdom.\n\nOn the night of 30 August 1957, crowds gathered at the Royal Selangor Club Padang in Kuala Lumpur to witness the handover of power from the British. Prime Minister-designate Tunku Abdul Rahman arrived at 11:58 p.m. and joined members of the Alliance Party's youth divisions in observing two minutes of darkness. On the stroke of midnight, the lights were switched back on, and the Union Flag in the square was lowered. The new Flag of Malaya was raised as the national anthem \"Negaraku\" was played. This was followed by seven chants of \"Merdeka\" by the crowd. Tunku Abdul Rahman later gave a speech hailing the ceremony as \"greatest moment in the life of the Malayan people\". Before giving the address to the crowd, he was given a necklace by representatives of the Alliance Party youth in honour of this great occasion in history, with a map of Malaya inscribed on it. The event ended at one in the morning the next day.\n\nOn the morning of 31 August 1957, the festivities moved to the newly completed Merdeka Stadium. More than 20,000 people witnessed the ceremony, which began at 9:30 a.m. Those in attendance included rulers of the Malay states, foreign dignitaries, members of the federal cabinet, and citizens. The Queen's representative, the Duke of Gloucester presented Tunku Abdul Rahman with the instrument of independence. Tunku then proceeded to read the declaration, which culminated in the chanting of \"Merdeka!\" seven times with the crowd joining in. The ceremony continued with the raising of the National Flag of Malaya accompanied by the national anthem being played by a military band and a 21-gun salute, followed by an \"azan\" call and a thanksgiving prayer in honour of this great occasion.\n\nThe day followed with the solemn installation of the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan, at Jalan Ampang, and the first installation banquet in his honour in the evening followed by a beating retreat performance and a fireworks display. Sports events and other events marked the birth of the new nation.\n\nThe document of the declaration was written in both Malay in Jawi script and English.\n"}

{"id": "175924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175924", "title": "Persecution", "text": "Persecution\n\nPersecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another individual or group. The most common forms are religious persecution, racism and political persecution, though there is naturally some overlap between these terms. The inflicting of suffering, harassment, imprisonment, internment, fear, or pain are all factors that may establish persecution, but not all suffering will necessarily establish persecution. The suffering experienced by the victim must be sufficiently severe. The threshold level of severity has been a source of much debate.\n\nAs part of the Nuremberg Principles, crimes against humanity are part of international law. Principle VI of the Nuremberg Principles states that\nTelford Taylor, who was Counsel for the Prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials wrote \"[at] the Nuremberg war crimes trials, the tribunals rebuffed several efforts by the prosecution to bring such 'domestic' atrocities within the scope of international law as 'crimes against humanity'\". Several subsequent international treaties incorporate this principle, but some have dropped the restriction \"in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime\" that is in Nuremberg Principles.\n\nThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which is binding on 111 states, defines crimes against humanity in Article 7.1. The article criminalises certain acts \"committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack\". These include:\n\nReligious persecution is systematic mistreatment of an individual or group due to their religious affiliation. Not only theorists of secularization (who presume a decline of religiosity in general) would willingly assume that religious persecution is a thing of the past. However, with the rise of fundamentalism and religiously related terrorism, this assumption has become even more controversial. Indeed, in many countries of the world today, religious persecution is a Human Rights problem.\n\nAtheists have experienced persecution throughout history. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beating, torture, or execution. It also may refer to the confiscation or destruction of property.\n\nThe persecution of Bahá'ís refers to the religious persecution of Bahá'ís in various countries, especially in Iran, which has one of the largest Bahá'í populations in the world. The Bahá'í Faith originated in Iran, and it represents the largest religious minority in that country.\n\nThe persecution of Christians is religious persecution that Christians may undergo as a consequence of professing their faith, both historically and in the current era. Early Christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both Jews from whose religion Christianity arose and the Roman Empire which controlled much of the land across which early Christianity was distributed. Early in the fourth century, the religion was legalized by the Edict of Milan, and it eventually became the State church of the Roman Empire.\n\nChristian missionaries, as well as the people that they converted to Christianity, have been the target of persecution, many times to the point of being martyred for their faith.\n\nThere is also a history of individual Christian denominations suffering persecution at the hands of other Christians under the charge of heresy, particularly during the 16th century Protestant Reformation as well as throughout the Middle Ages when various Christian groups deemed heretical were persecuted by the Papacy.\n\nIn the 20th century, Christians have been persecuted by various groups, and by atheistic states such as the USSR and North Korea. During the Second World War members of many Christian churches were persecuted in Germany for resisting the Nazi ideology.\n\nIn more recent times the Christian missionary organization Open Doors (UK) estimates 100 million Christians face persecution, particularly in Muslim-dominated countries such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. According to the International Society for Human Rights, up to 80% of all acts of persecution are directed against people of the Christian faith.\n\nWith the Missouri extermination order Mormons became the only religious group to have a state of the United States legalize the extermination of their religion. This was after a speech given by Sideny Rigdon called the July 4th Oration which while meant to state that Mormons would defend their lives and property was taken as inflammatory. Their forcible expulsion from the state caused the death of over a hundred due to exposure, starvation, and resulting illnesses. The Mormons suffered through tarring and feathering, their lands and possessions being repeatedly taken from them, mob attacks, false imprisonments, and the US sending an army to Utah to deal with the \"Mormon problem\" in the Utah War which resulted in the Mormons massacring settlers at the Mountain Meadows Massacre. A government militia slaughtered Mormons in what is now known as the Haun's Mill massacre. The founder of the church, Joseph Smith, was killed in Carthage, Illinois by a mob of about 200 men, almost all of whom were members of the Illinois state militia including some members of the militia who were assigned to guard him.\n\nThroughout the history of Jehovah's Witnesses, their beliefs, doctrines and practices have engendered controversy and opposition from local governments, communities, and mainstream Christian groups.\n\nFalun Gong was introduced to the general public by Li Hongzhi(李洪志) in Changchun, China, in 1992. For the next few years, Falun Gong was the fastest growing \"qigong\" practice in Chinese history and, by 1999, there were between 70 and 100 million people practicing Falun Gong in China. Following the seven years of widespread popularity, on July 20, 1999, the government of the People's Republic of China began a nationwide persecution campaign against Falun Gong practitioners, except in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. In late 1999, legislation was created to outlaw \"heterodox religions\" and retroactively applied to Falun Gong. Amnesty International states that the persecution is \"politically motivated\" with \"legislation being used retroactively to convict people on driven charges, and new regulations introduced to further restrict fundamental freedoms\".\n\nPersecution of Hindus refers to the religious persecution inflicted upon Hindus. Hindus have been historically persecuted during the Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent and during Portuguese rule of Goa. In modern times, Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh have also suffered persecution. Most recently, thousands of Hindus from Sindh province in Pakistan have been fleeing to India voicing fear for their safety. After the Partition of India in 1947, there were 8.8 million Hindus in Pakistan (excluding Bangladesh) in 1951. In 1951, Hindus constituted 22% of the Pakistani population (including present-day Bangladesh which formed part of Pakistan). Today, the Hindu minority amounts to 1.7 percent of Pakistan's population.\nThe Bangladesh Liberation War (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in \"Time\" magazine dated 2 August 1971, stated \"The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred.\" Senator Edward Kennedy wrote in a report that was part of United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations testimony dated 1 November 1971, \"Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked \"H\". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad\". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. In a syndicated column \"The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored\", Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Sydney Schanberg wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. \"Other reminders were the yellow \"H\"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army\" (by \"Muslim army\", meaning the Pakistan Army, which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), (Newsday, 29 April 1994).\nIn Bangladesh, on 28 February 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the Vice President of the Jamaat-e-Islami to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Following the sentence, activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir attacked the Hindus in different parts of the country. Hindu properties were looted, Hindu houses were burnt into ashes and Hindu temples were desecrated and set on fire. The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu homes, the rape of Hindu women, and the desecration and destruction of, according to community leaders, more than 50 Hindu temples; 1,500 Hindu homes were destroyed in 20 districts. While the government has held the Jamaat-e-Islami responsible for the attacks on the minorities, the Jamaat-e-Islami leadership has denied any involvement. The minority leaders have protested the attacks and appealed for justice. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has directed the law enforcement to start \"suo motu\" investigation into the attacks. US Ambassador to Bangladesh express concern about attack of Jamaat on Bengali Hindu community.\n\nPersecution of Jews is a recurring phenomenon throughout Jewish history. It has occurred on numerous occasions and in widely different geographical locations. It may include pogroms, looting and demolition of private and public Jewish property (e.g., Kristallnacht), unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, torture, killing, or even mass execution (in World War II alone, approximately 6 million people were deliberately killed for the sole reason of being Jewish). They have been expelled from their hometowns/countries, hoping to find havens in other polities. In recent times anti-Semitism has often been manifested as Anti-Zionism, despite the fact that there are various Jewish groups whose members themselves oppose the idea of Zionism.\n\nThe persecution of Muslims has been a recurring phenomenon throughout the history of Islam. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beatings, torture, or execution. It may also refer to the confiscation or destruction of property, or incitement to hate Muslims.\n\nPersecution can extend beyond those who perceive themselves to be Muslims and include those who are perceived by others as Muslims, or it can include Muslims who are considered non-Muslims by fellow Muslims. The Ahmadiyya regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and \"heretics\". In 1984, the Government of Pakistan, under General Zia-ul-Haq, passed Ordinance XX, which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as Muslims. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, Mirza Tahir Ahmad migrated to London.\n\nThe 1984 anti-Sikh riots or the 1984 Sikh Massacre was a series of pogroms directed against Sikhs in India, by anti-Sikh mobs, in response to the assassination of Indira Gandhi, on 31 October 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards in response to her actions authorising the military operation Operation Blue Star. There were more than 8,000 deaths, including 3,000 in Delhi. In June 1984, during Operation Blue Star, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to attack the Golden Temple and eliminate any insurgents, as it had been occupied by Sikh separatists who were stockpiling weapons. Later operations by Indian paramilitary forces were initiated to clear the separatists from the countryside of Punjab state.\nThe Indian government reported 2,700 deaths in the ensuing chaos. In the aftermath of the riots, the Indian government reported 20,000 had fled the city, however the People's Union for Civil Liberties reported \"at least\" 1,000 displaced persons. The most affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods in Delhi. The Central Bureau of Investigation, the main Indian investigating agency, is of the opinion that the acts of violence were organized with the support from the then Delhi police officials and the central government headed by Indira Gandhi's son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as Prime Minister after his mother's death and, when asked about the riots, said \"when a big tree falls, the earth shakes\" thus trying to justify the communal strife.\nThere are allegations that the government destroyed evidence and shielded the guilty. The \"Asian Age\" front-page story called the government actions \"the Mother of all Cover-ups\" There are allegations that the violence was led and often perpetrated by Indian National Congress activists and sympathisers during the riots. The chief weapon used by the mobs, kerosene, was supplied by a group of Indian National Congress Party leaders who owned filling stations.\n\nEthnic persecution refers to perceived persecution based on ethnicity. Its meaning is parallel to that of racism, (based on race). The Rwandan genocide remains an atrocity that the indigenous Hutu and Tutsi peoples still believe is unforgivable. The Japanese occupation of China caused the death of millions of people, mostly peasants who were murdered after the Doolittle Raid in early-World War II.\n\nThe persecution of ethnic Germans refers to systematic activity against groups of ethnic Germans based on their ethnicity. \n\nHistorically, this has been due to two causes: the German population was considered, whether factually or not, linked with German nationalist regimes such as those of the Nazis or Kaiser Wilhelm. This was the case in the World War I era persecution of Germans in the United States, and also in Eastern and Central Europe following the end of World War II. While many victims of these persecutions did not, in fact, have any connection to those regimes, cooperation between German minority organisations and Nazi regime did occur, as the example of Selbstschutz shows, which is still used as a pretense of hostilities against those who did not take part in such organisations. After World War II, many such Volksdeutsche were killed or driven from their homes in acts of vengeance, others in ethnic cleansing of territories prior to populating them with citizens of the annexing country. In other cases (e.g. in the case of the formerly large German-speaking populations of Russia, Estonia, or the Transylvanian (Siebenbürgen) German minority in Rumania and the Balkans) such persecution was a crime committed against innocent communities who had played no part in the Third Reich.\n\nThe Hazara people of central Afghanistan have been persecuted by Afghan rulers at various times in the history. Since the tragedy of 9/11, Sunni Muslim terrorists have been attacking the Hazara community in southwestern Pakistani town of Quetta, home to some 500,000 Hazara who fled persecution in neighbouring Afghanistan. Some 2,400 men, women and children have been killed or wounded with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claiming responsibility for most of the attacks against the community. Consequently, many thousands have fled the country seeking asylum in Australia.\n\nAntiziganism is hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed against the Romani people as an ethnic group, or people who are perceived as being of Romani heritage.\n\nThe \"Porajmos\" was the planned and attempted effort, often described as a genocide, during World War II by the government of Nazi Germany and its allies to exterminate the Romani (Gypsy) people of Europe. Under the rule of Adolf Hitler, a supplementary decree to the Nuremberg Laws was issued on 26 November 1935, defining Gypsies as \"enemies of the race-based state\", the same category as Jews. Thus, the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews. Historians estimate that 220,000 to 500,000 Romani were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators, or more than 25% of the slightly less than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time. Ian Hancock puts the death toll as high as 1.5 million.\n\nThe UN human rights chief slammed Myanmar's apparent \"systematic attack\" on the Rohingya minority, warning that \"ethnic cleansing\" seemed to be underway.\nEthnic Rohingya Muslims fleeing security forces in Myanmar’s Rakhine State have described killings, shelling, and arson in their villages that have all the hallmarks of a campaign of “ethnic cleansing,” Human Rights Watch said.\n“Rohingya refugees have harrowing accounts of fleeing Burmese army attacks and watching their villages be destroyed,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director. “Lawful operations against armed groups do not involve burning the local population out of their homes.” \n\nPersecution on the basis of albinism is frequently based on the belief that albinos are inferior to persons with higher concentration of melanin in their skin. As a result, albinos have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinistic people dug up and desecrated. Such people have also been ostracized and even killed because they are presumed to bring \"bad\" luck in some areas. Haiti also has a long history of treating albinistic people as accursed, with the highest incidence under the influence of François \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier.\n\nPeople with autism spectrum disorders have commonly been victims of persecution, both throughout history and in the present era. In Cameroon children with autism are commonly accused of witchcraft and singled out for torture and even death.\n\nAdditionally, it is speculated that many of the disabled children murdered during Action T4 in Nazi Germany may have been autistic, making autistic people among the first victims of The Holocaust.\n\nA number of countries, especially those in the Western world, have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the United Nations passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights and, in 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in all states of the United States.\n\nPersecution on the basis of army service (or the lack of it) operates in Israeli society. In the State of Israel, Jewish citizens who receive an exemption from service in the Israel Defense Forces cannot take up many prestigious career options, especially in the field of security. The root of discrimination on the basis of army service lies in the practice that at age 17, non-Arab citizens (including Druze) are called up to be examined for eligibility to compulsory military service. A record for each potential conscript is made. Those who actually serve in the military are distinguished from those rejected from service by a Discharge Card, which has additional information on it, including the soldier's rank, military profession, and behavior during army service. Potential employers show a particular interest in Discharge Cards, since they constitute a universally available source of information about a potential employee. Employers frequently look down upon citizens rejected from the army, typically believing that \"those who are unfit for army service are also unfit for the work environment\", and that those who succeeded in the army are also likely to become good employees. Job advertisements in Israel very frequently specify a requirement of \"Full Army Service\", thus the decisions taken by the draft board regarding a 17-year-old minor may affect entire careers.\n\nIn fiction, Robert A.

It is of particular note in two areas: in the politics of the Netherlands and Belgium and in the politics of the United States. \n\n\"Purple\" () is the nickname of a government coalition of social democrats and liberals, excluding Christian democrats. It is derived from the combination of the colour of the social democrats (red) and liberals (blue).\n\nBoth the Netherlands and Belgium have had such governments. In the Netherlands the two cabinets of Prime Minister Wim Kok (Kok I and Kok II, 1994–2002) were composed of social democrats (the Labour Party, PvdA), conservative liberals (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, VVD) and progressive liberals (Democrats 66).\n\nIn the 2010 Dutch cabinet formation the possibilities for a \"Purple-plus\" cabinet (the original \"purple\" coalition of PvdA, VVD, D66 plus GreenLeft) was investigated. Since 5 November 2012, following the 2012 Dutch general election, the VVD has been the senior partner in the second Rutte cabinet, a grand coalition Purple government with the PvdA.\n\nIn October 2013 the Second Rutte cabinet (VVD and PvdA), which has no majority in the \"Senate\", reached a budgetary agreement with D66 and the smaller Christian parties Christian Union (CU) and the Reformed Political Party (SGP). This occasional coalition is nicknamed \"purple plus the Bible\" (\"Paars met de Bijbel\") as it includes the purple parties VVD, PvdA and D66 plus the Bible-minded parties CU and SGP. The term \"purple plus the Bible\" had already been used in February that year, when the same parties reached an agreement on modernising the housing market. Secretary of Financial Affairs, Jeroen Dijsselbloem (PvdA) now calls D66, CU and SGP his \"most beloved opposition parties\". The three parties are very influential on the policy of the Second Rutte cabinet, because without the support of the three parties, new parliamentary elections are inevitable.\n\nIn the municipal elections of 19 March 2014 D66, CU and SGP did well. D66 for instance, became the biggest party in Amsterdam and The Hague, beating the PvdA. The CU became the biggest party in Zwolle, hometown of CU-leader Arie Slob. All three parties were rewarded for their so-called \"constructive co-operation\" with the cabinet. However, the coalition parties VVD and PvdA lost a lot of seats (PvdA lost its majority in Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Groningen etc. and the VVD did equally bad).\n\nIn Belgian politics, the term is used as a term for the two federal governments of Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, from 1999 to 2008. These cabinets consisted of the Flemish and Francophone social-democratic parties (SP.A and PS) and the Flemish and Francophone liberal parties (Flemish Liberals and Democrats and the Liberal Reformist Party, which later became Open VLD and the Reformist Movement). The first government also included the Flemish and Francophone green parties Agalev and Ecolo.\n\nIn the United States, a purple state is one where popular support for the Republican Party (red) and Democratic Party (blue) is approximately equal; such states, in elections for the President of the United States, are termed \"swing states\" and are highly targeted on account of the Electoral College system of electing the President of the United States. Purple states can also appear with the control of different branches. For example, a Democrat governor with Republican controlled state legislature, or a Republican governor with Democrat controlled state legislature.\n"}

In 1766 the Grand Duke instructed Trentine physiologist Felice Fontana to gather the collections of scientific instruments housed in the Pitti Palace. In 1771 he also collected a large part of the Medici instruments that were kept in the \"Stanzino delle Matematiche\" (Mathematics Room) of the Uffizi Gallery. Restoration works of the Torrigiani Palace, that had to become home to the Reale Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale, began in 1772.\n\nOn the iniziative of the Grand Duke, Fontana was surrounded with a small group of young scholars which included Giovanni Fabbroni, with whom Fontana established a close relationship.\n\nThe museum was officially opened in 1775 under the direction of Fontana, who was supported by Fabbroni as deputy director.\n\nSince its foundation, the Reale Museo housed scientific instruments, natural specimens and a large collection of anatomical wax models that came from previous collections or were specially made to be displayed in the new museum.\n\nThe very first nucleus of the scientific instruments housed in the museum came from the physics laboratory in the Pitti Palace. Then came 202 objects from the Medici collections in the Uffizi Gallery, that comprised measuring, mathematical and astronomical instruments—including Galileo's geometrical and military compass and the lens he used to observe the sky, Egnazio Danti's instrument of the Primum Mobile, Giovan Battista Giusti's quadrants, Della Volpaia's sundials and nocturnals, and Antonio Santucci's armillary sphere. Finally, the instruments of the Accademia del Cimento were moved from the Pitti Palace to the Reale Museo as well.\n\nAs far as natural history specimens, the museum housed the collections rearranged by Targioni Tozzetti, including Pier Antonio Micheli's herbaria and the collections of Dutch naturalist Georg Everhard Rumph and Danish physician and geologist Niels Steensen.\n\nThe engagement of wax modeller Clemente Susini made it possible to create a great lot of anatomical wax models portraying human body's musculature, internal organs, bones, the eye, the ear, and the nose. Six rooms were needed to display the many wax models.\n\nThe collection first core was enlarged in the following years with new exhibits that were made—first for studying reasons, then especially for educational reasons—by the workshops that were housed in the Torrigiani Palace since the Reale Museum's beginnings.\n\nThe Torrigiani Palace bordered Boboli Gardens—and this was a good chance to create a botanical garden, whose direction was entrusted to Attilio Zuccagni. The garden sheltered several species of plants classified according to Linnaean taxonomy, that assigned an appropriate name and class to each plant, pointing out its possible medical use as well.\n\nWhile the renovation works of the palace were underway, Fontana had already a mind to turn the \"Torrino\" (small tower) into an astronomical and meteorological observatory. When in 1775 he met Johann III Bernoulli, astronomer to the King of Prussia and director of the Berlin observatory, Fontana asked him some suggestions, but the grand-ducal court agreed only partly with Bernoulli's ideas. The shortage of skilled craftsmen made Fontana decide to buy the needed instruments in London. The great expenses caused a big time lag in the completion of works, that continued until 1796, when Fabbroni assigned the astronomer Domenico de Vecchi the responsibility of reorganizing the observatory and beginning to collect astronomical data.\n\nFontana thought that the museum had to be arranged according to the order of nature, appropriately classified. The ground floor housed, in addition to the storerooms, minerals from Tuscany and the chemistry laboratory; the physics laboratory, the library and the zoology collections were located at the first floor; wax models, stuffed animals, fossils, and precious stones were on display at the second floor. Visitors and scholars were thus able to travel from microcosm—chemistry—through the elements of nature, to macrocosm—astronomy—in the observatory.\n\nFontana would have liked to found a \"society of scientists\"—a new Accademia del Cimento—aimed at researching and disseminating new discoveries, but the grand-ducal court didn't support his plan because it was too expensive. Fabbroni, who took Fontana's place as museum director in 1805, complemented research with educational activity. But it was only his successor, Girolamo Bardi, who was able to open a \"liceo\" [high school] in the Torrigiani Place in 1807.\n\nThe first chairs to be established were Botanics and Anatomy—hold by Ottaviano Targioni Tozzetti and the surgeon Filippo Uccelli respectively—but four more were soon created. The subjects taught in the \"liceo\" were six, namely Chemistry, Experimental and theoretical physics, Astronomy, Natural history, and Comparative anatomy.\n\nThe \"liceo\" was actually a short-life adventure, because Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Lorraine—who came back into power after Napoleon I's fall—wanted the museum to interrupt educational activities and go back to conservation and research.\n\nVincenzo Antinori, who became the museum director in 1829, started again the pedagogical project and established the chairs of Physics, Comparative anatomy and zoology, and mineralogy and geology, which were granted to Leopoldo Nobili, Gaspero Mazzi and Filippo Nesti respectively. Educational and museological duties were closely connected as the full professors were the curators of the collections as well. New chairs were created in the following years, so making the \"liceo\" a more and more important institute for both specialized studies and research.\n\nIn 1839, on the occasion of the First Conference of Italian Scientists in Pisa, the attendees celebrated the development of meteorological studies and stressed the need for turning meteorology into a science. The museum welcomed this hope and in 1844 released a memorandum asking Italian observatories to help in the creation of a Central Meteorological Archives. The goal was collecting, arranging and publishing all data from meteorological observations in Italy. Cooperation and the exchange of information was regarded as the condition necessary to the advancement of meteorology in Italy and worldwide. Accordingly, the Archives established a close network of relationships with observatories as well as European and US. scientists.\n\nIn 1859 the museum was turned into the section of Physical and Natural Sciences of the Istituto di Studi Superiori Pratici e di Perfezionamento (Institute for Advanced and Specialized Studies), that was founded in Florence by the Provisional Government of Tuscany.\n\nFrom then on, educational activities, research and conservation of the collections became more and more separated. In 1872 astronomical observations were moved to the new Observatory at Arcetri. The instruments and machines used for teaching were placed in the various sections of the Istituto, which were destined to become the departments of the University of Florence. Zoology collections remained in the Torrigiani Palace, which is today home to La Specola Museum. Botanical specimens were gathered in the Giardino dei Semplici (the botanical garden). The exhibit of historical instruments in the Tribune of Galileo and the adjacent rooms remained unchanged and in 1874 was named Museo degli Strumenti Antichi di Astronomia e di Fisica (Museum of Ancient Astronomical and Physics Instruments). In 1875, Ferdinando Meucci began to catalogue those instruments that in 1929, after some ups and downs, became the patrimony of the Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza—today's Museo Galileo.\n\nArchival records produced by the Reale Museo between 1780 and 1872, which were first stored in the Department of Physics at the University of Florence, are today housed in the Museo Galileo's Library.\n\nThis collection is the most important source to reconstruct the history of the Reale Museo and its relationships with the main scientific institutions in Europe as well as to know the many instruments of the museum collections and the related events.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11175690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11175690", "title": "Salamanders in folklore", "text": "Salamanders in folklore\n\nThe salamander is an amphibian of the order Urodela which, as with many real creatures, often has been ascribed fantastic and sometimes occult qualities by pre-modern authors (as in the allegorical descriptions of animals in medieval bestiaries) not possessed by the real organism. The legendary salamander is often depicted as a typical salamander in shape, with a lizard-like form, but is usually ascribed an affinity with fire, sometimes specifically elemental fire.\n\nThis legendary creature embodies the fantastic qualities that ancient and medieval commentators ascribed to the natural salamander. Many of these qualities are rooted in verifiable traits of the natural creature but often exaggerated. A large body of legend, mythology, and symbolism has developed around this creature over the centuries.\n\nIn one of the earliest surviving descriptions of a salamander, Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) noted that the creature is \"an animal like a lizard in shape and with a body specked all over; it never comes out except during heavy showers and goes away the moment the weather becomes clear.\" All of these traits, even down to the star-like markings, are consistent with the golden Alpine salamander (\"Salamandra atra aurorae\") of Europe that has golden or yellow spots or blotches on its back and some similarly marked subspecies of the fire salamander (\"Salamandra salamandra\"). Pliny even made the important distinction between salamanders and lizards, which are similar in shape but different in other respects, which was not systematized until modern times, when biologists classified lizards as reptiles and salamanders as amphibians.\n\nPliny recounts several other traits which are less credible, such as the ability to extinguish fire with the frigidity of their bodies, a quality which was reported as hearsay by Aristotle (384–322 BCE). While Pliny notes this in Book 10, Chapter 86 of the \"Natural History\", in Book 29, Chapter 23 of the same work he views this idea with skepticism, pointing out that if such an idea were true, it should be easy to demonstrate.\n\nPliny also notes medicinal and poisonous properties, which are founded in fact on some level, since many species of salamander, including fire salamanders and Alpine salamanders, excrete toxic, physiologically active substances. These substances are often excreted when the animal is threatened, which has the effect of deterring predators. The extent of these properties is greatly exaggerated though, with a single salamander being regarded as so toxic that by twining around a tree it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well could slay all who drank from it.\n\nThe salamander is also mentioned in the Talmud (Hagiga 27a) as a creature that is a product of fire, and it relates that anyone who is smeared with its blood will be immune to harm from fire. Rashi (1040–1105), the primary commentator on the Talmud, describes the salamander as one which is produced by burning a fire in the same place for seven years. \n\nSaint Augustine in the \"City of God\" used the example of salamanders to argue for the possibility of humans being punished by being burned in eternal flame in Purgatory. He wrote \"If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which burns is not consumed.\"\n\nA frequently-cited illustration of a salamander is presented in an influential 20th-century occult work by Manly P. Hall, \"Secret Teachings of All Ages\", in which it is attributed to Paracelsus. This illustration appears to originate in a 1527 anti-papal tract by Andreas Osiander and Hans Sachs, where it is identified as \"the Pope as a monster\". Its association with Paracelsus derives from his \"Auslegung der Magischen Figuren im Carthäuser Kloster zu Nũrnberg\" in which the author presents explanations of some illustrations found in a Carthusian monastery in Nuremberg; the illustration in question he labels as \"a salamander or desolate worm with a human head and crowned with a crown and a pope hat thereon,\" which is later explained to represent the Pope. Catholic Archbishop Raymund Netzhammer (1862–1945) explained that the set of woodcuts it belongs to was commissioned by Osiander based on some old \"pope illustrations\" found at the monastery, which Netzhammer thought may have dated back to the time of Joachim of Fiore (d. 1202) and were intended as cartoons mocking the Pope and the Church.\n\nDescriptions of the legendary form are more likely to use stylized depictions. In Medieval European bestiaries, fanciful depictions of salamanders include \"a satyr-like creature in a circular wooden tub\" (8th century), \"a worm penetrating flames\" (12th century), \"a winged dog\" (13th century), and \"a small bird in flames\" (13th century). \nCompared to Medieval depictions, Renaissance depictions are characteristically more realistic, adhering more closely to the Classical description. In another example, a 1556 edition of the \"Book of Lambspring\" depicts the salamander as a white bird, while Lucas Jennis' 1625 version of the same illustration, included in the \"Musaeum Hermeticum\", depicts it as a lizard-like animal with star-like markings (see right).\n\nOf all the traits ascribed to salamanders, the ones relating to fire have stood out most prominently. This connection probably originates from a behavior common to many species of salamander: hibernating in and under rotting logs. When wood was brought indoors and put on the fire, the creatures \"mysteriously\" appeared from the flames. The 16th-century Italian artist Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571) famously recalled witnessing just such an appearance as a child in his autobiography. According to some writers, the milky substance that a salamander exudes when frightened and which makes its skin moist gave rise to the idea that the salamander could withstand any heat and even put out fires.\n\nAnother idea which is found in several Medieval and Renaissance works was that \"Egyptian priests\" used a hieroglyph which applied the figure of a salamander to represent a man who is burnt, or in other versions a man who has died from cold. This tradition is first found in the \"Hieroglyphica\" of Horapollo (Book 2, Ch. LXII), but it is not now considered to be an authentic representation of hieroglyphic usage.\n\nEarly commentators in Europe often grouped \"crawling things\" (\"reptiles\" or \"reptilia\" in Latin) together, and thus creatures in this group, which typically included salamanders (Latin \"salamandrae\"), dragons (Latin \"dracones\" or \"serpentes\"), and basilisks (Latin \"basilisci\"), were often associated, as in Conrad Lycosthenes' \"Prodigiorum ac ostentorum chronicon\" of 1557.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) wrote the following on the salamander: \"This has no digestive organs, and gets no food but from the fire, in which it constantly renews its scaly skin. The salamander, which renews its scaly skin in the fire,—for virtue.\" Later, Paracelsus (1493–1541) suggested that the salamander was the elemental of fire, which has had substantial influence on the role of salamanders in the occult. Paracelsus, contrary to the prevalent view of the time, considered them to be not devils but similar to humans — only lacking souls (along with giants, dwarves, mermaids, elves, and elemental spirits in human form). Francis I of France used the salamander as his symbol.\n\nThe salamander is found throughout French folklore, although in differing form. In addition or sometimes instead of its fire symbolism, it was attributed a powerful poison. Some legends say that merely by falling into a well, it would poison the water, and by climbing a fruit tree, poison the fruit. Its highly toxic breath was reportedly enough to swell a person until their skin broke; in Auvergne, it supposedly did the same to herds of cattle. This gained it the name of \"bellows breath\". Like the real animal, the legendary salamander breathed seldom; unlike the real salamander, the only way to kill one was said to be to lock it in a confined space so that it breathed its own poison. The Bretons feared it so they did not dare say its real name for fear it would hear and then kill them.\n\nEarly travelers to China were shown garments supposedly woven from salamander hair or wool; the cloth was completely unharmed by fire. The garments had actually been woven from asbestos. \nAccording to T. H. White, Prester John had a robe made from it; the \"Emperor of India\" possessed a suit made from a thousand skins; and Pope Alexander III had a tunic which he valued highly. William Caxton (1481) wrote: \"This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre.\" \nHolme (1688) wrote: \"...I have several times put [salamander hair] in the Fire and made it red hot and after taken it out, which being cold, yet remained perfect wool.\"\n\nAn alternative interpretation was that this material was a kind of silk: A 12th-century letter supposedly from Prester John says, \"Our realm yields the worm known as the salamander. Salamanders live in fire and make cocoons, which our court ladies spin and use to weave cloth and garments. To wash and clean these fabrics, they throw them into flames.\" Friar also notes that Marco Polo believed that the \"true\" salamander was an incombustible substance found in the earth.\n\nA newt is a type of salamander, and they are traditionally associated with witchcraft. In William Shakespeare's famous play \"Macbeth\", the witches use the \"eye of newt\" as the first ingredient stirred in their cauldron. However, the famous line in \"Macbeth\" is actually referring to a series of plants. Eye of newt refers to mustard, which reiterates the link between salamanders and fire as mustard seeds are used as a \"fiery\" spice.\n\n"}

{"id": "27796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27796", "title": "Succubus", "text": "Succubus\n\nA succubus is a demon in female form, or supernatural entity in folklore (traced back to medieval legend), that appears in dreams and takes the form of a woman in order to seduce men, usually through sexual activity. The male counterpart is the incubus. Religious traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with a succubus may result in the deterioration of health or mental state, or even death.\n\nIn modern representations, a succubus may or may not appear in dreams and is often depicted as a highly attractive seductress or enchantress; whereas, in the past, succubi were generally depicted as frightening and demonic.\n\nThe word is derived from Late Latin \"succuba\" \"paramour\"; from \"succubare\" \"to lie beneath\" (\"sub-\" \"under\" and \"cubare\" \"to lie in bed\"), used to describe the sleeper's position to the supernatural being as well. The word \"succubus\" originates from the late 14th century.\n\nAccording to Zohar and the Alphabet of Ben Sira, Lilith was Adam's first wife, who later became a succubus. She left Adam and refused to return to the Garden of Eden after she mated with archangel Samael. In Zoharistic Kabbalah, there were four succubi who mated with the archangel Samael. There were four original queens of the demons: Lilith, Eisheth, Agrat bat Mahlat, and Naamah. A succubus may take a form of a beautiful young girl but closer inspection may reveal deformities of her body, such as bird-like claws or serpentine tails. Folklore also describes the act of sexually penetrating a succubus as akin to entering a cavern of ice, and there are reports of succubi forcing men to perform cunnilingus on their vulvas that drip with urine and other fluids. In later folklore, a succubus took the form of a siren.\n\nThroughout history, priests and rabbis, including Hanina Ben Dosa and Abaye, tried to curb the power of succubi over humans. However, not all succubi were malevolent. According to Walter Map in the satire \"De Nugis Curialium\" (\"Trifles of Courtiers\"), Pope Sylvester II (999–1003) was allegedly involved with a succubus named Meridiana, who helped him achieve his high rank in the Catholic Church. Before his death, he confessed of his sins and died repentant.\n\nAccording to the Kabbalah and the school of Rashba, the original three queens of the demons, Agrat Bat Mahlat, Naamah, Eisheth Zenunim, and all their cohorts give birth to children, except Lilith. According to other legends, the children of Lilith are called Lilin.\n\nAccording to the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", or \"Witches' Hammer\", written by Heinrich Kramer (Institoris) in 1486, succubi collect semen from men they seduce. Incubi, or male demons, then use the semen to impregnate human females, thus explaining how demons could apparently sire children despite the traditional belief that they were incapable of reproduction. Children so begotten – cambions – were supposed to be those that were born deformed, or more susceptible to supernatural influences. While the book does not address why a human female impregnated with the semen of a human male would not produce regular human offspring, an explanation could be that the semen is altered before being transferred to the female host. However in some lore, the child is born deformed because the conception was unnatural.\n\nKing James in his dissertation titled Dæmonologie refutes the possibility for angelic entities to reproduce and instead offered a suggestion that a devil would carry out two methods of impregnating women: the first, to steal the sperm out of a dead man and deliver it into a woman. If a demon could extract the semen quickly, the transportation of the substance could not be instantly transported to a female host, causing it to go cold. This explains his view that succubae and incubi were the same demonic entity only to be described differently based on the tormented sexes being conversed with. The second method was the idea that a dead body could be possessed by a devil, causing it to rise and have sexual relations with others. However, there is no mention of a female corpse being possessed to elicit sex from men.\n\nIn Arabian mythology, the \"qarînah\" () is a spirit similar to the succubus, with origins possibly in ancient Egyptian religion or in the animistic beliefs of pre-Islamic Arabia. A qarînah \"sleeps with the person and has relations during sleep as is known by the dreams.\" They are said to be invisible, but a person with \"second sight\" can see them, often in the form of a cat, dog, or other household pet. \"In Omdurman it is a spirit which possesses. ... Only certain people are possessed and such people cannot marry or the qarina will harm them.\" To date, many African myths claim that men who have similar experience with such principality (succubus) in dreams (usually in form of a beautiful woman) find themselves exhausted as soon as they awaken; often claiming spiritual attack upon them. Local rituals/divination are often invoked in order to appeal the god for divine protection and intervention.\n\nIn the field of medicine, there is some belief that the stories relating to encounters with succubi bear resemblance to the contemporary phenomenon of people reporting alien abductions, which has been ascribed to the condition known as sleep paralysis. It is therefore suggested that historical accounts of people experiencing encounters with succubi may rather have been symptoms of sleep paralysis, with the hallucination of the said creatures coming from their contemporary culture.\n\nThroughout history, succubi have been popular characters in music, literature, film, television, and especially as video game and manga/anime characters.\n"}

The exhibit is roughly two stories tall and 35-feet in diameter. What makes this exhibit truly special is that it is a walk-through exhibit, allowing visitors to explore the different areas of the heart .\n\nThe original idea for the walk-through heart exhibit came from Dr. Mildred Pfeiffer, a physician and Director of Cardiovascular Diseases at the Pennsylvania Department of Health who would travel giving lectures about the heart and heart health, proposed the idea of the heart in an effort to have a centralized resource that people could visit and learn of the heart. The original materials used to construct the heart were papier-mâché, chicken wire and lumber.\n\nThe Giant Heart was supposed to have only been on display for six months, but now over 50 years later, it remains one of the most visited exhibits at The Franklin Institute\n\nThe Giant Heart and its accompanying exhibit, Bio-science Exhibit, have since been remodeled and updated. The Bio-science exhibit as a whole carries on the tradition of teaching and sparking interest in the science of the human body.\n\n"}

It is the continuation of \"Yön\", an influential political magazine in Turkey in the 1960s. \"Türk Solu\" was formed following a split in the Workers' Party (İP). The magazine is led by Gökçe Fırat Çulhaoğlu and is based in Istanbul.\n\nThey consider themselves as nationalist, socialist and Kemalist. They often promote Nationalism, Socialism and Secularism. However, unlike other Socialists, they criticise Marx often and they consider Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and Sultan Galiev as ideologues of Turkic Socialism. They are influenced by Attila İlhan, Doğan Avcıoğlu and Şevket Süreyya Aydemir also. They have been in favour of Yasser Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Il, Muammar Gaddafi and Hugo Chavez because of their Socialism and Third Worldism, Rauf Denktaş and Rebiya Kadeer because of their Pan-Turkism.\n\nThey support good relations with Turkic and Islamic countries and they view the USA, Israel, EU, Russia and China as enemies of Turkey.\n\nThey are often criticised for their views on Kurds. Especially their \"Kurdish Invasion in Turkish Cities\" theory is famous. They defend themselves with saying that Turkey is a nation-state and even saying \"I'm Kurd\" is separatism. They defend it with Nation definition of Turkish constitution. According to it, \"every citizen of Turkey is Turkish, regardless of ethnic group, race and religion.\"\nTürksolu defends that Kurds should melt in Turkish pot.\n\nUnlike most of Kemalists, they also admire Ottomans and defend its legacy except 19th-century Ottomans. They see Osman I and Atatürk as similar leaders, who both created new states instead serving a defeated, perished state. Despite they also appropriate Mehmed II, Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent, they see Mahmud II, Abdulhamid II and Mehmed VI as traitors, they have a similar view of other last era Ottoman sultans.\n\nThe group publishes \"Türksolu\" and \"İleri\" and founded a political party called Ulusal Parti.\n\n"}
{"id": "2487950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2487950", "title": "Uttering", "text": "Uttering\n\nUttering is a crime involving a person with the intent to defraud that knowingly sells, publishes or passes a forged or counterfeited document. More specifically, forgery creates a falsified document and uttering is the act of knowingly passing on or using the forged document.\n\nIn the law of countries whose legal systems derive from English common law, uttering is a crime similar to forgery. Uttering and forgery were originally common law offences, both misdemeanours. Forgery was the creation of a forged document, with the intent to defraud; whereas uttering was merely use — the \"passing\" — of a forged document, that someone else had made, with the intent to defraud. In law, uttering is synonymous with publication, and the distinction made between the common law offences was that forgery was the \"fabrication\" of a forged instrument (with the intent to defraud) and uttering was the \"publication\" of that instrument (with the intent to defraud). Statute law offences of forgery replace the common law offences nowadays, often subsuming the offence of uttering, and forgery is usually a felony rather than a misdemeanour.\n\n\"Uttering a forged document\" is a criminal offence in Canada, contrary to s 368 of the Criminal Code. It is an indictable offence and is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.\n\nSee section 36 of the Forgery Act 1861.\n\nHistory\n\nSee section 6 of the Forgery Act 1913.\n\nSection 29(1)(i) of the Larceny Act 1916 formerly created the offence of uttering a letter or writing demanding property with menaces.\n\nIn Scotland \"Uttering forged writings\" is a crime defined as \"using as genuine a fabricated writing falsely intended to pass as genuine the writing of another person\".\n\nIn the U.S., uttering is the act of offering a forged document to another when the offeror has knowledge that the document is forged. Uttering does not require that the person who presented the document actually forged or altered the document. For example, forging a log for personal profit might be considered uttering and publishing. Another example would be the forging of a university diploma. As an example of the law itself, the State of Michigan defines the offense (MCL 750.249): \"Any person who utters and publishes as true any false, forged, altered or counterfeit record, deed, instrument or other writing specified, knowing it to be false, altered, forged, or counterfeit, with intent to injure or defraud is guilty of uttering and publishing.\"\n\nForging or illegal \"publishing\" of an official or unofficial document is not the essence of uttering. Uttering is the actual presentation of forged or official documentation as one's own.\n\n"}

The film collection consists of more than 5,000 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, and Super 8mm prints and the video collection includes more than 35,000 items on DVD, Blu-ray, LaserDisc, and VHS. The Film Study Center engages in the conservation, preservation, presentation, and circulation of moving image materials. The Film Study Center is an Associate of the International Federation of Film Archives.\n\nFounded in 1982, the Film Study Center archive traces its roots to film collections at Yale dating back to the 1960s, including the historic archives of a number of prominent film collectors. The FSC is currently involved in efforts to preserve film on film and to share its collection through public screenings, to ensure that films can continue to be presented as they were originally seen by audiences.\n\nThe film collection of the Film Study Center is made up of a wide range of holdings, from Hollywood features to experimental shorts, from home movies to Bollywood musicals. The collection spans more than 120 years of cinema history, and includes films from around the globe as well as a number of films made by Yale alumni and about Yale and New Haven.\n\nResearchers can view films on site in the Film Study Center’s two screening rooms, which are capable of showing 16mm film and multiple video formats. One of these rooms is also equipped for screening 3D Blu-rays. The FSC also has two flatbed film viewing stations and twelve private video viewing booths for individual use. The FSC regularly screens its 35mm prints for the public in the Whitney Humanities Center Auditorium, the last 35mm-equipped public venue in New Haven County.\n\nFilm Study Center staff regularly consult on special film projects around the University, including the preservation of film material in the Benny Goodman Collection in the Irving Gilmore Music Library of the Yale University Library.\n\nIn 1968, Yale began collecting 16mm film with the purchase of several hundred prints known as the John Griggs Collection of Classic Films. The Griggs films came to Yale largely through the efforts of experimental filmmaker Standish Lawder, then Assistant Professor in Yale’s History of Art Department, and Yale alumnus Spencer Berger, a film collector and historian of the Barrymore family. The purchase was funded by three alumni: Fred W. Beinecke, Richard E. Fuller, and Chester J. LaRoche Jr., all graduates of the University. Although modest, this acquisition encouraged other collectors to donate their films, which then became part a vital part of film curricula.\n\nOver the next 15 years, film as an academic discipline grew immensely, leading to the formation of both the Film Studies Program and the Film Study Center in 1982. During the 1980s, the 16mm archive burgeoned with film donations by Yale alumni Spencer Berger, Ralph Hirshorn, and others, while Yale’s 35mm archive was born with hundreds of rare prints of television programs produced by Herbert Brodkin, and collections such as those of the pioneering experimental director Mary Ellen Bute, a 1926 alumna of the Yale School of Drama.\n\nIn 2013, the Film Study Center began its monthly screening series \"Treasures from the Yale Film Archive,\" showcasing 35mm prints from the archive's collection. The screenings feature introductions by Film Study Center staff as well as Yale faculty, and have also included guest filmmakers such as Michael Roemer, Warrington Hudlin, Tamar Simon Hoffs, Norman Weissman, and Frank and Caroline Mouris, as well as musical accompaniment for silent films by Donald Sosin.\n\nIn July, 2017, the Yale Film Study Center formally became part of the Yale University Library.\n\nFilms preserved by the Film Study Center include \"Passages from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake\" (directed by Mary Ellen Bute) and \"The Boy Who Saw Through\" (produced by Bute and directed by George C. Stoney); \"Our Union,\" directed by Carl Marzani; \"To Be a Man\", directed by Murray Lerner; and four films by animator Frank Mouris: \"Quick Dream\", \"You're Not Real Pretty But You're Mine...\", \"Chemical Architecture\", and \"Coney Island Eats\". In 2018, the Film Study Center completed preservation of director Nicholas Doob's 1979 film \"Street Music,\" which features performances by 19 street musicians including \"Oliver \"Pork Chop\" Anderson,\" Brother Blue, Bongo Joe Coleman, Jimmy Davis, Guy Mosley, Gene Palma, and \"The Automatic Human Jukebox.\"\n\nThe Film Study Center also preserved 2-inch videotapes containing a 1972 broadcast by WTIC of \"What's Happening,\" a local news program that covered the visit to Yale by Duke Ellington and other jazz musicians including Eubie Blake, Dizzy Gillespie, Jo Jones, Charles Mingus, Max Roach, and Mary Lou Williams.\n\nThe Film Study Center film archive is made up of a number of individual collections of the films of various filmmakers and film collectors, some of which are listed below.\n\n"}
