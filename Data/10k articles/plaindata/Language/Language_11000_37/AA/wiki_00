It is a case of vowel reduction. The most familiar example is probably Russian akanye (pronounced but not represented orthographically in the standard language). Akanye also occurs in standard Belarusian (represented orthographically) as well as in northern (Polissian) Ukrainian dialects, Slovene dialects (e.g., Lower Carniolan dialects), some subgroups of the Kajkavian dialect of Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian dialects (e.g., the Rhodope dialects, including the Smolyan dialect).\n\nIn Belarusian \"аканне\" (akanne), both non-softened and softened and and other phonemes phonetically merge into [] in unstressed positions; see Belarusian phonology.\n\nIn Russian \"а́канье\" (akan'ye), (except for Northern dialects), and phonetically merge in unstressed positions. If not preceded by a palatalized (soft) consonant, these phonemes give [] (sometimes also transcribed as ) in the syllable immediately before the stress and in absolute word-initial position. In other unstressed locations, non-softened and are further reduced towards a short, poorly enunciated []. The dialects without reduction of unstressed o are called \"okanye\" (), literally \"\"o\"-ing\".\nAfter soft consonants, unstressed and are pronounced like [] in most varieties of Russian (see vowel reduction in Russian for details); this reduction is not considered a manifestation of akanye. Unlike Belarusian akanne, Russian akanye does not affect softened vowels.\n\nSlovene \"akanje\" may be partial (affecting only syllables before or after the stressed vowel) or complete (affecting all vowels in a word). Examples from various Slovene dialects: \"domú\" → \"damú\" 'at home' (pretonic \"o\"), \"dnò\" → \"dnà\" 'bottom' (tonic \"o\"), \"léto\" → \"líəta\" (posttonic \"o\"), \"ne vém\" → \"na vém\" 'I don't know' (pretonic \"e\"), \"hléb\" → \"hlàb\" 'loaf' (tonic \"e\"), \"jêčmen\" → \"jèčman\" 'barley' (posttonic \"e\").\n\n"}

{"id": "32971437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32971437", "title": "Cornelius Labeo", "text": "Cornelius Labeo\n\nCornelius Labeo was an ancient Roman theologian and antiquarian who wrote on such topics as the Roman calendar and the teachings of Etruscan religion \"(Etrusca disciplina)\". His works survive only in fragments and \"testimonia.\"\nHe has been dated \"plausibly but not provably\" to the 3rd century AD. Labeo has been called \"the most important Roman theologian\" after Varro, whose work seems to have influenced him strongly. He is usually considered a Neoplatonist.\n\nLabeo and Censorinus are the only authors with demonstrable interests in writing about Roman religion during a time of \"military anarchy\" between the death of Caracalla and the accession of Diocletian when scholarship seems mostly to have ground to a halt. Because religious and civil law in ancient Rome may overlap, the fragments of this Labeo are sometimes confused with those of the jurists Quintus Antistius Labeo and Marcus Antistius Labeo.\n\nLabeo was among the sources used by Macrobius, John Lydus, and Servius. It has sometimes been supposed that the Orphic verses given by Macrobius in the first book of his \"Saturnalia\" are taken from Labeo. His works were influential enough that he was targeted for criticism by Church Fathers such as Arnobius and Augustine. He may have been Arnobius's intermediate source for Porphyry, and possibly Martianus Capella's for Iamblichus.\n\nLabeo was interested in such problems as the existence of good and bad \"numina\", and whether intermediate beings should be called \"daimones\" (δαίμονες) or \"angeloi\" (ἄγγελοι). Labeo is one of the Greek and Roman authors with whom Augustine debates over the nature of \"demons\" in Book 8, \"On the City of God\". In particular, he rejects Labeo's distinction between good and bad \"daimones\", saying they are all impure spirits and thus evil. In classifying divine figures as gods, demigods, and heroes, Labeo placed Plato among demigods such as Hercules and Romulus.\n\nIn \"De mensibus\" (\"On the months\"), Lydus cites Labeo as his source for a list of thirty names for Aphrodite (Venus) and for explanations of customs pertaining to the calendar such as the etymologies of the names of the months. Labeo supported the view that the Roman goddess Maia was the Earth \"(Terra)\", named for her great size \"(magnitudine)\", to be identified with the Great Mother (Magna Mater) and the Good Goddess (Bona Dea), to whom a temple was dedicated on the Kalends of May.\n\nLabeo wrote a book \"De oraculo Apollinis Clarii\" that has provided a key passage for understanding monotheistic tendencies in ancient Greek and Roman religious thought. When asked \"Who is the supreme God?\" Apollo responded:\n\nAlas, you have not come to enquire about small matters.<br>You want to know who is the king of heaven<br>Whom even I do not know, yet revere according to tradition.\n\nApollo says that the supreme God is superior to him, ineffable and unknowable. Labeo also reports that an interpretation was sought for the Orphic verse \"Zeus is One, Hades is One, Helios is One, Dionysus is One.\" According to Macrobius:\nThe authority of this line rests on an oracle of Clarian Apollo, in which another name for the Sun, too, is added, who is given among other names, in the same holy lines, that of Iao. For the Clarian Apollo, upon being asked which of the gods was meant by Iao, spoke as follows: \"Initiates must hold their secrets—yet know! Iao is Hades in the winter, Zeus in spring, Helios in summer, and Iao in autumn.\" The force of this oracular saying, and the interpretation of the divinity and the name, whereby Father Liber and Sol are meant by Iao, Cornelius Labeo treats in his book titled \"On the Oracle of the Clarian Apollo\".\nThis passage has been called \"the most far-reaching and prominent evidence for the concept of theocrasy in pagan antiquity.\" \"Many gods,\" Ramsay MacMullen observed, \"were really aspects of a single god.\" \"Iao\" (Ἰαώ) is not explicitly identified as the god of the Jews, but the name was already established in Latin usage as such. Labeo tried to find a way to situate the Jewish god in the Olympian system. In late antiquity, \"Iao\" has a \"magical potency\" that came to embody the unifying tendency of Neopythagoreanism and Neoplatonism.\n\nThe most extensive treatment of Cornelius Labeo, including the collected fragments, is that of the Italian scholar P. Mastandrea, \"Un Neoplatonico Latino: Cornelio Labeone, testimonianze e frammenti\" (Leiden, 1979). English translation of the fragments appears in Hooker (tr.), \"John Lydus: On the Months\" (2017), pp. 200-205.\n\nThe work \"Peri keraunôn (Περὶ κεραυνῶν, On Lightnings)\" has sometimes been wrongly ascribed to him. \n"}

{"id": "12378505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12378505", "title": "Dinabandhu Mitra", "text": "Dinabandhu Mitra\n\nDinabandhu Mitra () (1829–1873) the Bengali dramatist, was born in 1829 at village Chouberia in Gopalnagar P.S., North 24 Parganas and was the son of Kalachand Mitra. His given name was Gandharva Narayan, but he changed it to Dinabandhu Mitra.\n\nDinabandhu Mitra's education started at a village pathshala. His father arranged a job for him on a zamindar's estate (1840). But the small boy fled to Kolkata, where he started working in the house of his uncle, Nilmani Mitra. Around 1846, he was admitted to the free school run by James Long. Dinabandhu was a bright student and won a number of scholarships. In 1850, he enrolled in Hindu College and was awarded scholarships for academic excellence. However, he did not appear in his last examination, and, instead, started working as a postmaster in Patna (1855). He served in various posts in the Postal Department in Krishnanagar, Nadia, Dhaka and Orissa. In 1870, he was made supernumerary post- master in Serampore Head Post Office- 712201 In 1872, he joined the Indian Railway as an inspector. He wrote the play called neel darpan (indigo mirror).\n\nDinabandhu started writing literary pieces while still at college. His poetic style was inspired by the well-known poet Ishwar Chandra Gupta. His poems were able to attract the attention of intellectuals at kolkata, but his favourite genre was the drama. His work in the postal department had taken him to various parts of the country giving him opportunities to study human life closely and thereby adding to his ability to unfold the drama of life with a degree of realism unknown at that time. Among his books of poems are Suradhuni Kavya (first part appeared in 1871, second part appeared in 1876), Dvadash Kavita (1872). His plays include Nildarpan (1860), Nabin Tapasvini (1863), Biye Pagla Budo (1866), Sadhabar Ekadashi (1866), Lilavati (1867), Jamai Barik (1873)and Kamale Kamini (1873). He also wrote a novel titled Poda Mahehshvar. Another one of his noted contributions was the hilarious - Jamalaye Jibanta Manush (An Alive man in the abode of Yama), the basic story line will later be adopted into an iconic film In the same name starring Bhanu Bandopadhyay and Basabi Nandi. It has to be noted that Mitra was also a pioneer in the sense that his plays focused on humans rather than gods & goddesses. Also in Jamalay-e he involves popular Hindu gods to generate humour, which would later be done by Rajshekhar Basu too.\n\nDinabandhu is, however, primarily known for his play about the plight of indigo farmers Nil Darpan. The Indigo Revolt (1858) or Nilbidraha in Bengali was the revolt of the indigo farmers against the indigo planters. It was just one year after the Sepoy Revolt Bengal saw one more important revolt in its history.\n\nMitra stormed the social and the literary circle of Bengal by his most notable play Nildarpan in the year 1860. It was published from Dhaka and soon after its publication it ignited a major argument in the newspapers. His first hand experience of the indigo cultivators, while on the job as the post master in rural Orissa and Bengal, were reflected in the drama.\nMichael Madhusudan Dutt translated the play into English immediately after it was published . and Reverend James Long published it. The Nildarpan got wide publicity in Europe where it was translated into many other languages. No other Bengali book at that time got so wide publicity at such large scale.It was so emotionally motivating that when it was playing on the stage Chandra Vidyasagar threw a shoe to the actor who was playing the role of planter A lawsuit was filed against Rev. Long by 19 July 1861 for libeling the editor of the englishman and libeling the indigo planters. Rev. Long was fined a sum of 1000 Rs. and a month of time in jail, the fully packed court house were full with sympathy towards the Rev. and the dramatist. The fined sum was paid at the spot by another legend of Bengal Renaissance Kaliprasanna Sinha. The court hearing against the indigo planters went for the next four years. Nildarpan was so emotionally motivating that when the play was staged, the notable educator and reformer Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar was so taken in by the realism of the performance of Ardhendushekhar Mustafi, the actor playing the role of the indigo planter Mr Wood that he threw a shoe at the actor. The actor accepted the shoe as a compliment. Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay compared Nildarpan to Uncle Tom's Cabin for its role in arousing people's awareness of the evils of indigo plantations. It played an important role in the Nilbidraha.\n\nDinabandhu was awarded the title 'Rai Bahadur' by the British government for services rendered at the Battle of Lushai. He died on 1 November 1873.\n\nThe college Dinabandhu Mahavidyalay (estd. 1947) is named after him.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "784344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=784344", "title": "Fellow traveller", "text": "Fellow traveller\n\nThe term fellow traveller (also fellow traveler) identifies a person who is intellectually sympathetic to the ideology of a political organization, and who co-operates in the organization's politics, without being a formal member of that organization. In the early history of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik revolutionary Trotsky coined the term \"poputchik\" ('one who travels the same path') to identify the vacillating intellectual supporters of the Bolshevik régime. Likewise for the political characterisation of the Russian \"intelligentsiya\" (writers, academics, and artists) who were philosophically sympathetic to the political, social, and economic goals of the Russian Revolution of 1917, but who chose to not join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Moreover, during the Stalinist régime, the usage of the term \"poputchik\" disappeared from political discourse in the Soviet Union, but the Western world adopted the English term \"fellow traveller\" to identify people who sympathised with the Soviets and with Communism.\n\nIn U.S. politics, during the 1940s and the 1950s, the term \"fellow traveler\" was a pejorative term for a person who was philosophically sympathetic to Communism, yet was not a formal, \"card-carrying member\" of the American Communist Party. In political discourse, the term \"fellow traveler\" was applied to intellectuals, academics, and politicians who lent their names and prestige to Communist front organizations.\n\nIn European politics, the equivalent terms for \"fellow traveller\" are: \"Compagnon de route\", \"sympathisant\", and \"progressiste\" in France; \"Weggenosse\" and \"Sympathisant\" in Germany; and \"compagno di viaggio\" in Italy.\n\nIn 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks applied the term Poputchik (\"one who travels the same path\") to Russian writers who accepted the revolution, but who were not active revolutionaries. In the book \"Literature and Revolution\" (1923), Leon Trotsky popularized the usage of \"Poputchik\" as a political descriptor attributed to the pre-Revolutionary Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (the Social Democrats) to identify a vacillating political sympathizer. In Chapter 2, \"The Literary 'Fellow-Travellers' of the Revolution\", Trotsky said:\nBetween bourgeois Art, which is wasting away either in repetitions or in silences, and the new art which is as yet unborn, there is being created a transitional art, which is more or less organically connected with the Revolution, but which is not, at the same time, the Art of the Revolution. Boris Pilnyak, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nicolai Tikhonov, the Serapion Fraternity, Yesenin and his group of Imagists and, to some extent, Kliuev – all of them were impossible without the Revolution, either as a group or separately. ... They are not the artists of the proletarian Revolution, but her artist \"fellow-travellers\", in the sense in which this word was used by the old Socialists ...\n\nAs regards a \"fellow-traveller\", the question always comes up – How far will he go? This question cannot be answered in advance, not even approximately. The solution of it depends, not so much on the personal qualities of this or that \"fellow-traveller\", but mainly on the objective trend of things during the coming decade.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War (1939–45), the Russian term \"poputchik\" (fellow traveller) was translated to the German as \"Mitläufer\", to identify the person who, although not formally charged with participation in war crimes, was sufficiently involved with the Nazi régime to the extent that the Allied authorities responsible for the denazification of Germany could not legally exonerate him or her from association with the War crimes of the Wehrmacht.\n\nFor the term \"fellow traveller\", the reactionary Régime of the Colonels (1967–74) used the Greek word \"Synodiporia\" (\"The ones walking the street together\") as an umbrella term that described domestic Greek Leftists and democratic opponents of the military dictatorship; likewise, the military government used term \"Diethnis\" (\"international \"Synodiporia\"\") to identify the foreign supporters of the domestic anti-fascist Greeks.\n\nIn the U.S., the European term \"fellow-traveller\" was adapted to describe persons politically sympathetic to, but not members of, the American Communist Party (CPUSA), who shared the political perspectives of Communism. In the 1920s and 1930s, the political, social, and economic problems in the U.S. and throughout the world, caused partly by the Great Economic Depression, motivated idealistic young people, artists, and intellectuals to become sympathetic to the Communist cause, in hope they could overthrow capitalism. To that end, Black Americans joined the American Communist Party (1919) because some of their politically liberal stances (e.g. legal racial equality) corresponded to the political struggles of Black people for civil rights and social justice, in the time when Jim Crow laws established and maintained racial segregation throughout the United States. Moreover, the American League for Peace and Democracy (ALPD) was the principal socio-political group who actively worked towards peace by way of anti-fascism rather than by pacifism; as such, the ALPD was the most important organization within the Popular Front, a pro-Soviet coalition of anti-fascist political organizations.\n\nAs in Europe, in the 1920s and 1930s, the intellectuals of the U.S. either sympathized with or joined the U.S. Communist Party, to oppose the economic excesses of capitalism and fascism, which they perceived as its political form. In 1936, the newspaper columnist Max Lerner included the term \"fellow traveler\" in the article \"Mr. Roosevelt and His Fellow Travelers\" (\"The Nation\"). In 1938, Joseph Brown Matthews Sr. featured the term in the title of his political biography \"Odyssey of a Fellow Traveler\" (1938); later, J. B. Matthews was the chief investigator for the anti-Communist activities of the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee ). Moreover, among the writers and intellectuals known as fellow travelers were Ernest Hemingway and Theodore Dreiser novelists whose works of fiction occasionally were critical of capitalism and its excesses, whilst John Dos Passos, a known left-winger, moved to the right-wing and became a staunch anti-Communist.\n\nLikewise, the editor of \"The New Republic\" magazine, Malcolm Cowley had been a fellow traveler during the 1930s, but broke from the Communist Party, because of the ideological contradictions inherent to the Nazi-Soviet Pact (Treaty of Non-aggression between Germany and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 23 August 1939). The novelist and critic Waldo Frank was a fellow traveler during the mid-1930s, and was the chairman of the League of American Writers, in 1935, but was ousted as such, in 1937, when he called for an impartial enquiry to the reasons for Josef Stalin's purges (1936–38) of Russian society.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1939, the historian Richard Hofstadter briefly was a member of the Young Communist League USA. Despite disillusionment because of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia and the ideological rigidity of the Communist party-line, Hofstadter remained a fellow traveler until the 1940s. In \"Who Owns History?: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World\" (2003), Eric Foner said that Hofstatdter continued thinking of himself as a political radical, because his opposition to capitalism was the reason he had joined the American Communist Party.\n\nMoreover, in the elegiac article \"The Revolt of the Intellectuals\" (\"Time\" 6 Jan. 1941), the ex-Communist Whittaker Chambers satirically used the term \"fellow traveler\":\nIn the late 1930s, most fellow-travelers broke with the Communist party-line of Moscow when Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler signed the German–Soviet Non-aggression Pact (August 1939), which allowed the Occupation of Poland (1939–45) for partitioning between the U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany. In the U.S., the American Communist Party abided Stalin's official party-line, and denounced Britain and Western anti-Nazis, rather than the German Nazis, as war mongers. In June 1941, when the Nazis launched \"Operation Barbarossa\", to annihilate the U.S.S.R., again, the American Communist Party abided Stalin's party-line, and became war hawks for American intervention to the European war in aid of Russia, and ally of the United States.\n\nAt War's end, the Russo–American Cold War emerged in the 1946–48 period, and American Communists found themselves at the political margins of U.S. society – such as being forced out of the leadership of trade unions; in turn, membership to the Communist Party of the U.S.A. declined. Yet, in 1948, American Communists did campaign for the presidential run of Henry A. Wallace, President F. D. Roosevelt's vice-president. In February 1956, to the 20th congress of the C.P.S.U., Nikita Khrushchev delivered the secret speech, \"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\", denouncing Stalinism and the cult of personality for Josef Stalin; those political revelations ended the ideological relationship between many fellow-travelers in the West and the Soviet version of Communism.\n\nIn 1945, the anti-Communist HUAC (House Committee on Un-American Activities) became a permanent committee of the U.S. Congress; and, in 1953, after Senator Joseph McCarthy became chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, they attempted to determine the extent of Soviet influence in the U.S. government, and in the social, cultural, and political institutions of American society.\n\nThat seven-year period (1950–56) of moral panic and political witch hunts was the McCarthy Era of right-wing political orthodoxy realised by way of anonymous and unfounded accusations of treason and subversion, during which time the political pejorative \"fellow traveler\" was applied against any American citizen who did not fit or abide the HUAC's ideologically narrow definition of \"American\" – which contradicted, flouted, and voided the political rights provided for every citizen in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn the course of his political career, the Republican Sen. McCarthy claimed there were many American citizens (secretly and publicly) sympathetic to Communism and the U.S.S.R., who worked in the State Department and in the U.S. Army; likewise, that there were many secret Communists working in universities and in the businesses of the mass-communications media (publishing, radio, cinema, television) promoting \"un-American\" ideals, e.g. civil liberties, racial equality, opposition to book censorship, public health services, vaccination, mental health-care services and fluoridation, which were believed to be Communist plots to subvert U.S. society. In response to such ideological threats to the national security of the U.S., American citizens suspected of being \"un-American\" were secretly and anonymously registered to a blacklist, and so denied employment and the right to earn a living, despite many such ex-communists having transcended the \"fellow traveler\" stage of their political lives, e.g. the Hollywood blacklist.\n\nIn \"Masters of Deceit: The Story of Communism in America and How to Fight It\" (1958), FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, defined five types of \"fellow traveler\", as politically subversive persons who he believed meant to promote the Communist deposition of the U.S. government:\n\n\n\"The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought\" (1999), defines the term \"fellow-traveller\" as a post-revolutionary political term derived from the Russian word \"poputchik\", with which the Bolsheviks described political sympathizers who hesitated to publicly support the Bolshevik Party and Communism in Russia, after the Revolution of 1917.\n\n\"The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\" (1993) defines the term \"fellow-traveller\" as \"a non-Communist who sympathizes with the aims and general policies of the Communist Party\"; and, by transference, as a \"person who sympathizes with, but is not a member of another party or movement\".\n\n\"Safire's Political Dictionary\" (1978), defines the term \"fellow traveller\" as a man or a woman \"who accepted most Communist doctrine, but was not a member of the Communist party\"; and, in contemporary usage, defines the term \"fellow traveller\" as a person \"who agrees with a philosophy or group, but does not publicly work for it.\"\n\n\n"}

The first materials were published in 1903 and 1904 by Adolphe de Calassanti Motylinski (1854–1907). A more copious and reliable source is provided by the works of White Father Jacques Lanfry, who stayed in Ghadames from 1944 to 1945 and who published his main works in 1968 and 1973. No new research has been undertaken on location since then. Recently, Kossmann (2013) has published a modern grammar of Ghadamès based on Lanfry’s materials.\n\nLanfry mentions the number of c. 4,000 speakers as an optimistic estimate. The actual number of speakers is not known with certainty. \"Ethnologue\" cites a number of c. 10,000 speakers in 2006, with another 2,000 living outside the area. However, the number of 10,000 reflects the total number of inhabitants of Ghadames, who are not all native speakers of Ghadamès. In addition, the number of 2,000 emigrant speakers is based on a very old source. \"Ethnologue\" classifies the language as 6b (Threatened).\n\nGhadamès is a Berber language on its own, preserving several unique phonological and morphological features, and the Ghadamès lexicon, as recorded by Lanfry, shows relatively little influence from Arabic. There is as yet no consensus on the classification of Ghadamès within the Berber language group. Aikhenvald and Militarev (1984) group it as Eastern Berber, and Kossmann (1999) specifically groups it together with Awjila. \"Ethnologue\" classifies it as East Zenati.\n\nLike other Berber languages and Arabic, Ghadamès has both pharyngealized (\"emphatic\") and plain dental consonants. Gemination is contrastive. Consonants listed between brackets occur only very sporadically.\n\nMost Berber languages have just three phonemic vowels. Ghadamès, like Tamasheq, has seven vowels.\n\n"}

It is notable for its sesquisyllabic phonology (Anderson 2008:684-5) and vigesimal numeral system.\n\nGta’ is spoken by 3,000 people primarily in Malkangiri district, Odisha as well as adjoining areas of Koraput district (Anderson 2008:682).\n\n\"Ethnologue\" reports the following locations.\n\nGta’ has two main varieties, namely Plains Gta’ and Hill Gta’.\n\nThe Gta’ language belongs to the South Munda subgroup of the Munda branch of the Austroasiatic language family. Within South Munda, Gta’ is generally considered to be the first branch off a node that also subsumes the Remo and Gutob languages; this subgroup of South Munda is known as Gutob–Remo–Gataq. It is phonologically and morphologically divergent within that branch (Zide 1976).\n\nNouns in Gta? ordinarily have two forms, one a free full form, the other a bound short form. These latter occur only when the noun is compounded with some other stem for derivational 9 purposes, and are hence labeled \"combining forms\". Combining forms occurring with verb stems can be echoed independently of the verb stems; those occur? ring with noun stems either remain intact or change at par with the main stems.\n\n\"Examples\"\n\nType 1: sur-cu \"to fry in oil\" > sur-ca, sur-ci, sar-ca, s?r-cf, sar-cu. \ngag-bo? \"to tie onto the head\"\ngag-ba?, gig-bT?, gag-bT?, gTg-ba?, gig-bo?. \n\"tur-t?a \"to graze cattle\" > \ntar-ti, t?r-ti, tar-t?a, t?r-t?a.\nType 2: kula-re \"kinsman\" > \n\nka I a-re, k?I i-re. \n\nsari-ja \"paddy flower\" > \n\nsara-ja, s?ri-j?, si ri-ja.\n\nra-ko \"peacock feather\" > \n\nbara-ka, bir?-k?, bir?-ko. \n\nult-so \"mango wood\" > \n\nala-sa, ?l?-sf, ala-so, Mi-so. \n\nhuQ-be \"baby bear\" > \n\nhar?-ba, h?tj-b?, harj-be, h?n-be.\n\nRules of Formation\n\n\"Rule#\" 1.

The vowel of univocalic base words is reflected as either /a/ or /}/ in the echo-word. For base-word /u, e, o/ the vowel /a/ is preferred, while for base word /e/ the vowel /I/ is preferred.\n\n\"Rule#\" 3. The vowels of disyllabic base words are reflected in the echo-word as follows: \n\"Rule#\" 4. In the case of trisyllabic base words, one, two or all three of the vowels (in adjacent syllables) are reflected as either /a/ or /}/.\n\n\"Rule#\" 5.

He received his primary school education at Sohagpur, Itarasi and from Katni in Madhya Pradesh. He received his middle school education at Mahoba Uttar Pradesh and his secondary school education at Kishori Raman Vidyalay Mathura, Uttar Pradesh. He then entered the University of Allahabad where he studied for a BA, living at the Shyam Sundar Hostel. Because of financial constraints, he was unable to complete his education at the time. After working odd jobs in Jabalpur he attended Hitkarini City College there and completed his BA. In 1949 he joined the college as a professor.\n\nIn 1946 he married Vidyawati Shrivastav, a school teacher who had an MA Degree in Sanskrit and M Ed. She was a teacher for more than thirty years and got blessed with three children namely Amiya Ranjan Khare, Khanjan Sinha, and Dr. Malaya Ranjan Khare.\n\nKhare was admitted to Robertson College, Jabalpur, to study for an MA degree but was forced to withdraw because of his financial circumstances.\n\nAmong the notable individuals Khare taught during his career are: Acharya Shri Rajneesh Osho, Hari Krushna Tripathee, Professor Dr Uma Shankar Pathak, Prof Dr Jawahar Chourasiya Tarunh, and Gargee Sharan Mishra Maral, Prof Bharatdwaj.\n\nAn award, Aditya, was created in his honour at Maharashtra High School, for the student with the highest marks in Hindi studies.\n\nFor ten months in 1946 Khare taught at the Government Model High School in Jabalpur. While there he co-wrote \"Harinda\" with Harishankar Parsai who was a fellow teacher at the school. In 1947 he moved to Maharashtra High School. He received an MA degree from Nagpur University in 1948. He was then, along with well-known the writer Dr. Ramkumar Verma, associated with \"Prakash\", a magazine produced by the Social Welfare Department of the Government of the Central Province of Nagpur in the Berar region. He also served as an approved Geetkar and Kahanikar at Akashvani in Nagpur from 1947 to 1952.\n\nSince 2009, his book entitled \"Bhor ke Geet\" has been included as a part of the academic curriculum in the MA program at Pandit Ravishankar Shukla University, Raipur and, since 2013, at St Aloysius College Jabalpur for its BA programme in Hindi literature.\n\nHis works have also been included in the curricula of: Nagpur University, Indore, Gwalior, Agra, Ranchi, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Kolkata, Shantiniketan, Sagar, Rewa and Surguja.\n\nIn the late 2000s, those interested in Hindi literature began to rediscover Khare's writings. They began to be regarded as a valuable contribution to the world of Hindi literature. Currently, there are students across the India doing research on the Khare's contributions to Hindi literature. Ms Bhavna Sharma at Rani Durgavati University, Jabalpur researched her work from 1993 to 1997 under the guidance of Hindi writer Dr. Sushma Dubey.\n\nList of works (Kavita, Kahaani, Upanyaas and Music CDs)\n\nKavita\n\nOne of Khare's first books was \"Bhor ke geet\"(भोर के गीत) written between 1939-1942 at the age of 18. The book was later re-printed by Vani Prakashan Book Publishers in New Delhi in 2009. The book's publication was celebrated by parliamentarian Shri Balram Jakhar, former governor of Madhya-Pradesh, on 20 April 2009. The book is widely available for Hindi readers within India and is in libraries at MGI Mauritius and North Carolina State University, USA. In 2015 \"Bhor ke Geet Sameeksha pustak\" was released by Arunoday Prakashan, New Delhi.()\n\nAt the age of 20, 25 Jan 1943 he had written a poem ' Hemu Kalani' just after his hanging 21 Jan 1943, and it is published in 2017 after a span of 74 years.\nAt the age of 23, Khare wrote another well known title, \"Vijan ke Phool\"(विजन के फूल), between 1944 and 1946. The book was originally published in 1955 by Jabalpur Sahitya Sangh. In 2011, this book, as well as \"Surbala\", written between 1943–44, was re-published by Vani Prakashan Book Publishers. On 5 May 2011, the books were celebrated by Shri Rameshawar Thakur.\n\n\"Rajani ke pal\", another poetic collection, was written between 1941 and 1942. Vani Prakashan re-published the title in 2012.\n\nAnother of Khare's collections is \"Azaadee ke pahle Azaadee ke baad\" highlighting pre- and post-Independence India. It is a collection of more than 120 poems highlighting the struggle for Indian independence. Some 14,000+ school students in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, and a few thousands nationwide sing the lines of Shri Khare song \"Par Shobhit Mukut Himalaya\" during morning assembly and \"Prabhat-Pheri\" on 15 August and 26 January every year. Fifteen or more artists recite the same song in Mumbai on 9 August every year, at August Kranti Maidan in front of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra State and thousands of other patriots.\n\nKahaniya\n\nKhare also wrote numerous stories during his lifetime covering many aspects of life, poverty, love, and romance some with a patriotic flavor. One of his story collections is \"Sapano ki Nagaree\" written between 1940 and 1943 which was re-published in 2012 by Vani Prakashan, New Delhi. The same publisher also reissued \"Dur Path ke Rahee\", originally written in 1941, and plans to release the story collection \"Aaratee ke Deep\".\n\nUpanyaas\n\nKhare also contributed several Upanyaas to the world of Hindi literature such as \"Kashmeer\" written in 1948. Others worthy of mention include: \"Jeevan path ke raahi\", \"Mere Jeevan Prishth na padhe\", and \"Lekh Holi\", Nadi, Natak-Our Cinema and krasnavtar. Khare also wrote a famous essay on Shri Padumlal Punnalal Baxi in 1951 titled \"padumlal Punna laal baxi meri drushti main\" the same lekh was published in 1972 by Shri Narmada Prasad Khare.\"Sahitya Jagat Ke Biniva Padumlal Punnalal Baxi\" in his name . This was brought to notice of knowledgeable Hindi experts.\n\nIn early 1950s, Khare's work was used to compose songs sung by the artist, Smt. Santosh Jhanjhi. Nearly five decades after it was written, Khare's poems were the basis of songs on CDs such as: माँ! तुम हो भारत की माता, भोर के गीत and विजन के फूल. Lately, a few of his songs were also sung by Shri Shekhar Shrivastava from Dhanbad with Kumari Aashita Awasthy from Kanpur.\n\nEach year thousands of Hindi readers, students, and Ph.D and MA candidates across India come together to acknowledge, and to spread the word about Khare's contributions to the world of Hindi literature. Below is the list of events and programs held in remembrance of some of his classic works.\n\n"}

It is an indigenous language used in the eastern part of the Amazon, north of Mato Grosso and Para in Brazil. Mebengokre belongs to the Jê family and the Macro-Jê family stock. There are around 8,638 native speakers since 2010 based on the 2015 Ethnologue 18th edition. Due to the number of speakers the influence of Portuguese speakers, the language stands at a sixth level of endangerment; in which the materials for literacy and education in Kayapô are very limited.\n\nThe names Kayapô and Mebengokre do not only make reference to the language itself but have also been used to classify the indigenous communities that speak this language. Kayapô means “those who look like monkeys” and has been used to distinguish the Kayapô group from the other Mebengokre speaking peoples. The name Mebengokre has a meaning of itself; when referring to people, it means “the men of the hole/place of water.” \"Although there are differences between the dialects spoken among the various ethnic groups, all recognize themselves as participants in a common culture.\"\n\nThe first historical records of the Kayapô language and culture date back to the end of the 19th century written by the French explorer Henri Coudreau, who came in contact with the Irã'ã Mrãjre Kayapô. The following writings were made by the missionaries who arrived to Brazil later in the century to Christianize the indigenous people. Known authors of such period are Father Sebastião and Reverend Horace Banner, who lived among another Mebengokre group known as Gorotire Kayapó between 1937 and 1951. Although, “the Mebengokre [have been in] permanent contact with the surrounding non-indigenous population at various times, in most cases [there have been] catastrophic consequences. The Irã'ã Mrãjre are now extinct, and the population of the Gorotire Kayapó decreased by 80% during the first years of contact. Following such brutal experiences, some small refused to be approached by investigators and remain uncontacted around the Xingu and Curua rivers.\n\nSince the exploration period, academic linguists and anthropologists have investigated the Mebengokre and have successfully acquired a body of knowledge about this indigenous group. There are academic writings on the descriptive grammar and phonology of Kayapô language; some by Stout and Thomson in 1974, and Borgues in 1995, dictionaries with Portuguese translations; syntactic and phonological studies by Andres Salanova and Amelia Silva, translations of the New Testament into Kayapô published in 1996, and literary works including myth and ritual stories and descriptions of the Mebengokre speaking communities.\n\nFurthermore, the Brazilian organization ProDocult began a documentation project of the Kayapô language and culture in April 2009 and thus far have produced \"150 hours of video recording, 15 hours of audio recording and more than 6,000 digital photos, in addition to ... films [containing] records of \"culture\" Mebengokre, and how could it be ... highly dynamic [in its] creative aspect.\"\n\nMebengokre/Kayapô is composed of 16 consonants and 17 vowels; vowel production occurs both orally and nasally. Voiced oral stops are a unique feature of Mebengokre among the Jȇ family.\n\nThe morphological aspect of the Kayapô is still under research given the complexity that nasality adds to the construction of morpho-syntactic. According to Linguistics Ph.D Professor Patience Epps “the manifestation of nasality in Amazonian languages has practical implications for the development of orthographies.” As well, languages from the Amazon are “weakly-tensed languages; where tense may be left unexpressed” (18). In the case of Kayapô, verbs inflect through reduplication and although there is no morphological distinction between present and past, the completion or continuation of an action is determined by the narrative context.\n\nReduplication indicates repeated actions and transitivity of verbs as follows: \n\nIn some verbs, such as \"prõrprõt\" (to float up and down or), there is variation in order to follow the /r/ to /t/ to the syllabic structures C(C)V and C(C)VC.\n\nMebengokre has a set of pronouns to which affixes can be added during the formation of sentence types.\n\nBasic form of pronouns:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Third person can occur in different ways; by not adding inflection to words that are normally inflected and by affixing \"ku-\" to a small class of transitive verbs and prepositions to form an accusative sentence.\n\nIn Mebengokre any content word can be a direct object. Mebengokre has a split case system composed of the nominative, ergative, absolute and accusative (direct object) cases; each with different affixes.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Paucal / PC: refers to plurality with a small cardinality.\nThese cases are mandatory to express the subject of the sentence. For instance:\n\na) arɤm nẽ ba ar i.tẽm mʌ̃\n\nnow Non-FUT 1Nom PC 1.go to\n\n\"‘We are leaving’\"\n\nb) dʒʌ̃m nẽ ga aje ɔmũɲ ket\n\nINT Non-FUT 2Nom 2Erg 3+see Neg\n\n\"‘Don’t you see?’\"\n\nIn 1a. the nominative case introduces the subject of the main clause while 2b. introduces the subject in a subordinate clause with a non-finite verb.\n\nThe absolute case is not unique to subject and object arguments of non-finite verbs. It is also used when representing the object argument of finite verbs. For instance:\n\nuɤrɤ mã nẽ tẽ\n\n3+shower to Non-FUT Go\n\n\"'He/She is taking a shower / going to take a shower\"'\n\nIt is the same as the absolute case, except it present in transitive verbs.\n\narɤm nẽ ba ku.ma\n\nAlready Non-FUT 1Nom 3Acc.Listen/hear\n\n\"‘I heard it [already]’\"\n\nMebengokre tenses are expressed in terms of finiteness rather than aspectual morphology. The following sentence shows the role of verbal finiteness when determining tense:\n\na.\n\nkrwɣj jã nẽ mop krẽ\n\nparakeet DEM NFUT Malanga eat.V\n\n\"‘This parakeet ate (the) Malanga’\"\n\nb.\n\nkrwɣj jã nẽ kutɛ mop krẽn\n\nparakeet DEM NFUT 3RG Malanga eat.N\n\n\"‘This parakeet has eaten Malanga (at least once in his life)’\"\n\nThe semantic interpretation of 4\"a\" positions the events with respect to the time which can only be determined by narrative context.In contrast, 4b makes the event not \"anaphoric to discourse, but rather coterminous with the subject’s lifespan (mutatis mutandis for inanimate subjects). This interpretation has been variously described as “stative” or “subject-oriented” (in the sense that it ascribes a property to the subject, rather than focusing on the event itself) in the descriptive literature.”\n\n"}

{"id": "9633565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9633565", "title": "Language production", "text": "Language production\n\nIn psycholinguistics, language production is the production of spoken or written language. It describes all of the stages between having a concept, and translating that concept into linguistic form. In computational linguistics/natural language processing and artificial intelligence, the term natural language generation (NLG) is more common, and those models may or may not be psychologically motivated.\n\nLanguage production consists of several interdependent processes which transform a nonlinguistic message into a spoken, signed, or written linguistic signal. Though the following steps proceed in this approximate order, there is plenty of interaction and communication between them. The process of message planning is an active area of psycholinguistic research, but researchers have found that it is an ongoing process throughout language production. Research suggests that messages are planned in roughly the same order that they are in an utterance. After identifying a message, or part of a message, to be linguistically encoded, a speaker must select the individual words—also known as lexical items—to represent that message. This process is called lexical selection. The words are selected based on their meaning, which in linguistics is called semantic information. Lexical selection activates the word's lemma, which contains both semantic and grammatical information about the word.\n\nThis grammatical information is then used in the next step of language production, grammatical encoding. Critical grammatical information includes characteristics such as the word's syntactic category (noun, verb, etc.), what objects it takes, and grammatical gender if it is present in the language. Using some of these characteristics as well as information about the thematic roles of each word in the intended message, each word is then assigned the grammatical and thematic role it will have in the sentence. Function morphemes, like the plural /s/ or the past tense /ɪd/, are added in this stage as well. After an utterance, or part of one, has been formed, it then goes through phonological encoding. In this stage of language production, the mental representation of the words to be spoken is transformed into a sequence of speech sounds to be pronounced. The speech sounds are assembled in the order they are to be produced.\n\nThe basic loop occurring in the creation of language consists of the following stages:\nAccording to the lexical access model (see section below), in terms of lexical access, two different stages of cognition are employed; thus, this concept is known as the two-stage theory of lexical access. The first stage, lexical selection provides information about lexical items required to construct the functional level representation. These items are retrieved according to their specific semantic and syntactic properties, but phonological forms are not yet made available at this stage. The second stage, retrieval of wordforms, provides information required for building the positional level representation.\n\nA serial model of language production divides the process into several stages. For example, there may be one stage for determining pronunciation and a stage for determining lexical content. The serial model does not allow overlap of these stages, so they may only be completed one at a time.\n\nSeveral researchers have proposed a connectionist model, one notable example being Dell . According to his connectionist model, there are four layers of processing and understanding: semantic, syntactic, morphological, and phonological. These work in parallel and in series, with activation at each level. Interference and misactivation can occur at any of these stages. Production begins with concepts, and continues down from there. One might start with the concept of a cat: a four-legged, furry, domesticated mammal with whiskers, etc. This conceptual set would attempt to find the corresponding word {cat}. This selected word would then select morphological and phonological data /k / at/. The distinction of this model is that, during this process, other elements would also be primed ({rat} might be somewhat primed, for example), as they are physically similar, and so can cause conceptual interference. Errors might also occur at the phoneme level, as many words are phonetically similar, e.g. mat. Substitutions of similar consonant sounds are more likely to occur, e.g. between plosive stop consonants such as d, p and b. Lower primed words are less likely to be chosen, but interference is thought to occur in cases of early selection, where the level of activation of the target and interference words is at the same level. \n\nThis model states that the sentence is made by a sequence of processes generating differing levels of representations. For instance, the functional level representation is made on the a preverbal representation, which is essentially what the speaker seeks to express. This level is responsible for encoding the meanings of lexical items and the way that grammar forms relationships between them. Next, the positional level representation is built, which functions to encode the phonological forms of words and the order they are found in sentence structures. Lexical access, according to this model, is a process that encompasses two serially ordered and independent stages.\n\nFluency can be defined in part by prosody, which is shown graphically by a smooth intonation contour, and by a number of other elements: control of speech rate, relative timing of stressed and unstressed syllables, changes in amplitude, and changes in fundamental frequency.\n\nWhether or not a speaker is fluent in only one language, the process for producing language remains the same. However, bilinguals speaking two languages within a conversation access both languages at the same time. The three most commonly discussed models for multilingual language access are the Bilingual Interactive Activation model, the Revised Hierarchical Model, and the Language Mode model:\nSpeakers fluent in multiple languages can inhibit access to one of their languages, but this suppression can only be done once the speaker is at a certain level of proficiency in that language. A speaker can decide to inhibit a language based on non-linguistic cues in their conversation, such as a speaker of both English and French conversing with people who only speak English. When especially proficient multilingual speakers communicate, they can participate in code-switching. Code-switching has been shown to indicate bilingual proficiency in a speaker, though it had previously been seen as a sign of poor language ability.\n\nThere are two main types of research into speech production. One type focuses on using the analysis of speech errors. The other looks at reaction-time data from picture-naming latencies. Although originally disparate, these two methodologies are generally looking at the same underlying processes of speech production.\n\nAnalysis of speech errors has found that not all are random, but rather systematic and fall into several categories. Although speech production is very fast, (2 words per second) the error rate of the utterances are relatively rare (less than 1/1000) and those errors are categorized as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The official and national language of Slovenia is Slovene, which is spoken by a large majority of the population. It is also known, in English, as Slovenian. Two minority languages, namely Hungarian and Italian, are recognised as co-official languages and accordingly protected in their residential municipalities. Other significant languages are Croatian and its variants and Serbian, spoken by most immigrants from former Yugoslavia and their descendants. Slovenia is ranked among the top European countries regarding the knowledge of foreign languages. The most often taught foreign languages are English and German, followed by Italian, French, and Spanish.\n\nThe population of Slovenia has become more diverse in regard to its language through recent decades but is still relatively homogenous — Slovene was in 2002 the first language of 87.8% of the inhabitants. It was followed by Croatian (2.8%), Serbian (1.6%) and so-called Serbo-Croatian (1.6%). Italian and Hungarian language, protected by the Constitution of Slovenia, had lower numbers of native speakers.\n\nIn its Article 11, the Constitution of Slovenia stipulates that Slovene is to be the sole official and national language throughout the country. The Public Use of the Slovene Language Act of 2004 further defines the legal status of Slovene, by mandating that national and local authorities are compelled to use it in communication and legislation. As a national language, it is used on the obverse side of Slovenian euro coins, in Slovenian national anthem, by The Slovenian President, and uniquely represents Slovene culture on the international stage.\n\nTelevision and radio broadcasts, newspapers, commercials, user manuals, and other printed or broadcast material must be in Slovene. Usage of material in another language is permitted, if it is accordingly subtitled, dubbed or translated. Publishing or broadcasting untranslated material, as well as selling goods without instructions and declaration in Slovene, is punishable and banned by law. Also, names of corporations and trademarks registered in Slovenia must be in Slovene; however, they may be used along with the translated name in another language if its aimed at foreign markets.\n\nSlovene is the language of instruction at all levels of schooling, from primary to tertiary education. There is an international high school in Ljubljana with English as the language of instruction, but it admits only students from foreign diplomats and Slovenes who had been schooled abroad for several years. Undergraduate courses are run in Slovene, therefore applicants from foreign countries must prove an adequate level of knowledge of Slovene to be eligible to enroll. Graduate courses for foreign exchange students are offered in English, as well.\n\nThe Centre for Slovene as a Second/Foreign Language encourages the learning of Slovene as foreign language, offers different courses in Slovene, and grants certificates of language proficiency. One may sit for the Slovene Language Exam at three levels: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. After having passed the exam, the applicant receives the certificate of knowledge of the Slovene language, issued by the Faculty of Arts of University of Ljubljana, which is valid throughout the European Union, and makes the holder eligible to apply to any school or university in Slovenia.\n\nWith the accession of Slovenia to the European Union on May 1, 2004, Slovene became an official language of the European Union, requiring that all Acts and Directives be translated into Slovene. Additionally, Slovenian citizens may write to any EU institution in Slovene and expect a response in the same language.\n\nSlovene is divided into seven regional dialectal groups, further subdivided into local dialects. Mutual comprehension between certain dialects is limited.\n\nThis is the only Slovene dialect that has ever been attempted to be declared an official language in the Prekmurje region. It has a limited standardized written form, has been used in the liturgy, and has been used in modern literature, music, television and film.\n\nItalian is officially recognised as the mother tongue of the protected Italian minority and co-official language in Slovenian Istria near the Slovenian-Italian border and at the Slovenian coastline. Public usage of Italian is permitted and protected by minority protection laws. Members of the Italian minority are entitled to primary and secondary education in their native language, as well as to radio and television programmes in Italian, and to communicating in Italian with the authorities.\n\nItalian is co-official with Slovene in 25 settlements in 4 municipalities (all of them officially bilingual):\n\nHungarian is officially recognised as the mother tongue of protected Hungarian minority in Prekmurje region near the Slovenian-Hungarian border. Public usage of Hungarian is permitted and protected by minority protection laws. Members of Hungarian minority are entitled to primary and secondary education in their native language, as well to radio and occasional television broadcast in Hungarian, and to communicating in Hungarian with the authorities.\n\nHungarian is co-official with Slovene in 30 settlements in 5 municipalities (whereof 3 are officially bilingual):\n\nA significant number of Slovenian population speak a variant of Croatian and Serbian as their native language. These are mostly immigrants who moved to Slovenia from other former Yugoslav republics from the 1960s to the late 1980s, and their descendants. 0.4% of the Slovenian population declared themselves as native speakers of Albanian and 0.2% as native speakers of Macedonian in 2002.\n\nThere is a small Croatian speaking community in White Carniola, whose existence predates Yugoslavia. In four villages (Miliči, Bojanci, Marindol and Paunoviči), people speak the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect, with a strong influence of Slovene. People living there are mainly Serbian Orthodox and descendants of Serbian Uskoks, guerilla warriors against Ottoman invasions.\n\nRomani, spoken in 2002 as the native language by 0.2% of people, is a legally protected language in Slovenia. These people mainly belong to the geographically dispersed and marginalized Roma community.\n\nGerman and Bavarian dialects have been autochthonous since present-day Slovenia came under the rule of Bavaria in the 8th century. Whereas many immigrants from German-speaking areas adopted Slovene over the centuries, others retained their language. Until the 20th century, the most numerous German-speaking communities were found in the urban centers of Lower Styria, in the Gottschee County in southern Slovenia and in the villages around Apače (Apaško polje) along the Mura river.\n\nAccording to the last Austrian census of 1910, around 9% of the population of present-day Slovenia spoke German as their native tongue. Towns with a German-speaking majority included Maribor, Celje, Ptuj, Kočevje, Slovenj Gradec, Slovenska Bistrica, Ormož, Dravograd and some other smaller towns.\n\nAfter World War I, the number of German-speakers dropped significantly: most of the towns were slovenized, and German remained the majority language only in the Gottschee County and around Apače. According to the last pre-WWII Yugoslav census, German speakers amounted to 2.5% of the overall population. Former German or bilingual speakers had switched to Slovene, the official language.\n\nDuring World War II, ethnic Germans were resettled from areas occupied by Italy (Ljubljana, Gottschee) into the German-occupied zone. After the war, the great majority of the remaining Germans had to leave the country. In the census of 2002, just 1628 persons (0,1% of the population) declared German as their mother tongue. Almost everyone today born in Slovenia knows Slovene because people learn obligatory Slovene in school, but many at home speak other languages as well. The number of people fluent in German is unknown. German-speaking women around Maribor who are citizens of Slovenia have organized in the association \"Kulturno društvo nemško govorečih žena »Mostovi« Maribor\" (\"Bridges\").\n\nGottscheerish or Granish is a Bavarian dialect of the German language and has been spoken in the Gottschee County around Kočevje (Gottschee) since 1330. For over 600 years, it was the predominant oral language of the Gottscheers in that area, whereas Standard German was their written language. Most Gottschee Germans were resettled by the German occupation forces in 1941 during World War II. Only a few hundred Gottscheers remained, most of them supporting the partisan movement. After the war, Gottscheerish was forbidden. Today there are only a few speakers left, most of them in Moschnitze valley (Črmošnjiško-Poljanska dolina) between Kočevske Poljane and Črmošnjice, others today mainly know standard German.\n\nGottscheerish and German, though autochthonous to Slovenia, have no official status and are not protected by law.\n\nCzech and Slovak, which used to be the fourth largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (after Italian, German, Hungarian, Croatian and Serbian), is now the native languages of a few hundred Slovenian residents.\n\nHistorically, German was the \"lingua franca\" of Central European space and was perceived as the language of commerce, science and literature in Slovenia. Consequently, German used to be the first foreign language taught in schools. With the formation of Yugoslavia, so-called Serbo-Croatian became the language of federal authorities and the first foreign language taught in school. But also, Slovenes pick up Croatian more easily than other foreign languages due to its relative similarity to Slovene.\n\nNowadays, English has superseded it and is taught as the first foreign language throughout the country from pre-school onwards. German has, however, retained its strong position as an important language and is the most common second foreign language in high schools. According to the EU, Slovenia has the highest competence in German of any non-Germanic country, with only Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Denmark being higher. Other second foreign languages are Italian, Spanish, French and Hungarian. Among the five subjects in the Slovenian finishing exam (Matura), one foreign language—most commonly English—is compulsory.\n\nAs a consequence of different foreign languages having been taught at different times, there is no prevailing foreign language knowledge in Slovenia. Younger generations know English and Croatian well enough to communicate, whereas elder generations speak Croatian better. There are also regional differences, especially among the knowledge of a second foreign language, with German being more frequently taught and used in Styria region, whereas residents of the Littoral region have better familiarity with Italian.\n"}

{"id": "40095143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40095143", "title": "Linguistic development of Genie", "text": "Linguistic development of Genie\n\nWhen the circumstances of Genie, the primary victim in one of the most severe cases of abuse, neglect and social isolation on record in medical literature, first became known in early November 1970, authorities arranged for her admission to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where doctors determined that at the age of 13 years and 7 months she had not acquired a first language. Hospital staff then began teaching Genie to speak General American English, and she gradually began to learn and use language. Their efforts soon caught the attention of linguists, who saw her as an important way to gain further insight into acquisition of language skills and linguistic development. Starting in late May 1971, UCLA professor Victoria Fromkin headed a team of linguists who began a detailed case study on Genie's progress with learning language. One of Fromkin's graduate students, Susan Curtiss, became especially involved in testing and recording Genie's linguistic development. Linguists' observations of Genie began that month, and in October of that year they began actively testing what principles of language she had acquired and was acquiring. Their studies enabled them to publish several academic works examining theories and hypotheses regarding the proposed critical period during which humans learn to understand and use language.\n\nOn broader levels Genie followed some normal patterns of young children acquiring a first language, but researchers noted many marked differences with her linguistic development. The size of her vocabulary and the speed with which she expanded it consistently outstripped anticipations, and many of the earliest words she learned and used were very different from typical first-language learners and strongly indicated that she possessed highly developed cognitive abilities. By contrast, she had far more difficulty acquiring and utilizing grammar. She clearly mastered some basic aspects of grammar, and understood significantly more than she used in her own speech, but her rate of grammar acquisition was much slower than normal. As a result, her vocabulary was consistently much more advanced and sophisticated than most people in equivalent phases of grammar acquisition. Researchers attributed some of her abnormal expressive language to physical difficulties she faced with speech production, and worked very hard to improve her ability to speak. Within months of being discovered Genie developed exceptional nonverbal communication skills and became capable of utilizing several methods of nonverbal communication to compensate for her lack of language, so researchers decided to also teach her a form of sign language.\n\nBy the time the scientists finished working with Genie, she had not fully mastered English grammar and her rate of acquisition had significantly slowed down. Linguists ultimately concluded that because Genie had not learned a first language before the critical period had ended, she was unable to fully acquire a language. Furthermore, despite the clear improvements in her conversational competence it remained very low, and her vocalizations remained highly atypical. While she had expanded her use of language to serve a wider range of functions, she had an unusually difficult time utilizing it during social interactions. Tests on Genie's brain found she was acquiring language in the right hemisphere of her brain despite being right-handed, giving rise to many new hypotheses and refining existing hypotheses on cerebral lateralization and its effect on linguistic development.\n\nTesting of Genie's language occurred until the end of 1977, but in mid-1975, when she was 18 years old, authorities placed her in a foster care setting which subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, causing her to become afraid to speak and to rapidly begin losing her newly acquired language skills. After removal from this location in April 1977 she moved through several more placements, some of which were highly abusive, causing further regression of her language skills. In early January 1978 Genie's mother suddenly decided to prevent any further testing and scientific observations of Genie, and the very little available information on her ability to communicate since that time is exclusively from personal observations or secondary accounts of them. Nonetheless, linguists have continued analyzing Genie's language long after this time. Since the case study on Genie ended, there has been some controversy and debate among linguists about how much grammar she had acquired and for how long she had been learning new aspects of language.\n\nGenie was the last, and second surviving, of four children of parents living in Arcadia, California, and was born in 1957 without any noted complications at a normal, healthy weight and size. Around the time of her birth, her father began to isolate himself and his family from other people. Her father decided that she was severely mentally retarded because she was late to walk due to treatment for a congenital hip dislocation, a view which intensified as she got older, and consequently disliked her. He tried not to talk to or pay attention to her and discouraged his wife and son, who was five years older than Genie, from doing so.\n\nDoctors and scientists who worked with Genie were uncertain about most of her life from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both malnutrition and some degree of neglect, although the few medical records from the first year of her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities. In conversations with members of the research team that studied Genie, her mother said that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not babble very much. At times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations. When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation than the rest of the family.\n\nGenie spent almost all of her childhood locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she learned not to vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.\n\nGenie's father had an extremely low tolerance for any kind of noise, refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. Apart from one slightly open window Genie did not have any access to auditory stimuli outside the house, and the window was set well away from the street and other houses, so what little she heard from outside almost exclusively consisted of environmental sounds. Her father never allowed other people in the house, only permitted his wife to be in Genie's presence for a few minutes each day while preventing her from interacting with Genie, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence. He did not permit them to speak, and especially not to or around Genie, so any conversations they had were out of Genie's earshot, keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.\n\nSometime during October 1970, Genie's mother left her husband and took Genie with her. A few weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother inadvertently entered a social services office, where a social worker observed Genie's behavior and total silence. The social worker and her supervisor brought Genie to the attention of child welfare authorities and the police, and a court order was immediately issued for Genie, who was 13 years and 7 months old, to be admitted to Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The police officer who arrested Genie's parents said that he and other authorities who interacted with Genie specifically noted that she did not speak.\n\nImmediately upon Genie's admission to Children's Hospital Howard Hansen, who was the head of the hospital's psychiatry division and an early expert on child abuse, and David Rigler, a therapist and USC pediatrics and psychology professor who was the chief psychologist at the hospital, took direct control of her care. The following day they assigned physician James Kent, another early advocate for child abuse awareness, to be her primary therapist. Early tests placed her estimated mental age at approximately a 13-month-old level, within the range of development when the earliest phases of language acquisition begin. Audiometry tests confirmed Genie had regular hearing in both ears, doctors found no physical or mental deficiencies explaining her lack of speech, and her few existing medical records did not contain any definitive diagnoses. Based on a series of daytime observations and sleep studies that Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in extreme social isolation, conducted in the months after her admission, doctors definitively ruled out autism or any brain damage.\n\nFrom the time of Genie's admission doctors saw clearly picked up some nonverbal information, with Kent emphasizing that she seemed very intent on looking at peoples' faces and made decent eye contact from other people, and she showed a small amount of responsiveness to it even in the absence of language. Despite this, Kent noted that she could only get across a few very basic needs and neither made facial expressions nor used any discernible body language. When Genie was upset she would engage in silent, expressionless, self-harming tantrums until she had physically tired herself out, after which she immediately reverted to being completely non-expressive. She never cried during these outbursts—according to several firsthand accounts she could not cry at all—and if she wanted to make noise she pushed chairs or other objects. On a few occasions she responded to stimuli with a very soft, high-pitched, shrill laugh, but was otherwise completely undemonstrative.\n\nKent's early notes on Genie contained little linguistic information, which linguists wrote demonstrated Genie's unresponsiveness to language. Kent observed that she seemed interested in other people talking and attentively looked at the mouth of a speaker but had almost no reaction to speech. She seemed to recognize only a very few words which she always reacted to as if she heard them in isolation, and was entirely unable to respond to very basic sentences or commands without non-linguistic information. Hospital staff initially thought she understood them based on her few responses, but later determined she was reacting to accompanying nonverbal signals. She almost never tried to speak, and Kent described these efforts as, \"a kind of throaty whimper.\" Because she had been forced to repress all vocalization during infancy and childhood her larynx and vocal tract were extremely underused and the muscles used for speech production were severely atrophied, which doctors believed made it difficult for her to control both air flow and her vocal chords.\n\nFrom tapes of Genie's first two months in the hospital, linguists discerned that by January 1971 she knew her own name, the words \"mother\" and \"father\", the four color words \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", and \"brown\", the words \"no\" and \"sorry\", and a few miscellaneous nouns such as \"jewelry box\", \"door\", and \"bunny\". She also appeared to understand negative commands, and accordingly could discern a warning using a negation, although whether she understood them in the context of sentences was unclear. There was speculation, though no conclusive evidence, that she understood the intonation to indicate a yes or no question and that she understood imperative mood sentences based on tone of voice, but she otherwise lacked any grammar. Her active vocabulary at that time appeared to consist of just two short phrases, \"stop it\" and \"no more\". Some doctors thought she may have spontaneously said a few other words or negative commands, as her very few vocalizations were extremely difficult to understand, but there was no record of them and no one could remember what they might have been. Linguists could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before then, and therefore did not know whether she acquired any or all of this language during the preceding two months at the hospital.\n\nGenie's comprehension and production of these few words demonstrated that she distinguished speech from other environmental sounds and could hear individual phonemes when listening to people talking, two critical early components of language acquisition. Nonetheless, based on their observations both Children's Hospital doctors and the linguists who later worked with her concluded that she had not acquired a first language during childhood. Due to the lack of physical or mental explanations for her lack of speech, Kent and Hansen attributed it to the extreme isolation of her childhood. Kent came away from his first encounters with Genie extremely pessimistic about her prognosis on all fronts.\n\nChildren's Hospital staff did not keep detailed records of Genie's early linguistic progress, and she only rarely spoke during this time, so there was little data on Genie's language for the first 6 months of her stay. When Kent met with Genie for the first time, he initially observed no visible reactions from her but eventually found that she seemed afraid of a small puppet. When she threw it on the floor Kent pretended to be concerned and said, \"We have to get him back\", and Genie startled him when she repeated the word \"back\" and nervously laughed. When they subsequently played with the puppet she repeated \"back\" several times, and when Kent said, \"The puppet will fall\" she repeated the word \"fall\". Apart from her tantrums, the times she played with this and similar puppets accounted for most of the few instances she made any outward expression during the early part of her stay.\n\nWithin weeks of being admitted to Children's Hospital Genie became much more responsive to nonverbal stimuli, although at first her own demeanor remained devoid of nonverbal signals. During the first months that she lived at the hospital, she gradually began to express more of her emotions outward. After a fairly short time, Genie's nonverbal communication skills became exceptional. Everyone who worked with her said she had an indescribable way of eliciting emotions, and she seemed able to communicate her desires without talking.\n\nGenie's early receptive and expressive vocabulary acquisition was slow, although from the outset people observing her believed her linguistic performance was significantly behind her linguistic competence. Within a month she became far more responsive to other people talking, but doctors were unsure whether she was responding more to verbal or nonverbal stimuli. After a month she started attempting to mimic speech, albeit very infrequently, and soon after hospital staff observed her saying \"stopit\", which she treated as one word, as a phrase of ritual play. Even at this phase she distinguished the names of similar objects, even if they were unfamiliar, but never overgeneralized words for individual objects. For something unfamiliar she always sought the correct word or phrase instead of attempting to apply a word from her existing vocabulary, and could determine the names of objects based on their uses.\n\nPsychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block evaluated Genie in February 1971 and put her language below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but could not be sure about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.\n\nBy May 1971, most of Genie's vocabulary consisted of words for colors, the numbers 1 through 5, the word \"mama\" and a few peoples' names, the verbs \"stop it\" and \"spit\", and a large number of miscellaneous nouns\". She also knew a few compound verbs, such as \"put back\", although she treated them as single words in her vocabulary, and learned few stative verbs within the typical time frame of language acquisition. Whereas children's vocabulary primarily consists of nouns and a few particles, Genie's early lexicon contained almost as many adjectives and verbs as nouns, and unlike most children she used entire phrases as labels, only doing so with single words if asked. Before she began forming two-word sentences she could both ask for something and associate an object with someone, which was normal, but unlike most children she could also ask about memories or future events which had previously been mentioned. In late May 1971 with Jean Butler, her teacher at the hospital, Genie showed comprehension of basic commands.\n\nGenie had very little control of her voice during this time, so it was completely monotonic, abnormally high-pitched, and very soft, with many of her early utterances completely silent and others so quiet that they sounded like whispers. Throughout 1971 her voice was extremely glottalized, and when she spoke she frequently pronounced only a few sounds; for instance, the word \"doctor\" sounded more like \"dert\". Despite knowing how to ask questions, she could only indicate them through facial expressions. Despite the lack of variability in her own voice, she clearly understood different tones of voice in other peoples' speech.\n\nLike young children most of Genie's first words were monosyllabic consonant-vowel-(consonant) sequences, usually consisting of an unaspirated Bilabial stop or dental stop and a monophthong. But while most children's first disyllabic words also follow this pattern, hers had both consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant sequences. Unusually, from the very first disyllabic words Genie more fully articulated, except when referring to herself by her (real) name she immediately demonstrated proper stress patterns. For approximately two years the length of time she held out a vowel was her only stress indicator, and during that time was very exaggerated. People unfamiliar with her speech said she sounded either like a deaf child or someone with cerebral palsy, although trained speech pathologists only said the latter.\n\nIn December 1970 David Rigler procured a small grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to conduct preliminary studies on Genie, and in May 1971 Rigler organized and headed a team of doctors and scientists who sought and obtained a three-year grant from the NIMH to carry out a full case study. The primary focus of their research was to test the hypothesis of Eric Lenneberg that humans have a critical period for language acquisition, the end of which he defined as the onset of puberty, and the innateness hypothesis of Noam Chomsky, which contended that the ability to learn language is instinctive in humans and is what separates humans from all other animals. UCLA linguistics professor Victoria Fromkin headed linguistic evaluation and organized a group of linguists to design and carry out their study. Shortly afterwards, in late May, Susan Curtiss began her work on Genie's case as a graduate student in linguistics under Fromkin.\n\nThe relative lack of linguistic information on Genie from the previous six months left some ambiguities about the rate and timeline of Genie's early vocabulary and grammar acquisition. Curtiss and Fromkin quickly decided that Genie's linguistic abilities were not yet at a usefully testable level, so for the rest of Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with her almost every day for observations. They soon realized existing linguistic tests would not yield meaningful results, so although they also incorporated a few existing tests, including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, into their exams, they designed a set of 26 new tests from which they extrapolated most of their data. Curtiss also wrote down every spontaneous utterance she heard from Genie, ultimately recording approximately a few thousand.\n\nCurtiss quickly recognized Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie had with strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name most of the things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she wanted to know the word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.\n\nIn early June 1971 Genie began to use her first words with two morphemes and constructed her earliest two-word sentences, all of which were modifier-noun or noun-noun attributive constructions such as \"More soup\" or \"Genie purse\". A short time later, she began to produce noun-predicate adjective sentences such as \"Dave sick\". During this time, she never used equational sentences characteristic of young children in this phase of development. In addition, while most children form early two-word sentences with a few core words, which they attach to a wider variety of words, Curtiss never observed Genie doing this.\n\nIn late June 1971 Genie moved into Jean Butler's home, where she stayed until early August. Butler was childless, and at the time lived alone. Soon after moving in with Butler Genie, who had turned 14 while living at Children's Hospital, showed the first signs of reaching puberty, definitively putting her past Lenneberg's proposed critical period. The only linguistic information from anyone besides Butler during Genie's stay was that Genie formed some non-imitative two-word utterances in July, all without verbs and in noun phrase–noun phrase form, and that she gave her first imitations of a few unspecified three-word utterances.\n\nButler wrote that Genie rapidly became far more verbal and that the man she was dating, who moved in with her during Genie's stay and was a well known psychologist and retired University of Southern California professor, commented on Genie's talkativeness. She specifically claimed that she taught Genie to say \"yes\" to other people, to use negative word forms, and to express her anger through words or by hitting objects. Butler said Genie argued with her in late July and used negatives in her protestations, the first report of Genie using negatives in a sentence and of expressing disagreement in language. In an early August letter to Jay Shurley Butler wrote that Genie regularly used two-word sentences and sometimes produced three-word utterances, giving \"one black kitty\" as an example, containing two adjacent adjectives to describe nouns, and that in a recent conversation Genie extensively used negative words and sentences. Butler also reported that a few days prior, when she asked Genie why she threw her new pet goldfish outside, Genie explained, \"bad orange fish—no eat—bad fish\", which would have been by far her longest utterance to that point.\n\nIn mid-August 1971, authorities removed Genie from Butler's house and returned her to Children's Hospital. Later the same day they transferred her to David Rigler's home, where she stayed for approximately four years. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, one of whom left for college shortly after Genie arrived. For the duration of Genie's stay Rigler's wife, Marilyn, was her teacher; Marilyn had graduate training as a social worker and had just completed a graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in both nursery schools and Head Start Programs. Immediately after Genie moved in with the Riglers, linguists resumed detailed observations.\n\nBeginning in January 1971 scientists administered a series of neurolinguistics tests on Genie, making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed brain examinations. Based on tests and observations in everyday situations, doctors concluded that she was right-handed and that her brain was extremely right-hemisphere dominant for all functions. On tests specifically measuring Genie's language, her results were congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. On a tachistoscopic test in 1975, Genie had little difficulty when asked to point to words which rhyme. Genie also did very well on one evoked response test involving familiar homophones, demonstrating that, similar to these patients, her receptive language comprehension was significantly better than her expressive comprehension. An EEG consistently picked up more activity from her right hemisphere than they did from the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area in a right-handed person, especially finding a high level of involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex.\n\nBased on these results the concluded that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center when she was a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.\n\nWhen Genie first moved in with the Riglers she still scratched and cut herself when angry, and researchers wrote that her speech was much more halting and hesitant than Butler had described. She infrequently spoke, and for reasons they could not discern she almost always a several minutes delay in her responses to speech. Typically she did not seem to listen to anyone unless she was being directly addressed and typically walked away from somebody who was speaking to her, and while she would stay with someone if specifically asked she rarely seemed attuned to what the person was saying. In contrast to Butler's writings the scientists wrote that Genie only rarely used two-word sentences, and prior to October 1971 they were all modifier-noun sentences, sentences indicating possession—none containing the possessive \" 's \" marker—or the two words of a compound noun such as \"number five\". For the first few months linguists did not record any utterances longer than two words, and wrote that she did not use any negative sentences.\n\nMarilyn taught Genie to take her frustration out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By the end of her stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to people talking even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.\n\nDuring this time the scientists observed that, unlike young children, Genie would never use any piece of grammar before complete comprehension. She also never spoke with the excessive specificity and overly marked words, such as \"tooked\", that are characteristic of people in this phase of language acquisition. Furthermore, whereas children typically begin to use two-word phrases when their vocabulary is about 50 words, Genie only began to do so after she could use and understand about 200, matching the timeline previously observed in children with various types of aphasia. Curtiss also noted that when Genie used the word \"dog\" to describe any dog but not other animals, indicating she understood how to use generic terms, and that upon learning the name of the Riglers' dog she recognized that name was specific to him. In 1978, language psychologist Susan Goldin-Meadow suggested Genie's lack of overgeneralization may have been due to differences between the mind of a young child versus an adolescent as opposed to the properties of early language acquisition. She also had many more action verbs than normal in her early vocabulary.\n\nAt first Genie did not use negative word forms but soon showed comprehension of them, an ability previously observed in split-brain and adult left-hemispherectomy patients, albeit much more consistently with the word \"not\" and contraction \"n't\" than the prefix \"un\". Instead of learning negatives through the three-step process which linguists believed young children did, she appeared to have learned every kind of negation at once. In September and October 1971 she began incorporating verbs into her two-word utterances, such as, \"Dave hurt\", although at first she never included the first person subject and inconsistently included any subject. Although Genie's two-word sentences contained grammatical properties typical of young children she was much better at labeling and describing emotions and concrete objects, especially colors, sizes, and qualities, and most of her earliest two-word sentences modified nouns. Taken with her distinction between general and subordinate terms, this strongly indicated a focus on physical characteristics to a degree not seen in most children.\n\nCurtiss began active testing of Genie's language in October 1971, when she and Fromkin decided her linguistic abilities had advanced to the point where they would yield usable results. Their tests measured both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including syntax, phonology, and morphology, and Curtiss conducted the primary analysis of the results. At first the tests were deliberately short, only looking for six to eight responses per test, and over the course of testing they gradually increased in duration. When Curtiss began testing Genie usually did not actively resist but never initiated tests and only did the absolute least amount required, which Curtiss attributed to Genie simply being lazy, making the first year of testing extremely difficult. As Curtiss continued Genie grew to largely enjoy being tested and was typically much more willing to participate, though she still usually continued to less than she was capable of and sometimes playfully gave deliberately wrong answers, and on some occasions would even indicate that she wanted to take the tests.\n\nUpon commencing her tests Curtiss found that although Genie's comprehension was clearly ahead of her production, it was only slightly ahead. Genie had begun to diversify her two-word utterances to include sentences in either subject-verb or verb-object order, suggesting she was grasping the subject–verb–object sentence structure typically used in English, and could follow other basic word order rules as evidenced in her verb-complement sentences. While Genie did not use plural forms of words and could not distinguish between plural and singular words or inflections, by October 1971 she clearly distinguished between one versus more than one object and understood numbers and quantitative descriptors. She also started using some regular past tense forms of weak verbs. On tests she consistently did better recognizing and responding to the conjugations of irregular past tense verbs and strong verbs, but she only started to use these forms, either in imitation or in spontaneous speech, in 1973, and they remained limited.\n\nIn a conference presentation during 1972 Fromkin said that by November 1971 Genie's speech was, \"strictly rule-governed\", and that her grammar at that time was similar to a typical 18- to 20-month-old. In November 1971 Genie began forming noun-predicate two-word utterances, such as \"stocking white\". Genie had also begun using the genitive case in some of her two-word sentences around this time, with many of these sentences, such as \"Marilyn bike\", indicating possession. In all of these early possessive sentences, she entirely relied on word order.\n\nNovember 1971 was also the time that Genie produced her first spontaneous three- to four-word utterances, although they were extremely uncommon at first. All were either modifier–noun sentences such as \"little white clear box\", subject–verb–object sentences in noun–verb–noun form such as \"Tori chew glove\", or verb–noun phrase sentences, and some, such as \"Small two cup\", clearly demonstrated these were not imitations. In them she used grammar which the scientists thought she knew but could not previously confirm, including the first-person subject in sentences such as \"Genie love Curtiss\", and could incorporate what would have been a modifier-noun or possessive utterance into a longer sentence, further convincing linguists that she understood subject–verb–object word order. Some utterances from this time until the end of 1973, such as \"Elevator hurt silly goose\", were completely unintelligible, and a few of these, such as \"Angry burn stove\", were subject–subject–subject sentences previously observed in children with various language disorders. Whereas most children progress beyond two-word sentences after four to six weeks, it took Genie five months to do so.\n\nOn tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss determined that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such as \"little\" as absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word \"little\" with \"tiny\", Genie showed clear comprehension of them. Genie clearly understood both the word \"more\" and the suffix \"-er\" as comparatives by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the conjunctions \"and\" and \"or\" as if they both meant \"and\", but even after recognizing there was a difference never fully grasped the meaning of \"or\". On tests she showed perfect comprehension of \"and\" while correctly responding to the word \"or\" fewer than 10% of the time, but she always understood disjunction marked by the word \"or\" in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly ungrammatical exception never tried to connect two sentences.\n\nBefore December 1971 Genie could only use one noun in a sentence, but beginning in early 1972 Genie could form increasingly complex noun phrases. In early 1972, Genie began combining verbs to form two-word verbs in her sentences; most of these were two-word utterances requesting an action, such as \"Leave on\", but at least once in early November 1973 she included a two-word verb in part of a longer sentence. She also began using two consecutive verbs in some of her three and four word utterances. By this time she could also use two-word noun phrases, such as \"piece wood\", in different contexts, but a later analysis by linguist Derek Bickerton speculated that she treated all of these as single words in her vocabulary. Genie's first locative sentences also appeared around this time, all of which were two or three words, always in either noun-noun or verb-noun form with one of the nouns being a locative noun, and contained no prepositions, and the scientists simultaneously observed her first verb phrase constructions.\n\nThroughout January and February 1972 Genie more consistently using-word subject–verb and verb–object utterances, which linguists viewed as confirmation that she had mastered English word order. During this time she began to use the prepositions \"in\" and \"on\", the first words she used to exclusively serve a grammatical purpose, although she did not always include them and all of her early uses were in answers to questions. When Curtiss tested her on possessive sentences such as \"Point to the cat's foot\" and \"Point to the foot of the cat\" during this time Genie was only correct 50% of the time, but after March of that year she demonstrated full comprehension of both constructions despite not using either in her speech. In February 1972 she produced negative sentences, all consisting of \"No more\" appended to the beginning of either a noun or a noun and a verb which could have been an independent utterance.\n\nIn the spring of 1972 Genie began to spontaneously use the definite article \"the\", marking the first determiner in her speech, but for several months almost exclusively used it in imitation. In April and May 1972, by which time she was steadily increasing the complexity of her verb phrases, she began using these with similarly expanded noun phrases. In May she also began using the verb \"have\" in possessive sentences, i.e., \"Miss Fromkin have blue car.\" The following month she began to use \"No more\" with only a verb, such as \"No more have\", to form negative sentences, always at the beginning of what could have been an independent utterance.\n\nDuring July 1972 the scientists noted Genie's first verb-verb phrase sentences, such as \"Like chew meat\", and she then quickly began using complex verbs with complex noun phrases, as in the utterance \"Want buy toy refrigerator\". By this Genie still showed no comprehension of regular plurals, so in her first active attempt to teach Genie grammar Curtiss created a test to help her learn them. By August 1972 Genie mastered them, in contrast with earlier observations of people acquiring language in their right hemispheres who never learned any singular/plural distinction. After that time she used them in imitation, although she only used regular plurals in five undated spontaneous utterances despite practice with pronouncing a final \"s\", and never used any irregular plurals.\n\nBy November 1972 Genie could use the word \"on\", although it was uncertain whether she distinguished between \"on\" and \"in\" and Curtiss wrote that all of Genie's earliest utterances containing \"on\" and \"in\" were answers to somebody asking her a question, and could correctly use the suffix \"-ing\" to describe events in the present progressive. These were the first grammatical markers in her speech, and both are normally two of the first grammatical markers young children can use. Her use of \"-ing\" on exclusively dynamic verbs also indicated to linguists that she categorized dynamic versus stative verbs, although she did not use it with the verb \"to be\" until the fall of 1973 and then only when speaking in first or third-person. Even after learning the present progressive she inconsistently gave correct responses to it on tests, and use of the suffix \"-ing\" was the only way Genie modified a sentence without changing any of the base words. Although Genie had gained some understanding of number words during her initial stay at Children's Hospital she only began to count in sequential order in late 1972, always in very deliberate and laborious manner, and her progress was extremely slow.\n\nIn December 1972, after Curtiss and Genie had accidentally been locked out of the Riglers' home, Curtiss said to Genie, \"Tell them [David and Marilyn Rigler] what happened\" and Genie pointed to the door and said, \"Tell door lock\"; this indicated her language included recursion, which they considered an especially important development. The scientists interpreted another utterance from 1973, \"Ask David see swing\", as both further confirmation she had grasped recursion and the first complex sentence she produced. By this time she understood and used intensifiers such as the word \"very\", but only tenuously grasped superlatives. She never used them in her own speech but appeared to understand them, and while she was generally better with the suffix \"-est\" than with the word \"most\" Curtiss thought Genie might not have known the actual meaning of \"-est\". The contrast between her understanding and lack of production of superlatives furthered the researchers' belief that, even in the absence of language, her cognition had developed in some form.\n\nIn early 1973 Genie started using definite articles in imitative utterances, such as \"In the backyard\". By this time she had also gained the ability to spontaneously use the prepositions \"next to\", \"beside\", \"behind\", \"in\", \"at\", \"front\", and \"after\". However, until 1975 she exclusively used \"at\" in the phrase \"at school\", leading Curtiss to believe \"at school\" was one word in her vocabulary, and Genie inconsistently understood other prepositions such as \"behind\", \"over\", and \"in front of\". Curtiss wrote that on tests Genie frequently mistook both \"behind\" and \"in back of\" for \"in front of\", though by 1977 her understanding of \"behind\" on tests had substantially improved. By contrast, on non-test settings Genie's responses to \"in front of\", \"behind\", \"in back of\", and \"under\" generally indicated comprehension; unlike most children, who learn \"under\" well before the other three, she had somewhat more difficulty with \"under\".\n\nIn March 1973 Genie seemed unable to grasp \"on\" or \"under\" on one test, even though she had correctly used \"on\" in non-test settings, but the scientists suggested this was because of logistical difficulties unique to that test. On a different test Genie at first gave correct responses to \"on\" 48% of the time, and her confusion was mostly with the words \"in\" or \"under\", but by September 1973 she showed full comprehension of both \"in\" and \"on\". Soon afterward she began consistently including \"a\" in noun phrases, and eventually used both articles and the words \"and\" and \"more\" in noun phrases. In the early spring of that year she began to use the determiner \"another\" and started occasionally including prepositions and determiners in adverbial phrases, such as, \"In hospital, shot hurt arm\". Genie's acquisition of locative adverbs came before she learned ones for either time or manner, which was normal, but although she started to use time adverbs a few months later she never used any manner adverbs.\n\nBy April 1973 Genie began regularly using verb particles in her spontaneous utterances, frequently using phrases such as \"put back\" and \"take off\" , and began using imperative sentences using the vocative case. Researchers noted she began using imperatives much later in the language acquisition process than normal and that they remained very infrequent, and considered either her emotional difficulties or lack of self-concept possible explanations. By mid-1973 Genie had begun to include indirect objects in her sentences, such as \"Curtiss give me valentine\", and could use definite and indefinite articles but never distinguished between the two. In addition, whereas most people learn to use demonstratives and numbers at the same time, she never used these in her early spontaneous noun phrases, and in 1977 Curtiss noted that Genie had never used any demonstratives. In the fall of 1973 Genie began correctly using the verb \"has\" as the third person singular form of the verb \"to have\", but continued not to conjugate it in most situations and never used any other third person singular forms, so linguists suggested she may have learned it as a separate word instead of a conjugation.\n\nIn October 1973, in addition to forming negative sentences with the phrase \"No more\" Genie began to use the word \"No\" by itself. For both she still appended the negation to the beginning of an otherwise unaltered utterance, which was the normal first step for children learning negation. About a week later, she started using the word \"not\" in the same manner in sentences and showed clear understanding of more complex forms of negation. But while children usually quickly progress to saying \"I not\" and then \"I do not\", and then learn to use contractions, Genie did not move past this stage until early 1975. In addition, despite clearly understanding the negative prefix \"un-\" by this time Genie never used it in her speech.\n\nStarting in September 1972 Curtiss spent a great deal of time testing Genie's acquisition of pronouns and at first found that Genie strenuously resisted, often refusing to respond or clearly guessing, until becoming more receptive to them in late 1973. By December 1972 Genie understood and spontaneously used the pronoun \"I\", pronouncing it with more stress for emphasis, but almost exclusively used it with the words \"want\" or \"like\" and still frequently referred to herself by name. She did not show any comprehension of any other pronouns besides \"you\" and \"me\", which she interchangeably used; Genie would often say, \"Mama love you\" while pointing to herself, which Curtiss attributed to a manifestation of Genie's inability to distinguish who she was from who someone else was. Genie did not spontaneously use any other pronouns or use pronominal forms in her speech, although by 1973 she clearly understood the reciprocal pronoun \"each other\".\n\nIn 1973 and early 1974 Genie identified possessive pronouns, such as \"his\", \"your\", and \"my\", with less than 50% accuracy. By 1973 she began to use the possessive pronoun \"my\", making \"my\" and the possessive pronoun \"her\" the only possessive pronouns she learned. Curtiss wrote that this comprehension was not total, and was at least partially predicated on the method of testing. On another test from this time on reflexive pronouns, such as \"The boy is feeding himself\", she got more wrong than right but did somewhat better on sentences using object pronouns, such as \"He is feeding him\". Curtiss also recorded Genie using the word \"it\" twice, but only in sentences that were, for all practical purposes, imitative utterances.\n\nPrior to January 1972, if someone asked Genie a question using the interrogative word \"where\" she invariably responded by saying the last word of the speaker's sentence. In early January 1972 she began to give accurate, grammatical responses to \"where\" questions in conversations. By February 1972, in everyday interactions Genie clearly understood and appropriately acted on most questions using the interrogative words \"who\", \"what\", \"where\", \"when\", \"why\", \"which\", and \"how\". Unlike most children, who grasp \"who\", \"what\", \"which\", and \"where\" questions much earlier than \"when\", \"how\", or \"why\" questions, the only one of these which took longer for Genie understand was \"why\" and even this took much less time than linguists expected. Because the latter group of questions require more cognitive sophistication to properly answer, the scientists offered this as additional proof that Genie had a higher level of cognitive functioning than most children in similar phases of language acquisition.\n\nDespite this, on most simple test questions such as \"Who is the girl pulling?\" or \"What is the red box on?\" Genie did not react or reply to test questions at all. When she did respond she clearly had no understanding of the sentence and gave completely ungrammatical and nonsensical answers, either stating the answer in the question, attempting to fuse two separate questions into one, or attempting to state a declarative sentence as a question. She also remained entirely unable to ask an interrogative question in conversation, only ever attempting to upon specific request, and efforts during mid-1973 to help her memorize interrogative questions were completely unsuccessful. Curtiss theorized this inability was because Genie had no deixis or linguistic movement in her speech, and in 1975 the scientists speculated emotional difficulties may have made her unwilling to attempt them in spontaneous speech. Curtiss attributed Genie's failure to memorize them to being generally unable to remember sentences using grammar she had not mastered, which is typical of young children. After seeing how much trouble the tests gave Genie Curtiss ended them, and after approximately a year people stopped asking her to produce these questions.\n\nFrom October 1973 to January 1974, on simple past tense sentences such as, \"The girl opened the umbrella\" Genie was only correct 50% of the time, but was almost perfect with past tense completive sentences marked with the verb \"finish\", such as \"The girl finished opening the umbrella.\" It was unclear if she learned to use irregular past tense verbs, as all of her utterances in which she used them were either imitations or responses to questions containing them. Curtiss also used this test to gauge Genie's knowledge of the future tense, and found she showed almost perfect comprehension of the going-to future construction but showed no understanding of sentences with an identical semantic meaning but using the auxiliary verb \"will\"; by contrast, children almost always correctly respond to both. The scientists wrote her lack of comprehension or use of auxiliary structures, despite understanding identical messages phrased with inflected words, was consistent with her ability to grasp conceptual information far better than grammar.\n\nAt the end of 1973 and into early 1974 Genie's locative sentences underwent considerable expansion, as she produced utterances such as, \"Like good Harry at hospital\". In a few sentences from this time she began to incorporate the words of other people into her own utterances, as in \"Dentist say drink water\"; direct quotations would remain the only situation in which she could engage in any embedding of elements of language, and these remained very rare. On one occasion in early February 1974 she used the iterative aspect via reduplication in the utterance \"Tomorrow big, big prize hula hoop\". As this kind of reduplication is much more commonly expressed through the word \"very\", Curtiss found Genie's use of it abnormal.\n\nBy early 1974 the scientists estimated that Genie's grammar was congruous with a typical two or two and a half year old, although her progress remained unusually slow. Around this time Curtiss found that, unlike most children but similar to adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients, she was completely unable to distinguish between active and passive voice, giving random responses to these sentences and never gaining any use of the passive voice. In these sentences Genie would often, though not always, confuse the subject and object, contrasting with her ability to process subject–verb–object sentences in other contexts and her own subject–verb–object sentences, but these reversals were only with certain pronouns and became significantly less common by January 1974. On a test between February 1974 to July 1975, Genie also showed no comprehension of the words \"many\", \"most\", \"few\", or \"fewest\".\n\nIn the late spring of 1974 Genie began to use the phrase \"no more\" to represent its common lexical meaning, as demonstrated in the utterance \"No more penny\". During May 1974 Curtiss recorded Genie's first compound noun phrases, which were the only times Genie would use the word \"and\". At the same time Curtiss noted Genie's first compound sentences, but with one possible exception, the utterance \"I want save money buy two rectangle box\" dated early October 1974, she did not use any compound verb phrases. During this time Genie also used a few verb infinitives in her speech, in all instances clearly treating them as one word, and began adding the pronoun \"my\" to her possessive sentences and using the marker \" 's \" to indicate possession. Curtiss also noted that Genie never confused gender, although she only marked it through gender-specific nouns.\n\nIn both test settings and conversations Genie still sometimes reversed \"I\" and \"you\", \"my\" and \"your\", and \"me\" and \"you\", but during the summer of 1974 she began to show definite improvement in both her comprehension and production of first and second person pronouns. In August she started to demonstrate the ability to modify first subject and then object pronouns. By mid-1975, her confusion of \"me\" versus \"you\" and \"my\" versus \"your\" was much less frequent. Curtiss also noted Genie starting to use the benefactive case during this time, although she did not always include the word \"for\".\n\nGenie also understood \"self\" and \"selves\" as reflexive pronoun markers, and in most scenarios she understood reflexive pronouns. The exception was when she encountered a noun phrase with a pronoun she misunderstood; for instance, if given the sentence, \"He is feeding himself\", she frequently confused \"he\" with \"she\" and therefore changed \"himself\" to \"herself\". In sentences with reciprocals or the reflexive pronoun \"themselves\" she appeared to understand the pronoun \"they\", but never used it in her own speech; Curtiss thought Genie was likely guessing the meaning from context, as Genie could discern plurality from the elements of the sentences using it. Her pronoun acquisition was described at that time as \"painfully slow\", but researchers insisted there was definite progress. There were certain pronouns, such as object pronouns or the word \"there\" as a pronoun, that Genie never used or understood.\n\nIn the fall of 1974 Genie produced a few utterances with internal negatives, although she had specifically practiced all but two of these early sentences and one of the spontaneous occurrences was a partial imitation, and these sentences grew more common until she completely mastered their use by early 1975. Curtiss did not view this as linguistic movement, believing that Genie's grammar simply changed to place negations in the middle of a sentence. By the fall of 1974 Genie began differentiating between third-person pronouns such as \"he\" and \"she\", but still had a high rate of error and did not use these, relative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns. She had used locatives after subject noun phrases for a long time, but only did so after an object phrase in late 1974. At around the same time she had begun to use more than one prepositional phrase in some sentences, and in the spring of 1975 she fully comprehended the preposition \"between\" on tests.\n\nIn 1975 Genie began to use a different type of serial verb construction, in sentences such as \"I like go ride Miss F. car\". Curtiss noted that all of these were first-person utterances, that she almost never said the word \"I\", and that she frequently used standalone verbs, such as \"go\", which typically precede a second verb; although in several cases she said \"go ride\" and \"go walk\", Curtiss thought Genie may have treated these as single words and were therefore not as complicated as they appeared. In addition, all of these sentences were in verb–(verb–verb phrase) form which Curtiss argued had no hierarchical structure, although an outside analysis argued they had contained some degree of hierarchy. In non-test settings during early 1975 Genie gave some indications, including one verbal response to David Rigler, that she grasped conditional sentences, but Curtiss said she could not be completely certain. Curtiss also noted that, despite the fact that Genie clearly understood contractions, she did not use any in her speech.\n\nBy at least 1975 Genie clearly understood and incorporated the concept of temporality into her speech, and unusually for people acquiring a first language she understood the words \"before\" and \"after\" before learning past or future tense markers. She could also use sentences to indicate causation, albeit without saying the words \"if\" and \"then\". Despite this, by 1975 Genie remained largely unable to respond to sentences where the nouns were not in the same sequence as the events, such as \"Touch your ear after you touch your nose\", although she improved more with sentences asking her to do something \"after\" instead of doing something \"before\". In a 1981 paper Curtiss interpreted Genie's temporal utterances as an expansion of Genie's vocabulary, but an outside analysis of Curtiss' writings concluded that Genie had to have acquired some degree of grammar to have formed these sentences.\n\nWhen first asked to distinguish between \"all\", \"some\", and \"one\" Genie would interpret \"some\" to mean \"all\", but by 1975 she reversed this and began mistaking \"some\" for \"one\", which Curtiss interpreted as a sign of progress. This contrasted with her distinction between \"more\" and \"less\", which she had demonstrated by at least August 1973, and her understanding of the qualifiers \"one\" and \"all\" in everyday conversations. When learning relative terms such as \"large\" and \"small\" or \"narrow\" and \"wide\" she simultaneously learned both words in the pair, whereas most people acquire either the marked or the negative form first, and never mistakenly used one term in a pair to mean the other. Although she had difficulty with different pairs of relative and relational terms on tests, she showed significantly greater comprehension outside of test settings.\n\nIn early 1975 Genie began to use a type of ungrammatical sentence with a subject–verb–(object or subject)–verb–({subject or object}–verb) construction. Curtiss wrote that some of these sentences could have been grammatically correct if they included relative pronouns, but that others looked like two separate sentences which Genie had simply combined while removing some of the nouns. At around the same time Genie also began to produce ungrammatical sentences containing a copula, first with utterances such as \"Is Akron\" and later including verbs without the \"-ing\" suffix such as \"Boy is pinch\". Curtiss wrote that approximately one half of these types of ungrammatical sentences were Genie's responses to people who told her to, \"speak in sentences\", which she would interpret as being asked to include a form of \"to be\" in a sentence. Curtiss noted that Genie also produced some grammatical sentences with copulas, such as \"Glass is clear\".\n\nDespite mastering word order, Genie still had difficulty with distinguishing between simple actor–action–object sentences. In 1975, when given the sentences \"The girl pulls the boy\" or \"The boy pulls the girl\" and asked to point to the corresponding picture, her answers would either be all correct or all incorrect. While this was progress from 1971 and 1972, when she simply guessed, this indicated that she was attempting to use a word order strategy but could not ascertain a specific formula. Her difficulty with this also manifested itself in her inability to use word order to tell the difference between sentences such as, \"What is on the blue box?\" and, \"What is the blue box on?\". In addition to the disparity with the results on pronoun and relative clause tests, in which she used word order strategies, researchers wrote this was a major contrast with the clear word order rules in her spontaneous speech.\n\nBy early 1975 Genie showed comprehension of simple and complex sentences where the object was the relative clause, such as \"The boy is looking at the girl who is frowning\", or sentences where the subject was the relative clause and did not end in a noun phrase, such as \"The boy who is frowning is looking at the girl\". However, when interpreting a complex sentence in which a relative clause ending in a noun phrase came before the main verb, such as \"The boy who is looking at the girl is frowning\", she interpreted the noun closest to the verb as the subject. The scientists wrote that this meant that she was using a word order strategy, which they considered progress because her earlier responses to them were clearly guesses. By this time Genie could only consistently count as high as 7 in sequential order, which came at the expense of her ability to do so via gestalt perception.\n\nBy 1975 Genie demonstrated full comprehension of several paired words, such as \"long\" and \"short\" or \"high\" and \"low\". Most of the time she learned both words in a pair at the same time, and in a few cases learned either the negative or the marked word in the pair first; for instance, she learned the word \"narrow\" before \"wide\" and \"few\" before \"many\". For some paired words, such as \"left\" and \"right\", her answers on tests were still less than 100% even by 1977 consistently showed the same level of understanding for each word. However, Genie never made any distinction between the words \"here\" and \"there\"; on multiple tests, when told to come or go to a person or area her response to either, \"Come here\" and, \"Go there\" was always to go to either the closest or the farthest person or area.\n\nWhen Genie left the Riglers' house in mid-1975, at the age of 18, she had acquired a degree of vocabulary and grammar far greater than that observed in non-human subjects. In June of that year, David Rigler wrote that she continued to make significant strides in every field which the scientists were testing. Despite the marked improvement in Genie's language, it was still clearly abnormal. The words she learned continued to remain far ahead of the grammar she possessed and still showed an unusual focus on objective properties, and the gap between her receptive and expressive vocabulary had grown. While her use and comprehension of grammar had clearly improved, and papers from the time indicated she was continuing to acquire it, they were still highly deficient and her progress remained far slower than linguists had anticipated. And how much of what she did use was attributable to acquisition versus rote memory was not readily obvious.\n\nDespite Genie's grammar acquisition, her speech remained entirely devoid of pro-forms, modal verbs, modal particles, or auxiliary verbs. She memorized a few ritual phrases containing auxiliary structures but only used them in very specific ways, so linguists did not consider these grammar acquisition. In the spring of 1974 Curtiss thought Genie may have acquired use of the contractible auxiliary \"you\", but wrote that she only used it in sentences that were mostly imitative. In January 1974 the scientists noted the first copulas in her spontaneous sentences, but she never used a contractible copula. By early 1975 Genie had started including do-support in some of her sentences, such as the utterance \"I do not have a red pail\", but only in negative sentences with memorized phrases, almost exclusively the phrase \"I do not have\", causing Curtiss to speculate that Genie had simply memorized the words \"I do\" as an independent phrase. Even then, Genie frequently omitted or incorrectly used it.\n\nDuring everyday interactions with other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, and when she did talk it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than she was actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.\n\nUnusually for a first language learner, Genie never engaged in any kind of experimentation with language. Sometimes if Genie mastered an aspect of grammar she would not use it in everyday interactions, such as imperatives, and with many others, such as past tense or plural words, she only used the correct words or markers if separately and specifically asked. If someone asked Genie a yes or no question she often repeated part of the question or said \"no\" even if she clearly meant yes and shook her head the correct way, which Curtiss concluded was Genie simply repeating the last word of the sentence. By contrast, she frequently understood and responded to highly complex questions that she could not on tests, especially sentences requiring some degree of inference and sentences performing both a locutionary and illocutionary act. Her comprehension of other complex sentences remained inconsistent, although beginning in November 1973 researchers recorded slow but noticeable improvement.\n\nThe scientists also measured Genie's conversational competence. Most verbal interactions with her consisted either of someone asking her a question several times until she responded or her saying something to which the other person responded, and unless she actively attempted to control a conversation's direction she relied on the other person to achieve and maintain its flow. She typically did not acknowledge statements, requests, or other common pieces of conversation, and when she did respond it was often with a significant delay. Curtiss wrote that Genie grew progressively better at both, although even by mid-1975 she did not always respond or took an unusually long time to do so. If she did respond she often repeated something said earlier, and she used repetitive statements to serve several conversational functions.\n\nIn everyday interactions Genie became steadily more willing and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her. She was generally more willing to start or enter conversations on topics which interested her, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters. When she wanted to talk about a particular subject she would sometimes allow the topic to change, but often persisted by repeating herself even after someone made multiple efforts to discuss something else. Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would try to say something relevant. If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word \"tenant\", and in an effort to contribute Genie said the word \"ten\" and held up ten fingers.\n\nAs Genie learned more language she gradually included more grammatical complexity in her speech during everyday interactions, and began to apply her language to more everyday situations. In late 1973 she startled linguists when she gave a monologue consisting of a series of short utterances to a small group of familiar adults, which was much longer than any of her previously recorded speech; while she only used grammar she had fully mastered she seemed to be using different words to try to express herself, which Curtiss thought was a sort of free association, making it the closest she came to attempting any language experimentation. Genie subsequently spoke at this length on a few more occasions, always in the same manner and on similar topics. She also began to use language to describe fictional events, describing some of fantasies in language as early as January 1973 and attempting on at least two occasions in 1974 and 1975 to lie.\n\nTo supplement Genie's language acquisition, once Genie started to combine words the scientists worked to teach Genie ritual speech for common everyday situations. Soon after beginning to produce two-word utterances Genie learned the phrases \"Give me [example]\", \"Help me [example]\", and \"I want [example]\", and later learned \"May I have [example]?\". Analyses of Genie's utterances beginning with \"I want\" concluded that Genie treated the phrase as one word, and noted that the dependent clauses in these utterances could all have been separate utterances and never had markers indicating dependence. Linguists also noted that the phrase \"Help me\" always preceded a verb, whereas \"Give me\", \"May I have\", and \"I want\" always preceded nouns. In addition, since she could only use the word \"may\" as a part of the phrase \"May I have\" to ask a question and never produced a statement or asked about someone else with it, Curtiss did not consider these utterances true use of an auxiliary structure.\n\nBy contrast, Genie never used any automatic speech or interjections during conversations. Despite repeated efforts to teach her she could not start an interaction with automatic speech, and she only responded to ritual questions, such as \"How are you?\", if someone repeatedly asked her and pushed her into doing so; she then could say \"How are you?\" or \"I am fine\", but it would be very forced. The only exception was when the person speaking to her had some additional affect, after which she usually laughed or tried to get the person to do it again. In addition, Genie never learned any profanity nor ever used other substitute swear words. These aspects of speech are typically either bilateral or originate in the right hemisphere, and split-brain and hemispherectomy patients normally learn them without difficulty, but linguists were unsurprised that Genie never used them. Curtiss wrote that Genie's failure to do so was because her childhood gave her no opportunity to observe conversation, where children typically learn them.\n\nDespite Genie's increased willingness and ability to engage in conversation she continued to speak far less than most people in equivalent phases of language acquisition, and her conversational competence remained very low. In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that in many aspects Genie's overall demeanor continued to bear a strong resemblance to that of a person who had not been socialized. The scientists found Genie's inability to master conversational skills was unsurprising and suggested that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill from simply knowing language, consistent with earlier observations of retarded and autistic children. They therefore attributed Genie's difficulty with conversation to her lack of socialization during childhood instead of her language constraints.\n\nDuring a Children's Hospital visit near Christmas 1971 a boy playing with a toy pistol frightened Genie, and when Curtiss tried to reassure her Genie said an abbreviated version of Curtiss' words, \"Little bad boy. Bad gun.\" About two weeks later Curtiss heard Genie speaking to herself and using an invented gesture for the word \"naughty\", and when Curtiss asked Genie what she said she repeated, \"Little bad boy. Bad gun.\" out loud for several minutes, marking the first time she spoke about something in the past. Several months later David and Marilyn overheard her saying, \"Father hit big stick. Father is angry.\" to herself, marking the first time anyone heard her talk about her life before starting to acquire language. She infrequently spoke to others about her early life, but the Riglers said that for the rest of the time she lived with them she constantly repeated \"Father hit\" to herself. By the end of her stay, she could also talk about something someone else had told her.\n\nSome of Genie's pronunciation rules and limitations were characteristic of typical General American English speakers, and her progress with learning to pronounce individual phonemes followed relatively normal patterns for a first-language learner, but many others were highly atypical. Her speech typically contained unusually extensive deletions and substitutions, including vowel reduction, neutralization, and consonant modifications, and she typically spoke in an extremely high-pitched and monotonic voice. Curtiss determined that, despite the unpredictability with which Genie applied many of her pronunciation rules, there were several clearly defined patterns in her speech. Some of Genie's pronunciation rules and phonological limitations were normal for General American English speakers, and she clearly limited the variability of her substitutions. Similar to young children, Genie's enunciation remained far better in imitation than in her own utterances. The scientists worked very hard to strengthen Genie's voice and improve her articulation, but in her dissertation Curtiss wrote that Genie's speech was still extremely difficult to represent using standard IPA.\n\nFrom the outset scientists could tell that Genie's vowel substitutions were clearly not random, but she did not seem to draw distinctions based on normal classification such as front versus back or open versus close vowels. In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that Genie still laxed and centralized the pronunciation of vowels and off-glides. When she began using longer words and sentences she often deleted unstressed syllables, for instance pronouncing the word \"refrigerator\" as . As with vowels she would often delete or substitute consonants, although with considerably less variability than with vowels, and for several she had different pronunciation rules based on the position of the phoneme in the word.\n\nThere were three consonants, the voiced dental fricative, voiced palato-alveolar affricate, and voiceless palato-alveolar affricate, which Genie did not spontaneously pronounce until 1973 and only inconsistently pronounced after that time. Until 1973, instead of pronouncing alveolar lateral approximants and retroflex approximants as separate sounds she articulated both in a manner that Curtiss described as a sound somewhere in between. Genie would also typically, although not always, simplify or delete consonant clusters. The one regular exception was that a rhotic approximant almost always remained intact because Genie seemed to interpret it as a part of the preceding vowel.\n\nIn addition, there were several sounds that Genie did not use as initial or final consonants. In particular, before 1973 Genie frequently, but not always, deleted final consonants without any discernible pattern. Researchers suspected this was the reason Genie did not usually use plural forms, possessive markers, and past tense or third person singular conjugations. If someone imitated her deletion of a final consonant she would laugh, reply, \"Silly\", gesture, and then repeat her utterance with both the final consonant and any other sounds she had initially deleted, causing Curtiss to speculate that Genie simply was not paying attention to how her speech sounded.\n\nIn November 1971, Genie displayed an ability to change pitch and volume while singing that she had never demonstrated in her speech. Around a week after the first time she sang, while on a trip to the hospital, Curtiss improvised a song to calm Genie down and Genie again surprised her by singing along; Curtiss especially noticed that Genie sang the word \"hospital\" far louder than she had ever spoken. Almost a year after moving in with the Riglers, while David Rigler was examining and cleaning her ear, Genie uttered the only recorded scream of her lifetime. The scientists did not know why she had screamed on that particular occasion, or why they never heard her do so again.\n\nCurtiss and Fromkin wrote that by 1973 Genie seemed to be slowly improving her articulation and that she had clearly strengthened and gained more control over her voice, and by at least the middle of that year she could distinguish and articulate all the sounds of General American. During that year she started to use pitch variation in addition to vowel duration to indicate stress, with the latter remaining the primary method for doing so but becoming much less obtrusive and exaggerated, but she still did not vary pitch or volume to indicate either questions or imperative sentences. While her voice remained largely monotonic she began including more speech patterns and intonation, sometimes in spontaneous speech but more consistently in imitation. Despite this she still did not use either voiced or voiceless dental fricatives in spontaneous speech, though she had imitated them since June 1972, and inconsistently used affricates in spontaneous speech.\n\nIn 1973, Genie began optionally articulating consonant clusters consisting of an followed by a nasal consonant. For words starting with an followed by other types of consonant clusters Genie started to break up the cluster with an epenthetic schwa and soon after, in longer words where she would have previously deleted a vowel, she began to include a schwa where the deleted sound would have been; because reduced vowels in English are generally schwas, linguists thought she could have been gaining command of English phonology. Around the same time, linguists noted that she began to pronounce more final consonants. By 1975 Genie started to pronounce both voiced and voiceless dental fricatives, albeit rarely, in various word positions, and when she did she frequently stopped them.\n\nIn 1975 the scientists said that Genie's voice had clearly strengthened and she modified both pitch and volume for emphasis and stress, but she continued to avoid speaking if possible because controlling her voice remained very difficult for her. Her vocalizations were still soft and breathy, and they wrote that, \"it is still very difficult to understand her if you have not been with her for a period of time.\" In mid-1975 she could speak with a relatively normal declarative sentence stress pattern, and began to do so with increasing frequency. Even then her pronunciation also remained abnormal, as she still frequently deleted and substituted sounds in her speech, and she remained unable to use intonation to indicate a question.\n\nWhen Genie started forming longer sentences, she often produced extreme haplologies. She frequently omitted morphological elements which, though necessary to make the utterance grammatical, were clear to present observers, causing speculation that Genie had a grammar rule first mandating and then optionally permitting her to remove grammatical elements which were non-essential in context. At other times Genie condensed and deleted sounds, syllables, or entire words in ways which rendered her speech ambiguous, and for no discernible reason sometimes said the same sentence with and without any omissions. This significantly complicated attempts to determine Genie's true linguistic abilities, and researchers speculated this may have led to her comprehension scores being significantly lower on certain language analysis tests. In May 1972, by which time Genie regularly spoke in three or four-word utterances, she attempted to truncate several of her sentences to monosyllables, such as pronouncing the sentence \"Monday Curtiss come\" as . Marilyn and Curtiss told Genie they could not talk to her if she spoke in such a manner, and she then stopped attempting such extreme haplologies but continued to condense sounds when possible.\n\nGenie gradually began to outwardly exhibit more of her emotions, and for reasons the scientists never managed to discern she maintained her unexplained ability to communicate her desires to complete strangers without words. Even while speaking she continued to use supplementary nonverbal gestures to improve her intelligibility. Prior to mid-1974 she invented gestures to indicate specific phonemes and homonyms regardless of semantic context, unlike previous observations of invented signing systems in which individual gestures exclusively communicated semantic meaning. Sometimes she used one gesture for two similar-sounding but not completely homophonic words, such as her use of the same gesture for both the words \"disappear\" and \"disappointed\".\n\nIn addition to signing Genie would pantomime some words as she spoke, for instance crouching into a seated position when saying the words \"sit\" or \"sick\", and act out sequences of events. Unlike young children, for who this is ancillary to their speech and lessens as they acquire more language, Genie maintained this as an integral part of her vocabulary. At first Genie only drew pictures if specifically asked, but later began to draw pictures or use images from magazines or books to relate to daily experiences or if she could not express herself in words. Until 1973 Curtiss and Fromkin unsuccessfully tried to teach Genie to read and write, although other people made subsequent attempts; by the time Curtiss presented her dissertation Genie had learned to read approximately five to ten unspecified names and words, and could write individual letters in print.\n\nTo take advantage of Genie's nonverbal abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to receive sign language instruction; Curtiss described the type of sign language as being, \"a system of signing somewhere between American Sign Language and signed English in its grammatical system.\" Curtiss wrote that Genie would often simultaneously speak and sign, and continued to use and invent her own gestures, but while she continued to use her existing gestures for individual phonemes she started creating new ones to convey a semantic meaning. The scientists did not specifically test Genie's sign language, but Curtiss recorded that by February 1975 Genie could use the sign to indicate a plural and that by the spring of 1975 used the past tense sign. In addition, when told to start a sentence in sign language with the word \"he\" Genie produced \"The boy signing is he cookie\".\n\nIn June 1975, despite Genie's progress the National Institute of Mental Health cut off their funding for the case study on Genie. Shortly afterwards, in the early summer of 1975, Genie moved out of the Riglers' home to live with her mother. Despite the NIMH grant ending Curtiss continued to regularly meet with her, both administering weekly tests and spending time with her outside of test sessions, and the Riglers maintained contact with Genie and her mother. While living with her mother, Genie continued to be largely unresponsive to statements or requests. After a few months, Genie's mother had Genie transferred to the first of what would become a succession of foster homes.\n\nSoon after moving into this location the people running it began subjecting Genie to extreme physical and psychological abuse, causing her language skills to rapidly regress and making her return to her coping mechanism of silence. The incident with the largest impact occurred when they severely beat her for vomiting and told her that if she did it again she would never see her mother, which rapidly accelerated her regression and made her extremely scared of opening her mouth for anything, including speaking, out of fear of vomiting and facing more punishment. As she still wanted to communicate with people she knew, she began almost exclusively using the sign language she learned while living with the Riglers. During this time Curtiss was the only person who had worked with Genie to have any regular contact with her, meeting once a week to continue testing, and she wrote that Genie's language skills severely deteriorated due to the abuse she endured. Curtiss later recalled that during this time Genie frenetically signed to her on a variety of topics, but said she could not bring herself to open her mouth so she could speak. At one point, she refused to talk for five months.\n\nUpon Genie's removal from this location in April 1977 she required a two-week stay at Children's Hospital, where she was able to see her mother and the Riglers. While she was there her condition somewhat improved, but she continued mostly using sign language to communicate. That month, Curtiss and Fromkin obtained a year-long grant from the National Science Foundation to continue working with Genie. Authorities then moved to another foster home for several months, an arrangement in which Genie reportedly did fairly well but which unexpectedly ended in late 1977, and after giving her temporary accommodations through the end of December of that year authorities moved her into a different location. In early January 1978 Curtiss wrote a letter in which she stated these moves were all very hard on Genie, causing continued regression in all aspects of her life, and that their frequency heightened their traumatic impact.\n\nIn 1976 Curtiss finished and presented her dissertation, \"Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day \"Wild Child\"\", which analyzed Genie's language until the early summer of 1975. It received reviews from several prominent scientists, and the following year Academic Press published it. Curtiss continued working with Genie through the end of 1977, but after meeting with her on January 3, 1978, Genie's mother suddenly prevented linguists from seeing Genie, entirely ending all testing and evaluations. Curtiss published Genie's utterances from mid-1975 to the end of 1977, and analysis of them, in papers she wrote and co-wrote in 1979. After this, Curtiss continued to analyze Genie's language in later papers.\n\nBetween early 1978 and mid-1993 Genie moved through several more institutions and foster homes, some of which subjected her to severe levels of abuse and harassment. Shurley saw Genie at least twice during this time, at her 27th birthday party in 1984 and again two years later, and later recalled that during both visits she was almost completely silent and made very little outward expression or eye contact. In 1992 Curtiss said that since 1978 she had only heard two updates on Genie's condition, both indicating she almost never spoke, and in a 1993 book on Genie author Russ Rymer wrote that as of 1992 she very rarely spoke. In a 1994 afterword to his book Rymer wrote that in early 1993 Genie's mother told him Genie was significantly more verbal, albeit hard to understand. The Riglers reestablished contact with Genie and her mother in mid-1993, and shortly afterwards David Rigler wrote that when he and Marilyn first visited Genie she immediately recognized and greeted both of them by name.\n\nThe latest available information on Genie's speech came in May 2008. That year ABC News reported that, in 2000, someone speaking to them under condition of anonymity had hired a private investigator who located Genie. According to the investigator, she only spoke a few words but could still communicate fairly well in sign language. In 2002 Curtiss said that she would be interested in measuring Genie's linguistic abilities again, but in July 2016 she said she had not conducted a new evaluation of Genie's language since January 1978.\n\nGenie's is one of the best-known cases of language acquisition in a child with delayed linguistic development. Curtiss argued that Genie's case supported Chomsky's hypothesis of innate language, but that Genie demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start. Because Genie had learned vocabulary and clearly mastered some principles of grammar Curtiss contended that she definitively disproved more extreme conceptualizations of the critical period hypothesis, which predicted that no or almost no language acquisition of any kind could occur after the end of critical period. Instead, she argued that Genie provided evidence for a gradual variation of it; that although some degree of acquisition can occur beyond puberty, permitting some form of ability to communicate using language, it would never progress into normal-sounding speech.\n\nFurthermore, Curtiss argued that Genie proved only linguistic stimulation could cause the lateralization of language functions, pointing out that Genie's language center had not developed in her left hemisphere despite experiencing enough environmental stimulation to commence lateralization of other brain functions. Without this stimulation, a person would be rendered incapable of processing language from the left hemisphere of the brain and would be forced to only use the right hemisphere. The contrast between Genie's vocabulary and grammar acquisition also supported the existing hypothesis that these two processes underwent separate development during language acquisition. Genie's inability to master language despite clear progress in her cognitive development in other areas also suggested that language acquisition and cognition were separate, a new concept at the time.\n\nGenie's inability to engage in normal interactions with other people provided additional evidence that understanding the principles of language was a separate skill from the ability to engage in conversations. In addition, her rapid progress with nonverbal communication and her exceptional proficiency at it demonstrated that even nonverbal communication was fundamentally separate from language. Her arguments have become widely accepted in the field of linguistics and other linguists and cognitive psychologists, including Steven Pinker and James Hurford, have cited Genie's case study as evidence for Chomsky's hypothesis of innate language and for a steadily progressing version of the critical period for language acquisition. Curtiss' findings were also the impetus for several additional studies on both delayed and abnormal language acquisition.\n\nAnalysis of the aspects of grammar that Genie did and did not acquire aided linguists in determining which structures were more dependent on exposure to language. In particular, the auxiliary component of language had been known to be one of the few children acquire at different rates depending on the amount of speech they heard. Genie's inability to master it supported the idea that its development and that of other similar systems of grammar is more sensitive than vocabulary or more basic grammar, such as word order or recursion, requiring a more conducive language environment to properly develop and having a more specific critical period. Linguists also noted the grammatical skills Genie acquired and used bore striking resemblance to the grammar of pidgin languages and the gesture systems deaf children invent when isolated from other deaf people, which contain certain aspects of language, such as vocabulary, recursion, and word order, but always lack other components such as auxiliary structures.\n\nGenie's language acquisition also refined existing hypotheses and gave rise to additional hypotheses about what parts of language the right hemisphere could acquire after the critical period. Throughout the course of her linguistic development her language had remained largely congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. By contrast, in both previous and subsequent studies, people with the same conditions who began acquiring language in their right hemispheres prior to the end of the critical period had developed normal vocabulary and grammar. This further convinced the scientists that Genie's language acquisition was abnormal because she had started after the critical period, and therefore was processing language in the right hemisphere of her brain.\n\nGenie's case has also been used in theorizing about whether the critical period hypothesis can be applied to the acquisition of a second language, a topic which remains the subject of considerable debate.\n\nSeveral people who have analyzed Genie's linguistic development have compared it to historical accounts of children withd delayed language acquisition, including records of language deprivation experiments of Psamtik I, King James IV of Scotland, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Linguists have especially noted the similarities between Genie's case study and the testing of Victor of Aveyron. The scientists acknowledged the impact these cases had on their research and testing methods, and linguists and historians have cited Genie's case as the impetus for reanalysis of the case study on Victor. Both the research team and outside analyses especially contrasted Genie and a case in the 1950s of a girl known by the name Isabella, who had been isolated from all speech until the age of 6 but within a year of receiving therapy spoke using vocabulary and grammar typical of someone her age. Author Justin Leiber compared Genie to Helen Keller, particularly noting the differences between the language instruction each received.\n\nSome of the scientists who worked with Genie, including Jay Shurley, concluded based on non-linguistic evidence that she had been mentally retarded from birth and that this rendered it impossible to be completely certain about the utility of studying her language acquisition. During his sleep studies Shurley had uncovered, among a few other persistent abnormalities in her sleep, a highly elevated number of sleep spindles, which are characteristic of people born with severe retardation. However, the linguists who studied Genie firmly believed that she possessed at least average intelligence at birth and argued that the abuse and isolation she suffered during her childhood had left her functionally retarded. Curtiss specifically noted that some of Genie's linguistic capabilities, such as her clear ability to distinguish gender in her speech, were very uncharacteristic of someone born mentally retarded. Other linguists analyzing Genie's case, including Steven Pinker, have concurred with Curtiss' position.\n\nThe scientists acknowledged that Genie's extreme emotional difficulties may have contributed to delaying her acquisition and willingness to use a few specific pieces of grammar, and at the beginning may have partially explained her very tacit demeanor. Nonetheless, in Curtiss and Fromkin repeatedly maintained that her emotional profile could not have impeded her ability to acquire language; they pointed out that she had clearly progressed in other aspects of her psychological development and was generally happy during their testing, and argued it was extremely implausible that emotional difficulties could interfere with her grammar acquisition without affecting her vocabulary. Several linguists, including Pinker and Derek Bickerton, accepted Curtiss and Fromkin's assessment while a few, including Stephen Laurence, questioned it but considered her case highly valuable. Other linguists, including Geoffrey Sampson, argued that the severity of her emotional difficulties made this extremely implausible and therefore negated much of the scientific significance ascribed to her case.\n\nEarly accounts of Genie expressed varying degrees of optimism about her language acquisition, and in her dissertation Curtiss argued that, while Genie's speech was still considerably different from that of most people, her, \"language performance often does not reflect her underlying linguistic ability\". An independent 2006 review of Genie's case concluded that Curtiss' dissertation displayed an unwarranted degree of positivity about Genie's progress and prognosis, pointing out that by the time of its completion Genie's language had clearly regressed from her treatment in foster care. Curtiss' accounts of Genie after her dissertation all acknowledged that Genie's vocabulary had steadily broadened, and argued that she clearly learned some basic grammar, but all had more negative evaluations of Genie's speech. In these writings, Curtiss concluded that she had never learned any meaningful amount of grammar. In later interviews Curtiss said that Genie could communicate messages using language but did not speak in real sentences, and Russ Rymer wrote that, based on conversations with her and documents she shared with him, she seemed to view the summer of 1972 as the point at which Genie's linguistic abilities plateaued.\n\nOutside analysis from Peter Jones, a linguistics professor at Sheffield Hallam University, argued that Curtiss' earlier accounts of Genie's speech, up to and including her dissertation, were more accurate than those from after 1977. He argued that in these later analyses Curtiss did not provide sufficient evidence for many of her later conclusions, saying that she neither examined the utterances she cited in significant detail nor presented them in a manner conducive to doing so, and in a few instances asserted that Curtiss' data outright contradicted her conclusions. Jones wrote that, despite the tone of Curtiss' later works and interviews, he found nothing either suggesting reevaluation of her earlier arguments or disavowal of any of her earlier conclusions. In addition, he wrote that Curtiss did not release enough information about Genie's speech from after mid-1975 to determine exactly what, if any, grammatical abilities she had lost, and that the complete lack of data from any time after early January 1978 rendered it impossible to determine the extent to which her language had regressed.\n\nAlthough Jones said that the relatively small number of utterances Genie produced made it impossible to draw definite conclusions, in a 1995 paper he concluded the discrepancies he noted demonstrated that, \"the post-(1977) account [of Genie's speech] is not so much based on reanalysis or reinterpretation of the data but on a \"highly selective and misleading misrepresentation of the earlier findings.\"\"[emphasis as in the original] This, in turn, left an unresolved tension between Curtiss' pre- and post-1977 analyses of Genie's language which he said meant that until Curtiss published a clarification of her works, \"a definitive judgment on the character and extent of Genie's linguistic development still cannot be given.\" In 2014 Jones maintained these arguments, noting that no additional outside analysis of Genie's utterances and Curtiss' papers had occurred since his paper. Others discussing Genie's case have cited Jones' arguments, and similarly questioned Curtiss' later analyses of Genie's grammar acquisition. To this point, neither Curtiss nor anyone else directly associated with Genie's case has responded to Jones' arguments.\n\n"}
{"id": "14755584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14755584", "title": "Locality (linguistics)", "text": "Locality (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, locality refers to the proximity of elements in a linguistic structure. Constraints on locality limit the span over which rules can apply to a particular structure. Theories of transformational grammar use syntactic locality constraints to explain restrictions on argument selection, syntactic binding, and syntactic movement. \n\nLocality is observed in a number of linguistic contexts, and most notably with:\n\n\nThe projection principle requires that lexical properties — in particular argument structure properties such as thematic roles — be \"projected\" onto syntactic structures. Together with Locality of Selection, which forces lexical properties to be projected within a local projection (as defined by X-bar theory), the projection principle constrains syntactic trees. Syntactic trees are represented through constituents of a sentence, which are represented in a hierarchical fashion in order to satisfy locality of selection through the restraints of X-bar theory.\nFrom the perspective of projection, an element can be \"stretched\" to occupy the following projection levels:\n\nminimal (X)\n\nintermediate (X')\n\nmaximal (x max)\n\nThese occupying elements appear valid for all syntactically relevant lexical and functional categories.\n\nAccording to locality of selection, the material introduced in the syntactic tree must have a local relationship with the head that introduces it. This means that each argument must be introduced into the same projection as its head. Therefore, each complement and specifier will appear within the local projection of the head that selects it.\n\nFor example, the contrast between the well-formed (1a) and the ill-formed (1b) shows that in English, an adverb cannot intervene between a head (the verb \"study\") and its complement (the DP \"the report\").\nIn structural accounts of the contrast between (1a) and (1b), the two sentences differ relative to their underlying structure. The starting point is the lexical entry for the verb \"study\", which specifies that the verb introduces two arguments, namely a DP which bears the semantic role of Agent, and another DP which bears the semantic role of Theme.\n\nIn the tree for sentence (1a), the verb is the Head of the VP projection, the DP is projected onto the Complement position (as sister to the head V), and the DP is projected onto the Specifier (as sister to V'). In this way, (1a) satisfies Locality of Selection as both arguments are projected within the projection of the head that introduces them. In addition, the AdvP \"carefully\" attaches as an unselected adjunct to VP; structurally this means that it is outside of the local projection of V as it is sister to and dominated by VP. In contrast, in the tree for sentence (1b), the introduction of the AdvP \"carefully\" as sister to the verb \"study\" violates Locality of Selection; this is because the lexical entry of the verb \"study\" does not select an AdvP, so the latter cannot be introduced in the local projection of the verb.\n\nLocality can also be broken down into a morphological perspective, by analyzing words with some, or many affixes. A speaker who can make sense of a word with many morphemes (e.g. affixes) must know: how the morpheme is pronounced and what kind of morpheme it is, (free, prefix, suffix). If it is an affix, then the speaker also must know what the affix c-selects. The speaker must also know that the c-selected element must be adjacent to the affix, amounting to the requirement that branches of a tree never cross. Crossing branches is not included in the lexicon, and it is a general property of how linguistic structures are grammatically structured. This is true because lexical entries do no impose a requirement on a part of word structure that it is not sister to. This relates to the fact that affixes cannot c-select for an element which is not a sister. Additionally, the speaker must know what kinds of thing results after c-selection. These key aspects that a speaker must know can be observed in the lexical entries below, with the example \"denationalization\".\nBinding Theory refers to 3 different theoretic principles that regulate DPs. Principle A states that anaphors must be bound in their local domain, Principle B states that pronouns must be free in their local domain, and Principle C states that R-expressions cannot be bound. The local domain refers to the smallest XP with a subject. \n\nPrinciple A for locality in Binding Theory refers to when binding of an anaphor and its antecedent must occur within the local domain. Therefore, the antecedent should be in the same clause that contains the anaphor. A clause is the domain if and only if it is the smallest XP containing a DP that c-commands the anaphor and has a subject. An anaphor is considered to be free when it is not c-commanded or coindexed.\n\nThe following examples show the application of Binding Theory, Principle A:\n\nExample (2a) is predicted to be grammatical by Principle A of binding theory. The anaphor and antecedent appear within the same TP domain: TP is the smallest XP that contains the anaphor and DP subject (in this case, the subject is the antecedent). However, in example (2b), the anaphor and antecedent are not bound within the same domain, therefore, the sentence is predicted to be ungrammatical.\n\nExample (3) is similar to example (2). (3a) is grammatical because the anaphor is bound within the same domain as the antecedent. However, example (3b) is ungrammatical because the anaphor and antecedent appear within different domains. The anaphor is not bound.\nThe following examples show the application of Binding Theory, Principle B:\n\nWhen the [ Lucy], is co-indexed with and c-commanded with [ her], as in (4a), this violates principle B. , meaning they are locally related but are referring to the same entity. Since [ her] has a c-commanding antecedent in its domain (i.e. [ Lucy]) this shows that the pronoun is bound in its domain. \n\nPrinciple B is obeyed in (4b), because the co-indexation of [ Lucy] and [ her], are free in their domains, meaning that although they are referring to the same entity they are not locally related. \n\nPrinciple B does not state anything regarding whether a pronoun requires an antecedent. It is permissible for a pronoun to not have an antecedent in a sentence. Principle B simply states that if a pronoun does have a c-commanding antecedent, then it must be outside of the smallest XP with a subject that has the pronoun, i.e. outside the domain of the pronoun.\n\nThe following examples show the application of Binding Theory, Principle C:\n\nIt is important to note that 5a, can be distinguished from 5b and 5c the differences in structural relations between the pronoun and the name. In 5a, she c-commands Lucy, but this does not occur in 5b and 5c. These observations can be described by the preliminary observation that non-pronominals cannot be bound, i.e., non-pronominals cannot be c-commanded by a co-indexed pronoun. Compared to Principle A and Principle B, this requires goes all the way up to the root node, since it is not limited to any domain. \n\nMovement is the phenomenon that accounts for the possibility of a single syntactic constituent or element occupying multiple, yet distinct locations, depending on the type of sentence the element or constituent is in.\n\nIn wh-movement in English, an interrogative sentence is formed by moving the wh-word (determiner phrase, preposition phrase, or adverb phrase) to the specifier position of the complementizer phrase. This results in the movement of the wh-phrase into the initial position of the clause .The +q feature of the complementizer (+q= question feature) results in an EPP:XP feature: This forces an XP to the specifier position of CP. The +q feature also attracts the bound morpheme in the tense position to move to the head complementizer position; leading to do-support.\n\nThere are seven types of violations that can occur for wh-movement. These constraints predict the environments in which movement generates an ungrammatical sentence: Movement does not occur locally.\n\nThis definition tells us that if the specifier position of CP is occupied or if a C is occupied by a +q word, movement of a wh-phrase out of the CP cannot occur. In other words, a CP that has a wh-phrase in its [spec, CP] that is filled with another wh-phrase that is not the one that was extracted, but from higher in the tree. The wh-phrase movement is being obstructed by another wh-phrase. \nExample (4b) illustrates the wh-island constraint. The embedded clause contains a complementizer with the feature +q. This causes the DP \"who\" to move to the specifier position of that complementizer phrase. Movement of the complement DP \"what\" cannot occur since the specifier position of CP is filled. Therefore, movement of the wh-word, \"what,\" generates an ungrammatical sentence, while movement of the wh-word \"who\" is allowed (specifier position of the embedded CP is not occupied).\n\nExample (5b) demonstrates the adjunct island condition. We can see that the wh-word, \"what\", occurs within the complementizer phrase that appears in the adjunct. Therefore, movement of this DP out of the adjunct will generate an ungrammatical sentence. Example (5a) is grammatical because the trace of the PP \"where\" is not within the adjunct,therefore, movement is allowed. This demonstrates the prohibition of extraction from inside and adjunct and the condition that no element in a CP inside an adjunct may move out of this adjunct. \n\nA setenial subject is not the subject of a sentence, rather a subject that is a clause. Therefore, a clause that is a subject is called a sentenial subject. The Sentenial Subject Constraint is violated when an element moves out of a CP that is in the subject position. \n\nExample (6b) displays the sentential subject condition. The subject of the verb in this sentence is a complementizer clause. The DP \"what\" that appears within the CP subject moves to the specifier position of the main clause. The sentential subject constraint predicts that this wh-movement will result in an ungrammatical sentence since the trace was within the CP subject. Example (6a) is grammatical because the DP \"who\" does not have a trace within the CP subject, therefore, allowing movement to occur.\n\nExample (7a) is grammatical since the DP complement is moving as a whole to the specifier position of the matrix clause; nothing is extracted from the larger DP. Example (7b) is an example of the coordinate structure constraint. The DP \"what\" originally occurs within the DP conjunct, therefore, this constraint predicts that an ungrammatical sentence will result due to the extraction of an element within the conjunct.\n\nExample (8a) is a grammatical because the DP complement of the verb moves as a whole to the specifier position of the main clause. Example (8b) displays the complex noun phrase constraint. The NP complement D, \"whose\", is extracted and moved to the specifier position of the main clause. The complex noun phrase constraint predicts that this wh-movement will result in an ungrammatical sentence since extraction of an element within the complex NP is not allowed.\n\nExample (9a) does not display any wh-movement. Therefore, the sentence is grammatical since nothing is extracted from the subject DP. Example (9b) contains wh-movement of a DP that is within the subject DP. The subject condition tells us that this type of movement is not allowed and the sentence will be ungrammatical.\n\nIn example (10a), there is no wh-movement, therefore the left branch constraint does not apply and this sentence is grammatical. In example (10b), the DP \"whose\" is extracted from the larger DP \"whose cake.\" This extraction under the left branch constraint is not allowed, therefore, the sentence is predicted to be ungrammatical. This sentence can be made grammatical by moving the larger DP as a unit to the specifier position of CP.\n\nIn example (10c), the whole subject DP structure undergoes wh-movement, which results in a grammatical sentence. This suggests that pied-piping can be used to reverse the effects of the violations or extraction constraints.\n\nExample (24) is an example of a wh-island violation. There are two TP bounding nodes that appear between the DP \"what\" and its trace. Therefore, according to the subjacency condition, movement will result in an ungrammatical sentence.\n\n"}
{"id": "578783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=578783", "title": "Mandaic language", "text": "Mandaic language\n\nMandaic is the language of the Mandaean religion and community. Classical Mandaic is used by a section of the Mandaean community in liturgical rites. The modern descendent of Classical Mandaic, known as Neo-Mandaic or Modern Mandaic, is spoken by a small section of the Mandaean community around Ahvaz, Khuzestan Province, Iran. Speakers of Classical Mandaic are found in Iran, Iraq (particularly the southern portions of the country) and in diaspora (particularly in the United States). It is a variety of Aramaic, notable for its use of vowel letters (see Mandaic alphabet) and the striking amount of Persian influence in its lexicon.\n\nClassical Mandaic is a Northwest Semitic language of the Eastern Aramaic sub-family, and is closely related to the language of the Aramaic portions of the Babylonian Talmud, as well as the language of the incantation texts and Aramaic incantation bowls found throughout Mesopotamia. It is also related to Syriac, another member of the Eastern Aramaic sub-family, which is the liturgical language of many Christian denominations throughout the Middle East.\n\nNeo-Mandaic represents the latest stage of the phonological and morphological development of Mandaic, a Northwest Semitic language of the Eastern Aramaic sub-family. Along with the other surviving dialects of Aramaic, it is classified as Neo-Aramaic; these form a constellation of dialects ranging from Lake Van and Lake Urmia in the north to Damascus and Ahvaz in the south, clustered in small groups. Having developed in isolation from one another, most Neo-Aramaic dialects are mutually unintelligible and should therefore be considered separate languages; however, determining the exact relationship between the various Neo-Aramaic dialects is a difficult task, fraught with many problems, which arise from our incomplete knowledge of these dialects and their relation to the Aramaic dialects of antiquity.\n\nAramaic became the lingua franca of the Fertile Crescent largely during the Neo-Assyrians (ca. 934–609 BCE) and the Achaemenids (576–330 BCE) after them, who adopted it as an auxiliary language for both international communication and internal administrative use. It gradually came to supplant the native languages of the region, but due to its wide geographic distribution and political circumstances, it soon evolved into two major sub-families, the Western sub-families comprising Palestinian Talmudic, Christian Palestinian, and Samaritan and the Eastern subfamilies comprising Jewish Babylonian Aramaic (which was in use until the Geonic period), Syriac, and Mandaic.\n\nAlthough no direct descendants of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic survive today, most of the Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken today belong to the Eastern sub-family; these include Central Neo-Aramaic (Ṭuroyo and Mlaḥsô), Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (the largest Neo-Aramaic group, which includes various Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects, and the dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Chaldean Neo-Aramaic), and Neo-Mandaic. The only surviving remnant of the Western subfamily is Western Neo-Aramaic, spoken in the villages of Maʿlūla, Bakhʿa, and Jubb ʿAdīn to the northeast of Damascus. Of all of these dialects, Eastern or Western, only Neo-Mandaic can be described with any certainty as the direct descendent of one of the Aramaic dialects attested in Late Antiquity. For this reason, it is potentially of great value in reconstructing the history of this sub-family and the precise genetic relationship of its members to one another.\n\nIn terms of its grammar, Neo-Mandaic is the most conservative among the Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects, preserving the old Semitic \"suffix\" conjugation (or perfect). The phonology, however, has undergone many innovations, the most notable being the loss of the so-called \"guttural\" consonants.\n\nNeo-Mandaic survives in three subdialects, which arose in the cities of Shushtar, Shah Vali, Masjed Soleyman, and Dezful in northern Khuzestan Province, Iran. The Mandaean communities in these cities fled persecution during the 1880s and settled in the Iranian cities of Ahvaz and Khorramshahr. While Khorramshahr boasted the largest Mandaic-speaking population until the 1980s, the Iran-Iraq War caused many to flee into diaspora, leaving Ahvaz the only remaining Mandaic-speaking community.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19359", "title": "Mandarin Chinese", "text": "Mandarin Chinese\n\nMandarin (; ) is a group of related varieties of Chinese spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of Standard Mandarin or Standard Chinese. Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as the Northern dialects (). Many local Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly a billion).\n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area, stretching from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four tones. The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final glottal stop. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain retroflex initial consonants, which have been lost in southern dialect groups.\n\nThe capital has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a national lingua franca since the 14th century. In the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the national language. Standard Chinese is the official language of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan and one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is used as one of the working languages of the United Nations. It is also one of the most frequently used varieties of Chinese among Chinese diaspora communities internationally.\n\nThe English word \"mandarin\" (from Portuguese \"mandarim\", from Malay \"menteri\", from Sanskrit \"mantrin\", meaning \"minister or counsellor\") originally meant an official of the Ming and Qing empires.\nSince their native varieties were often mutually unintelligible, these officials communicated using a Koiné language based on various northern varieties. When Jesuit missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name \"Guānhuà\" (), or \"language of the officials\".\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to Standard Chinese, which is often called simply \"Chinese\". Standard Chinese is based on the particular Mandarin dialect spoken in Beijing, with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the \"de facto\" official language of the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan), and one of the four official languages of the Republic of Singapore. It also functions as the language of instruction in Mainland China and in Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, under the name \"Chinese\". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as\nbut not as \"Guānhuà\".\n\nLinguists use the term \"Mandarin\" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call \"Guānhuà\". The alternative term \"Běifānghuà\" (), or \"Northern dialects\", is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\nNative speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of \"Mandarin\" (or so-called \"Northern dialects\") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name—for example Sichuan dialect, Hebei dialect or Northeastern dialect, all being regarded as distinct from the standard language.\n\nThe hundreds of modern local varieties of Chinese developed from regional variants of Old Chinese and Middle Chinese. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are Wu, Gan, and Xiang in central China, and Min, Hakka, and Yue on the southeast coast. The \"Language Atlas of China\" (1987) distinguishes three further groups: Jin (split from Mandarin), Huizhou in the Huizhou region of Anhui and Zhejiang, and Pinghua in Guangxi and Yunnan.\n\nAfter the fall of the Northern Song (959–1126) and during the reign of the Jin (1115–1234) and Yuan (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the \"qu\" and \"sanqu\" poetry.\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a rime dictionary called the \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\" (1324). A radical departure from the rime table tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the 'Phags-pa script based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese, and the \"Menggu Ziyun\", a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.\n\nIn Middle Chinese, initial stops and affricates showed a three-way contrast between tenuis, voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were four tones, with the fourth, or \"entering tone\", a checked tone comprising syllables ending in plosives (\"-p\", \"-t\" or \"-k\"). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch, and by the late Tang dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.\n\nThe \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\" shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final \"-m\", which has merged with \"-n\" in modern dialects, and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered \"j-\", \"q-\" and \"x-\" in pinyin).\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun \"tā\" (他), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in Literary Chinese, which was modeled on the classics of the Warring States period and the Han dynasty. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, (\"yì,\" \"wing\") is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 homophones in Standard Chinese.\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for recording materials that were meant to be reproduced in oral presentations, materials such as plays and grist for the professional story-teller's mill. From at least the Yuan dynasty, plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as \"Water Margin\", on down to the Qing dynasty novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" and beyond, there developed a literature in written vernacular Chinese (白话/白話 \"báihuà\"). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties, and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.\n\nHu Shih, a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled \"Báihuà Wénxuéshǐ\" (\"A History of Vernacular Literature\").\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people living in many parts of South China spoke only their local variety. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as \"Guānhuà\". Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the Yongzheng Emperor, unable to understand the accents of officials from Guangdong and Fujian, issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation (, \"Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn\") were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n\nAs the last two of these features indicate, this language was a koiné based on dialects spoken in the Nanjing area, though not identical to any single dialect. This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to Beijing in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard. As late as 1815, Robert Morrison based the first English–Chinese dictionary on this koiné as the standard of the time, though he conceded that the Beijing dialect was gaining in influence. By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.\n\nIn the early years of the Republic of China, intellectuals of the New Culture Movement, such as Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu, successfully campaigned for the replacement of Literary Chinese as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language (). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it \"pǔtōnghuà\" ().\nSome 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984. Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.\n\nThe national language is now used in education, the media and formal occasions in both the PRC and the ROC but not in Hong Kong and Macau. This standard can now be spoken intelligibly by most younger people in Mainland China and Taiwan with various regional accents. In Hong Kong and Macau, because of their colonial and linguistic history, the sole language of education, the media, formal speech and everyday life remains the local Cantonese. Mandarin is now common and taught in many schools but still has yet to gain traction with the local population. In Mandarin-speaking areas such as Sichuan and Chongqing, the local dialect is the native tongue of most of the population. The era of mass education in Standard Chinese has not erased these regional differences, and people may be either diglossic or speak the standard language with a notable accent.\n\nFrom an official point of view, the PRC and ROC governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. Technically, both \"Pǔtōnghuà\" and \"Guóyǔ\" base their phonology on the Beijing accent, though \"Pǔtōnghuà\" also takes some elements from other sources. Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the Beijing dialect. \"Pǔtōnghuà\" and \"Guóyǔ\" also have some differences from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatics.\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although simplified characters are used in China, Singapore and Malaysia, while people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan generally use traditional characters.\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The North China Plain provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people. As a result, there are pronounced regional variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.\n\nMost of northeastern China, except for Liaoning, did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century, and as a result the Northeastern Mandarin dialects spoken there differ little from the Beijing dialect. The Manchu people of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern Xinjiang, where Xibe, a modern dialect, is spoken.\n\nThe frontier areas of Northwest China were colonized by speakers of Mandarin dialects at the same time, and the dialects in those areas similarly closely resemble their relatives in the core Mandarin area. The Southwest was settled early, but the population fell dramatically for obscure reasons in the 13th century, and did not recover until the 17th century. The dialects in this area are now relatively uniform. However, long-established cities even very close to Beijing, such as Tianjin, Baoding, Shenyang, and Dalian, have markedly different dialects.\n\nUnlike their compatriots on the southeast coast, few Mandarin speakers engaged in overseas emigration until the late 20th century, but there are now significant communities of them in cities across the world.\n\nThe classification of Chinese dialects evolved during the 20th century, and many points remain unsettled. Early classifications tended to follow provincial boundaries or major geographical features.\nIn 1936, Wang Li produced the first classification based on phonetic criteria, principally the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials.\nHis Mandarin group included dialects of northern and southwestern China, as well as those of Hunan and northern Jiangxi.\nLi Fang-Kuei's classification of 1937 distinguished the latter two groups as Xiang and Gan, while splitting the remaining Mandarin dialects between Northern, Lower Yangtze and Southwestern Mandarin groups.\nThe widely accepted seven-group classification of Yuan Jiahua in 1960 kept Xiang and Gan separate, with Mandarin divided into Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern and Jiang–Huai (Lower Yangtze) subgroups.\n\nOf Yuan's four Mandarin subgroups, the Northwestern dialects are the most diverse, particularly in the province of Shanxi.\nThe linguist Li Rong proposed that the northwestern dialects of Shanxi and neighbouring areas that retain a final glottal stop in the Middle Chinese entering tone (plosive-final) category should constitute a separate top-level group called Jin. He used this classification in the \"Language Atlas of China\" (1987). Many other linguists continue to include these dialects in the Mandarin group, pointing out that the Lower Yangtze dialects also retain the glottal stop.\n\nThe southern boundary of the Mandarin area, with the central Wu, Gan and Xiang groups, is weakly defined due to centuries of diffusion of northern features. Many border varieties have a mixture of features that make them difficult to classify.\nThe boundary between Southwestern Mandarin and Xiang is particularly weak, and in many early classifications the two were not separated.\nZhou Zhenhe and You Rujie include the New Xiang dialects within Southwestern Mandarin, treating only the more conservative Old Xiang dialects as a separate group.\nThe Huizhou dialects have features of both Mandarin and Wu, and have been assigned to one or other of these groups or treated as separate by various authors.\nLi Rong and the \"Language Atlas of China\" treated it as a separate top-level group, but this remains controversial.\n\nThe \"Language Atlas of China\" calls the remainder of Mandarin a \"supergroup\", divided into eight dialect groups distinguished by their treatment of the Middle Chinese entering tone (see Tones below):\n\nThe \"Atlas\" also includes several unclassified Mandarin dialects spoken in scattered pockets across southeastern China, such as Nanping in Fujian and Dongfang on Hainan,\nAnother Mandarin variety of uncertain classification is apparently Gyami, recorded in the 19th century in the Tibetan foothills, who the Chinese apparently did not recognize as Chinese.\n\nSyllables consist maximally of an initial consonant, a glide, a vowel, a final, and tone. Not every syllable that is possible according to this rule actually exists in Mandarin, as there are rules prohibiting certain phonemes from appearing with others, and in practice there are only a few hundred distinct syllables.\n\nPhonological features that are generally shared by the Mandarin dialects include:\n\nThe maximal inventory of initials of a Mandarin dialect is as follows, with bracketed pinyin spellings given for those present in the standard language:\n\n\nMost Mandarin dialects have three medial glides, , and (spelled \"i\", \"u\" and \"ü\" in pinyin), though their incidence varies.\nThe medial , is lost after apical initials in several areas.\nThus Southwestern Mandarin has \"right\" where the standard language has \"dui\" .\nSouthwestern Mandarin also has in some words where the standard has \"jie qie xie\" . This is a stereotypical feature of southwestern Mandarin, since it is so easily noticeable. E.g. \"hai\" \"shoe\" for standard \"xie\", \"gai\" \"street\" for standard \"jie\".\n\nMandarin dialects typically have relatively few vowels. Syllabic fricatives, as in standard \"zi\" and \"zhi\", are common in Mandarin dialects, though they also occur elsewhere.\nThe Middle Chinese off-glides and are generally preserved in Mandarin dialects, yielding several diphthongs and triphthongs in contrast to the larger sets of monophthongs common in other dialect groups (and some widely scattered Mandarin dialects).\n\nThe Middle Chinese coda was still present in Old Mandarin, but has merged with in the modern dialects.\nIn some areas (especially the southwest) final has also merged with . This is especially prevalent in the rhyme pairs \"-en/-eng\" and \"-in/-ing\" . As a result, \"jīn\" \"gold\" and \"jīng\" \"capital\" merge in those dialects.\n\nThe Middle Chinese final stops have undergone a variety of developments in different Mandarin dialects (see Tones below).\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final glottal stop.\nIn other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.\nAs a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin. For example:\nR-coloring, a characteristic feature of Mandarin, works quite differently in the southwest. Whereas Beijing dialect generally removes only a final or when adding the rhotic final \"-r\" , in the southwest the \"-r\" replaces nearly the entire rhyme.\n\nIn general, no two Mandarin-speaking areas have exactly the same set of tone values, but most Mandarin-speaking areas have very similar tone \"distribution\". For example, the dialects of Jinan, Chengdu, Xi'an and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the Beijing dialect tones of (55), (35), (214), and (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.\n\nMiddle Chinese stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.\nIn Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.\nOf the four tones of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.\nThe following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin \"d\" denotes a non-aspirate , while \"t\" denotes an aspirate ):\n\nIn traditional Chinese phonology, syllables that ended in a stop in Middle Chinese (i.e. /p/, /t/ or /k/) were considered to belong to a special category known as the \"entering tone\".\nThese final stops have disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, with the syllables distributed over the other four modern tones in different ways in the various Mandarin subgroups.\n\nIn the Beijing dialect that underlies the standard language, syllables beginning with original voiceless consonants were redistributed across the four tones in a completely random pattern. For example, the three characters , all \"tsjek\" in Middle Chinese (William H. Baxter's transcription), are now pronounced \"jī\", \"jǐ\" and \"jì\" respectively. Older dictionaries such as \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\" mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. Minjiang) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a glottal stop . (This includes the dialect of Nanjing on which the Postal Romanization was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing \"h\".) This development is shared with Wu Chinese and is thought to represent the pronunciation of Old Mandarin. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four. However, modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no phonemic tone at all.\n\nAlthough the system of tones is common across Mandarin dialects, their realization as tone contours varies widely:\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Dialects in and around the Nantong area typically have many more than 4 tones, due to influence from the neighbouring Wu dialects.\n\nMandarin dialects frequently employ neutral tones in the second syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.\n\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except Shanghainese. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more homophones. New words have been formed by adding affixes such as \"lao-\" (老), \"-zi\" (子), \"-(e)r\" (儿/兒), and \"-tou\" (头/頭), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in \"cōngmáng\" (匆忙), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun reduplication, which is hardly used in Beijing. In Sichuan, one hears \"bāobāo\" (包包) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses \"bāo'r\" (包儿).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as () \"butterfly\".\n\nThe singular pronouns in Mandarin are () \"I\", ( or ) \"you\", () \"you (formal)\", and (, or ) \"he/she/it\", with - () added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun (/), which is inclusive of the listener, and (/), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns. While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., Shanghainese has \"non\" / \"you\" and \"yi\" \"he/she\").\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as () \"alley\". Southern Chinese varieties have borrowed from Tai, Austroasiatic, and Austronesian languages.\n\nThere are also many Chinese words came from foreign languages such as () from golf; () from bikini; () from hamburger.\n\nIn general, the greatest variation occurs in slang, in kinship terms, in names for common crops and domesticated animals, for common verbs and adjectives, and other such everyday terms. The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary—terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\nChinese varieties of all periods have traditionally been considered prime examples of analytic languages, relying on word order and particles instead of inflection or affixes to provide grammatical information such as person, number, tense, mood, or case.\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.\n\nThe basic word order of subject–verb–object is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of ditransitive sentences.\nIn northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:\n\nIn southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate aspect, but the particles used vary.\nMost Mandarin dialects use the particle \"-le\" (了) to indicate the perfective aspect and \"-zhe\" (着/著) for the progressive aspect.\nOther Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese \"zo\" 咗 and \"gan\" 紧/緊 respectively.\nThe experiential aspect particle \"-guo\" (过/過) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.\n\nThe subordinative particle \"de\" (的) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.\nSome southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a classifier fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.\n\nEspecially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final particles alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle \"ma\" (嘛), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by \"yo\" (哟) in southern usage.\n\nSome characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches. In Mandarin the character 師 functions the same thing, it is combined with 教, which means teach, to form the word teacher.\n\nList of Chinese prefix and suffix\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Gelet and the Judeo-Iraqi varieties have retained features of Babylonian Aramaic.\n\nDue to Iraq's inherent multiculturalism as well as history, Iraqi Arabic in turn bears extensive borrowings in its lexicon from Aramaic, Akkadian, Persian, Turkish, the Kurdish languages and Hindustani.\n\nEven in the most formal of conventions, pronunciation depends upon a speaker's background. Nevertheless, the number and phonetic character of most of the consonants has a broad degree of regularity among Arabic-speaking regions.

The emphatic coronals (, , and ) cause assimilation of emphasis to adjacent non-emphatic coronal consonants.

Many of the Kunta moved east to the region north of Timbuktu and became salt merchants. The Kunta adopted the teachings of Muhammad al-Maghili, a noted cleric around 1500 CE who was said to have introduced the Qadiriyya order of Sufis to the region.\n\nAl-Mukhtar's father died when he was ten.\nOther members of his family assisted in his education, as did members of the Kel al-Suq and Kel Hurma families.\nHis main teacher was Shaykh Sidi Ali bin al-Najib of Araouane, a leading Qadiriyya cleric. \nFor a period he was caretaker of the tomb near Oualata of Sidi Ahmad al-Kunti (aka al-Bakka'i Bu Dam'a, ), a Kunta saint who had died in 1515.\nBetween 1754 and 1757 he studied in Morocco. He married a distant cousin on his return.\n\nAl-Mukhtar succeeded Sidi Ali as Shaykh when he died.\nHe made his base at Azawad, about to the northeast of Timbuktu.\nFrom Azawad he mediated in tribal disputes, particularly between the Kunta and the Barabish.\nAl-Mukhtar al-Kunti had outstanding leadership abilities in addition to his scholarship and spiritual qualities. Starting in 1757, already recognized as the leader of the Kunta and soon by all the other Qadiri shaykhs, he became increasingly involved in resolving disputes among the Tuareg people of the region.\n\nEventually al-Mukhtar came to be the recognized spiritual leader in a large region around the bend of the Niger River.\nIn this area the Iwellemmedan Tuaregs were the dominant warriors and the Kunta dominated trade as well as providing religious leadership. \nHe gave spiritual advice to the Ullimiden tribal chief Kawa Ag Amma.\nHe died at the age of 82 in 1226 AH (1811 CE) and was succeeded by his son Muhammad and then his grandson Ahmad al-Bakkay.\n\nAl-Mukhtar al-Kunti was a prolific author, said to have written three hundred treatises on aspects of Islam and its practices. \nHe saw himself as a mujaddid, and thought that he was inspired by the Prophet, who had appeared to him and said \"you are the true messenger to renovate my Way.\" In his writings he is strongly opposed to such things as charms and amulets, and to the growing numbers of \"mallams\" primarily interested in money.\nAl-Mukhtar al-Kunti strongly believed that a shaykh should lead by example, following a pure asceticism informed by Islamic truth.\nHe corresponded widely with other scholars in the arid and semi-arid lands that extend from Bornu in the east to the Atlantic coast.\n\nAl-Mukhtar's huge moral influence and support for the Qadiriyya \"tariqa\" meant that Islam expanded its role in the region beyond that of the private religion of merchants and scholars. The \"tariqa\" members were required to spread the message among the pagans of one God to whom all men were subordinate. Mukhtar al-Kunti trained clerics so they could establish Islamic schools in the pagan countries, and these schools could in turn spread the word further.\nIn response to a question on the status of the Fulbe people, Sidi al-Mukhtar explicitly refused to acknowledge any difference between blacks and whites.\n\nAl-Mukhtar's pupil Shaykh Sīdyā al-Kabīr was an influential Qadiriyya cleric in Mauritania.\nIn Ségou his pupil Bakari was assassinated because he was unwilling to compromise with paganism.\nAl-Mukhtar taught both Shaykh Usman dan Fodio and Shaykh Amadu Lobbo of Masina.\nUsman dan Fodio looked up to al-Mukhtar as a teacher, and al-Mukhtar reportedly threw his support behind Shaykh Usman in the campaign in which he founded the Sokoto Caliphate in 1809, saying \"Usman ibn Fudi is one of the accomplished saints; his \"djihad\" is just.\"\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

{"id": "2785010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2785010", "title": "Old English grammar", "text": "Old English grammar\n\nThe grammar of Old English is quite different from that of Modern English, predominantly by being much more inflected. As an old Germanic language, Old English has a morphological system that is similar to that of the hypothetical Proto-Germanic reconstruction, retaining many of the inflections thought to have been common in Proto-Indo-European and also including characteristically Germanic constructions such as the umlaut.\n\nAmong living languages, Old English morphology most closely resembles that of modern Icelandic, which is among the most conservative of the Germanic languages; to a lesser extent, the Old English inflectional system is similar to that of modern German.\n\nNouns, pronouns, adjectives and determiners were fully inflected with five grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), two grammatical numbers (singular and plural) and three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). First- and second-person personal pronouns also had dual forms for referring to groups of two people, in addition to the usual singular and plural forms.\nThe instrumental case was somewhat rare and occurred only in the masculine and neuter singular. It was often replaced by the dative. Adjectives, pronouns and (sometimes) participles agreed with their antecedent nouns in case, number and gender. Finite verbs agreed with their subject in person and number.\n\nNouns came in numerous declensions (with many parallels in Latin, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit). Verbs came in nine main conjugations (seven \"strong\" and two \"weak\"), all with numerous subtypes, as well as a few additional smaller conjugations and a handful of irregular verbs. The main difference from other ancient Indo-European languages, such as Latin, is that verbs could be conjugated in only two tenses (vs. the six \"tenses,\" really tense/aspect combinations, of Latin), and they have no synthetic passive voice although it still existed in Gothic.\n\nThe grammatical gender of a given noun does not necessarily correspond to its natural gender, even for nouns referring to people. For example, \"sēo sunne\" (the Sun) was feminine, \"se mōna\" (the Moon) was masculine, and \"þæt ƿīf\" \"the woman/wife\" was neuter. (Compare modern German \"die Sonne\", \"der Mond\", \"das Weib\".) Pronominal usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender, when it conflicted.\n\nVerbs in Old English are divided into strong and weak verbs. Strong verbs indicate tense by a change in the quality of a vowel, while weak verbs indicate tense by the addition of an ending.\n\nStrong verbs use the Germanic form of conjugation known as \"ablaut\". In this form of conjugation, the stem of the word changes to indicate the tense. Verbs like this persist in modern English; for example \"sing, sang, sung\" is a strong verb, as are \"swim, swam, swum\" and \"choose, chose, chosen\". The root portion of the word changes rather than its ending. In Old English, there were seven major classes of strong verb; each class has its own pattern of stem changes. Learning these is often a challenge for students of the language, though English speakers may see connections between the old verb classes and their modern forms.\n\nThe classes had the following distinguishing features to their infinitive stems:\n\nThe first preterite stem is used in the preterite, for the first- and third-person singular. The second preterite stem is used for second-person singular, and all persons in the plural (as well as the preterite subjunctive). Strong verbs also exhibit i-mutation of the stem in the second- and third-person singular in the present tense.\n\nThe third class went through so many sound changes that it was barely recognisable as a single class. The first was a process called 'breaking'. Before , and + another consonant, turned into , and to . Also, before + another consonant, the same happened to , but remained unchanged (except before combination ).\n\nThe second sound change to affect it was the influence of palatal sounds , , and . These turned preceding and to and , respectively.\n\nThe third sound change turned to , to , and to before nasals.\n\nAltogether, this split the third class into five sub-classes:\n\nRegular strong verbs were all conjugated roughly the same, with the main differences being in the stem vowel. Thus \"stelan\" \"to steal\" represents the strong verb conjugation paradigm.\n\nWeak verbs are formed by adding alveolar (\"t\" or \"d\") endings to the stem for the past and past-participle tenses. Examples include \"love, loved\" and \"look, looked\".\n\nOriginally, the weak ending was used to form the preterite of informal, noun-derived verbs such as often emerge in conversation and which have no established system of stem-change. By nature, these verbs were almost always transitive, and even today, most weak verbs are transitive verbs formed in the same way. However, as English came into contact with non-Germanic languages, it invariably borrowed useful verbs which lacked established stem-change patterns. Rather than inventing and standardizing new classes or learning foreign conjugations, English speakers simply applied the weak ending to the foreign bases.\n\nThe linguistic trends of borrowing foreign verbs and verbalizing nouns have greatly increased the number of weak verbs over the last 1,200 years. Some verbs that were originally strong (for example \"help, holp, holpen\") have become weak by analogy; most foreign verbs are adopted as weak verbs; and when verbs are made from nouns (for example \"to scroll\" or \"to water\") the resulting verb is weak. Additionally, conjugation of weak verbs is easier to teach, since there are fewer classes of variation. In combination, these factors have drastically increased the number of weak verbs, so that in modern English weak verbs are the most numerous and productive form, although occasionally a weak verb may turn into a strong verb through the process of analogy, such as \"sneak\" (originally only a noun), where \"snuck\" is an analogical formation rather than a survival from Old English.\n\nThere are three major classes of weak verbs in Old English. The first class displays i-mutation in the root, and the second class none. There is also a third class explained below.\n\nClass-one verbs with short roots exhibit gemination of the final stem consonant in certain forms. With verbs in , this appears as or , where and are pronounced . Geminated appears as , and that of appears as . Class-one verbs may receive an epenthetic vowel before endings beginning in a consonant.\n\nWhere class-one verbs have gemination, class-two verbs have or , which is a separate syllable pronounced . All class-two verbs have an epenthetic vowel, which appears as or .\n\nIn the following table, three verbs are conjugated. \"Sƿebban\" \"to put to sleep\" is a class-one verb exhibiting gemination and an epenthetic vowel. \"Hǣlan\" \"to heal\" is a class-one verb exhibiting neither gemination nor an epenthetic vowel. \"Sīðian\" \"to journey\" is a class-two verb.\nDuring the Old English period, the third class was significantly reduced; only four verbs belonged to this group: \"habban\" 'have', \"libban\" 'live', \"secgan\" 'say', and \"hycgan\" 'think'. Each of these verbs is distinctly irregular, though they share some commonalities.\nThe preterite-present verbs are a class of verbs which have a present tense in the form of a strong preterite and a past tense like the past of a weak verb. These verbs derive from the subjunctive or optative use of preterite forms to refer to present or future time. For example, \"ƿitan\", \"to know\" comes from a verb which originally meant \"to have seen\" (cf. OE ƿise \"manner, mode, appearance\"; Latin videre \"to see\" from the same root). The present singular is formed from the original singular preterite stem and the present plural from the original plural preterite stem. As a result of this history, the first-person singular and third-person singular are the same in the present.\n\nFew preterite-present verbs appear in the Old English corpus, and the forms marked with an asterisk are unattested reconstructions, formed by analogy.\n\nIn spite of heavy irregularities, there are four groups of similarly-conjugated verbs:\n\n\nNote that the Old English meanings of many of the verbs are significantly different from that of the modern descendants; in fact, the verbs \"can, may, must\", and to a lesser extent \"thurf, durr\" appear to have chain shifted in meaning.\n\nAdditionally, there is a further group of four verbs which are anomalous: \"want\" (modern \"will\"), \"do\", \"go\" and \"be\". These four have their own conjugation schemes which differ significantly from all the other classes of verb. This is not especially unusual: \"want\", \"do\", \"go\", and \"be\" are the most commonly used verbs in the language, and are very important to the meaning of the sentences in which they are used. Idiosyncratic patterns of inflection are much more common with important items of vocabulary than with rarely used ones.\n\n\"Dōn\" 'to do' and \"gān\" 'to go' are conjugated alike; \"ƿillan\" 'to want' is similar outside of the present tense.\nThe verb 'to be' is actually composed of three different stems:\n\nThe present forms of \"ƿesan\" are almost never used. Therefore, \"ƿesan\" is used as the past, imperative, and present participle versions of \"sindon\", and does not have a separate meaning. The \"bēon\" forms are usually used in reference to future actions. Only the present forms of \"bēon\" contrast with the present forms of \"sindon\"/\"ƿesan\" in that \"bēon\" tends to be used to refer to eternal or permanent truths, while \"sindon\"/\"ƿesan\" is used more commonly to refer to temporary or subjective facts. This semantic distinction (made only during the present tense) was lost as Old English developed into modern English, so that the modern verb 'to be' is a single verb which takes its present indicative forms from \"sindon\", its past indicative forms from \"ƿesan\", its present subjunctive forms from \"bēon\", its past subjunctive forms from \"ƿesan\", and its imperative and participle forms from \"bēon\". (Modern German had an analogous, but even more complicated, development for its verb \"sein\".) In late OE and ME, the form \"earon\"/\"earun\", from the Old Norse \"erun\", replaced bēoþ and sind (See also List of English words of Old Norse origin).\n\nOld English is an inflected language, and as such its nouns, pronouns, adjectives and determiners must be declined in order to serve a grammatical function. A set of declined forms of the same word pattern is called a declension. As in several other ancient Germanic languages, there are five major cases: nominative, accusative, dative, genitive and instrumental.\n\nThe small body of evidence available for Runic texts suggests that there may also have been a separate locative case in early or Northumbrian forms of the language (e.g., \"on rodi\" \"on the Cross\").\n\nIn addition to inflection for case, nouns take different endings depending on whether the noun was in the singular (for example, \"one ring\"') or plural (for example, \"many rings\"). Also, some nouns pluralize by way of Umlaut, and some undergo no pluralizing change in certain cases.\n\nNouns are also categorized by grammatical gender – masculine, feminine, or neuter. In general, masculine and neuter words share their endings, while feminine words have their own subset of endings. The plural of some declension types distinguishes between genders, e.g., a-stem masculine nominative plural \"stones\" vs. neuter nominative plural \"ships\" and \"words\"; or i-stem masculine nominative plural \"victories\" vs. neuter nominative plural \"sieves\" and \"hilts\".\n\nFurthermore, Old English nouns are divided as either strong or weak. Weak nouns have their own endings. In general, weak nouns are less complex than strong nouns, since they had begun to lose their system of declension. However, the various noun classes are not totally distinct from one another, and there is a great deal of overlap between them.\n\nDescriptions of Old English language grammars often follow the NOM-ACC-GEN-DAT-INST case order.\n\nHere are the strong declensional endings and examples for each gender:\n\nFor the '-u/–' forms above, the '-u' is used with a root consisting of a single short syllable or ending in a long syllable followed by a short syllable, while roots ending in a long syllable or two short syllables are not inflected. (A long syllable contains a long vowel or is followed by two consonants. Note also that there are some exceptions; for example, feminine nouns ending in -þu such as \"strengþu\" 'strength'.)\nNote the syncope of the second \"e\" in \"engel\" when an ending follows. This syncope of the vowel in the second syllable occurs with two-syllable strong nouns, which have a long vowel in the first syllable and a second syllable consisting of a short vowel and single consonant (for example, \"engel\", \"ƿuldor\" 'glory', and \"hēafod\" 'head'). However, this syncope is not always present, so forms such as \"engelas\" may be seen.\n\nHere are the weak declensional endings and examples for each gender:\n\nIn addition, masculine and neuter nouns whose main vowel is short \"æ\" and end with a single consonant change the vowel to \"a\" in the plural (a result of the phonological phenomenon known as Anglo-Frisian brightening):\nSome masculine and neuter nouns end in -e in their base form. These drop the -e and add normal endings. Note that neuter nouns in -e always have -u in the plural, even with a long vowel:\nNouns ending in -h lose this when an ending is added, and lengthen the vowel in compensation (this can result in compression of the ending as well):\nNouns whose stem ends in -ƿ change this to -u or drop it in the nominative singular. (Note that this '-u/–' distinction depends on syllable weight, as for strong nouns, above.)\n\nA few nouns follow the -u declension, with an entirely different set of endings. The following examples are both masculine, although feminines also exist, with the same endings (for example \"duru\" 'door' and \"hand\" 'hand'). Note that the '-u/–' distinction in the singular depends on syllable weight, as for strong nouns, above.\n\nThere are also some nouns of the consonant declension, which show i-umlaut in some forms.\n\nOther such nouns include (with singular and plural nominative forms given):\n\nMasculine: \"tōþ\", \"tēþ\" 'tooth'; \"mann\", \"menn\" 'man'; \"frēond\", \"frīend\" 'friend'; \"fēond\", \"fīend\" 'enemy' (cf. 'fiend')\n\nFeminine: \"studu\", \"styde\" 'post' (cf. 'stud'); \"hnitu\", \"hnite\" 'nit'; \"āc\", 'oak'; \"gāt\", 'goat'; \"brōc\", \"brēc\" 'leg covering' (cf. 'breeches'); \"gōs\", \"gēs\" 'goose'; \"burg\", \"byrg\" 'city' (cf. 'borough', '-bury' and German cities in -burg); \"dung\", \"dyng\" 'prison' (cf. 'dungeon' by way of French and Frankish); \"turf\", \"tyrf\" 'turf'; \"grūt\", 'meal' (cf. 'grout'); \"lūs\", 'louse'; \"mūs\", 'mouse'; \"neaht\", \"niht\" 'night'\nFeminine with loss of -h in some forms: \"furh\", \"fyrh\" 'furrow' or 'fir'; \"sulh\", \"sylh\" 'plough'; \"þrūh\", 'trough'; \"ƿlōh\", \"ƿlēh\" 'fringe'.\nFeminine with compression of endings: \"cū\", 'cow' (cf. dialectal plural 'kine')\n\nNeuter: In addition, \"scrūd\" 'clothing, garment' has the umlauted dative-singular form \"scrȳd\".\n\nOther such nouns: , \"egg\" (ancestor of the archaic or dialectal form \"ey\", plural \"eyren\"; the form \"egg\" is a borrowing from Old Norse); \"bread\", \"breadru\" 'crumb'; \"cealf\", \"cealfru\" 'calf'; \"cild\" 'child' has either the normal plural \"cild\" or \"cildru\" (cf. 'children', with -en from the weak nouns); \"hǣmed\", \"hǣmedru\" 'cohabitation'; \"speld\", \"speldru\" 'torch'.\n\nAdjectives in Old English are declined using the same categories as nouns: five cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), and two numbers (singular, plural). In addition, they can be declined either strong or weak. The weak forms are used in the presence of a definite or possessive determiner, while the strong ones are used in other situations. The weak forms are identical to those for nouns, while the strong forms use a combination of noun and pronoun endings:\nFor the '-u/–' forms above, the distinction is the same as for strong nouns.\n\nExample of the strong adjective declension: gōd 'good'\n\nNote that the same variants described above for nouns also exist for adjectives. The following example shows both the æ/a variation and the -u forms in the feminine singular and neuter plural:\n\nThe following shows an example of an adjective ending with -h:\n\nThe following shows an example of an adjective ending with -ƿ:\n\nOld English had two main determiners: \"se\", which could function as both 'the' or 'that', and \"þes\" for 'this'.\nModern English 'that' descends from the neuter nominative/accusative form, and 'the' from the masculine nominative form, with 's' replaced analogously by the 'th' of the other forms. The feminine nominative form was possibly the source of Modern English 'she'.\n\nMost pronouns are declined by number, case and gender; in the plural form most pronouns have only one form for all genders. Additionally, Old English pronouns preserve the dual form (which is specifically for talking about groups of two things, for example \"we two\" or \"you two\" or \"they two\"). These were uncommon even then, but remained in use throughout the period.\n\nMany of the forms above bear strong resemblances to their contemporary English language equivalents: for instance in the genitive case \"ēoƿer\" became \"your\", \"ūre\" became \"our\", \"mīn\" became \"mine\". Some forms do not match their modern equivalents due to dissimilation. The feminine nominative \"hēo\" was at some point replaced with the feminine nominative article \"sēo\", yielding \"she\"; whereas the \"h\" in plural forms such as \"hīe\" was replaced with \"þ\" under Norse influence as it evolved (a slower development that was not complete until well into the Middle English period), yielding \"they, them, their\".\n\nPrepositions (like Modern English words \"by\", \"for\", and \"with\") often follow the word which they govern, in which case they are called \"postpositions\". Also, if the object of a preposition was marked in the dative case, a preposition may conceivably be located anywhere in the sentence.\n\nThe following is a list of prepositions in the Old English language. Many of them, particularly those marked \"etc.\", are found in other variant spellings. Prepositions may govern the accusative, genitive, dative or instrumental cases.\n\nOld English syntax was similar in many ways to that of Modern English. However, there were some important differences. Some were simply consequences of the greater level of nominal and verbal inflection, and word order was generally freer. There are also differences in the default word order and in the construction of negation, questions, relative clauses and subordinate clauses.\n\n\nThere was some flexibility in word order of Old English since the heavily inflected nature of nouns, adjectives, and verbs often indicated the relationships between clause arguments. Scrambling of constituents was common. Even sometimes scrambling within a constituent occurred, as in \"Beoƿulf\" line 708 \"ƿrāþum on andan\":\n\nSomething similar occurs in line 713 \"in sele þām hēan\" \"in the high hall\" (lit. \"in hall the high\").\n\nExtraposition of constituents out of larger constituents is common even in prose, as in the well-known tale of Cyneƿulf and Cyneheard, which begins\nNote how the words \"ond Ƿestseaxna ƿiotan\" \"and the West Saxon counselors\" (lit. \"and (the) counselors of (the) West Saxons\") have been \"extraposed\" from (moved out of) the compound subject they belong in, in a way that would be totally impossible in modern English. Case marking helps somewhat: \"ƿiotan\" \"counselors\" can be nominative or accusative but definitely not genitive, which is the case of \"rīces\" \"kingdom\" and the case governed by \"benam\" \"deprived\"; hence, Cyneƿulf can't possibly have deprived Sigebryht of the West Saxon counselors, as the order suggests.\n\nMain clauses in Old English tend to have a verb-second (V2) order, where the verb is the second constituent in a sentence, regardless of what comes first. There are echoes of this in modern English: \"Hardly did he arrive when ...\", \"Never can it be said that ...\", \"Over went the boat\", \"Ever onward marched the weary soldiers ...\", \"Then came a loud sound from the sky above\". In Old English, however, it was much more extensive, like the word order in modern German. If the subject appears first, there is an SVO order, but it can also yield orders such as OVS and others. In questions VSO was common, see below.\n\nIn subordinate clauses, however, the word order is completely different, with verb-final constructions the norm, again as in German. Furthermore, in poetry, all the rules were frequently broken. In Beoƿulf, for example, main clauses frequently have verb-initial or verb-final order, and subordinate clauses often have verb-second order. (However, in clauses introduced by \"þā\", which can mean either \"when\" or \"then\", and where word order is crucial for telling the difference, the normal word order is nearly always followed.)\n\nThose linguists who work within the Chomskyan transformational grammar paradigm often believe that it is more accurate to describe Old English (and other Germanic languages with the same word-order patterns like modern German) as having underlying subject-object-verb (SOV) ordering. According to this theory, all sentences are initially generated using this order, but in main clauses, the verb is moved back to the V2 position (technically, the verb undergoes \"V-to-T raising\"). That is said to explain the fact that Old English allows inversion of subject and verb as a general strategy for forming questions, while modern English uses this strategy almost only with auxiliary verbs and the main verb \"to be\", requiring \"do\"-support in other cases.\n\nBecause of its similarity with Old Norse, it is believed that most of the time the word order of Old English changed when asking a question, from SVO to VSO. While many purport that Old English had free word order, this is not quite true, as there were conventions for the positioning of subject, object and verb in clause.\n\nOld English did not use forms equivalent to \"who, when, where\" in relative clauses (as in \"The man whom I saw\") or subordinate clauses (\"When I got home, I went to sleep\").\n\nInstead, relative clauses used one of the following:\nPreposition-fronting (\"The man with whom I spoke\") did not normally occur.\n\nSubordinate clauses tended to use correlative conjunctions, e.g.\nThe word order usually distinguished the subordinate clause (with verb-final order) from the main clause (with verb-second word order).\n\nThe equivalents of \"who, when, where\" were used only as interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns, as in Ancient Greek and Sanskrit.\n\nBesides \"þā ... þā ...\", other correlative conjunctions occurred, often in pairs of identical words, e.g.:\n\nThe phonology of Old English is necessarily somewhat speculative, since it is preserved purely as a written language. Nevertheless, there is a very large corpus of Old English, and the written language apparently indicates phonological alternations quite faithfully, so it is not difficult to draw certain conclusions about the nature of Old English phonology.\n\n\n\n"}

It serves as a bridge between input methods and the operating system. It was originally designed to offer a better text-entry experience and alternative input methods not found in Apple's built-in set or suit better the needs for Windows \"switchers.\" However, the developers have since worked on a Microsoft Windows port and a bridge between OV and SCIM on the X Window System. The macOS version is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger). OV's input methods can also be used through SCIM on Linux or FreeBSD. An experimental Win32 Unicode version is also available.\n\nThe motivation for OpenVanilla was for to fill an oversight in commercially available software.\n\nApple was slow to localize its operating system for the Chinese market. In 1987, three years after launching Macintosh, Apple produced a Chinese version of its Finder (then the improper name of its later renamed \"Mac OS\"), Chinese Talk. There were several competing alternatives, but these never gained traction. However, Apple's Chinese Talk and later its Chinese version of Mac OS had a serious shortcoming: although several Chinese input methods were offered, one of them — the Phonetic \"Zhuyin\" method — lacked the Eten Layout, which more closely emulates Chinese phonetics.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, prior to the globalization of computing and software distribution, new computer users learned the Eten Layout as their first (and often only) way of transcribing Chinese characters. Without support for the Eten Layout on the Apple OS, Microsoft maintained a substantial customer base, especially in Taiwan, because the phonetic method in Windows included the Eten Layout as an optional configuration.\n\nApple's Mac OS X, launched in 2002, received negative feedback after another popular input method, Cangjie, was substantially modified, prompting complaints that the method in OS X was too unfamiliar, compared to that of OS 9.\n\nIn 2003, developer \"clkao\" (Chia-liang Kao) ported Chewing, a popular Chinese input method in Linux/FreeBSD world, to OS X. Using Xcode, a development tool included with OS X, it became possible to build customized input methods on OS X. \"clkao\"'s port is called ChewingOSX and was transferred to \"gugod\" (Kang-ming Liu) and \"zonble\" (Weizhong Yang) in 2004 for further maintenance.\n\nThe success of these developers inspired another, \"lukhnos\", to create VanillaInput, a phonetic input method that supports the Eten Layout, in July 2004. A month later, Cangjie support was also added, overcoming the perceived challenges of OS X.\n\nPrior to these advancements, the focus of large OS producers, such as Apple, did not generally include input method support for minority languages. As a repercussion of the developments surrounding Chewing and VanillaInput, the design of new Chinese input methods was opened for further exploration. Yet, regarding the writing of an IM, many parts (libraries, for example) were still not \"open\" source.\n\nIn October 2004, \"lukhnos\", \"gugod\", \"zonble\" and \"b6s\" began to develop a new IM framework, OpenVanilla, designed on Mac OS X, but intended for implementation beyond OS X. The intention was to create a minimalist and clean design with the goal of helping users write their own IM with minimal C++ knowledge, and independent of the operating platform.\n\nHolo is an example of a language that can be aided by OpenVanilla. Holo is a language spoken by more than approximately 70% of the Taiwanese population. It is the de facto majority language (even though 95% of the people speak and read Mandarin, the official language, to varying competence and extent), but it lacks the same social standing as Mandarin. One contributing factor to this inequality is that it is not used in information processing, because a proper, fully functioning input method for it was not offered by major OS publishers.\n\nA foundation upon which to build an input method for Holo exists. POJ (Pe̍h-ōe-jī) is the de facto romanization standard for the Holo language spoken in Taiwan. In use for over 150 years, POJ was used to publish a Holo Bible and many other important texts. In addition, the transcription of Holo shares similarities with Japanese: the written language can be represented in various ways (in syllabic forms or in ideographic forms). Holo can be written in either Romanized form (Pe̍h-ōe-jī) or in Chinese/Han characters. A standard IME for Japanese exists, in which text is entered phonetically, and then converted by the IME to be presented in various final forms: hiragana, katakana, kanji, or romaji. Conceivably, an analogous system could be developed for Holo using the same principles.\n\nDemo movie\n\nThis screenshot demonstrates the different \"layers\" of a functional POJ input method. A better Holo input method should evolve further into the \"phrase\" layer, in which phrases could be automatically interpreted, and users would not be required to explicitly assign tones for each syllable.\n\nOpenVanilla is still in its nascent stage. Currently a preliminary implementation is done using rapid prototyping techniques and Objective-C++. To make it platform-independent and more accommodating, it needs to re-implemented. Aside from the Objective-C part that pertains mostly to data structure, OpenVanilla's POJ IM module is a pure algorithm code that deals exclusively with keyboard mapping and syllable transformation without a user interface code, so as not to require an IM developer to possess in-depth knowledge of its inner workings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24902", "title": "Post-structuralism", "text": "Post-structuralism\n\nPost-structuralism, sometimes referred as the French theory, is associated with the works of a series of mid-20th-century French continental philosophers and critical theorists who came to international prominence in the 1960s and 1970s. The term is defined by its relationship to the system before it—structuralism (an intellectual movement developed in Europe from the early to mid-20th century). Structuralism proposes that one may understand human culture by means of a structure—modeled on language (i.e., structural linguistics)—that differs from concrete reality and from abstract ideas—a \"third order\" that mediates between the two. \n\nPost-structuralist authors all present different critiques of structuralism, but common themes include the rejection of the self-sufficiency of structuralism and an interrogation of the binary oppositions that constitute its structures. Writers whose works are often characterised as post-structuralist include: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Judith Butler, Jean Baudrillard and Julia Kristeva, although many theorists who have been called \"post-structuralist\" have rejected the label.\n\nExistential phenomenology is a significant influence; Colin Davis has argued that post-structuralists might just as accurately be called \"post-phenomenologists\".\n\nPost-structuralist philosophers such as Derrida and Foucault did not form a self-conscious group, but each responded to the traditions of phenomenology and structuralism. The idea that knowledge could be centred on the beholder is rejected by structuralism, which claims to be a more secure foundation for knowledge. In phenomenology, this foundation is experiential in itself. In Structuralism, knowledge is founded on the \"structures\" that make experience possible: concepts, and language or signs. By contrast, Post-structuralism argues that founding knowledge either on pure experience (phenomenology) or systematic structures (Structuralism) is impossible. This impossibility was not meant as a failure or loss, but rather as a cause for \"celebration and liberation\".\n\nA major theory associated with structuralism is binary opposition. This theory proposes that there are frequently used pairs of opposite but related words (concepts), often arranged in a hierarchy. Examples of common binary pairs include: Enlightenment/Romantic, male/female, speech/writing, rational/emotional, signifier/signified, symbolic/imaginary. Post-structuralism rejects the notion of the dominant word in the pair being dependent on its subservient counterpart. The only way to properly understand the purpose of these pairings is to assess each term individually, and then its relationship to the related term.\n\nStructuralism was an intellectual movement in France in the 1950s and 1960s that studied the underlying structures in cultural products (such as texts) and used analytical concepts from linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and other fields to interpret those structures. It emphasized the logical and scientific nature of its results.\n\nPost-structuralism offers a way of studying how knowledge is produced and critiques structuralist premises. It argues that because history and culture condition the study of underlying structures, both are subject to biases and misinterpretations. A post-structuralist approach argues that to understand an object (e.g., a text), it is necessary to study both the object itself and the systems of knowledge that produced the object.\n\nPost-structuralists generally assert that post-structuralism is the historical context surrounding the arts, while structuralism is considered descriptive of the present. This terminology is derived from Ferdinand de Saussure's distinction between the views of historical (diachronic) and descriptive (synchronic) reading. From this basic distinction, Post-structuralist studies often emphasize history to analyze descriptive concepts. By studying how cultural concepts have changed over time, Post-structuralists seek to understand how the same concepts are understood by readers in the present. For example, Michel Foucault's \"Madness and Civilization\" is both an observation of history and an inspection of cultural attitudes about madness. The theme of history in modern Continental thought can be linked to such influences as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche's \"On the Genealogy of Morals\" and Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time.\n\nThe uncertain distance between structuralism and post-structuralism is further blurred by the fact that scholars rarely label themselves as Post-structuralists. Some scholars associated with structuralism, such as Roland Barthes and Foucault, also became noteworthy in Post-structuralism.\n\nSome observers from outside the post-structuralist camp have questioned the rigor and legitimacy of the field. American philosopher John Searle argued in 1990 that \"The spread of 'poststructuralist' literary theory is perhaps the best known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon.\" Similarly, physicist Alan Sokal in 1997 criticized \"the postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now hegemonic in some sectors of the American academy.\" Literature scholar Norman Holland argued that Post-structuralism was flawed due to reliance on Saussure's linguistic model, which was seriously challenged by the 1950s and was soon abandoned by linguists: \"Saussure's views are not held, so far as I know, by modern linguists, only by literary critics and the occasional philosopher. [Strict adherence to Saussure] has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale. One can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds, but only a handful that refer to Chomsky.\"\n\nDavid Foster Wallace wrote:\nPost-structuralism emerged in France during the 1960s as a movement critiquing structuralism. According to J. G. Merquior a love–hate relationship with structuralism developed among many leading French thinkers in the 1960s.\n\nIn a 1966 lecture \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\", Jacques Derrida presented a thesis on an apparent rupture in intellectual life. Derrida interpreted this event as a \"decentering\" of the former intellectual cosmos. Instead of progress or divergence from an identified centre, Derrida described this \"event\" as a kind of \"play.\"\n\nIn 1967, Barthes published \"The Death of the Author\" in which he announced a metaphorical event: the \"death\" of the author as an authentic source of meaning for a given text. Barthes argued that any literary text has multiple meanings, and that the author was not the prime source of the work's semantic content. The \"Death of the Author,\" Barthes maintained, was the \"Birth of the Reader,\" as the source of the proliferation of meanings of the text.\nThe period was marked by the rebellion of students and workers against the state in May 1968.\n\nBarthes in his work, \"Elements of Semiology\" (1967), advanced the concept of the \"metalanguage\". A metalanguage is a systematized way of talking about concepts like meaning and grammar beyond the constraints of a traditional (first-order) language; in a metalanguage, symbols replace words and phrases. Insofar as one metalanguage is required for one explanation of first-order language, another may be required, so metalanguages may actually replace first-order languages. Barthes exposes how this structuralist system is regressive; orders of language rely upon a metalanguage by which it is explained, and therefore deconstruction itself is in danger of becoming a metalanguage, thus exposing all languages and discourse to scrutiny. Barthes' other works contributed deconstructive theories about texts.\n\nThe occasional designation of Post-structuralism as a movement can be tied to the fact that mounting criticism of Structuralism became evident at approximately the same time that Structuralism became a topic of interest in universities in the United States. This interest led to a colloquium at Johns Hopkins University in 1966 titled \"The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man\", to which such French philosophers as Derrida, Barthes, and Lacan were invited to speak.\n\nDerrida's lecture at that conference, \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Human Sciences\", was one of the earliest to propose some theoretical limitations to Structuralism, and to attempt to theorize on terms that were clearly no longer structuralist.\n\nThe element of \"play\" in the title of Derrida's essay is often erroneously interpreted in a linguistic sense, based on a general tendency towards puns and humour, while social constructionism as developed in the later work of Michel Foucault is said to create play in the sense of strategic agency by laying bare the levers of historical change. Many see the importance of Foucault's work to be in its synthesis of this social/historical account of the operation of power (see governmentality).\n\nThe following are often said to be post-structuralists, or to have had a post-structuralist period:\n\n"}
{"id": "1877683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1877683", "title": "Proto-Balto-Slavic language", "text": "Proto-Balto-Slavic language\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic is a reconstructed proto-language descending from Proto-Indo-European (PIE). From Proto-Balto-Slavic, the later Balto-Slavic languages are thought to have developed, composed of sub-branches Baltic and Slavic, and including modern Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian and Serbo-Croatian among others.\n\nLike most other proto-languages, it is not attested by any surviving texts but has been reconstructed using the comparative method. There are several isoglosses that Baltic and Slavic languages share in phonology, morphology and accentology, which represent common innovations from Proto-Indo-European times and can be chronologically arranged.\n\nProto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops lost their aspiration in Proto-Balto-Slavic. Stops were no longer distinguished between fortis and aspirated but were voiceless and voiced. However, several new palatal (postalveolar) consonants had developed: *ś and *ź from earlier palatovelar plosives and *š from *s as a result of the Ruki sound law.\n\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic preserved much of the late Proto-Indo-European vowel system. One noticeable difference between the two was the merging of earlier short and into . Earlier syllabic sonorants in PIE had been converted into liquid diphthongs by inserting *i or *u before the sonorant in Proto-Balto-Slavic.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic preserved most PIE diphthongs intact except for the short /o/ and /a/ merger. The merger of short /o/ and /a/ carried into the production of Proto-Balto-Slavic diphthongs. The diphthongs that contained the onglide /o/ in PIE consequently became diphthongs with the onglide /a/ in Proto-Balto-Slavic. Former /eu/ had become /jau/, so that no /eu/ diphthong existed anymore.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic also possessed sequences of a close vowel, followed by *l, *r, *m or *n: the \"sonorant diphthongs\". Their accents behaved like the other diphthongs rather than like vowel-consonant sequences.\n\nThe accent of Balto-Slavic and its descendants is still a topic of active research, and there is still disagreement over the developments in many cases. The following gives only a general overview of the points for which a general consensus has been reached among linguists. Differing opinions are noted when necessary.\n\nMost Proto-Balto-Slavic words could be accented on any syllable, as in Proto-Indo-European. The placement of the accent was changed significantly relative to PIE, with much paradigmatic leveling of the mobile PIE accent, along with leftward and rightward shifts conditioned by the surrounding phonemes.\n\nIn the early Balto-Slavic period, an additional articulatory feature, the \"acute register\", had developed on certain syllables, particularly those that ended in a PIE laryngeal consonant (detailed further below). It was a suprasegmental feature whose exact phonetic nature is not quite clear. It likely involved glottalization at some stage, as a similar articulatory feature is found in the Latvian \"broken tone\", which is a reflex of it. It is denoted variously with a superscript glottalization symbol ˀ, a glottal stop symbol ʔ, or simply as the laryngeal cover symbol H.\n\nOnly the presence or absence of the feature, called \"acute\" and \"circumflex\" respectively, was phonemic. Furthermore, the distinction applied only to \"long\" syllables. The following syllable types were \"long\" and thus could have this distinction:\n\n\nThus, any syllable was either long with acute register, long with circumflex (nonacute) register or short (with no register distinction).\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained the system of ablaut from its parent language, but it was far less productive and had been significantly reworked. Vowel alternations were often leveled, but it is not always easy to determine how far this leveling had progressed by the time the Balto-Slavic dialects began to diverge, as the leveling progressed along the same lines in all of them to some degree.\n\nThe lengthened grade remained productive in word derivation and was used in many innovative formations that were not present in Proto-Indo-European. After the merger of \"*o\" and \"*a\", the resulting phoneme \"*a\" could lengthen to both \"*ā\" and \"*ō\".\n\nPre-Proto-Slavic retained many such uses of lengthened grades in morphology. The length distinctions are reflected as vowel quality distinctions in Late Common Slavic (LCS) and the later Slavic languages:\n\nThese are similar examples in Lithuanian:\n\nOn the basis of the existing length alternations inherited from Proto-Indo-European, new alternations arose between the long \"*ī\", \"*ū\" and the short \"*i\", \"*u\". This latter type of apophony was not productive in PIE. Compare:\n\nThe new type of apophonic length was especially used in Pre-Proto-Slavic in the formation of durative, iterative and imperfective verbs. Compare:\n\nCertain pairs of words show a change of older initial \"*a-\" (from PIE , , , ) to \"*e-\", which is sometimes called \"Rozwadowski's rule\". The exact conditioning of this change is currently not well understood, but led to alternations between \"*e-\" and \"*a-\" in related words or even as alternative forms of the same word. The alternations often gave rise to different initial vowels in different languages. Several words retained the alternation into Proto-Slavic times as well, which became an alternation between \"*(j)e-\" and \"*o-\":\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic retained many of the grammatical features present in Proto-Indo-European.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic made use of seven cases:\n\nThe eighth case, the ablative, had merged with the genitive case. Some of the inflectional endings for the genitive were replaced with those of the former ablative.\n\nAn innovation within Balto-Slavic was the use of the genitive in place of the accusative for the direct object of a negative verb. That feature is still present in its descendants:\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic still distinguished three numbers: singular, dual and plural. The dual was retained into the early Slavic languages, but most modern Slavic languages have lost it. Slovene, Chakavian (a dialect of Serbo-Croatian), and Sorbian are the only remaining Slavic languages that still make consistent use of the dual number.\n\nIn most other Slavic languages, the dual number is not retained except for historically-paired nouns (eyes, ears, shoulders), certain fixed expressions, and agreement of nouns when used with numbers; it is synchronically often analyzed as genitive singular because of the resemblance in forms. The Baltic languages also used to have a dual number system, but it has become practically obsolete in modern Latvian and Lithuanian.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic nouns could also have one of three genders: masculine, feminine or neuter. Many originally neuter nouns in PIE had become masculine in Balto-Slavic so the group was somewhat reduced relative to the others. The modern Slavic languages largely continue the use of three grammatical genders, but modern Baltic languages primarily use only two: masculine and feminine. Latvian distinguishes between only two genders: masculine and feminine. Lithuanian distinguishes between only masculine and feminine in nouns, but in pronouns, participles and numerals, the neuter is retained.\n\nAn innovation within Balto-Slavic was the creation of a distinct \"definite\" inflection of adjectives by affixing forms of the pronoun \"*ja-\" to existing adjective forms. The inflection had a function resembling that of the definite article 'the' in English: Lithuanian ', Old Church Slavonic ' \"the good\" vs. ', ' \"good\". The distinction is no longer productive in most Slavic languages today, and most Slavic languages preserve a mixture of definite forms and indefinite forms in a single paradigm.\n\nRussian, Czech and Polish for example use the original definite nominative singular forms (Russian \"-ый, -ая, -ое\" (\"-yj, -aja, -oje\"), Polish \"-y, -a, -e\", Czech \"-ý, -á, -é\"). Czech and Polish have lost the indefinite forms except in a few limited uses, while Russian preserves the indefinite nominative forms as the so-called \"short forms\", used in some cases in predicate position. Serbo-Croatian and Slovene still distinguish the two types but only in the masculine nominative singular (definite \"-i\" versus indefinite with no ending). Bulgarian and Macedonian have innovated completely new forms, affixing forms of the demonstrative pronoun \"*t-\" instead.\n\nThe distinction between athematic and thematic verbs was preserved, but athematic verbs were gradually reduced in number. The primary first-person singular endings, athematic \"*-mi\" and thematic \"*-oh₂\", were kept distinct, giving Balto-Slavic \"*-mi\" and \"*-ōˀ\" respectively. The thematic ending was occasionally extended by adding the athematic ending to it, apparently in Balto-Slavic times, resulting in a third ending: \"*-ōˀmi\" > \"*-ōˀm\" > \"*-am\", replacing the original ending in Slavic, reflected as \"*-ǫ\" (Russian \"-у\" (\"-u\"), Polish \"-ę\", Bulgarian \"-a\").\n\nIn many Slavic languages, particularly South and West Slavic, the athematic ending was analogically extended to other verbs and even replaced the thematic ending completely in some languages (Slovene, Serbo-Croatian). In the Baltic languages, only the thematic ending was retained, as Lithuanian \"-ù\" and Latvian \"-u\" (< East Baltic \"*-uo\" < Balto-Slavic \"*-ōˀ\"). In Latvian, the first-person singular form of \"būt\" \"to be\" is \"esmu\", which preserves the original \"*-m-\" of the athematic ending, but it was extended with the thematic ending.\n\nBalto-Slavic replaced the PIE second-person singular ending \"*-si\" with \"*-seHi\" > \"*-sei\" for which the origin is not fully understood. According to Kortlandt, the ending is a combination of the ending \"*-si\" with \"*-eHi\", which he considers to be the original thematic ending. The new ending, \"*-sei\", carried over into all three branches of Balto-Slavic and came to be used in all athematic root verbs in Baltic. In Old Church Slavonic, it completely ousted the older ending. In the other Slavic languages, the original ending generally survives except in the athematic verbs.\n\nThe aspectual distinction between present and aorist was retained and still productive in Proto-Balto-Slavic. It was preserved into early Slavic but was gradually replaced with an innovated aspectual distinction, with a variety of forms. Modern Bulgarian retained the aorist, however, alongside the innovated system, producing a four-way contrast. The Indo-European perfect/stative was falling out of use in Proto-Balto-Slavic and was likely already reduced to relics by Proto-Balto-Slavic times. It survives in Slavic only in the irregular Old Church Slavonic form \"vědě\" \"I know\" (< Balto-Slavic \"*waidai\" < PIE \"*weyd-\" \"to see\"), which preserves an irregular first-person singular ending, presumed to originate in the perfect.\n\nProto-Indo-European did not originally have an infinitive, but it did have several constructions that served as action nouns. Two of these, the \"-tis\" and \"-tus\" nouns, remained in use into Balto-Slavic and acquired verbal noun and infinitive-like functions. They were not fully integrated into the verb system by Balto-Slavic times, however, and the individual Balto-Slavic languages diverge on the details. In Slavic and the Eastern Baltic languages, the infinitive was formed from a case form of the \"-tis\" noun: Lithuanian \"-ti\", Latvian \"-t\", Proto-Slavic \"*-ti\". Old Prussian, however, has \"-t\" and \"-twei\" as infinitive endings, the latter of which comes from the \"-tus\" noun instead. The shorter \"-t\" could come from either type.\n\nAustrian Balto-Slavist Georg Holzer has reconstructed a relative chronology of 50 Balto-Slavic sound changes, referring only to phonology, not to accentuation, from Proto-Balto-Slavic down to the modern daughter languages. However, only the first 12 are Common Balto-Slavic and so relevant for this article (only Winter's law is a unique common change):\n\n\nWinter's law caused lengthening of vowels if a plain voiced stop followed, and the new long vowels received the acute register. According to some analyses, the change occurred only if the stop was in syllable coda (the syllable ending with that consonant). It operated while there was still a phonemic distinction between plain and aspirated voiced stops, which later merged.\n\nConsequently, the distinction between those two series has been indirectly preserved in Proto-Balto-Slavic by long acuted vowels. Furthermore, Winter's law took place before \"*o\" and \"*a\" merged, as it lengthened earlier \"*o\" to \"*ōˀ\" and \"*a\" to \"āˀ\".\n\nOn the basis of relative chronology of sound changes, it has been ascertained that Winter's law acted rather late, after some other less prominent Balto-Slavic changes had occurred such as after the disappearance of laryngeals in prevocalic position. Compare:\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic generally shows Satem reflexes of the three velar series: labiovelars merge into the plain velars while palatovelars develop into sibilants (\"*ś\" and \"*ź\").\n\nThere are a number of words in Balto-Slavic that show Centum reflexes instead, with palatovelars appearing as plain velars. A number can be explained by regular sound laws, but some laws have been obscured by numerous analogical developments. Others are argued to be borrowings from Centum languages.\n\nFor example, Proto-Balto-Slavic \"*kárˀwāˀ\" 'cow' (Lithuanian \"kárvė\", OCS \"krava\", Russian \"koróva\") is likely a feminine derivation of a lost masculine noun that was likely borrowed from Proto-Celtic \"*karwos\" \"deer\" (Middle Welsh \"carw\", Middle Breton \"karo\", Middle Cornish \"carow\"), which in turn is a regular reflex of PIE .\n\nPIE palatovelars could also depalatalize in Balto-Slavic. Several depalatalization rules for Balto-Slavic have been proposed. According to Matasović, the depalatalization of palatovelars occurred before sonorant followed by a back vowel: K' > K/_RV. That would explain Centum reflexes such as these ones:\n\nAnother view is that satemization occurred in Baltic and Slavic independently after Slavic had split off.\n\nPIE \"*s\" was preserved in Balto-Slavic in most positions. According to the RUKI law, it became \"*š\" when it was preceded by \"*r\", \"*u\", \"*k\" or \"*i\". It also included diphthongs ending in \"*u\" or \"*i\", the long vowels \"*ū\" and \"*ī\" (whether original or from a following laryngeal), and the voiced velar \"*g\".\n\nAmong the Balto-Slavic languages, the evidence of RUKI rule is recognizable only in Lithuanian and Slavic because in the other languages \"*š\", \"*ś\" and \"*s\" all merge into plain \"*s\". In Lithuanian, \"*š\" and \"*ś\" are merged to \"*š\" instead, remaining distinct from \"*s\". In Slavic, \"*ś\" merges with \"s\" but \"*š\" remains distinct (and becomes \"*x\" before back vowels).\n\nMost handbooks, on the basis of Lithuanian material, state that in Baltic RUKI law has been applied only partially. The most common claim is that the law applied unconditionally in Lithuanian only after \"*r\", while after \"*u\", \"*k\" and \"*i\", both \"*s\" and \"*š\" occur. Compare:\n\nThere is no simple solution to such double reflexes the RUKI law in Lithuanian and thus no simple answer to the question of whether RUKI law is a common Balto-Slavic isogloss or not. The most probable answer seems to be the assumption that PIE \"*s\" was changed to \"*š\" after \"*r\", \"*u\", \"*k\", \"*i\" completely regularly within Balto-Slavic proper, but the traces of the effect of RUKI law were erased by subsequent changes in Lithuanian such as the change of word-final \"*-š\" to \"*-s\".\n\nGenerally, it can be ascertained that Lithuanian shows the effect of RUKI law only in old words inherited from Balto-Slavic period so Lithuanian \"š\" appears in words that have a complete formational and morphological correspondence in Slavic (ruling out the possibility of accidental, parallel formations).\n\nIt appears that palatovelars yielded fricatives in Balto-Slavic before the effect of RUKI law, so that appears simply as \"*ś\". Compare:\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European syllabic sonorants \"*l̥\", \"*r̥\", \"*m̥\" and \"*n̥\" (abbreviated \"*R̥\") developed a prothetic vowel in front of them, converting them into \"sonorant diphthongs\". Both \"*i\" and \"*u\" appear as prothetic vowels, yielding reflexes \"*im\", \"*in\", \"*ir\", \"*il\" (\"*iR\") and \"*um\", \"*un\", \"*ur\", \"*ul\" (\"*uR\"). It has remained an unsolved problem to this day as to the exact phonological conditions that trigger which reflex. Regardless, analysis of their distribution has shown that \"*i\" appears much more often, suggesting that it is the default reflex, with \"*u\" appearing only in special cases. In a sample of 215 Balto-Slavic lexical items, 36 (17%) are attested only with \"*uR\" reflexes, 22 (10%) with both reflexes in the same language or branch or with one in Slavic and the other in Baltic, and the remaining 157 (73%) are attested only with \"*iR\" reflex.\n\nSeveral theories have been proposed, the most notable being the one by André Vaillant from 1950. According to him, \"*u\" arose after PIE labiovelars. If true, it would be the only trace of PIE labiovelars in Balto-Slavic.\n\nAfter surveying Reinhold Trautmann's 1924 Balto-Slavic dictionary, Jerzy Kuryłowicz in 1956 found no phonologically consistent distribution for the dual reflexes except in a single position: after PIE palatovelars Baltic and Slavic have only \"*iR\" reflex.\n\nGeorge Shevelov in 1965 inspected Slavic data in much detail, but in the end, he demonstrated only that the\ndistribution of the dual reflexes in Slavic is not reducible to phonological conditioning.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Christian Stang in 1966 Kuryłowicz's statistics proved only that \"*iR\" reflexes are much more frequent than \"*uR\" reflexes. Stang made several important observations:\n\nStang's analysis indicates that \"*iR\" was the regular result of the diphthongization of PIE syllabic sonorants. Doublets with expressive meaning are then explained as expressively motivated \"*uR\" replacements of the original \"*iR\" reflex, or as borrowings from substratum dialects (such as Germanic) that regularly had the \"*R̥\" > \"*uR\" reflex, when (pre-)Balto-Slavic no longer had syllabic sonorants and were then used side by side with the original reflex.\n\nAccording to Jānis Endzelīns and Reinhold Trautmann \"*uR\" reflex resulted in zero-grade of morphemes that had PIE \"*o\" (> Balto-Slavic \"*a\") in normal grade.\n\nMatasović, in 2008, proposed the following rules:\n\nLaryngeals generally disappeared as independent phonemes. When they appeared after a vowel, they caused compensatory lengthening of that vowel, as in almost all Indo-European branches. Laryngeals between consonants disappeared as well, but in the first syllable, they are reflected as \"*a\". Compare:\n\nSyllabic sonorants followed by laryngeals do not show any different outcome from syllabic sonorants in other environments. Balto-Slavic shares that characteristic with Germanic but no other Indo-European languages, which show clearly distinct reflexes in this case. Compare:\n\nIt appears, however, that laryngeals left traces in Balto-Slavic: they triggered the \"acute\" register on a preceding vowel or sonorant diphthong, as an articulatory \"residue\". While laryngeals were the most important source of the acute in Balto-Slavic, they were not the only source. The acute emerges in the following cases:\n\nThe rules governing the emergence of the acute in Balto-Slavic seem complicated when they are formulated within the framework of \"classical\" Proto-Indo-European laryngeal theory, as there is no obvious connection between laryngeals and voiced stops, both of which trigger the acute register. Frederik Kortlandt has proposed an alternative, more elegant and economic rule for the derivation of Balto-Slavic acute by using the glottalic theory framework of Proto-Indo-European. He proposed that the acute is a reflex of a glottal stop, which has two sources, the merger of PIE laryngeals and the dissolution of PIE pre-glottalized stop (\"voiced stops\" in traditional reconstruction) to glottal stop and voiced stop, according to the Winter's law. Kortlandt's formulation appears very elegant initially and seems to be confirmed independently by a glottal stop in Latvian as a reflex of Balto-Slavic acute in words in which accent was retracted, and it in accordance with the typological universal: most languages with high tone is developed in syllables closed with a glottal stop (however, in Lithuanian, it developed into a falling tone, the opposite of the other languages). Rising tone can then be explained as a result of the development of high tone on the second mora of a long syllable.\n\nThough elegant, Kortlandt's theory also has some problems. The glottalic theory, which was proposed in the 1970s, is not generally accepted among linguists, and today only a small minority of linguists would consider it a reliable and self-supportive framework onto which to base modern Indo-European research. Also, there is a number of Balto-Slavic lexemes which point to acute accent but that are provably not of PIE laryngeal origin, and some of them were a result of apophonical lengthenings occurring only in Balto-Slavic period.\n\nMatasović (2008) lists the following scenario as the most probable origin of Balto-Slavic acute:\n\nWord-finally, \"*m\" became \"*n\" in Balto-Slavic. Final nasals are not directly preserved in most Balto-Slavic languages, however, making evidence mostly indirect. Old Prussian uniquely preserves final \"*-n\", and there is indeed a clear attestation of the change in the nominative-accusative of neuters, such as \"assaran\" \"lake\" < PIE . In the other Baltic languages, no final nasals are retained. Lithuanian has vowel lengthening that reflects earlier nasal vowels, but they could conceivably come from either final \"-n\" or \"-m\" and thus do not provide evidence either way. In Slavic, all word-final consonants are lost in one way or another so there is no direct evidence there either.\n\nHowever, there is indirect evidence in the form of sandhi effects that were preserved in some Slavic pronouns. For example, Old Church Slavonic attests constructions like \"sъ nimь\" \"with him\", which can be traced to the Balto-Slavic \"*śun eimis\" where the first word reflects the common Proto-Indo-European preposition \"*ḱom\" \"with\" (compare Latin \"cum\"), and the second reflects the PIE pronominal stem \"*ey-\" (Latin \"is\", German \"er\"). In Slavic, in accordance with the \"Law of Open Syllables\", the final \"-n\" of the preposition was reinterpreted as belonging to the pronoun, which acted to preserve the nasal in its Balto-Slavic form, thus corroborating that it was indeed \"-n\": If the change of \"*-m\" to \"*-n\" had not taken place at an earlier stage, the phrase would have been \"*śum eimis\", which would have given \"*sъ mimь\" in OCS instead.\n\nThe following changes to vowels in Proto-Balto-Slavic can be noted:\n\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European accent was completely reworked in Balto-Slavic, with far-reaching consequences for accentual systems of the modern daughter languages. The development was conditioned by several delicate factors, such as the syllable length, presence of a laryngeal closing the syllable, and the position of PIE ictus. There is still no consensus among Balto-Slavists on the precise details of the development of Balto-Slavic accentual system. All modern research is based on the seminal study of Stang (1957), which basically instituted the field of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology. However, many laws and correspondences have been discovered and are now held to be true by the majority of researchers even if the exact details sometimes remain in dispute.\n\nEarly Balto-Slavic retained a simple accent in which only the placement of the accent was distinctive, but there were no pitch distinctions. The acute register was initially no more than an articulatory feature on certain syllables and could occur independently of accent placement. However, the acute was the trigger for several sound changes that affected the placement of the accent. For example, under Hirt's law, the accent tended to shift leftwards onto a syllable that bore the acute.\n\nOn accented syllables, the acute came to be accompanied by a distinct pitch contour in late Proto-Balto-Slavic. Consequently, accented syllables of any type that could carry the acute register in Proto-Balto-Slavic (listed above) now differed in pitch contour as well as articulation; they had rising or falling pitch (whether accented acute syllables had rising or falling pitch differed by dialect). The tonal accents that emerged from this process are called \"acute accent\" and \"circumflex accent\" in Balto-Slavic linguistics.\n\nSyllables with a single short vowel could not bear the acute register and so also had tonal distinctions. When accented, they had the same pitch contour (though nondistinctive) as a circumflex-accented syllable. The syllables are said to have \"short accent\".\n\nTo reconstruct the Balto-Slavic accent, the most important are those languages that have retained tonal oppositions: Lithuanian, Latvian, (probably) Old Prussian and the West South Slavic languages of Slovene and Serbo-Croatian. However, one should keep in mind that the prosodical systems of dialects in the aforementioned languages are sometimes very different from those of standard languages. For example, some Croatian dialects like Čakavian and Posavian dialects of Slavonian Štokavian are especially important for Balto-Slavic accentology, as they retain more archaic and complex tonal accentual system than the Neoštokavian dialect on which modern standard varieties of Serbo-Croatian (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian) are based. On the other hand, many dialects have completely lost tonal oppositions (such as some Kajkavian varieties, the Zagreb spoken nonstandard idiom).\n\nA minority view, originating from Vladimir Dybo, considers Balto-Slavic accentuation (based on correspondences in the Germanic, Celtic, and Italic languages) more archaic than Greek-Vedic and therefore closer to Proto-Indo-European.\n\nWhat follows is a short overview of the commonly used diacritical marks for Balto-Slavic (BSl.) accents and/or prosodic features, all based on the example letter \"a\". In each case, there is a crude characterization of the pronunciation in terms of High, Mid, and Low-tone sequences.\n\n\nIn Croatian dialects, especially Čakavian and Posavian, the \"neoacute\" (\"new acute\", a new rising tone) is usually marked with tilde, as \"ã\". Short neoacute (\"short new rising\") is marked as \"à\". Neoacutes represent a post–Proto-Slavic development.\n\nHere is a reverse key to help decode the various diacritical marks:\n\n\nThere are multiple competing systems used for different languages and different periods. The most important are these:\n\nMany nonprosodic marks are also found in various languages in combinations with certain letters. The various combinations of letter and diacritic should normally be viewed as single symbols (i.e. as equivalent to such simple symbols as \"a, b, c ...\").\n\nExamples on vowels:\n\nExamples in consonants:\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic, just like Proto-Indo-European, had a class of nominals with so called \"mobile\" accentuation in which accent alternated between the word stem and the ending. The classes of nominals are usually reconstructed on the basis of Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek, which have retained the position of the original PIE accent almost unchanged. However, by comparing the Balto-Slavic evidence, it was discovered that the PIE rules on accent alternations, devised on the basis of Vedic and Greek, do not match those found in Balto-Slavic.\n\nMoreover, nominals that belong to mobile paradigms in Balto-Slavic belong to declension classes that always had fixed accent in PIE paradigms: ā-stems and o-stems. For a long time, the exact relationships between the accentuation of nominals in Balto-Slavic and PIE was one of the most mysterious questions of Indo-European studies, and some parts of the puzzle are still missing.\n\nResearch conducted by Christian Stang, Ferdinand de Saussure, Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Vladimir Dybo has led to a conclusion that Balto-Slavic nominals, with regard to accentuation, could be reduced to two paradigms: fixed and mobile. Nominals of the fixed paradigm had accent on one of the stem syllables, and in the nominals of the mobile paradigm, the accent alternated between the stem and the ending. As shown by Illič-Svityč, Balto-Slavic nominals of the fixed paradigm correspond to the PIE nominals with accent on the root (PIE barytones). The only exception were nominals with the accent on the ending (PIE oxytones) when it was shifted onto the root in Balto Slavic in accordance with Hirt's law; such nominals also have fixed accent in Balto-Slavic.\n\nThe origin of the Balto-Slavic nominals of the mobile paradigm has not been completely determined, with several proposed theories of origin. According to Illič-Svityč, they originate as an analogical development from fixed-accent PIE oxytones. That theory has been criticized as leaving unclear why PIE nominals with fixed accent on the ending would become mobile, as analogies usually lead to uniformity and regularity. According to Meillet and Stang, Balto-Slavic accentual mobility was inherited from PIE consonant and vowel-stems but not for o-stems, where they represent Balto-Slavic innovation. Vedic and Greek lost the accentual mobility in vowel stems, retaining it only in consonant stems. De Saussure explained it as a result of accent retraction in the medially stressed syllables of consonant-stems exhibiting the hysterokinetic paradigm, with vocalic stems subsequently imitating the new accentual patterns by analogy. According to Dybo the position of Balto-Slavic accent is determined by a formula from PIE tones according to the \"valence theory\" developed by the Moscow school, which presupposes lexical tone in PIE. Kortlandt up to 2006 supported the theory of Balto-Slavic losing PIE consonant-stem accentual mobility in nominals, and innovating everywhere else, but after 2006 maintains that the original PIE accentual mobility was preserved in Balto-Slavic in ā-stems (eh₂-stems), i-stems, u-stems and consonant-stems.\n\nThe Balto-Slavic accentual system was further reworked during the Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic period (Dybo's law, Meillet's law, Ivšić's law, etc.), resulting in three Common Slavic accentual paradigms (conventionally indicated using the letters \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"), corresponding to four Lithuanian accentual paradigms (indicated with the numbers \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\") in a simple scheme:\n\nThe simplest accentuation is that of nominals which were acuted on the root in Balto-Slavic. They remain accented on the root (\"root\" here is understood in the Proto-Balto-Slavic, not the PIE sense) throughout the paradigm in Baltic (Lithuanian \"first accentual paradigm\") and Slavic (\"accent paradigm a\").\n\n\nIn the nouns with non-mobile initial accent, which did not have an acuted root syllable, both Lithuanian and Slavic had an independent accent shift occur, from the root to the ending. In Lithuanian, they are the nouns of the \"second accent paradigm\" and in Slavic, the \"accent paradigm b\".\n\nLithuanian noun \"rankà\" \"hand\" etymologically corresponds to Russian \"ruká\" and Serbo-Croatian \"rúka\", but both became mobile in a later Common Slavic development so the reflexes of the Proto-Slavic noun \"*juxá\" \"soup\" are listed instead.\n\n\nNominals with mobile accent had in some cases an accented first syllable, in others an accented ending.\n\nLithuanian distinguishes two accent paradigms of these nominals, depending on whether the root was acuted, as in the fixed paradigm, or not.\n\nIn Proto-Slavic, the operation of Meillet's law converted acute roots to circumflexed in mobile nominals, so that the split found in Lithuanian does not occur. All nominals with mobile accentuation in Balto-Slavic belong to one accent paradigm in Slavic, \"accent paradigm C\".\n\n\nIn the later Balto-Slavic languages, the acute articulation itself was often lost, leaving only the pitch distinction on accented syllables as the reflex. There, \"acute\" is only a type of pitch accent, rather than a specific articulatory feature. The Slavic languages have no trace of the acute articulation and preserve only tonal distinctions although most have since lost even those, in their development from Proto-Slavic. The East Baltic languages preserve some traces of the original acute articulation, in the form of the so-called \"broken tone\", the is a long vowel with a glottal stop in the middle of it, typically denoted by a circumflex diacritic, not to be confused with the circumflex accent: \"â\" . The broken tone is preserved in syllables in certain dialects of Latvian and Lithuanian. The broken tone can occur on unaccented syllables so it is not actually a tone but a register distinction, much like the Danish \"stød\" or the \"ngã\" tone in Northern Vietnamese.\n\nThe short accent was preserved as such in both the Baltic and Slavic languages, but its lengthening could be triggered by certain conditions. For example, in Lithuanian, vowels /a/ and /e/ were lengthened when they initially bore short accent in open syllable, and rising tone emerged, marked with tilde sign \"ã\". Compare:\n\nThe most direct continuation of the acute is in Latvian, particularly in the three-tone central dialects. There, the acute register is directly continued as a broken tone (\"lauztā\") in originally unstressed syllables, marked with a circumflex diacritic: \"luôgs\" \"window\". In originally-stressed syllables, the acute register is continued as a rising or lengthened intonation (\"stieptā\"), marked with a tilde: \"luõks\" \"spring onion\". The circumflex register is generally continued as a falling intonation (\"krītošā\"), marked with a grave accent: \"lùoks\" \"arch, bow\". It can occur on all syllables: locative plural \"gal̂vâs\" \"on the heads\" (compare: Lithuanian \"galvosè\" with stress on a short final vowel, deleted in Latvian), including monosyllables: \"dêt\" \"to lay eggs\" < \"*dêtì\".\n\nIn Lithuanian, the distinction between acute and circumflex is not preserved in unstressed syllables. In Standard Lithuanian, based on the Aukštaitian dialect, the acute becomes a falling tone (so-called \"Lithuanian metatony\") and is marked with an acute accent, and the circumflex becomes a rising tone, marked with a tilde. In diphthongs, the acute accent is placed on the first letter of the diphthong while the tilde marking rising tone (the original circumflex) is placed on the second letter. In diphthongs with a sonorant as a second part, the same convention is used, but the acute accent is replaced with a grave accent: Lithuanian \"pìlnas\" 'full' < PIE ). Word-finally, the acute was regularly shortened: \"gerà\" 'good' (indefinite adjective) : \"geróji\" 'the good' (definite adjective). That rule is called Leskien's law after the German neogrammarian August Leskien.\n\nThe shortening operated according to Leskien's law after the Lithuanian metatony. In monosyllabic words, the acute became circumflexed. Metatonical retraction of the accent from the final syllable to the penultimate syllable also created a circumflex automatically.\n\nIn the Žemaitian (Samogitian) dialects of Lithuanian, the usual reflex of Balto-Slavic acute in a stressed syllable is a broken tone like Latvian: Žemaitian (Kretinga) \"ộmž́iọs\" \"age, century\" = standard \"ámžius\".\n\nIn Old Prussian, the acute was reflected probably as a rising tone and circumflex as a falling tone. The marks on long vowels and diphthongs in Abel Will's translation of Martin Luther's \"Enchiridion\" point to that conclusion. It is the only accented Old Prussian text preserved. Diphthongs that correspond to a reconstructable Balto-Slavic acute are generally long in the second part of the diphthong, and those corresponding to a Balto–Slavic circumflex are generally long in the first part.\n\nIn Proto-Slavic, the acute was lost as an articulatory feature and retained only as a tonal distinction on accented syllables. The acute produced a rising tone and the circumflex a falling tone, as in Latvian and Old Prussian.\n\nSeveral developments in Late Common Slavic affected vowel length. Syllables that were originally short could lengthen, and those originally long could shorten. However, the long vowels also acquired different quality from the short ones so lengthenings and shortenings did not cause them to merge.\n\nInstead, the vowels remained separate, causing the number of distinct vowels to almost double. Thus, differences vowel quality reflected older length distinctions while new vowel length distinctions were conditioned by accent type and placement. Consequently, in the Slavic languages that retain it, vowel length is often a suprasegmental feature tied to the accentual system rather phonemes. In Czech, Slovak and Old Polish, the mobile accent was lost in favour of fixed stress, which rephonemicised the older accentual length distinctions. Thus, the languages have long vowels as distinct phonemes, but they do not reflect the original Proto-Slavic length distinctions.\n\nIn all Slavic languages, the acute was shortened when it fell on a long vowel. A new rising accent (the \"neoacute\"), generally long, developed from retraction of the stress from a weak yer vowel (later usually lost). The short rising accent that developed from the old acute (and in some circumstances, the neoacute) was later lengthened again in a number of Slavic languages (such as Russian, Czech, Slovenian). The circumflex was shortened in some dialects as well (such as Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovak). Direct continuation of the acute vs. circumflex difference as a tonal distinction occurs only in archaic Serbo–Croatian dialects (such as Chakavian) and, to some extent, Slovenian (although the relationship between Slovenian and Proto-Slavic tones and accent position is complex).\n\nIn addition, the Proto-Slavic tonal distinction on liquid diphthongs is reflected fairly directly in Russian as a multisyllable accent shape (pleophony): *ôr (falling) > \"óro\", *ór (rising) > \"oró\". In some other languages (most notably Czech and standard Neoshtokavian Serbo-Croatian), the acute vs. circumflex distinction is continued as a length distinction (although in all languages, both long and short vowels have other sources as well). The length-from-tone distinction no longer exists in Russian.\n\nHere is a table of basic accentual correspondences of the first syllable of a word:\nScholars raised questions regarding the possible relationship between Slavic and Baltic languages as early as the late-18th century. In 1802 the influential German scholar of Slavic languages and history August Ludwig von Schlözer described how his understanding of this relationship had changed over the years: whereas previously he had argued that the 'Latvian' or 'Old-Prussian' peoples spoke languages that belonged to the Slavic group, he had come to see them as an independent language family.\n\nIt was formerly thought that Balto-Slavic split into two branches, Baltic and Slavic, which both developed as a single common language for some time afterwards. More recently, scholarship suggests that Baltic was not a single branch of Balto-Slavic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "302507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302507", "title": "Proto-Esperanto", "text": "Proto-Esperanto\n\nProto-Esperanto () is the modern term for any of the stages in the evolution of L. L. Zamenhof's language project, prior to the publication of \"Unua Libro\" in 1887.\n\nAs a child, Zamenhof had the idea to introduce an international auxiliary language for communication between different nationalities. He originally wanted to revive some form of simplified Latin or Greek, but as he grew older he came to believe that it would be better to create a new language for his purpose. During his teenage years he worked on a language project until he thought it was ready for public demonstration. On December 17, 1878 (about one year before the first publication of Volapük), Zamenhof celebrated his 19th birthday and the birth of the language with some friends, who liked the project. Zamenhof himself called his language \"Lingwe Uniwersala\" (Universal Language).\n\n\"W\" is used for \"v\". Otherwise, all modern Esperanto letters are attested apart from \"ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ\". Known verb forms are present \"-á\", imperative \"-ó\", infinitive \"-are\". Nouns were marked by \"-e\" in the singular and \"-es\" in the plural; the article was singular \"la\" and plural \"las\". It appears that there was no accusative case, and that stress was as in modern Esperanto, except when marked, as in \"-á\" and \"-ó\".\n\nOnly four lines of the \"Lingwe uniwersala\" stage of the language from 1878 remain, from an early song that Zamenhof composed:\n\nIn modern Esperanto, this would be,\n\n\"Jam temp' está\" remains an idiom in modern Esperanto, an allusion to this song.\n\nWhile at university, Zamenhof handed his work over to his father, Mordechai, for safe-keeping until he had completed his medical studies. His father, not understanding the ideas of his son and perhaps anticipating problems from the Tsarist police, burned the work. Zamenhof did not discover this until he returned from university in 1881, at which point he restarted his project. A sample from this second phase of the language is this extract of a letter from 1881:\n\nModern: \"Mia plej kara amiko, neniam mia senkulpa plumo fariĝus tirano por ci. Mi povas de cent ciaj leteroj konkludi, kiel sciigoj de tiu-ĉi speco devas vundi cian fratan koron; mi kvazaŭ vidas cin jam ...\" \n\nBy this time the letter \"v\" had replaced \"w\" for the [v] sound; verbal inflection for person and number had been dropped; the nominal plural was \"-oj\" in place of \"-es\" (as well as adjectival \"-a\" and adverbial \"-e\"); and the noun cases were down to the current two (though a genitive \"-es\" survives today in the correlatives). The accusative case suffix was \"-l\", but in many cases was only used on pronouns: \n\nBeside the stronger Slavic flavor of the orthography (\"ć, dź, h́, ś, ź\" for \"ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ŝ, ĵ\") compared to the modern language, the imperfective verb forms (present and imperfect) still had final stress:\n\nThe pronouns ended in a nominal \"o\" (or adjectival \"a\" for possessives: \"mo\" \"I\", \"ma\" \"my\"), but there were other differences as well, including a conflation of 'he' and 'it': \nIn addition, there was indefinite \"o\" 'one'.\n\nThe correlatives were similarly close, though it is not clear if there was a distinction between indefinite and relative forms (modern \"i-\" and \"ki-\"; these may have corresponded to \"kv-\" and \"k-\") and no possessive forms are known:\nThe last row was evidently pronounced as \"fj-\". \n\nEsperanto at this stage had a consonantal ablaut in verbs, with a voiceless consonant for an attempt at something, and a voiced consonant for success. For example, \"aŭti\" to listen (for), \"aŭdi\" to hear; \"trofi\" to look for, \"trovi\" to find; \"prufi\" to argue (a point), \"pruvi\" to prove. Traces of this remain in a few pairs of words such as \"pesi\" 'to weigh (an item)' and \"pezi\" 'to weigh (have weight)' (cf. their derivatives \"pesilo\" 'scales' & \"pezilo\" 'a weight').\n\nZamenhof refined his ideas for the language for the next several years. Most of his refinements came through translation of literature and poetry in other languages. The final stress in the verb conjugations was rejected in favour of always stressing the second-last vowel, and the old plural \"-s\" on nouns became a marker of finite tenses on verbs, with an imperfect \"-es\" remaining until just before publication. The Slavic-style acute diacritics became circumflexes to avoid overt appearances of nationalism, and the new bases of the letters \"ĵ, ĝ\" (for former \"ź, dź)\" helped preserve the appearance of Romance and Germanic vocabulary.\n\nIn 1887 Zamenhof finalized his tinkering with the publication of the \"Unua Libro\" (\"First Book\"), which contained the Esperanto language as we know it today. In a letter to Nikolai Borovko he later wrote,\n\n\n"}

Among his most noted achievements are the publication of five books of poetry on one day (26 January 1963) and a prize from the Sahitya Akademi for his 1975 \"Dariā Gāzotā\".\n\nA monograph on Poet Raghunath Vishnu Pandit has been written by Dr. S.

Such data commonly requires processing and analysis to make it useful and reliable. To turn the raw intelligence into a finished form, the steps required may include decryption, translation, collation, evaluation and confirmation.\n\nIn the period after the First World War, British practise was to circulate raw intelligence with little analysis or context. Such direct intelligence was a strong influence on policy-makers. Churchill was especially keen to see raw intelligence and was supplied this by Desmond Morton during his period outside the government. When Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, he still insisted on receiving raw intelligence and wanted it all until it was explained that the volume was now too great. A selection of daily intercepts was provided to him each day by Bletchley Park and he called these his \"golden eggs\".\n\nUS intelligence has a different tradition from the British. The key event for the US was the failure to prevent the attack on Pearl Harbor and the inquiries which followed concluded that this was not due to the lack of raw intelligence so much as the failure to make effective use of it. The Central Intelligence Agency was created to collate, analyse and summarise the raw intelligence collected by the other departments. US agencies which focus on the collection of raw intelligence include the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency.\n\n"}

She immigrated with her parents and small brother to Israel in 1957. She has been writing since childhood, first in Hungarian, later in Hebrew. Studied painting in Jerusalem and New York City, philosophy, literature and psychology in Bar Ilan University, graduated in Tel Aviv University (MA, clinical psychology).\nKeren has worked as a librarian, art therapist and clinical psychologist. Exhibited her paintings in various countries. During these years, she had published books for children, adolescents, novels, short stories, translations and was included in numerous anthologies. Some of her books and short stories had been translated to German, English, Spanish, Russian, Hungarian, Braille (for the blind) and recorded on disks.\nKeren is a member of PEN, ACUM, and IPA.\n\nShe is married with two children.\n\nRivka Keren published so far fourteen books and four additional books are due to be published soon. Her work is dealing mostly with subject matters such as destiny, memory, identity, the mystery of love and evil and the dualism of immigrants. Keren's writing is multi-layered and non-linear. The characters wander in a limbo between good and bad, love and hate, sanity and madness, while their state of mind meticulously analyzed. Their quests for belonging, roots and most of all truth and purpose, carry them to their goals through suffering and harsh experiences. Those of the novels that examine the characters against the black hole of the Holocaust were bestsellers and subject to much controversy among critics. In her writings, Rivka Keren, as second generation to Holocaust survivors, is representing the ongoing turmoil and conflict in the existence of immigrants, their pain and alienation but also their absorption and success. Her novels are a study of the human nature, the destructiveness of evil and revenge and the power of hope and love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. An oral language or vocal language is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a sign language, which is produced with the hands and face. The term \"spoken language\" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as \"spoken\", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs.\n\nIn spoken language, much of the meaning is determined by the context. That contrasts with written language in which more of the meaning is provided directly by the text. In spoken language, the truth of a proposition is determined by common-sense reference to experience, but in written language, a greater emphasis is placed on logical and coherent argument. Similarly, spoken language tends to convey subjective information, including the relationship between the speaker and the audience, whereas written language tends to convey objective information.\n\nThe relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the field of linguistics the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability, and written language is a cultural invention. However some linguists, such as those of the Prague school, argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.\n\nBoth vocal and sign languages are composed of words. In vocal languages, words are made up from a limited set of vowels and consonants, and often tone. In sign languages, words are made up from a limited set of shapes, orientations, locations movements of the hands, and often facial expressions; in both cases, the building blocks are called phonemes. In both vocal and sign languages, words are grammatically and prosodically linked into phrases, clauses, and larger units of discourse.\n\nHearing children acquire as their first language the language that is used around them, whether vocal, cued (if they are sighted) signed. Deaf children can do the same with Cued Speech or sign language if either visual communication system is used around them. Vocal language are traditionally taught to them in the same way that written language must be taught to hearing children. (See oralism.)\n\n"}

As Ingold has described the term: \"just as the landscape is an array of related features, so – by analogy – the taskscape is an array of related activities.\" Taskscape, then is a socially constructed space of human activity, understood as having spatial boundaries and delimitations for the purposes of analysis. Of key importance, is that \"taskscape\" as well as \"landscape\", is to be considered as perpetually in process rather than in a static or otherwise immutable state. A taskscape is typically analyzed via five factors: mobility, habitat, economy, nature, and public space.\n\nTim Ingold coined the term in his 1993 article defining the spatial and temporal dimensions of the landscape in human life. He considers it as a methodological structure and analyses the temporality of the landscape in Pieter Bruegel's famous painting, \"The Harvesters\".\n\n\n"}

From the Southern Marine Terminal of the city port, the Odessa–Brody pipeline takes its beginning towards the Western Ukraine.\n\nThe city's port is an internationally important oil terminal, and one of Ukraine's top three ports, with Odessa and Chornomorsk. In fact, these three nearby port cities have grown into a single conurbation, and Yuzhne is considered a satellite of Odessa.\n\nThe city is located about 32 kilometers (20 miles) east of Odessa.

The correct way to name the town in Ukrainian is \"Pivdenne\", rather than \"Yuzhne\".\n\nNonetheless, on 11 May 1978 by the order of the Presidium of Verkhovna Rada of Ukrainian SSR the newly built populated place was given the name of the village Yuzhne. Starting from this event the place takes its beginning.
