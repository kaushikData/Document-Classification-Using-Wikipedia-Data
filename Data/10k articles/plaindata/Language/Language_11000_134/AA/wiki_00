For instance, the general age of onset for the spinal disease scoliosis is \"10-15 years old,\" meaning that most people develop scoliosis when they are of an age between ten and fifteen years. \n\nDiseases are often categorized by their ages of onset as congenital, infantile, juvenile, or adult. Missed or delayed diagnosis often occurs if a disease that is typically diagnosed in juveniles (such as asthma) is present in adults, and vice versa (such as arthritis). Depending on the disease, ages of onset may impact features such as phenotype, as is the case in Parkinson's and Huntingdon's diseases. For example, the phenotype for juvenile Huntington's disease clearly differs from adult-onset Huntingdon's disease and late-onset Parkinson's exhibits more severe motor and non-motor phenotypes. \n\nGerm-line mutations are often at least in part the cause of disease onset at an earlier age. Though many germ-line mutations are deleterious, the genetic lens through which they may be viewed may provide insights to treatment, possibly through genetic counseling.\n\nIn some cases, the age of onset may be the result of mutation accumulation. If this is the case, it could be helpful to consider ages of onset as a product of the hypotheses depicted in theories of aging. Even some mental health disorders, whose ages of onset have been found to be harder to define than physical illnesses may have a mutated component. The symptoms of standard mental disorders often start off non-specific. Pathological changes pertaining to disorders often become more detailed and less fickle before they can be defined in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM. The brain is a dynamic and complex system, it is constantly re-wiring itself and a major concern is what happens to the brain in earlier life that mirrors what occurs later in its psycho-pathological state. The typical onset of many mental disorders in late adolescence may reflect the critical development that happens at this time.\n\nThe age of onset of mental health disorders have been found to be harder to define than physical illnesses.

The brain is a dynamic and complex system, it is constantly re-wiring itself and a major concern is what happens to the brain in earlier life that mirrors what occurs later in its psycho-pathological state.\n\nThe rate-of-living theory of aging states that senescence occurs because individuals accumulate damage to cells and tissues during cell division. This theory is not supported because its postulates that aging rate should be correlated with metabolic rate and organisms cannot evolve longer lifespans were not supported in trials. The rate-of-living theory may not be used to draw conclusions about age of onset based on this.\n\nThere are two subsets to the evolutionary theory of aging: antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis and the mutation accumulation hypothesis.\n\nThe antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis was tested by monitoring the \"age-1\" gene in C. elegans. The \"age-1\" gene plays a role in senescence; nematodes with mutations in this gene live up to 80% longer. Mutants in the \"age-1\" gene for allele \"hx546\" seem to be otherwise normal until placed under stressful conditions. Then, the carriers of the mutant gene appear to be at disadvantage—they do not lay eggs while being starved. This evidence supports antagonistic pleiotropy as a theory of aging, and therefore as an onset cause in some cases.\n\nThe mutation accumulation hypothesis was tested by demonstrating how quickly deleterious mutations can accumulate in Musca domestica. Reed and Bryant demonstrated this by limiting the lifespan of the flies to a few days, which made late-life mutations invisible to selection since they occurred after reproduction. The lifespan of the flies was monitored by allowing them to carry out their complete lifespan every few generations, which was reported to decline substantially. Mutation accumulation is supported as a theory of aging, and therefore an onset cause in cases of diseases resulting from mutation accumulation.\n\nAge of onset (or onset age) is a term that is also used in criminology in reference to the age at which a crime is first offended. Here, age of onset may be linked to subsequent offenses.\n"}

It was spoken on the northeast and north central coasts of North Andaman and on Smith Island.\n\nIt has been extinct since November 2009 when its last speaker, Boro, died.\n\nThe native name for the language was Aka-Kora, also spelled Aka-Khora or Aka-Cora (Aka- being a prefix for \"tongue\"); and this name is often used for the tribe itself. They were divided between shore-dwellers (\"aryoto\") and forest-dwellers (\"eremtaga\") subtribes.\n\nBy the time of the first permanent British settlement at Port Blair (1858), the estimates size of the Kora tribe was about 500 individuals, out of perhaps 3500 Great Andamanese.\nHowever the tribe was discovered only much later, in the work leading to the 1901 census. Like other Andamanese peoples, the Kora were decimated during colonial and post-colonial times, by diseases, alcohol, colonial warfare and loss of territory. The census of 1901 recorded 96 individuals, which decreased to 71 in 1911, 48 in 1921, and 24 in 1931.\n\nIn 1949, any remaining Kora were relocated, with all other surviving Great Andamanese, to a reservation on Bluff island. In 1969 they were relocated again to a reservation on Strait Island.\n\nBy 1980 only one person claimed to be a Kora member, and 1994 the Kora tribe no longer existed as a separate unit. Although descendants of the Kora were still living in the Great Andamanese reservation of Strait Island as of 2006, they identified themselves as members of other tribes, mainly Jeru. The last known speaker of the Kora language died in November 2009. They were a designated Scheduled Tribe.\n\nThe Great Andamanese languages are agglutinative languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system. They have a distinctive noun class system based largely on body parts, in which every noun and adjective may take a prefix according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the tongue. An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of \"yop\", \"pliable, soft\", in Aka-Bea: \nSimilarly, \"beri-nga\" \"good\" yields:\n\nThe prefixes are,\n\nBody parts are inalienably possessed, requiring a possessive adjective prefix to complete them, so one cannot say \"head\" alone, but only \"my, or his, or your, etc. head\".\n\nThe basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):\n'This' and 'that' are distinguished as \"k-\" and \"t-\".\n\nJudging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two cardinal numbers — one and two — and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.\n"}

{"id": "3785051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3785051", "title": "Big Gold Belt", "text": "Big Gold Belt\n\nThe Big Gold Belt is a historic professional wrestling championship belt that has represented multiple world championships throughout its history.\n\nOriginally designed in 1985 by silversmith Charles Crumrine and commissioned by Jim Crockett Promotions for NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair, the championship belt has three large gold plates with a distinctive name plate onto which the champion's name was etched. While not the first wrestling championship belt to incorporate a name plate, it popularized the concept. The original championship belt design was known for being unbranded as it only read \"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\" and bore no initials or trademark of its owning promotion.\n\nIn 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) added its logo to the design for copyright purposes. Following the championship belt's introduction in WWE, the distinctive name plate feature of the Big Gold Belt was swiftly incorporated into the belt designs of other WWE championships.\n\nThe Big Gold Belt was first introduced in 1986 to replace the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt that had been used since 1973, historically known as the \"domed globe\". Jim Crockett Jr. of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) commissioned Charles Crumrine, a silversmith in Reno, Nevada that specialized in rodeo-style belt buckles, to produce it. The championship belt debuted on February 14, 1986 at a Championship Wrestling from Florida card called \"Battle of the Belts II\", where NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair defended the title against Barry Windham.\n\nIn 1988, JCP was purchased by media mogul and TBS founder Ted Turner. He established it as World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under partnership with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and continued promoting the NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair.\n\nIn January 1991, WCW officially recognized Ric Flair as their world champion in conjunction with the NWA's recognition. During this time, the Big Gold Belt represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship as well as the newly established WCW World Heavyweight Championship. An exception to this arose in the spring of 1991. On March 21, 1991, Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Flair at the WCW/New Japan Supershow. Following this match, the NWA recognized Fujinami as their new champion. However, WCW did not recognize this title change. While Flair would defeat Fujinami at SuperBrawl I on May 19, 1991 to reunify the NWA and WCW world titles, during Fujinami's approximately two-month reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Flair retained possession of the championship belt and it only represented the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. \n\nIn July 1991, Flair and WCW parted ways while Flair was still champion. The Big Gold Belt left with Flair due to a dispute with WCW Vice President Jim Herd in which Herd refused to return Flair's $25,000 deposit, a deposit per regulations that was required of reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champions and was to be returned after the conclusion of their reigns. WCW was forced to strip Flair of their recognition of world champion and introduced a new title belt design to continue to represent the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The NWA followed suit and also stripped Flair of their recognition of world champion. \n\nFlair soon signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and exhibited the Big Gold Belt there, proclaiming himself \"The Real World Heavyweight Champion\". Flair stated on the 2008 DVD release of \"Nature Boy Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection\" that the $25,000 he initially deposited with additional interest totalling $38,000 was never paid back to him, and as a result, Flair kept the Big Gold Belt until a settlement was finally reached with WCW. With its return to WCW, the Big Gold Belt represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship once again, while the new WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt design that had been commissioned after Flair's departure also continued to be used.\n\nIn September 1993, WCW formally seceded from the NWA and with that the promotional rights to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship were returned to the NWA. With the Big Gold Belt remaining property of WCW, Ric Flair who won NWA World Heavyweight Championship in July was recognized by WCW as holding the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, the world championship of a supposed subsidiary of WCW called \"WCW International\". The WCW International World Heavyweight Championship was represented by the Big Gold Belt until June 1994, when it was unified with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The Big Gold Belt became the WCW World Heavyweight Championship again. The Big Gold Belt remained the top title in WCW until the end of the promotion in 2001.\n\nIn March 2001, after the long and bitter rivalry of the Monday Night Wars, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. bought out WCW. The Big Gold Belt became property of the WWF and continued to represent the abbreviated WCW Championship within the promotion during the period of the WCW/ECW \"Invasion\". After the conclusion of Invasion at the Survivor Series in November 2001, the WCW Championship being held by The Rock became known simply as the World Championship for the month that followed as the WCW name was phased out. The title was unified with the WWF Championship at Vengeance in December 2001. Chris Jericho became the final recognized titleholder and the subsequent undisputed champion in the WWF and professional wrestling.\n\nFollowing the unification of the World Championship (formerly WCW Championship) and WWF Championship in December 2001, the Big Gold Belt and the WWF Championship belt were collectively used to represent the Undisputed WWF Championship (those who held the championship belts after Jericho are credited as having held only the WWF Championship). After Jericho was defeated by Triple H at WrestleMania X8, the two title belts were replaced by a single Undisputed WWF Championship belt (later WWE), which was first exhibited by Triple H on April 1, 2002.\n\nBy 2002, the WWF had been divided in what became known as the brand extension and the promotion along with its parent company were renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The roster was divided into two franchises or \"WWE brands\", split between Raw and SmackDown!. The WWE Undisputed Champion appeared on both shows and defended against challengers from both brands. After SummerSlam in August 2002, WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar announced that he had signed an exclusive contract with SmackDown!, ignoring the claim to the title's number-one contendership by Raw's Triple H. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff said that the WWE Undisputed Championship was thus very much disputed, and he awarded the World Heavyweight Championship, in the form of the Big Gold Belt, to Triple H. A WWE logo was added to the title belt, for copyright purposes, in March 2003.\n\nOn December 15, 2013 at the pay-per-view, the title was unified with the WWE Championship when WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, and was officially retired.\n\nOn December 15, 2013, the Big Gold Belt was used in conjunction with the existing WWE Championship belt to represent the unified championship known as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship (the name has since reverted to the WWE Championship). However, much like how Chris Jericho carried both physical title belts as Undisputed WWF Champion, the title history for the World Heavyweight Championship was retired as this lineage follows that of WWE's original world title. Along with the custom side plates of the WWE Championship belt, the name plate on the Big Gold Belt still bore the current champion's name. On the August 18, 2014 episode of \"Raw\", a newly designed single championship belt was presented to then champion Brock Lesnar, while the Big Gold Belt was once again completely retired in the process.\n\n"}

{"id": "12443159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12443159", "title": "Comprehensive planning", "text": "Comprehensive planning\n\nComprehensive planning is a process that determines community goals and aspirations in terms of community development. The result is called a comprehensive plan and both expresses and regulates public policies on transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. Comprehensive plans typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The term comprehensive planning is most often used by urban planners in the United States.\n\nIn Canada, comprehensive planning is generally known as strategic planning or visioning. It is usually accompanied by public consultation. When cities and municipalities engage in comprehensive planning the resulting document is known as an Official Community Plan or OCP for short. (In Alberta, the resultant document is referred to as a Municipal Development Plan.\n\nDuring the earliest times of American history, cities had little power given to them by State governments to control land use. After the American Revolution, the focus on property rights turned to self-rule and personal freedom, as this was a time of very strong personal property rights. Local governments had simple powers which included maintaining law and order and providing basic services. Cities had little power, if any at all, to direct development in the city.\n\nCities began to focus on the provision of basic services during the 1840s at a time known as the Sanitary Reform Movement. During this time it became clear that there was a strong relationship between disease and the availability of a quality sewer system. Part of the movement included the development of sanitary survey planning to help bring sewer systems to infected parts of cities. From this planning also developed a new consciousness of townsite location. People began to understand the environmental and social impacts of building cities and developed ways in which to further lower the spread of deadly diseases. Frederick Law Olmsted was a firm believer in the relationship between the physical environment and sanitation, which helped lead to the development of grand parks and open spaces in communities to bring not only recreation, but sanitation as well. The Sanitary Reform Movement is seen by many as the first attempt at comprehensive planning, however it failed to be completely comprehensive because it focused on only one aspect of the city and did not consider the city as a whole.\n\nDuring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cities began to urbanize at very high rates. Cities became very dense and full of disease. As a response to the overpopulation and chaotic conditions, planning became a major focus of many large American cities. The City Beautiful movement was one of the many responses to the decaying city. The movement began in Chicago in 1890 with the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 and lasted until about the 1920s. The focus on the movement was the design and architectural characteristics of the city. Leaders of the movement wanted to push the vision of the ideal city, and demonstrate to the world what cities could look like if they were created to be works of art. The White City was created for the exposition which embodied the visions of the movement with neoclassical designed buildings set against landscaped streets. Visitors to the exhibition began to realize that cities could be much more than dirty, overcrowded places. The movement spread across the United States and influenced many major American cities.\n\nIn 1898, Ebenezer Howard published his book entitled \"Tomorrow, a Peaceful Path to Reform,\" in which he developed the idea of a Garden City. This city was a planned development which included different land uses and community services. The communities were to be surrounded by a green belt and included many open spaces and parks within the city. These cities were designed to be completely self-sufficient and focused on decreasing the negative impacts traditional cities had on people's lives. Although these cities were considered to be utopian ideas, two cities were eventually built in this vision, Letchworth and Welwyn, England. The vision of Ebenezer Howard greatly impacted the idea of city planning in the United States for decades and helped in the development of the idea that cities must be planning comprehensively for growth.\n\nAfter the turn of the twentieth century, American cities began to see the need for local development and growth plans. Influential in this planning was Daniel Hudson Burnham who re-created the city plan for Washington, D.C. created by Pierre Charles L'Enfant in 1791. The original plan called for grid iron laid streets crossed by diagonal boulevards, squares, plazas, parks, monuments, and sculptures. However, over time this plan was largely ignored and the city had developed against L'Enfant's vision. Burnham was instrumental in recreating the city plan and helping to return the city to its once intended form. In 1903, Burnham helped create the city growth plan for the city of Cleveland, Ohio and in 1906 he created the city plan for San Francisco, California. Although these were all city development plans, it was not until 1909 when Burnham created the city plan for Chicago that his plans were comprehensive. The plan of Chicago is known today as the first comprehensive plan and it began a movement of comprehensive planning that emphasized planning as a way to not only make cities more beautiful, but to function better as well.\n\nComprehensive Planning typically follows a planning process that consists of eight different steps. By following this process, planners are able to determine a wide range of interconnecting issues that affect an urban area. Each step can be seen as interdependent and many times planners will revise the order to best fit their needs.\n\nThe planner must first address the issue they are investigating. \"To be relevant, the planning process must identify and address not only contemporary issues of concern to residents, workers, property owners, and business people, but also the emerging issues that will be important in the future.\" Generally, planners determine community issues by involving various community leaders, community organizations, and ordinary citizens.\n\nOnce issues have been identified by a community, goals can then be established. Goals are community visions. They establish priorities for communities and help community leaders make future decisions which will affect the city. Stating goals is not always an easy process and it requires the active participation of all people in the community.\n\nData is needed in the planning process in order to evaluate current city conditions as well as to predict future conditions. Data is most easily collected from the United States Census Bureau, however many communities actively collect their own data. The most typical data collected for a comprehensive plan include data about the environment, traffic conditions, economic conditions, social conditions (such as population and income), public services and utilities, and land use conditions (such as housing and zoning). Once this data is collected it is analyzed and studied. Outcomes of the data collection process include population projections, economic condition forecasts, and future housing needs.\n\nThe plan is prepared using the information gathered during the data collection and goal setting stages. A typical comprehensive plan begins by giving a brief background of the current and future conditions found in the data collection step. Following the background information are the community goals and the plans that will be used in order to implement those goals into the community. Plans may also contain separate sections for important issues such as transportation or housing which follow the same standard format.\nDuring this stage of the process different programs are thought of in order to implement the goals of the plan. These plans focus on issues such as cost and effectiveness. It is possible that a variety of plans will result from this process in order to realize one goal. These different plans are known as alternatives.\n\nEach alternative should be evaluated by community leaders to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective way to realize the community's goals. During this stage each alternative should be weighed given its potential positive and negative effects, impacts on the community, and impacts on the city government. One alternative should be chosen that best meets the needs and desires of the community and community leaders for meeting the community goals.\n\nThe community needs to adopt the plan as an official statement of policy in order for it to take effect. This is usually done by the City Council and through public hearings. The City Council may choose not to adopt the plan, which would require planners to refine the work they did during previous steps. Once the plan is accepted by city officials it is then a legal statement of community policy in regards to future development.\n\nUsing the implementation plans defined in the earlier stages, the city will carry out the goals in the comprehensive plan. City planning staff monitor the outcomes of the plan and may propose future changes if the results are not desired.\n\nA comprehensive plan is not a permanent document. It can be changed and rewritten over time. For many fast growing communities, it is necessary to revise or update the comprehensive plan every five to ten years. In order for the comprehensive plan to be relevant to the community it must remain current.\n\nThe basis for comprehensive planning comes from the government's duty and right to protect the health and welfare of its citizens. The power for local governments to plan generally comes from state planning enabling legislation; however, local governments in most states are not required by law to engage in comprehensive planning. State statutes usually provide the legal framework necessary for those communities choosing to participate while allowing others to disengage themselves with the process. The legal provision for comprehensive planning comes from what is called the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act which was written by the United States Department of Commerce in the 1920s. This act was never passed by the United States Congress but was rather a law written for state legislatures to willingly adopt. Many states did choose to adopt the act which provided local governments with the framework to engage in land use planning. Because the act never gave a clear definition for comprehensive planning, the Department of Commerce wrote another act, the Standard City Planning Enabling Act of 1928, which defined more precisely what a comprehensive plan is and how it should be used.\n\nIn states that do not require local governments to plan comprehensively, state governments usually provide many incentives to encourage the process at the local level. In Georgia, for example, the state government gives many incentives to local governments to establish comprehensive plans to guide development. Today, almost every county in Georgia has established a plan voluntarily.\n\nHowever, a comprehensive plan is not usually legally binding. A community's ordinances must be amended in order to legally implement the provisions required to execute the comprehensive plan.\n\n\n"}

The term \"multilingual information retrieval\" refers more generally both to technology for retrieval of multilingual collections, and to technology which has been moved to handle material in one language to another. Cross-language information retrieval refers more specifically to the use case where users formulate their information need in one language and the system retrieves relevant documents in another. To do so, most CLIR systems use various translation techniques. CLIR techniques can be classified into different categories based on different translation resources: \n\n\nCLIR systems have improved so much that the most accurate multi-lingual and cross-lingual adhoc information retrieval systems today are nearly as effective as monolingual systems. Other related information access tasks, such as media monitoring, information filtering and routing, sentiment analysis, and information extraction require more sophisticated models and typically more processing and analysis of the information items of interest. Much of that processing needs to be aware of the specifics of the target languages it is deployed in.\n\nMostly, the various mechanisms of variation in human language pose coverage challenges for information retrieval systems: texts in a collection may treat a topic of interest but use terms or expressions which do not match the expression of information need given by the user. This can be true even in a mono-lingual case, but this is especially true in cross-lingual information retrieval, where users may know the target language only to some extent. The benefits of CLIR technology for users with poor to moderate competence in the target language has been found to be greater than for those who are fluent. Specific technologies in place for CLIR services include morphological analysis to handle inflection, decompounding or compound splitting to handle compound terms, and translations mechanisms to translate a query from one language to another. \n\nThe first workshop on CLIR was held in Zürich during the SIGIR-96 conference. Workshops have been held yearly since 2000 at the meetings of the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF).

Almost a hundred years ago, jewellery / jewelry became the focus over leather goods made by early family settlers. Continuing now, Curtis Australia still use traditional techniques such as lost wax casting and hand gemstone setting.\nThe company now produces a broader range of items, including fine jewellery / jewelry and luxury writing instruments.\nWriting instruments produced by the brand usually contain elements of precious metal or gemstone(s) to reflect Curtis origins as jewellers. Pen models are often solid sterling silver, such as the Adventurer Series or a combination of materials such as evident in the Dream Writer range. \nFounder Glenn Curtis is a Fellow of the Gold & Silversmiths Guild of Australia and has been making jewellery in Australia for 40 years.\nInformation about Curtis pens listed on Marcus Link, an independent overview of pen manufacturers.\n\nIn late 2014, Curtis were chosen to contribute to the Robb Report Magazine's Ultimate Gift Guide, a collection of extreme luxury products and concepts aimed at the very wealthy. The Curtis pen designs included concepts called 'Artistry' - a gem set and gold pen drawing inspiration from decorative art history, and 'Racing the Wind' a design featuring a diamond set eagle and stallion. Both concepts are intended to prompt design commissions from the magazines subscribers.\n\nIn 2017, Curtis started to create solid gold watches, using designs created and made in house, fitted with Swiss made movements.\n\nFamily ownership\n\nCurtis Australia was founded in 2002 by Glenn Curtis. Curtis is a third generation jeweller and a Fellow and former Secretary of the Gold & Silversmiths Guild of Australia (link). He has been a jeweller for 45 years, owning retail stores and designing and manufacturing jewellery before developing the Curtis brand.\n\nThe company now designs and makes 'Curtis Australia' branded product, a move away from more generic forms of jewellery.\n\nProducts\n\nJewellery\n\n\"By Collections\"\n\nMyst\n\nOcean Bay\n\nFloriale\n\nColours\n\nDell\n\nFantasy\n\nWriting Instruments\n\n\"By Collections\"\n\nStreamline\n\nDream Writer\n\nPrestige\n\nBrighton\n\nAdventurer\n\nQuadrant\n\nLimited Editions\n\nWatches\n\nMens\n\nLadies\n\nNotable innovations\n\nCurtis pens feature an internally developed spring clip. This has allowed sterling silver, a material normally not strong enough for pen clips, to be deployed across their pen ranges.\n\nMost high end resin and silver pens are engineered using repetition tooling or machinery, leading to similar styles and design. Curtis pens are often sculptured with modelled surfaces in relief (source) and hand finished. This approach as led to recognition in industry publications.\n\nIllustrative pens\n\nSome Curtis pen models are decorated with imagery related to certain historical events. Examples of these include the 'Wildlife Warrior' pen, the 'Great Race' pen, the 'Race to the Pole' pen and the 'America 400' pen.\n\nThe 'Wildlife Warrior' Pen was created as a philanthropic project to raise funds for the charity of the same name. (link). The 'Race to the Pole' Pen commemorates the centenary of the race to the North Pole (link)\n\nCurtis' 'Great Race Pen' marks the anniversary of 'the world's first auto race' (link) while the 'America 400' has illustrative elements relating to the European settlement of North America. Pens in this series are heavily sculptured in solid sterling silver.\n\nWatches\n\nCurtis watches utilise different manufacturing techniques. Most conventional watch cases are subtractively produced, i.e. engineered from solid blocks of materials, leading to designs that often reflect manufacturing technique. Curtis watch case designs have been influenced by their background as precious metal jewellers and pen makers.\n\n\n\"(author: Laura Chandler)\"\n\nThe Jack Nicklaus Collector's Pen Series marks significant achievements in the career of professional golfer Jack Nicklaus and includes pens that feature the Masters Tournament, the US Open and the Ryder Cup, with the British Open and the US PGA pen designs still in development.\n\nIn addition to producing pens, Curtis also produces several jewellery collections, examples include the 'Flight of Fantasy' necklet and the 'Morning Mist' necklet. Recent additions include a range of two tone gold rings made by fusing different colours of solid gold into the one item and a range of pieces that include reclaimed Australian hardwoods. \n\n\n"}

This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all calls.\nA call attempt invokes a call setup procedure, which, if successful, results in a connected call. A connected call may be terminated (disconnected) due to a technical reason before the parties making the call would wish to do so (in ordinary phone calls this would mean before either of the parties has hung up). Such calls are classified as dropped calls. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as dropped, at what stage of the call setup procedure a call is counted as connected, etc. In modern telecommunication systems, such as cellular networks, the call setup procedure may be very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the dropped-call rate is calculated.\nThe dropped-call rate in conventional (land-line) networks is extremely low and is significantly less than 0.01%. In mobile communication systems using radio channels the dropped-call rate is higher and may range for commercial networks between 0.1% and a few percent. The main reasons for dropped calls in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), radio interference between different subscribers, imperfections in the functioning of the network (such as failed handover or cell-resellection attempts), overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc.\nThe dropped-call rate is one of the key performance indicators (KPI) used by the network operators to assess the performance of their networks. It is assumed to have direct influence on the customer satisfaction with the service provided by the network and its operator. The dropped-call rate is usually included, together with other technical parameters of the network, in a key performance indicator known as call retainability.\nThe operators of telecommunication networks aim at reducing the call dropped rate as much as practical and affordable. In mobile networks this is achieved by improving radio coverage, expanding the capacity of the network and optimising the performance of its elements, all of which may require considerable effort and significant investments on the part of the network operator.\n\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has announced a compensation of Re.1 for every call up to a maximum of three calls everyday effect from January 1, 2016.\n\nThis decision was challenged by telecoms, which lost their case in the Delhi High Court.\nThe court termed the TRAI notification as “flawed, unconstitutional, arbitrary and unreasonable”. The court was also of the view that a transparent procedure was not followed while evolving it.\n\n"}

Interest in this greeting was renewed during the avian flu scare of 2006 and the 2009 swine flu outbreak, and the Ebola outbreak of 2014 when health officials supported its use to reduce the spread of germs.\n\nAn early popularization of the elbow bump began outside the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement in 1969 with the lifting of the quarantine policy, which forced leprosy patients to live in an isolated peninsula on Molokai. Many of the settlement's residents were devout Christians; when they began attending church services outside of the settlement, the members of the church congregation were fearful of making physical contact with them. Priests, too, were wary of such contact with the former Kalaupapa Settlement residents, but as a sign of good faith they would touch elbows. This greeting became popular among churchgoers of Hawaii in the early 1970s. Because leprosy is transmitted primarily through mucus, there is some evidence that the elbow bump constrained infections.\n\nThe elbow bump as a greeting is also attributed to be a derivative of the more well known fist bump, beginning in the 1980s. The earliest written record of the elbow bump by David Grimes supports this hypothesis. More recently, Shaquille O'Neal demonstrated the derivative nature of the elbow bump in relation to the fist bump in 2004, when he dismissed Kobe Bryant's greeting with a half-hearted elbow bump.\n\nA recent advocate of the fist bump is the World Health Organization. In 2006, due to fears of a possible avian flu pandemic, the WHO proposed using the elbow bump as a means of \"keeping other people's cooties at arms length.\" Dr. Michael Bell has been a principal advocate for using the elbow bump, noting that it can also help constrain the spread of diseases such as Ebola, by modeling social behavior that limits physical contact.\n\nThe elbow bump got renewed interest when the 2009 swine flu outbreak in Mexico began growing into a worldwide pandemic. By 2009 the elbow bump had grown so large in popularity that people in Mexico had taken it upon themselves to utilize the elbow bump to reduce the spread of disease. As in 2006, the elbow bump was supported by a number of health officials, such as Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent.\n\nThe Manhattan Soccer Club endorsed the elbow bump as the safe alternative to the hygienically promiscuous traditions of vigorous hand-to-hand contact. This contact has been characterized, in the less dangerous formats, as handshakes and high-fives, but could also extend to orgies of perspiration and mucus slathered hands rubbing violently in the post-game \"hand slap\" line-up. The potential for mass contamination via these practices is obvious.\n\nIn October 2014 an outbreak of the Ebola disease caused people to revive the Elbow bump interest in the greeting during the 2014 Ebola scare.\n\nBy 2009, the elbow bump was endorsed by university officials and Nobel laureate Peter Agre. The American Association for the Advancement of Science joined the World Health Organization in endorsing the elbow bump. However, some of these endorsements were meant as much to elicit good humor as for purposes of good hygiene.\n\nThe word \"elbow bump\" was considered for \"Word of the Year\" in 2009 by the New Oxford American Dictionary.\n\nAt the open-air service of the Greenbelt festival of 2009, worshipers were encouraged to greet each other with the 'elbow bump of peace' instead of the more usual 'holy kiss' during the Christian rite of peace, because of concerns over swine flu.\n"}

The language is also known as Old Koguryo, Koguryoic, and Koguryoan.\n\nIt is unknown except for a small number of words, which mostly suggest that it was similar but not identical to the language of Silla. Striking similarities between later Baekje and Goguryeo can also be found, which is consistent with the legends that describe Baekje being founded by the sons of Goguryeo's founder. The Goguryeo names for government posts are mostly similar to those of Baekje and Silla.\n\nIn Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, the historical books of Korea's Goryeo period, it is described that the Silla of the late Three Kingdoms is related to the language of Goguryeo and Baekje.\n\nChinese records suggest that the languages of Goguryeo, Buyeo, Eastern Okjeo, Dongye, Baekje and Silla were similar, while the Tungusic languages of Mohe and Yilou differed significantly.\n三國志 魏書 高句麗 : 東夷舊語以爲夫餘別種 言語諸事 多與夫餘同 <br>\n\n梁書 列傳 高驪 : 言語諸事, 多與夫餘同, 其性氣衣服有異 <br>\n\n梁書 列傳 百濟 : 今言語服章略與高驪同, 行不張拱, 拜不申足則異 <br>\n\n梁書 列傳 新羅 : 語言待百濟而後通焉 <br>\n(\"Book of Liang\" : Silla language has to be translated by Baekje so that they can communicate with China.)<br>\n\n三國志 魏書 勿吉國 : 勿吉國在高句麗北, 一曰靺鞨 言語獨異 <br>\n\n後漢書 挹婁 : 人形似夫餘, 而言語各異 <br>\nMany experts today, including Ki-moon Lee, S.

It is argued that the connections of Goguryeo toponyms to Japonic may be due to earlier languages of southern Korea prior to the expansion of Koreanic languages. Words of Goguryeo origin can be found in Middle Korean (early 10th to late 14th century).

They were supposed to work by allowing the ink of the cancellation to be absorbed more readily by the fibres of the stamp paper, making it harder to wash off the cancellation.\n\nThe best-known (indeed only major) examples of grilling are the United States issues of the late 1860s and early 1870s, when grilling was standard for all US stamps. \"Grilling\" therefore remains a specialist interest only for American philatalists. While many types of grilled stamps are common, certain of the grill patterns were little-used, and define some of the great rarities of philately. In particular, the 1-cent stamp with the \"Z\" grill is generally cited as the rarest of all US stamps (only two copies are known), and is commonly known simply as the Z Grill. A recently discovered grill issue, the 30-cent \"I\" grill stamp, may be even rarer, for only one example has thus far been identified.\n\nThe idea of grilling was first suggested by Charles F. Steel, a supervisor at the National Bank Note Company, with correspondence on the subject dating from 1865. The purpose of grilling stamps was to break the paper fiber of the stamp. This would cause the ink cancellation mark to soak into the paper fiber making them more difficult to wash and reuse as postage.\n\nThe first type of grill to be tried, termed by philatelists the \"A\" grill, was applied to the entire stamp. Stamps so treated were distributed to post offices for testing in August 1867, and apparently satisfactory, as National received a contract stipulating use of grilling for all stamps. However, the actual practice of grilling on a large scale had not been completely worked out, and the process significantly weakened sheets, resulting in tearing during perforation and general production handling. National soon switched to the use of a small rectangular pattern of indentations, and subsequent grills were all of this form.\n\nNational's contract did not specify the type of grill pattern, and the details changed as they experimented with equipment. Many of the details have been lost to history; in 1910s, philatelist William L. Stevenson introduced a system of distinguishing types of grills, and identifying them by letter. Later research clarified some of the details of chronology.\n\nNo G, H, I or J grills are found on the 1861-68 issue, for this series went out of production before they were introduced. The 1869 issue used only the G grill, while the 1870 issue used H and I grills. Fears of reuse had abated by the early 1870s, and grilling seems to have been quietly dropped from the production process. Some stamps of the Continental Bank Note Company (who took over production from National) are known to have been impressed with the \"J\" grill as late as 1875.\n\nGrills:\n\nThe least-widely used of these patterns (all associated with the 1861-68 issue) were the \"B\" and \"C\" Grills (both found on only the three-cent denomination), the \"D\" Grill (found only on the two-cent and three-cent denomination) and the \"A\" Grill (found only on the three-cent, five-cent and thirty-cent denominations). The rarest grilled U. S. stamps are:\n\n\nNote: Given that intensive studies of the I Grill began only recently, additional copies of the I Grill issues listed here may well be discovered in the future.\n\nBecause certain grill patterns were only belatedly recognized as features of separate collectible stamp issues, not every U. S. grilled stamp was assigned its own individual numeral in the standard Scott catalogue. Issues that share numerals are as follows:\n\n3-cent D grill, 85; the six Z grill issues, 85A-85F.\n\nH grill issues, 134-144; I grill issues, 134A-141A; 143A-144A.\n\nScott moreover lists stamps bearing the experimental J grill as minor variants (denoted by small letters) of non-grilled issues: 156e, 157c, 158e, 159b, 160a, 161c, 162a, 163a, 165c, 179c. \n\nFour stamps featuring the \"B grill\" pattern are known to exist, all used. All of them are of the three-cent denomination, and are numbered as Scott #82. All four stamps came from a letter sent to Prussia. The stamps were originally given a Mason, Texas cancel. Once they went to Germany (on or about March 3, 1869), they were given a German transit-date stamp. The cover was discovered in 1969 and raised controversy in the philatelic market because certain issues of the much more common \"C grill\" had been partially erased. This occurred during the grill roller's changing to use C grills instead of the all-over A grill. No additional \"B grill\" stamps have been discovered since, and one of the stamps from the cover was sold in 1993 for $85,000. Another B grill was sold again as part of the 1998 Zoellner sale (which featured the 1c Z grill) but sold for about $155,000. In 2008, the stamp was sold again, this time for over one million dollars.\n\nAlthough the National Banknote Company ceased to issue U. S. Stamps after being supplanted by Continental in 1873, it soon began to produce stamps for Peru, on a contract that stipulated the use of the grilling process. Grills of three different types appear on regular issue stamps of Peru produced between 1874 and 1884. One of these Peru grills displays the horizontal ridges that characterize the American Z grill, but the Peruvian version is smaller in size, measuring 9 x 14 mm. The other two grills measure, respectively, 11 x 15½ mm. and 10 x 12 mm.\n\n\n"}

It started in San Francisco, along with the Bunny Hug and Texas Tommy and was also done on the Staten Island ferry boats in the 1900s. It has been said that dancers John Jarrott and Louise Gruenning introduced this dance as well as the Turkey Trot at Ray Jones Café in Chicago, Illinois around 1909. The Grizzly Bear was first introduced to Broadway audiences in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1910 by Fanny Brice.\n\nThe dance was rough and clumsy. During the dance, the dancers would yell out: \"It's a Bear!\" The genuine Grizzly Bear step was in correct imitation of the movements of a dancing bear, moving or dancing to the side. A very heavy step to the side with a decided bending of the upper part of the body from one side to the other, a decidedly ungraceful and undignified movement when performed as a dance.\n\nIt was reported that one of the reasons former President Woodrow Wilson's inaugural ball was cancelled was because of his \"disapproval of such modern dances as the turkey trot, the grizzly bear and the bunny hug\". Not long before this, in 1912, New York placed the dance under a \"social ban\", along with other \"huggly-wiggly dances\", like the Turkey Trot and the Boston Dip. It was also condemned in numerous cities across the US during the same time period, with many considering it to be a \"degenerate dance\".\n\nHowever, a large portion of society accepted the dance, along with other similar dances. The Grizzly Bear dance was featured \"on Broadway, in vaudeville, and at cabaret performances\". In fact, it is believed that the first introduction to the \"general public\" of the dance came about in the original \"Broadway production of \"Over the River\"\" in 1912.\n\nIn 2015, Boulder-based contemporary dance artist Christopher Reetz revitalized interest in the \"Grizzly Bear\". In a February 2015 interview, Reetz described his interpretation of the dance: \"First, you're riding a bear. Then, you are the bear\".\n\n"}

The standards published by the Academy of the Hebrew Language are not meticulously followed in common usage, so the Hebrew Wikipedia community decides on problematic cases of spelling by discussions or polls for the sake of consistency within the project. When technically possible, spelling decisions are periodically enforced using automatic replacement by a bot.\n\nOver the years, Hebrew Wikipedia has become one of the most popular sources of information for Israelis. In a 2012 qualitative research, 51 Israeli teachers of different grades were asked about their use habits of Wikipedia, and most of them responded that they don't use it as the main source for teaching, and instead search for other reliable websites on Google.

Some Wikipedia contributors at the meeting criticized \"the lack of government cooperation with their efforts to compile a free online Hebrew-language encyclopedia,\" as well as sharing complaints from Wikipedia editors abroad that since the Israel Defense Forces does not release photos for free redistribution on the Internet, the sole source of available pictures for entries such as the Gaza War and the 2006 Lebanon War are the Palestinians.\n\nIn July 2006, Hebrew Wikipedia had one of the highest amounts of bytes per article, and the highest of all editions on Wikipedia with over 20,000 articles.\n\nWhereas the English Wikipedia requires a general consensus for deleting articles (hence deletion discussion is not considered to be a voting process), the Hebrew Wikipedia has adopted a policy of deletion upon a 55% majority, with no minimum number of votes. In these votes, only registered users with one month seniority and at least 100 edits in the article, image, category or template namespaces in the past 90 days can vote.\n\nAdding on the aforementioned, comparing to English Wikipedia, Hebrew Wikipedia is much more conservative, regarding what types of content may be in it - even when complying with all the basic guidelines for good encyclopedic writing.\n\nThe inclusion criteria are detailed under the \"principles and guidelines\" page.

He was appointed secretary and principal assistant keeper in 1938.\n\nDuring 1944 and 1945, he paid several extended visits to Italy, Germany, and Malta as War Office Adviser on Archives, attached to the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Subcommission, playing an important role in archives protection in those countries from the worst of the depredations of war. In 1947, Jenkinson, along with H. E. Bell, advocated the protection and preservation of a country's archives, even during times of war, so that the \"sanctity of evidence\" may be preserved in the records.\n\nFrom 1947 until his retirement in 1954, Jenkinson served as the deputy keeper (chief executive officer) of the repository at the Public Record Office. During this tenure, Jenkinson was instrumental in acquiring more facilities in Ashridge, Hertfordshire as further records storage, and facilities in Hayes, Middlesex to serve as temporary housing for records in the process of being transferred to the Public Record Office. \n\nJenkinson lectured on palaeography, diplomatic, and archives in Cambridge, King's College London and University College London. He wrote a number of books on palaeography and diplomatic, and his \"Manual of Archive Administration\" (1922; revised edition 1937) became a highly influential work on archival practice in Britain and Ireland.\n\nJenkinson served as Honorary Secretary of the Surrey Archaeological Society. He took a leading part in establishing its daughter organization, the Surrey Record Society, in 1912; and thereafter, as secretary and general editor until 1950, in establishing its principles of editing and records publication. He was a founder, Joint Honorary Secretary (1932–47) and Vice-President (1954–61) of the British Records Association; President of the Jewish Historical Society of England (1953–55); and President of the Society of Archivists (1955–61). He also played an important role in the setting up of the National Register of Archives in 1945. Jenkinson served as the British representative for the UNESCO International Council on Archives, later becoming a vice-president of the Council.\n\nJenkinson's \"Manual of Archive Administration\" was first published in 1922, and republished in a second edition (revised and expanded, but not significantly altered in its principles) in 1937. It was reissued with a new introduction by Roger Ellis in 1965. The book is described by John Ridener as \"one of the most widely recognized treatises on the theory of archives and archival work\" for introducing continental archival concepts to Britain (and the English-speaking world), along with his own original interpretations. For example, Jenkinson rejected the practice of accepting singular documents into an archive, as well as the acceptance of private papers, which he considered to be a flaw of the French and Belgian philosophies. However, Margaret Procter argues that despite Jenkinson's \"iconic\" status, his work also rested to a considerable degree on an existing British theoretical tradition. \n\nKey elements in Jenkinson's archival theory included the following:\n\nJenkinson saw \"the good Archivist\" as \"perhaps the most selfless devotee of Truth the modern world produces\". \"His Creed, the Sanctity of Evidence; his Task, the Conservation of every Scrap of Evidence attaching to the Documents committed to his charge; his Aim, to provide, without prejudice or afterthought, for all who wish to know the Means of Knowledge.\" He further reaffirmed this position by designating the archivist as being a \"profession of faith,\" a serious professional that is uncompromising in their duty. \n\nJenkinson had a number of theoretical differences of opinion with T. R. Schellenberg, his American counterpart, particularly over the question of the archivist's role in appraisal and selection. John Ridener ascribes their differences in outlook to the fact that, in contrast to Schellenberg's concern with modern records management, Jenkinson's theory was founded on \"medieval record structures\", and was unsuited to dealing with the increased bulk of modern records. To Schellenberg, it was a matter of quality in the archives. Having an undisturbed and impartial bulk in appraisal and accession does not, in his philosophy, serve the main purpose of the modern archives: making available useful material to patrons. Some records have higher evidentiary value, while others fall short on worth, making the former more desirable for preservation. Schellenberg desired a forward-thinking practicality in the approach to archival appraisal that took into consideration the needs of future patrons (in stark contrast to Jenkinson's conservative approach), while maintaining Jenkinson's notions of record relatedness, evidentiary value, and \"truth\" in archival holdings.\n\nIn a private letter, Schellenberg dismissed Jenkinson as \"an old fossil\". \n\nIn his professional career at the Public Record Office, and in particular as Deputy Keeper from 1947 to 1954, he was often seen as an autocratic and inflexible conservative. Elizabeth Shepherd comments that \"it was only after his retirement that the PRO could finally develop a professional archival approach to its work,\" as Jenkinson did not like individual interpretations or differing viewpoints of his philosophy.\n\nJenkinson's core beliefs in the objectivity of archives and the archivist as neutral custodian have undergone considerable criticism and revision in recent years. Writing in 1997, Terry Cook commented: \"At its most extreme, Jenkinson's approach would allow the archival legacy to be perverted by administrative whim or state ideology, as in the former Soviet Union, where provenance was undermined by the establishment of one state fonds and archival records attained value solely by the degree to which they reflected the 'official' view of history.\"\n\nJenkinson was appointed CBE in 1943 and knighted in 1949. As well as being a member of the Society of Archivists of Great Britain, Jenkinson was also an honorary member of the Society of American Archivists. Jenkinson was further bestowed an honorary fellowship at University College, London, as well as an honorary LLD of Aberdeen.\n\nWriting in 1980, Roger Ellis and Peter Walne commented that \"[n]o one man had more influence on the establishment of the profession of archivist in Great Britain than Sir Hilary Jenkinson\". Terry Eastwood in 2003 called Jenkinson \"one of the most influential archivists in the English-speaking world\".\n\nJenkinson influenced the University of London's decision to establish an archives diploma program, and would later present its first lecture. Such a program provided advancement towards Jenkinson's desire for the scientific archival profession to advance beyond his Public Records Office, and to train a new generation of archivists in his English method. After his death, Oliver W. Holmes wrote in the \"American Archivist\" that Jenkinson's work had become a reference source for all inexperienced staff. Since 2007, the Department of Information Studies at University College London has hosted an annual Jenkinson Lecture named in honour of Sir Hilary. The series was established to mark the sixtieth anniversary of archival education at UCL.\n\n\nA fuller bibliography of Jenkinson's writings to 1956 appears as:\n\nFestschrifts\n\n\n"}

According to the Academy's website, \"The overarching goal of the HDP is to present the history and development of the Hebrew lexicon, from the earliest occurrences of words down through their most recent documentation.\" It aims to encompass the entire Hebrew lexicon throughout its history; that is, to present every Hebrew word in its morphological, semantical, and contextual development from its first appearance in written texts to the present. \n\nThe editorial board consists of Prof. Chaim A. Cohen, editor-in-chief; Prof. Steven (Shmuel) Fassberg, associate editor; and Dr. Gabriel Birnbaum, writer of the entries.\n\nAs early as 1937, the president of Va'ad HaLashon (\"The Language Committee\", which later became the Academy of the Hebrew Language), Prof. Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai, proposed the establishment of \"a large endeavor which prepares an academic dictionary of our language, in all of the periods and evolutions that it has endured from the moment it is documented, until today.\" A formal decision to undertake the HDP was taken in 1955.\n\nThe HDP is based on Hebrew texts up until 1100 CE, and large selections of Hebrew literature from the period thereafter until the founding of the State of Israel. As much scholarly attention had already been given to the Hebrew Bible and the Pseudepigrapha, it was decided to begin with texts from the post-biblical period. The database thus reflects more than 2000 years of Hebrew writing. Such a project requires a large textual database, and the HDP was one of the first in the world to develop and use a computerized concordance. In 2005, some fifty years after commencement, it was decided there was enough material to begin the writing of entries.\n\nThe Academy initially debated as to whether it should create a series of dictionaries according to periods or literary genres, or whether it should work towards a single integrated work. In 1959 it was decided that there would be one central dictionary containing all periods, i.e., ancient, medieval and modern Hebrew literature. Material was first gathered from ancient literature written between 200 BCE and 1100 CE, and later, modern literature from 1750 onwards. Sources include material discovered at the Cairo Genizah. Material from Karaite sources is also included, and material from Samaritan sources may be added in the future. Compilation of the list of documentary sources for the dictionary was completed in 1963 with the publication of \"Sefer ha-Meqorot [Source Book]\" for sources \"from the canonization of the Bible until the conclusion of the Geonic period.\" The \"Source Book\" serves as the foundation for all work on the dictionary.\n\nWork on the HDP is based on the best available manuscripts of the texts, which are entered into the database and then analyzed. In those cases where there are several extant manuscripts, the clearest and most complete manuscript is selected for incorporation into the dictionary. \n\nIn 1982 the Academy published a sample entry for the dictionary based on the triliteral root ערב. The 88-page entry was published in the Academy’s journal \"Leshonenu\" (\"Our Language\"). \n\nIn 2010, the database of Hebrew texts from the post-biblical period down through the 11th century, and the database of modern texts from 1750 onwards, were united into a single database. This database serves as an archive of not only individual words, but also complete texts that have been carefully copied from their source. In addition to enabling grammatical analyses and concordance searches, the archives also contain unique corpora, such as Hebrew poetry from the 11th century. The database is accessible to the public. \n\nThe database draws upon some 4,300 Hebrew sources, from the classic Rabbinic literature period (2nd century BCE) through the Geonic period (11th century CE) to 1947. Literary strata and genres represented include the Dead Sea Scrolls, inscriptions, Talmud and Midrash, Geonic literature, prayer and piyyut, Karaite literature, science, deeds, colophons, amulets, and the like. Essentially a concordance, the online resource accesses all the words in the database and enables retrieval of citations according to roots, lemmata, and declined forms or combinations, as well as of specific texts by title, author, date, or literary genre. It is updated as new research becomes available and as more old texts are discovered.\n\nAs of 7 June 2010, the twenty-million word database contained 4,056 Hebrew roots. Of its 54,807 entries, 14,592 are nouns, adjectives and adverbs, and 13,979 are verbs. The balance consists of personal names, numbers, prepositions and similar lexical items. The size of the database on that date was about 40 gigabytes. The complete lexical archive will contain at least 25 million quotations.\n\n\nThree samples of the entry for the triliteral root ערב a b c\n"}

There are long vowels as well as long consonants (the latter are often called \"geminates\").\n\nMany languages do not have distinctive length. Among the languages that have distinctive length, there are only a few that have both distinctive vowel length and distinctive consonant length. It is more common that there is only one or that they depend on each other.\n\nThe languages that distinguish between different lengths have usually long and short sounds. According to some linguists, Estonian and some Sami languages have three phonemic (meaning-distinguishing) lengths for consonants and vowels. Some Low German/Low Saxon varieties in the vicinity of Hamburg and some Moselle Franconian and Ripuarian Franconian varieties do, too.\n\nStrictly speaking, a pair of a long sound and a short sound should be identical except for their length. In certain languages, however, there are pairs of phonemes that are traditionally considered to be long-short pairs even though they differ not only in length, but also in quality, for instance English \"long e\" which is (as in \"feet\" ) vs. \"short i\" which is (as in \"fit\" ) or German \"long e\" which is (as in \"Beet\" 'garden bed') vs. \"short e\" which is (as in \"Bett\" 'sleeping bed'). Also, tonal contour may reinforce the length, as in Estonian, where the over-long length is concomitant with a tonal variation resembling tonal stress marking.\n\nIn transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet, long vowels or consonants are notated with the length sign (Unicode U+02D0 MODIFIER LETTER TRIANGULAR COLON) after the letter. Diacritics may occur over either the base letter, the length sign, or both. For example, in some non-rhotic varieties of English the /t/ of the word \"party\" may be nearly elided, with just some breathy-voice remaining, in which case it may be transcribed . When both length and tone are moraic, a tone diacritic may appear twice, as in (falling tone on a long vowel). A morpheme may be reduced to length plus nasalization, in which case a word might be transcribed . If the length is morphemic, the morphemes would be and .\n\nIn this non-linear phonology, the feature of length is often not a feature of a specific sound segment, but rather of the whole syllable.\n\n"}
{"id": "3244612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3244612", "title": "Liburnian language", "text": "Liburnian language\n\nThe Liburnian language is an extinct language which was spoken by the ancient Liburnians, who occupied Liburnia in classical times. Classification of the Liburnian language is not clearly established; it is reckoned as an Indo-European language with a significant proportion of the Pre-Indo-European elements from the wider area of the ancient Mediterranean.\n\nNo writings in Liburnian are known. The only Liburnian linguistic remains are Liburnian toponyms and some family and personal names in Liburnia, in Latinized form from the 1st century AD. Smaller differences found in the archaeological material of narrower regions in Liburnia are in a certain measure reflected also in these scarce linguistic remains. This has caused much speculation about the language.\n\nFeatures shared by Liburnian and other languages have been noted in Liburnian language remains, names and toponyms, dating from between the Iron Age and the beginning of Common Era. These are insufficient for a precise linguistic classification, other than a general indication that they have an Indo-European basis, but also incorporate significant elements from Pre-Indo-European languages. This also appears to be the case in their social relations, and such phenomena are likely related to their separate cultural development, physical isolation and mixed ethnic origins.\n\nFollowing studies of the onomastics of the Roman province of Dalmatia, Géza Alföldy has suggested that the Liburni and Histri belonged to the Venetic language area. In particular, some Liburnian anthroponyms show strong Venetic affinities, a few similar names and common roots, such as \"Vols-\", \"Volt-\", and \"Host-\" (< PIE \"*ghos-ti-\", \"stranger, guest, host\"). Liburnian and Venetic names sometimes also share suffixes in common, such as \"-icus\" and \"-ocus\".\n\nJürgen Untermann, who has focused on Liburnian onomastics, considers that only the Liburnians at the north-eastern Istrian coast were strongly Venetic. Untermann has suggested three groups of Liburnian names: one structurally similar to those of the Venetian and Histri; another linked to the Dalmatae, Iapodes and other Illyrians on the mainland to the south of the Liburnians, and; a third group of names that were common throughout Liburnian territory, and lacked any relation to those of their neighbors.\n\nOther proper names, such as those of local deities and toponyms also showed differing regional distributions. According to R. Katičić, Liburnian toponyms, in both structure and form, also demonstrate diverse influences, including Pre-Indo-European, Indo-European and other, purely local features. Katičić has also stated that toponyms were distributed separately along ethnic and linguistic lines. \n\nS. Čače has noted that it can not be determined whether Liburnian was more related to the North Adriatic language group (Veneti, Histri) or the languages of Iapodes and Dalmatae, due to the scarcity of evidence. While the Liburnians differed significantly from the Histri and Veneti, both culturally and ethnically, they have been linked to the Dalmatae by their burial traditions. \n\nOther toponymical and onomastic similarities have been found between Liburnia and other regions of both Illyria and Asian Minor, especially Lycia, Lydia, Caria, Pisidia, Isauria, Pamphylia, Lycaonia and Cilicia, as well as similarities in elements of social organization, such as matriarchy/ginecocracy (\"gynaikokratia\") and the numerical organization of territory. These are also features of the wider Adriatic region, especially Etruria, Messapia and southern Italy. Topoymical and onomastic connections to Asia Minor may also indicate a Liburnian presence amongst the Sea Peoples.\n\nThe old toponym \"Liburnum\" in Liguria may also link the Liburnian name to the Etruscans, as well as the proposed Tyrsenian language family.\n\nThe Liburnians underwent Romanization after being conquered by the Romans in 35 BCE. The Liburnian language was replaced by Latin, and underwent language death –most likely during Late Antiquity. The Liburnians nevertheless retained some of their cultural traditions until the 4th century CE, especially in the larger cities – a fact attested by archaeology.\n\nThe single name plus patronymic formula common among Illyrians is rare among Liburnians. In a region where the Roman three-name formula (\"praenomen\", \"nomen gentile\", \"cognomen\": \"Caius Julius Caesar\") spread at an early date, a native two-name formula appears in several variants.\nPersonal name plus family name is found in southern Liburnia, while personal name plus family name plus patronymic is found throughout the Liburnian area, for example: \"Avita Suioca Vesclevesis\", \"Velsouna Suioca Vesclevesis f(ilia)\", \"Avita Aquillia L(uci) f(ilia)\", \"Volsouna Oplica Pl(a)etoris f(ilia)\", \"Vendo Verica Triti f(ilius)\".\n\n\nThe majority of the preceding names are unknown among the eastern and southern neighbors of the Liburnians (Dalmatae, etc.), yet many have Venetic complements. The following names are judged to be exclusively Liburnian, yet one (\"Buzetius\") is also attested among the neighboring Iapodes to the north and northeast:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42605567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42605567", "title": "Malak Hifni Nasif", "text": "Malak Hifni Nasif\n\nMalak Hifni Nasif (25 December 1886 – 17 October 1918) was an Egyptian feminist who contributed greatly to the intellectual and political discourse on the advancement of Egyptian women in the early 20th century.\n\nMalak was born in Cairo in 1886 to a middle-class family. Her mother was Saniyyah Abd al-Karim Jalal, and her father was Hifni Bey Nasif, a lawyer who was a member of Muhammad Abduh’s party. Malak’s father encouraged her to learn and be educated. Growing up, she often read Arabic poetry and began writing in her free time. While her father encouraged her to be formally educated, he also raised her with a strong connection to native Egyptian culture, teaching her the Arabic language and Arabic culture from an early age.\n\nMalak was among the first graduating class from the Girls’ Section of the ‘Abbas Primary School in 1901, and she continued her education at the Saniyyah Teacher Training College, where she graduated at the top of her class in 1903. Malak returned to the ‘Abbas School to teach for two years. She was forced to quit when she married Abd al-Satar al-Basil Pasha in 1907. At the time, Egyptian law forbid women from teaching while married. At this point, Malak moved with al-Basil to al-Fayyum in the desert, and she began writing under the pseudonym Bahithat al-Badiya. It was there that she found out her husband already had a wife and a child. The treatment she received from al-Basil, as well as the observations she made of other women, led her to write thoughtfully and directly about the status of women in Egypt. She corresponded significantly with other writers and friends like May Ziadah, and she responded critically to major male writers of the time, like Qasim Amin. Malak stayed with al-Basil for 11 years until she died of influenza in 1918.\n\nMalak lived in Egypt during a period of growing intellectual and political discourse on the status of women in society. This time period included influential players like Huda Sha'arawi, Qasim Amin, Nabawiyya Musa, and many more. During the same period, nationalist and traditionalist thinkers went back and forth with different ideas about the future of the Middle East. These two conversations were intrinsically linked and had a large overlap. Malak entered this dialogue and presented her \"attempt at reform\" for an Egyptian future.\n\nMalak first began publishing works Al-jarida, the major newspaper of the Umma party. Malak also spoke often at universities and the Umma party headquarters. In 1909, she published Al-Nisa’iyyat, a collection of many of her talks and essays. Through these methods, she raised her own voice for the advancement of women.\n\nThe dominant feminist ideas at the time associated the advancement of women with westernization and movement towards a more European society. Women like Huda Sha’rawi supported actions like unveiling as progress towards a more European, more liberated world for women. Malak agreed on some level with her contemporaries, but, for the most part, she brought her own ideas. She had an alternative feminist voice; she combined westernization with Islam and traditionalism, claiming that only a combination of the two would move women in the right direction. She presented these views by writing on a number of different issues, including unveiling, marriage, and education.\n\nDuring the early 1900s, many elite women began using unveiling, or the public removal of their face veils, as a symbol of feminism. Writers like Qasim Amin advocated unveiling as a strategy for women to show their power and liberation. Malak, on the other hand, was opposed to unveiling and did not believe that it should be used in this way. She believed that many of the wealthier women who unveiled were doing so because of an obsession with European fashion, not because of a desire for freedom or because they felt repressed by the veil. She also argued that the veil had been a part of the culture for a long time and that banning it would be too abrupt a change for many women. Malak called for women to be wary of men who, at first, ordered women to wear a veil and then suddenly ordered them not to for the purpose of their ‘liberation.’ Her views on the veil represented a significant difference between her and other feminists.\n\nMalak wrote extensively about the marital rights of women in Egypt. This issue was one of the feminist issues with which she had significant personal experience. The fact that her husband had two wives caused her to intensely oppose polygamy. In an article entitled “Or Co-Wives”, she deemed polygamy “women’s mortal enemy.” She felt that significant changes must be made with regards to marriage; polygamy must end, men and women must both be able to divorce, and the age at which women marry must increase to at least sixteen. She argued that all of these reforms stem from one central idea: love must be the basis for all marriage. Malak despised the idea of a marriage rooted in economic reasons, of a man marrying a woman simply for her money. She also supported her arguments against early marriage by commenting that women who married early often developed hysteria. Overall, marriage in Egypt was one of the biggest problems for Malak, and she sought drastic reform on this issue.\n\nMalak viewed education reform as one of the most promising solutions to many of the problems that women faced. In her writings, she expressed that any girl that did not have an opportunity to attend and finish school had been treated unjustly. She shared this sentiment with the other feminists of the time. She did not believe, though, that just any education would suffice. She opposed the implementation of missionary schools in Egypt, arguing that “the most ignorant of girls are the graduates of the missionary schools.” Malak called for more Egyptian control over the public education system to create schools that taught girls a more comprehensive curriculum, including history of Egyptian culture.\n\nMalak diverged from others further when she extended her argument and claimed that formal education alone could not solve women’s problems. She believed that much of the women’s injustice resided in the home, that tarbiya, or the process of raising a child, was responsible for a woman’s future. She emphasized the difference between European mothers and Egyptian mothers in caring for their children; Egyptian mothers did not take care of their daughters’ physical health and mental development nearly as well as European mothers did. She argued that mothers must teach their girls to feel empathy for others, to take care of themselves, and to take care of their own children. Malak proposed reforms to better teach religion to girls, to expand schools for female nurses, to increase access to healthcare for women, and to teach hygienic practices. The practice of child rearing was one of the areas in which Malak thought that some Westernization would benefit Egyptian society, but she also believed strongly in the importance of teaching Islam to children. Overall, she believed that most aspects of women’s education needed significant reform.\n\nMalak took action on her views by starting organizations and seeking political action. One aspect of her political activity was connection with women from other countries. She founded the Union for the Education of Women, which brought Egyptian women together with other Arab and European women. Malak later founded an emergency health service based on the Red Cross and a nursing school for women in her own home. She made sure to physically represent the ideals that she supported in her writing.\n\nOne of Malak’s most significant political actions was her presentation of a ten-point program for the improvement of women to the Egyptian Legislative Assembly in 1911. She laid out five points as to how education should be improved: it should have religious orientation; it should be required up to primary school; it should include hygiene, childrearing, first aid, and economics; it should include training for women in nursing and teaching professions; and it should be open to all women for higher studies. She asked for legislation on all of these points. The other five points focused on other women’s rights like marriage age and unveiling. Though this program was ignored by the assembly, it was a major example of a woman taking charge of feminism in a political forum.\n\nMalak died of influenza at the age of 31 on 17 October 1918. Her funeral was attended by an array of feminists and government leaders. On the seventh anniversary of her death, Sha’rawi held another commemoration that included the predominant feminist thinkers Nabawiyya Musa and Mai Ziyada. While she left a powerful legacy and was remembered by all of her contemporaries, her unique feminist perspective died with her, and Sha’rawi became the foremost feminist thinker of the time.\n"}

Supposedly, he was a pupil of Confucius's grandson, Zisi. Like Confucius, according to legend, he travelled throughout China for forty years to offer advice to rulers for reform. During the Warring States period (403–221 BC), Mencius served as an official and scholar at the Jixia Academy in the State of Qi (1046 BC to 221 BC) from 319 to 312 BC. He expressed his filial devotion when he took three years leave of absence from his official duties for Qi to mourn his mother's death. Disappointed at his failure to effect changes in his contemporary world, he retired from public life.\n\nMencius is buried in the \"Mencius Cemetery\" (孟子林, \"Mengzi Lin\", also known as 亞聖林, \"Yasheng Lin\"), which is located 12 km to the northeast of Zoucheng's central urban area. A stele carried by a giant stone tortoise and crowned with dragons stands in front of his grave.\n\nMencius's mother is often held up as an exemplary female figure in Chinese culture. One of the most famous traditional Chinese four-character idioms is (); this saying refers to the legend that Mencius's mother moved houses three times before finding a location that she felt was suitable for the child's upbringing. As an expression, the idiom refers to the importance of finding the proper environment for raising children.\n\nMencius's father died when Mencius was very young. His mother () raised her son alone. They were very poor. At first they lived by a cemetery, where the mother found her son imitating the paid mourners in funeral processions. Therefore, the mother decided to move. The next house was near a market in the town. There the boy began to imitate the cries of merchants (merchants were despised in early China). So the mother moved to a house next to a school. Inspired by the scholars and students, Mencius began to study. His mother decided to remain, and Mencius became a scholar.\n\nAnother story further illustrates the emphasis that Mencius's mother placed on her son's education. As the story goes, once when Mencius was young, he was truant from school. His mother responded to his apparent disregard for his education by taking up a pair of scissors and cutting the cloth she had been weaving in front of him. This was intended to illustrate that one cannot stop a task midway, and her example inspired Mencius to diligence in his studies.\n\nThere is another legend about his mother and his wife, involving a time when his wife was at home alone and was discovered by Mencius not to be sitting properly. Mencius thought his wife had violated a rite, and demanded a divorce. His mother claimed that it was written in The Book of Rites that before a person entered a room, he should announce his imminent presence loudly to let others prepare for his arrival; as he had not done that in this case, the person who had violated the rite was Mencius himself. Eventually Mencius admitted his fault.\n\nShe is one of 125 women of which biographies have been included in the Lienü zhuan ('Biographies of Exemplary Women'), written by Liu Xiang.\n\nDuke Huan of Lu's son through Qingfu (慶父) was the ancestor of Mencius. He was descended from Duke Yang of the State of Lu (魯煬公). Duke Yang was the son of Bo Qin, who was the son of the Duke of Zhou of the Zhou dynasty royal family. The genealogy is found in the Mencius family tree (孟子世家大宗世系).\n\nMencius's descendants lived in Zoucheng in the Mencius Family Mansion, where the Mencius Temple was also built and also a cemetery for Mencius's descendants.\n\nMeng Haoran and Meng Jiao were descendants of Mencius who lived during the Tang dynasty.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty, one of Mencius's descendants was given a hereditary title at the Hanlin Academy by the Emperor. The title they held was Wujing Boshi (五經博士; 五經博士; Wǔjīng Bóshì). In 1452 Wujing Boshi was bestowed upon the offspring of Mengzi-Meng Xiwen (孟希文) 56th generation and Yan Hui-Yan Xihui (顔希惠) 59th generation, the same was bestowed on the offspring of Zhou Dunyi-Zhou Mian (週冕) 12th generation, the two Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi-Chen Keren (程克仁) 17th generation), Zhu Xi-Zhu Ting (朱梴) 9th generation, in 1456–1457, in 1539 the same was awarded to Zeng Can's offspring-Zeng Zhicui (曾質粹) 60th generation, in 1622 the offspring of Zhang Zai received the title and in 1630 the offspring of Shao Yong.\n\nOne of Mencius's direct descendants was Dr. Meng Chih (Anglicised as Dr. Paul Chih Meng) former director of China House, and director of the China Institute in 1944. \"Time\" magazine reported Dr. Meng's age that year as 44. Dr. Meng died in Arizona in 1990 at the age of 90. North Carolina's Davidson College and Columbia University were his alma mater. He was attending a speech along with Confucius descendant H. H. Kung.\n\nIn the Republic of China there is an office called the \"Sacrificial Official to Mencius\" which is held by a descendant of Mencius, like the post of \"Sacrificial Official to Zengzi\" for a descendant of Zengzi, \"Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui\" for a descendant of Yan Hui, and the post of \"Sacrificial Official to Confucius, held by a descendant of Confucius.\n\nThe descendants of Mencius still use generation poems for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors along with the descendants of the other Four Sages (四氏): Confucius, Zengzi, and Yan Hui.\n\nHistorical sites related to his descendants include the Meng family mansion (孟府), Temple of Mencius (孟廟), and Cemetery of Mencius (孟林).\n\nOne of Mencius's descendants moved to Korea and founded the Sinchang Maeng clan.\n\nWhile Confucius himself did not explicitly focus on the subject of human nature, Mencius asserted the innate goodness of the individual, believing that it was society's influence – its lack of a positive cultivating influence – that caused bad moral character. \"He who exerts his mind to the utmost knows his nature\" and \"the way of learning is none other than finding the lost mind.\"\n\nTo show innate goodness, Mencius used the example of a child falling down a well. Witnesses of this event immediately feel \n\nHuman nature has an innate tendency towards goodness, but moral rightness cannot be instructed down to the last detail. This is why merely external controls always fail in improving society. True improvement results from educational cultivation in favorable environments. Likewise, bad environments tend to corrupt the human will. This, however, is not proof of innate evil because a clear thinking person would avoid causing harm to others. This position of Mencius puts him between Confucians such as Xunzi who thought people were innately bad, and Taoists who believed humans did not need cultivation, they just needed to accept their innate, natural, and effortless goodness. The four beginnings/sprouts could grow and develop, or they could fail. In this way Mencius synthesized integral parts of Taoism into Confucianism. Individual effort was needed to cultivate oneself, but one's natural tendencies were good to begin with. The object of education is the cultivation of benevolence, otherwise known as Ren.\n\nAccording to Mencius, education must awaken the innate abilities of the human mind. He denounced memorization and advocated active interrogation of the text, saying, \"One who believes all of a book would be better off without books\" (盡信書，則不如無書, from 孟子.盡心下). One should check for internal consistency by comparing sections and debate the probability of factual accounts by comparing them with experience.\n\nMencius also believed in the power of Destiny in shaping the roles of human beings in society. What is destined cannot be contrived by the human intellect or foreseen. Destiny is shown when a path arises that is both unforeseen and constructive. Destiny should not be confused with Fate. Mencius denied that Heaven would protect a person regardless of his actions, saying, \"One who understands Destiny will not stand beneath a tottering wall\". The proper path is one which is natural and unforced. This path must also be maintained because, \"Unused pathways are covered with weeds.\" One who follows Destiny will live a long and successful life. One who rebels against Destiny will die before his time.\n\nMencius emphasized the significance of the common citizens in the state. While Confucianism generally regards rulers highly, he argued that it is acceptable for the subjects to overthrow or even kill a ruler who ignores the people's needs and rules harshly. This is because a ruler who does not rule justly is no longer a true ruler. Speaking of the overthrow of the wicked King Zhou of Shang, Mencius said, \"I have merely heard of killing a villain Zhou, but I have not heard of murdering [him as] the ruler.\"\n\nThis saying should not be taken as an instigation to violence against authorities but as an application of Confucian philosophy to society. Confucianism requires a clarification of what may be reasonably expected in any given relationship. All relationships should be beneficial, but each has its own principle or inner logic. A Ruler must justify his position by acting benevolently before he can expect reciprocation from the people. In this view, a King is like a steward. Although Confucius admired Kings of great accomplishment, Mencius is clarifying the proper hierarchy of human society. Although a King has presumably higher status than a commoner, he is actually subordinate to the masses of people and the resources of society. Otherwise, there would be an implied disregard of the potential of human society heading into the future. One is significant only for what one gives, not for what one takes.\n\nMencius distinguished between superior men who recognize and follow the virtues of righteousness and benevolence and inferior men who do not. He suggested that superior men considered only righteousness, not benefits. That assumes \"permanent property\" to uphold common morality. To secure benefits for the disadvantaged and the aged, he advocated free trade, low tax rates, and a more equal sharing of the tax burden. \n\nHis alleged years make him contemporary with Xun Zi, Zhuangzi, Gaozi, and Plato.\n\nXun Zi was a Confucian who believed that human nature is centered on self-interest and greed, and the purpose of moral cultivation is to develop our nature into goodness. This put him at odds with Mencius. Later, the thinker Zhu Xi declared the views of Xun Zi to be unorthodox, instead supporting the position of Mencius.\n\nMencius's argument that unjust rulers may be overthrown is reminiscent of Socrates's argument in Book I of Plato's \"Republic\".\n\nMencius's interpretation of Confucianism has generally been considered the orthodox version by subsequent Chinese philosophers, especially by the Neo-Confucians of the Song dynasty. Mencius's disciples included a large number of feudal lords, and he is said to have been more influential than Confucius had been. \n\nThe \"Mencius\" (also spelled \"Mengzi\" or \"Meng-tzu\"), a book of his conversations with kings of the time, is one of the Four Books that Zhu Xi grouped as the core of orthodox Neo-Confucian thought. In contrast to the sayings of Confucius, which are short and self-contained, the \"Mencius\" consists of long dialogues, including arguments, with extensive prose. It was generally neglected by the Jesuit missionaries who first translated the Confucian canon into Latin and other European languages, as they felt that the Neo-Confucian school largely consisted of Buddhist and Taoist contamination of Confucianism. Matteo Ricci also particularly disliked Mencius's strong condemnation of celibacy as unfilial. François Noël, who felt that Zhu's ideas represented a natural and native development of Confucius's thought, was the first to publish a full edition of the \"Mencius\" at Prague in 1711; as the Chinese rites controversy had been recently decided against the Jesuits, however, his edition attained little influence outside central and eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1978 book purporting to estimate the hundred most influential persons in history to that point, Mencius is ranked at 92.\n\n\n"}

Shorto's \"Mon–Khmer Comparative Dictionary\", while a new Proto-Austroasiatic reconstruction is currently being undertaken by Paul Sidwell. Paul Sidwell (2009) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is in the Mekong River region, and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2,000 BCE. \n\nPeiros (2011) criticized Sidwells theory heavily and calls it a bunch of contradictions. He show with his analysis that the homeland of Austroasiatic is somewhere near the Yangtze. He suggests the Sichuan Basin as likely homeland of proto-Austroasiatic before they migrated to other parts of central and southern China and than into Southeast Asia. He further suggests that the family must be as old as proto-Austronesian and proto-Sinotibetan or even older.\n\nA genetic and linguistic research in 2015 about ancient people in East Asia suggest an origin and homeland of Austroasiatic in today southern China or even further north.\n\nThe Proto-Mon–Khmer language is the reconstructed ancestor of the Mon–Khmer languages, a purported primary branch of the Austroasiatic language family. However, Mon–Khmer as a taxon has been abandoned in recent classifications, making Proto-Mon–Khmer synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic; the Munda languages, which are not well documented, and have been restructured through external language contact, have not been included in the reconstructions.\n\nProto-Mon–Khmer as reconstructed by Harry L. Shorto (2006) has a total of 21 consonants, 7 distinct vowels, which can be lengthened and glottalized, and 3 diphthongs.\n\nProto-Mon–Khmer is rich in vowels. The vowels are:\n\nThe diphthongs are:\n\nPaul Sidwell and Felix Rau (2015) propose the following syllable structure for Proto-Austroasiatic.\n\nAlso possible are more complex forms with prefixes and infixes, as well as presyllable “coda-copying” from main syllables.\n\nSidwell & Rau (2015) reconstruct 21-22 Proto-Austroasiatic consonants (the reconstruction of *ʄ is uncertain).\n\nAll of the Proto-Austroasiatic consonants except for implosives and voiced stops can occur as syllable finals (C).\n\nAll of the Proto-Austroasiatic unvoiced stops and voiced stops, as well as *m-, *N-, *r-, *l-, and *s-, can occur as presyllables or sesquisyllables (C).\n\nMedial consonants (C) are *-w -, *-r -, *-l -, *-j -, and *-h-.\n\nSidwell & Rau (2015) reconstructs 8 Proto-Austroasiatic vowels, for which there is vowel length contrast. A long vowel will be appended with triangular colon (ː) instead of doubling.\nProto-Austroasiatic diphthongs are *iə and *uə, and possibly *ie and *uo.\n\nCommon structures include *CV(C) and *CCV(C) roots. *CVC roots can also be affixed either via prefixes or infixes, as in *C-CVC or *CVC (Shorto 2006). Sidwell (2008) gives the following phonological shapes for two types of stems.\n\n\n\"Note\": R is one of the optional medial consonants /r, l, j, w, h/.\n\nSidwell (2008) considers the two most morphologically conservative Mon–Khmer branches to be Khmuic and Aslian. On the other hand, Vietnamese morphology is far more similar to that of Chinese and the Tai languages and has lost many morphological features found in Proto-Mon–Khmer.\n\nThe following Proto-Mon–Khmer affixes, which are still tentative, have been reconstructed by Paul Sidwell (Sidwell 2008:257-263).\n\n\nRoger Blench (2012) notes that Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan share many similarities regarding word structure, particularly nominal affixes (otherwise known as sesquisyllables or minor syllable prefixes). Blench (2012) does not make any definitive conclusions about how these similarities could have arisen, but suggests that this typological diffusion might have come about as a result of intensive contact in an area between northern Vietnam, Laos, and northeast Myanmar.\n\nLike the Tai languages, Proto-Mon–Khmer has an SVO, or verb-medial, order. Proto-Mon–Khmer also makes use of noun classifiers and serial verb constructions (Shorto 2006).\n\nHowever, Paul Sidwell (2018) suggests that Proto-Austroasiatic may have in fact been verb-initial, with SVO order occurring in Indochina due to convergence in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area. Various modern-day Austroasiatic languages display verb-initial word order, including Pnar and Wa (Jenny 2015). Nicobarese also displays verb-initial word order.\n\nProto-Austroasiatic personal pronouns as follows, with reconstructions from Sidwell & Rau (2015).\nThe following Proto-Austroasiatic lexical proto-forms have been reconstructed by Sidwell & Rau (2015:340-363), and correspond to the 100-item Swadesh list.\n\nAustroasiatic branch-level reconstructions include:\n\nPaul Sidwell (2018) considers the Austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4,000 years B.P. during the arrival of rice agriculture in Indochina, but notes that the origin of Proto-Austroasiatic itself is older than that date. The lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum. The early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts, animal names, natural features, and pronouns, while the names of cultural items (agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts, which are reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic) form part of the later stratum.\n\nIntegrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings, Paul Sidwell (2015) further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into Indochina from the Lingnan area of southern China, with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China. Sidwell (2015) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years B.P. during the Neolithic transition era of mainland Southeast Asia, with all the major branches of Austroasiatic formed by 4,000 B.P. Austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the Pearl River watershed of Lingnan, which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of Vietnam, or downstream through the Mekong River via Yunnan. Both the reconstructed lexicon of Proto-Austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early Austroasiatic speakers around 4,000 B.P. cultivated rice and millet, kept livestock such dogs, pigs, and chickens, and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments. At 4,500 B.P., this \"Neolithic package\" suddenly arrived in Indochina from the Lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, with grain husks found in northern Indochina by 4,100 B.P. and in southern Indochina by 3,800 B.P. However, Sidwell (2015) found that iron is not reconstructable in Proto-Austroasiatic, since each Austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from Tai, Chinese, Tibetan, Malay, and other languages. During the Iron Age about 2,500 B.P., relatively young Austroasiatic branches in Indochina such as Vietic, Katuic, Pearic, and Khmer were formed, while the more internally diverse Bahnaric branch (dating to about 3,000 B.P.) underwent more extensive internal diversification. By the Iron Age, all of the Austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present-day locations, with most of the diversification within Austroasiatic taking place during the Iron Age.\n\nRoger Blench (2017) suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies (such as boats, waterways, river fauna, and fish capture techniques), can be reconstructed for Proto-Austroasiatic. Blench (2017) finds widespread Austroasiatic roots for 'river, valley', 'boat', 'fish', 'catfish sp.', 'eel', 'prawn', 'shrimp' (Central Austroasiatic), 'crab', 'tortoise', 'turtle', 'otter', 'crocodile', 'heron, fishing bird', and 'fish trap'. Archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern Indochina (northern Vietnam, Laos, and other nearby areas) dates back to only about 4,000 years B.P. (2,000 B.C.), with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the Yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6,000 B.P. Hence, this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of Austroasiatic as compared to Sino-Tibetan, whose speakers had a distinct non-riverine culture. In addition to living an aquatic-based lifestyle, early Austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock, crops, and newer types of watercraft. As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "299609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299609", "title": "Psychological projection", "text": "Psychological projection\n\nPsychological projection is a theory in psychology in which the human ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude. It incorporates blame shifting. \n\nA prominent precursor in the formulation of the projection principle was Giambattista Vico. In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first enlightenment thinker to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion. The Babylonian Talmud (500 AD) notes the human tendency toward projection and warns against it: \"Do not taunt your neighbour with the bleach you yourself drank.\"\n\nProjection () was conceptualised by Sigmund Freud in his letters to Wilhelm Fliess, and further refined by Karl Abraham and Anna Freud. Freud considered that, in projection, thoughts, motivations, desires, and feelings that cannot be accepted as one's own are dealt with by being placed in the outside world and attributed to someone else. What the ego repudiates is split off and placed in another.\n\nFreud would later come to believe that projection did not take place arbitrarily, but rather seized on and exaggerated an element that already existed on a small scale in the other person. (The related defence of projective identification differs from projection in that there the other person is expected to become identified with the impulse or desire projected outside, so that the self maintains a connection with what is projected, in contrast to the total repudiation of projection proper.)\n\nMelanie Klein saw the projection of good parts of the self as leading potentially to over-idealisation of the object. Equally, it may be one's conscience that is projected, in an attempt to escape its control: a more benign version of this allows one to come to terms with outside authority.\n\nProjection tends to come to the fore in normal people at times of personal or political crisis but is more commonly found in the neurotic or psychotic in personalities functioning at a primitive level as in narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder.\n\nCarl Jung considered that the unacceptable parts of the personality represented by the Shadow archetype were particularly likely to give rise to projection, both small-scale and on a national/international basis. Marie-Louise Von Franz extended her view of projection, stating that \"wherever known reality stops, where we touch the unknown, there we project an archetypal image\".\n\nPsychological projection is one of the medical explanations of bewitchment used to explain the behavior of the afflicted children at Salem in 1692. The historian John Demos asserts that the symptoms of bewitchment experienced by the afflicted girls were due to the girls undergoing psychological projection of repressed aggression.\n\n\nJung wrote, \"All projections provoke counter-projection when the object is unconscious of the quality projected upon it by the subject.\" Thus, what is unconscious in the recipient will be projected back onto the projector, precipitating a form of mutual acting out.\n\nIn a rather different usage, Harry Stack Sullivan saw counter-projection in the therapeutic context as a way of warding off the compulsive re-enactment of a psychological trauma, by emphasizing the difference between the current situation and the projected obsession with the perceived perpetrator of the original trauma.\n\nDrawing on Gordon Allport's idea of the expression of self onto activities and objects, projective techniques have been devised to aid personality assessment, including the Rorschach ink-blots and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT).\n\nProjection may help a fragile ego reduce anxiety, but at the cost of a certain dissociation, as in dissociative identity disorder. In extreme cases, an individual's personality may end up becoming critically depleted. In such cases, therapy may be required which would include the slow rebuilding of the personality through the \"taking back\" of such projections.\n\nSome studies were critical of Freud's theory. Research supports the existence of a false-consensus effect whereby humans have a broad tendency to believe that others are similar to themselves, and thus \"project\" their personal traits onto others. This applies to good traits as well as bad traits and is not a defense mechanism for denying the existence of the trait within the self.\n\nInstead, Newman, Duff, and Baumeister (1997) proposed a new model of defensive projection. In this view, repressors try to suppress thoughts of their undesirable traits, and these efforts make those trait categories highly accessible—so that they are then used all the more often when forming impressions of others. The projection is then only a by-product of the real defensive mechanism.\n"}

This oracle may simply be a divinatory technique, such as the \"I Ching\", that is manipulated by the querents themselves without recourse to any other human agency. Alternatively it may involve another person, someone perhaps seen as a \"fortune teller\" – particularly a practitioner of tarot reading or other form of mediumship – from whom advice is sought.\n\nThe kinds of questions asked by querents may vary widely according to their needs, and the methodology of the divination system. Some querents seek general advice trusting that they will be told what is most pertinent to their present situation. Others will ask questions that are only slightly more direct such as, \"Will I be rich?\" and \"What kind of person will I marry?\" Still others seek specific advice, although opinions are divided amongst practitioners of various divinatory arts as to what constitutes a 'good' question: some say that questions in the form of \"What would be likely to happen if I followed course of action X?\" are potentially more useful to a querent than \"Should I follow course of action X?\". Yes-and-no questions are not always best because of the finality they represent, and usually most querents are after far more than just yes and no.\n\nThe mindset of a querent plays a significant role in the development of a clear and dynamic reading. Those who approach a reading with heavy skepticism, especially if they are dealing with a human oracle, are often unwilling to engage the reader at all, which can result in a stifling of the prophetic flow that is so intrinsic to divination. Conversely, some approach with great respect, as if they predetermine that the Diviner or the system of divination is influence by some kind of higher, even divine, power and thereby will believe virtually anything they are told. A third ideal group will talk freely with a human oracle and accept their advice with a healthy dose of skepticism, yet still remain open-minded to the possibility of revelation.\n\nThese querent attitudes often stem from their personal beliefs concerning spirituality and the nature of the particular oracular system they are consulting. Common theories that inform these attitudes divide generally into three classes:\n\n"}

{"id": "1364760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1364760", "title": "Surzhyk", "text": "Surzhyk\n\nSurzhyk (, ) refers to a range of mixed (macaronic) sociolects of Ukrainian and Russian languages used in certain regions of Ukraine and adjacent lands. There is no unifying set of characteristics; the term is used for \"norm-breaking, non-obedience to or non-awareness of the rules of the Ukrainian and Russian standard languages\".\n\nThe Ukrainian word \"surzhyk\" originally meant flour or bread made from mixed grains, e.g. wheat with rye.\n\nThe vocabulary mix of each of its constituent languages (Ukrainian and Russian) varies greatly from locality to locality, or sometimes even from person to person, depending on the degree of education, personal experience, rural or urban residence, the geographical origin of the interlocutors, etc. The percentage of Russian words and phonetic influences tends to be greatest in the east and south and in the vicinity of big Russian-speaking cities. It is commonly spoken in most of eastern Ukraine's rural areas, with the exception of the large metropolitan areas of Donetsk, Kharkiv, Luhansk, and especially Crimea, where the majority of the population uses standard Russian. In rural areas of western Ukraine, the language spoken contains fewer Russian elements than in central and eastern Ukraine but has nonetheless been influenced by Russian.\n\nThe ancient common origin, and relatively recent divergence, of Russian and Ukrainian make it difficult to establish the degree of mixing in a vernacular of this sort.\n\nAccording to data presented by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in 2003, 11% to 18% of the people of Ukraine were found to communicate in Surzhyk. Specifically, in western Ukraine, Surzhyk is spoken by 2.5% of the population, while in the south, it is spoken by over 12.4% of the population. In the east, 9.6% of the population speaks Surzhyk. As Western Ukraine has a higher ratio of Ukrainian speakers to Russian speakers than the rest of Ukraine, the lesser proportion of Surzhyk speakers compared with the east and south is understandable.\n\nOne problem in analysing the linguistic status of Ukraine is that there is a tendency for code-mixing errors to exist across the entire spectrum of languages. In other words, those who identify themselves as Russian-speaking or Ukrainian-speaking can often be found blending the two languages to some degree. Only a few of these individuals were found to acknowledge the incorrectness of the use of either or both languages, or the fact that they were actually blending Russian and Ukrainian in their speech at all.\n\nSurzhyk originated at the end of the 18th century, when Ukrainian peasants started to have greater contact with the Russian language as Ukrainian society modernized. Industrialization resulted in workers migrating from Central Russia to Ukrainian cities and the urbanization of the Ukrainian peasantry. Russian civil and military administration, together with cultural, business, religious and educational institutions, soon became forces of linguistic Russification. Ukrainian peasants moving to the cities regarded Russian as being more urban and prestigious than their own language. However, because their schooling in the Russian language was inadequate, most Ukrainian peasants who strived to speak it ended up blending it with their native Ukrainian; this was how Surzhyk was born.\n\nThe speaking of pure Ukrainian (i.e. a language without elements of Russian), was for the most part avoided by the urban intelligentsia, because the Ukrainian language was associated with provincialism and nationalism. At this point, the majority of Ukrainians found it easy to become competent in Russian. The association of the Ukrainian language with a rural lifestyle or narrow-minded nationalism encouraged more Ukrainians to adopt Russian as their language of choice. Such decisions led to an increased prevalence of Surzhyk in everyday speech and the further dilution of the Ukrainian language.\n\nIn 1721, the Russian Tsar Peter I decreed that the publication of books in Ukraine, except for Russian-language religious works, would be prohibited, and Ukrainian books and records were to be burned. In 1786, it was decreed that services in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church were to be conducted using only the Russian pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic, and not the Ukrainian pronunciation. Decrees in 1863, 1876, and 1881 prohibited the publication and importation of Ukrainian books, as well as the public use of the Ukrainian language in general. The Russian regime of the day viewed the use of Ukrainian as evidence of political opposition and harshly suppressed it.\n\nThe use of the Ukrainian language in theatre and music was also banned, and it had to be translated into other languages. Education in the Ukrainian language also suffered similarly, with ethnically Ukrainian teachers being replaced with ethnic Russians. In the early 1900s, children were punished for speaking Ukrainian to each other in school, and people sometimes lost their jobs for speaking it.\n\nAustrian and Hungarian rule in western Ukraine in the late 1700s and 1800s was also linguistically oppressive. For example, in Zakarpattia, Hungarian was the only language permitted by the regime, so Ukrainian was excluded from institutions like schools. Even so, language policies here were not as restrictive as those applied in eastern Ukraine by the Tsarist regime of Russia.\n\nIn the 1920s, after Ukraine became a part of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian language saw a revival under the Soviet policy of \"korenizatsiya\" (nativisation), which supported the development of non-Russian languages. The purpose was to gain the support of those ethnic groups that had been oppressed by the Tsarist regime. Soviet government business in Ukraine was conducted in the Ukrainian language, with the aim of integrating the Ukrainian people into the new Soviet system. This Ukrainianisation brought with it a significant advance in the development, standardisation, and codification of the Ukrainian language. Accompanying it was an increase in the number of Ukrainian-language publications, as well as theatre productions and schools in which Ukrainian was used.\n\nFrom the 1930s onwards, the Russian language exerted significant influence on Ukrainian, and the regime of Joseph Stalin began to actively suppress the Ukrainian language. Along with many of the other languages spoken in the Soviet Union, Ukrainian was viewed as a challenge to centralised power and the linguistic unification of the Soviet people. Terminology and wording that was similar or identical to Russian was emphasized in dictionaries, grammar books, and the official guidance issued to editors and publishers. This resulted in a generally more Russianised Ukrainian than had existed prior to the Soviet Union. After Ukraine became independent, this outcome would eventually generate disagreement regarding the question of what constitutes pure Ukrainian.\n\nWords and other Ukrainian-language speech forms that are similar to those of Russian were emphasised. In addition, many Russian words or terms replaced their Ukrainian equivalents and were then modified by Ukrainian grammar and phonetics. The following table contains a few examples of how the Ukrainian language was changed during the Soviet era. \n\nMembers of the cultural elite who promoted local languages were later purged from positions of authority during the reign of Stalin, as part of an effort to strengthen the cohesion of the Soviet Union and promote Russian as the official language of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of Ukraine as a sovereign state, the Ukrainian language became a key issue in the nation's politics. Ukrainian became Ukraine’s sole official language, and therefore the ability to master it in speech became an important skill for politicians and other prominent figures. Many such individuals were speakers of Russian who began to use Ukrainian, but because they had not perfected it another form of Surzhyk emerged which clearly showed the effect of Russification on the Ukrainian language. Linguists began to engage in debates over the 'correct' way to speak Ukrainian, because the Soviet language policies had had a profound effect on the Ukrainian language. On the one hand, some linguists argue that Ukrainian should only use the forms that existed prior to the Soviet Union, while others argue that the current forms, which emerged from the Soviet language policy, are more up-to-date and more familiar to the Ukrainians of today, and would therefore be better at meeting contemporary needs.\n\nIn Soviet times, the usage of Ukrainian gradually decreased, particularly during those times when the Russification policies intensified (i.e. in the 1930s and during the late 1970s to early 1980s), and so a sizable portion of ethnic Ukrainians possess a better knowledge of formal Russian than they do formal Ukrainian. Since 1991, however, Ukrainian has been the sole official language. After this change, it was realised that much of the population of Ukraine was actually unable to speak Ukrainian fluently. This was highly apparent in the case of many Ukrainian officials (including the President of Ukraine), who were observed to make code-mixing mistakes in their speech. \n\nThe prevalence of Surzhyk is greatest in the countryside. In the cities, people tend to speak purer forms of Ukrainian or Russian. This contrasts with the more rural inhabitants, who lack the prestige associated with the educational and technological advantages that people in the cities have. However, in spite of the differences that exist between the rural and urban varieties of the spoken language, many visitors find that they have trouble communicating with the local population of Ukraine when they follow guidebooks published abroad. This is because these books tend to focus on either pure Russian or pure Ukrainian and disregard the hybrid form.\n\nThe speaking of Surzhyk instead of Russian or Ukrainian is viewed negatively by nationalist language activists. Because it is neither the one nor the other, they regard Surzhyk as a threat to the uniqueness of Ukrainian culture.\n\nNikolai Gogol used the language extensively in his short story collection \"Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka\". Surzhyk has been an object of parody in Ukrainian literature since the very emergence of the Ukrainian language. For example, in the 1798 poem \"Eneyida\", written by Ivan Kotlyarevsky and based on the Roman poem known as the \"Aeneid\", for satirical purposes the character \"Filozop\" speaks Surzhyk while standing over the dead Pallas.\n\nSurzhyk is often also used for comic effect in the arts. Examples include the short plays of Les Poderviansky, and the repertoire of the pop star Verka Serdyuchka. The punk-rock group Braty Hadyukiny (literally \"Brothers Viperids\") sings many of its songs in Surzhyk, often to underscore the rural simplicity of its songs' protagonists.\n\n\nDel Gaudio S.

Pretending to be factual, the book does not name the creator of the language; both More and Giles have been alternately credited, with Giles often thought to have designed the alphabet.\n\nAlthough some words in Utopian show different forms corresponding to different cases in the Latin translation, there is no evidence of a consistent relationship between form and meaning, as can be seen from the following comparison of the nominal, pronominal, and adjectival case forms:\n\nThere are only four verbs in the Utopian poem, and these also show no evidence of a correspondence between form and function:\n\nUtopian has its own 22-letter alphabet, with letters based on the shapes of the circle, square, and triangle.

Uyghur, a Turkic language spoken primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region features both vowel harmony and some vowel reduction also plays a role.\n\nUyghur vowels are by default short, but some phonologists have argued that long vowels also exist because of historical vowel assimilation (above) and through loanwords. Underlyingly long vowels would resist vowel reduction and devoicing, introduce non-final stress, and be analyzed as |Vj| or |Vr| before a few suffixes. However, the conditions in which they are actually pronounced as distinct from their short counterparts have not been fully researched.\n\nOfficial Uyghur orthographies do not mark vowel length, and also do not distinguish between (e.g., بىلىم 'knowledge') and back (e.g., تىلىم 'my language'); these two sounds are in complementary distribution, but phonological analyses claim that they play a role in vowel harmony and are separate phonemes.\n\nThe high vowels , , and are devoiced in non-stressed positions when they occur between two voiceless consonants, or in word-initial position before a voiceless consonant: e.g. \"uka\" 'older brother', \"pütün\" 'entire', \"ikki\" .\n\nUyghur has two processes of systematic vowel reduction (or vowel raising):\nThe former process is applied before the latter; As with other phenomena, long vowels are exempt. For example:\n\nUyghur, like other Turkic languages, displays vowel harmony. Words usually agree in vowel backness, but compounds, loans, and some other exceptions often break vowel harmony. Suffixes surface with the rightmost [back] value in the stem, and /e, ɪ/ are transparent (as they don't contrast for backness). Uyghur also has rounding harmony.\n\nUyghur voiceless stops are aspirated word-initially and intervocalically. The pairs , , , and alternate, with the voiced member devoicing in syllable-final position, except in word-initial syllables. This devoicing process is usually reflected in the official orthography, but an exception has been recently made for certain Perso-Arabic loans. Voiceless phonemes do not become voiced in standard Uyghur.\n\nSuffixes display a slightly different type of consonant alternation. The phonemes and anywhere in a suffix alternate as governed by vowel harmony, where occurs with front vowels and with back ones. Devoicing of a suffix-initial consonant can occur only in the cases of → , → , and → , when the preceding consonant is voiceless. Lastly, the rule that must occur with front vowels and with back vowels can be broken when either or in suffix-initial position becomes assimilated by the other due to the preceding consonant being such. \n\nStops and affricates lenite when preceding a dissimilar consonant. goes to , to , to , and to . goes to in word-initial syllables, but in non-initial syllables, and behave like their unvoiced equivalents and go to and respectively. These changes are not reflected in orthography, except when lenites to or as <w>. Similarly, tends to become before another consonant. Lenition also occurs in certain intervocalic contexts, e.g. lenites to and as (not marked).\n\nUyghur displays vocalic assimilation, atypical among Turkic languages. Syllable-final , , and are optionally assimilated to the preceding vowel which is lengthened, in the case of e and u, made lower and less tense; e.g., \"xelqler\" ‘the nations’. However, this never occurs when and are word final. This phenomenon occurs most common in colloquial speech, but is often avoided when reciting, reading, or singing. As a result, Uyghur speakers often hypercorrect by inserting an after a long vowel where there is no phonemic , especially after attaching a vowel-initial suffix (e.g. \"bina\" 'building', \"binarim\" or \"binayim\" 'my building'). In addition, although this is not represented orthographically, a few cases of \"r-deletion\" have been lexicalized, such as تۆت \"töt\" ('four').\n\nLoan phonemes have influenced Uyghur to various degrees. and were borrowed from Arabic and have been nativized, while from Persian less so. only exists in very recent Russian and Chinese loans, since Perso-Arabic (and older Russian and Chinese) became Uyghur . Perso-Arabic loans have also made the contrast between and phonemic, as they occur as allophones in native words, the former set near front vowels and the latter near a back vowels. Some speakers of Uyghur distinguish from in Russian loans, but this is not represented in most orthographies. Other phonemes occur natively only in limited contexts, i.e. only in few interjections, , , and rarely initially, and only morpheme-final. Therefore, the pairs *, *, and * do not alternate.\n\nThe primary syllable structure of Uyghur is CV(C)(C). Uyghur syllable structure is usually CV or CVC, but CVCC can also occur in some words. When syllable-coda clusters occur, CC tends to become CVC in some speakers especially if the first consonant is not a sonorant. In Uyghur, any consonant phoneme can occur as the syllable onset or coda, except for which only occurs in the onset and , which never occurs word-initially. In general, Uyghur phonology tends to simplify phonemic consonant clusters by means of elision and epenthesis.\n\n"}
