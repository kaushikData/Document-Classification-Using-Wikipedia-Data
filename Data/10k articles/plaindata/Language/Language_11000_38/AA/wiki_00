His first job (1960–62) was directing the campaign against sleeping sickness in Angola. He returned to Portugal and from 1974 to 1982 was a cardiologist at Centro Hospitalar das Caldas da Rainha, as well as working in other hospitals such as the Hospital de Santa Maria, Lisbon. He was a Member of Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia and the European Society of Cardiology. He was the brother of John Claro Fernandes, who became a noted Tiatr writer and director.\n\nFernandes's most famous work is the Portuguese-language novel \"Bodki\" (1962). In the words of Everton V. Machado,\n\nThe constant clash between modern convictions of the elite raised in a Christian environment and the popular beliefs among the lower social strata of Goa must be re-emphasized within the set of Indo-Portuguese themes, as is very clearly illustrated in the novel \"Bodki\" ...

{"id": "677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=677", "title": "Ambiguity", "text": "Ambiguity\n\nAmbiguity is a type of meaning in which several interpretations are plausible. A common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The \"ambi-\" part of the term reflects an idea of \"two\", as in \"two meanings\".)\n\nThe concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.\n\nContext may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.\n\nThe lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. \"Meaning\" here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word \"bank\" has several distinct lexical definitions, including \"financial institution\" and \"edge of a river\". Or consider \"apothecary\". One could say \"I bought herbs from the apothecary\". This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary (pharmacist) or went to the apothecary (pharmacy).\n\nThe context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says \"I buried $100 in the bank\", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.\n\nLexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as word sense disambiguation.\n\nThe use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose \"weasel words\" and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science.\n\nMore problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. \"Good\", for example, can mean \"useful\" or \"functional\" (\"That's a good hammer\"), \"exemplary\" (\"She's a good student\"), \"pleasing\" (\"This is good soup\"), \"moral\" (\"a good person\" versus \"the lesson to be learned from a story\"), \"righteous\", etc. \" I have a good daughter\" is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity (\"unlockable\" can mean \"capable of being unlocked\" or \"impossible to lock\").\n\nSyntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax. This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. \"He ate the cookies on the couch\", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies. \"To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license.\" This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license. Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher. Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.\nFor the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, formal languages (such as computer programming languages), see Ambiguous grammar.\n\nSpoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For example, \"ice cream\" and \"I scream\". Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a mondegreen.\n\nSemantic ambiguity happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase—a word or phrase that has more than one meaning. In \"We saw her duck\" (example due to Richard Nordquist), the word \"duck\" can refer either\n\nLexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness.\n\nLinguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law, because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.\n\nPhilosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, \"I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth\", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after \"taxes\" (to convey the first sense) or by changing \"which\" to \"that\" (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true – an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.\n\nIn continental philosophy (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. Martin Heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.[3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work Being and Nothingness an \"essay in phenomenological ontology\" Jean-Paul Sartre follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. Simone de Beauvoir tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: \"as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.\" Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: \"Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting\". Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.\n\nIn literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool. Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: \"Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know\". Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" (where \"blue\" can refer to the color, or to sadness).\n\nIn the narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel \"The Great Gatsby\".\n\nChristianity and Judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Many Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.[dubious – discuss] The orthodox Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases. (The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox.)\n\nMetonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or jargon, for the name of the whole object (for example \"wheels\" to refer to a car, or \"flowers\" to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern vocabulary, critical semiotics,[9] metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as \"sweet ride\" to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humor.\n\nIn music, pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some polytonality, polymeter, other ambiguous meters or rhythms, and ambiguous phrasing, or (Stein 2005, p. 79) any aspect of music. The music of Africa is often purposely ambiguous. To quote Sir Donald Francis Tovey (1935, p. 195), \"Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.\"\n\nIn visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the Necker cube, which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called multistable perception.\nThe opposite of such ambiguous images are impossible objects.\n\nPictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?\n\nSome languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially lexical ambiguity. Lojban and Loglan are two related languages which have been created for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.\n\nIn computer science, the SI prefixes kilo-, mega- and giga- were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 (1024, 1024 and 1024) contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion. This usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices (e.g. DRAM) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense.\n\nSubsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that binary prefixes could be written explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G \"unambiguous\" in texts conforming to the new standard — this led to a \"new\" ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes (necessarily indicating the new style) as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous (old style) or not (new style). Note also that 1 M (where M is ambiguously 1,000,000 or 1,048,576) is \"less\" uncertain than the engineering value 1.0e6 (defined to designate the interval 950,000 to 1,050,000), and that as non-volatile storage devices began to commonly exceed 1 GB in capacity (where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit), GB and TB almost always mean 10 and 10 bytes.\n\nMathematical notation, widely used in physics and other sciences, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several lexical, syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain.\n\nThe ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function, which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several special functions still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:\n\nAmbiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.\nIt is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, formula_1. Then, if one sees formula_2, there is no way to distinguish whether it means formula_1 multiplied by formula_4, or function formula_5 evaluated at argument equal to formula_4. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.\n\nCreators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages (C++ and Fortran) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The Wolfram Language used in Mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression f=f(x) is qualified as an error.\n\nThe order of operations may depend on the context. In most programming languages, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, formula_7 is interpreted as formula_8; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.\nSometimes, one uses \"italics\" letters to denote elementary functions.\nIn the scientific journal style, the expression\nformula_9\nmeans\nproduct of variables\nformula_10,\nformula_11,\nformula_12 and\nformula_13, although in a slideshow, it may mean formula_14.\n\nA comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.\nIf it is written formula_15, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables\nformula_16, formula_12 and formula_18, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.\nThe writing of formula_15 instead of formula_20 may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.\n\nSubscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in formula_21.\nformula_22, which could be understood to mean either formula_23 or formula_24. In addition, formula_25 may mean formula_26, as formula_27 means formula_28 (see tetration).\n\nformula_29, which by convention means formula_30, though it might be thought to mean formula_31, since formula_32 means formula_33.\n\nformula_34, which arguably should mean formula_35 but would commonly be understood to mean formula_36 .\n\nIt is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with formula_37 and states with fixed number of photons with formula_38. Then, there is an \"unwritten rule\": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and formula_39photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if formula_40 is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and formula_41 means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on quantum mechanics. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized adimensional, dimensionless variables are used. Expression formula_42 may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.\n\nSome physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even dimension, as in the case of the Einstein coefficients), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like Ludwig Wittgenstein states in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus: \"... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\"\n\nA highly confusing term is \"gain\". For example, the sentence \"the gain of a system should be doubled\", without context, means close to nothing.\nIt may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.\nIt may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.\nIt may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).\n\nThe term \"intensity\" is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of irradiance, luminous intensity, radiant intensity, or radiance, depending on the background of the person using the term.\n\nAlso, confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant, or resolution of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also Accuracy and precision and its talk.\n\nThe Berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as \"definable\" or \"nameable\". Terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal.\n\nIn mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of underdetermination—for example, formula_43 leaves open what the value of \"X\" is—while its opposite is a self-contradiction, also called inconsistency, paradoxicalness, or oxymoron, or in mathematics an inconsistent system—such as formula_44, which has no solution.\n\nLogical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects, such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of M. C. Escher.\n\n\n\n"}

Also in 1992, the first detailed policy analysis of the issue was convened by the Cuyahoga County Planning Commission. The United States Environmental Protection Agency selected Cuyahoga County as its first brownfield pilot project in September 1993.\nThe term applies more generally to previously used land or to sections of industrial or commercial facilities that are to be upgraded.\n\nBrownfield land is an area of land previously used or built upon, as opposed to greenfield land, which has never been built upon. It is a term used in urban planning to describe land within certain legal exclusions and additions, which was previously used for industrial or commercial purposes, where its expansion, redevelopment or reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.\n\nLand that is more severely contaminated and has high concentrations of hazardous waste or pollution, such as a Superfund site, does not fall under the brownfield classification. \"Mothballed brownfields\" are properties that the owners are not willing to transfer or put to productive reuse.\n\nBrownfield status is a legal designation which places restrictions, conditions or incentives on redevelopment and use on the site.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term 'brownfield' has a colloquial meaning roughly equivalent to the American usage described above, i.e. vacant or derelict land or property, usually industrial in nature. In terms of British Town and Country Planning, however, the meaning of 'brownfield' is more complex, and is often conflated with the technical term 'previously developed land' (PDL). PDL was originally defined in planning policy for housing development in England and Wales, and was carefully distinguished in such policy from 'brownfield', which was undefined but considered to be different. The definition from the 2012 National Planning Policy Guidance, which only applies to England, uses the terms 'brownfield' and 'previously developed land' interchangeably:\n\"Land which is or was occupied by a permanent structure, including the curtilage of the developed land (although it should not be assumed that the whole of the curtilage should be developed) and any associated fixed surface infrastructure. This excludes: \n\nGenerally, brownfield sites exist in a city's or town's industrial section, on locations with abandoned factories or commercial buildings, or other previously polluting operations like steel mills, refineries or landfills.\nSmall brownfields also may be found in older residential neighborhoods, as for example dry cleaning establishments or gas stations produced high levels of subsurface contaminants.\n\nTypical contaminants found on contaminated brownfield land include hydrocarbon spillages, solvents, pesticides, heavy metals such as lead (e.g., paints), tributyl tins, and asbestos. Old maps may assist in identifying areas to be tested.\n\nThe primary issue facing all nations involved in attracting and sustaining new uses to brownfield sites is that industries are globally oriented and respond to global market forces. This directly affects brownfield reuse, such as limiting the effective economic life of the use on the revitalized sites.\n\nUnited States estimates suggest there are over 500,000 brownfield sites contaminated at levels below the Superfund caliber (the most contaminated) in the country. While historic land use patterns created contaminated sites, the Superfund law has been criticized as creating the \"brownfield phenomenon\" where investment moves to greenfields for new development due to severe, no-fault liability schemes and other disincentives. The Clinton-Gore administration and US EPA launched a series of brownfield policies and programs in 1993 to tackle this problem.\n\nCanada has an estimated 200,000 \"contaminated sites\" across the nation. Canada had about 23,078 federally contaminated sites, from abandoned mines, to airports, lighthouse stations, and military bases, which are classified into N 1,2,or 3, depending on a score of contamination, with 5,300 active contaminated sites, 2,300 suspected sites and 15,000 listed as closed because remediated or no action was necessary.\n\nThe provincial governments have primary responsibility for brownfields. The provinces´ legal mechanisms for managing risk are limited, as there are no tools such as \"No Further Action\" letters to give property owners finality and certainty in the cleanup and reuse process. Yet, Canada has cleaned up sites and attracted investment to contaminated lands such as the Moncton rail yards. A strip of the Texaco lands in Mississauga is slated to be part of the Waterfront Trail. However, Imperial Oil has no plans to sell the property which has been vacant since the 1980s.\n\nAccording to their 2014 report on federally contaminated sites, the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimated that the \"total liability for remediating Canada’s contaminated sites reported in the public accounts [was] $4.9 billion.\" The report listed significant sites called the Big Five with a liability of $1.8 billion: Faro mine, Colomac Mine, Giant Mine, Cape Dyer-DEW line and Goose Bay Air Base. The Port Hope, Ontario site has a liability of $1 billion. Port Hope has the largest volume of historic low-level radioactive wastes in Canada, resulting from \"radium and uranium processing in Port Hope between 1933 and 1988 by the former Crown corporation Eldorado Nuclear Limited and its private sector predecessors. By 2010 it was projected that it would cost well over a billion dollars for the soil remediation project, it was the largest such cleanup in Canadian history. The effort is projected to be complete in 2022. In July 2015 the $86,847,474 contract \"to relocate the historic low-level radioactive waste and marginally contaminated soils from an existing waste management facility on the shoreline of Lake Ontario to the new, state-of-the-art facility about a kilometre north of the current site.\" was undertaken. There is also \"$1.8 billion for general inventory sites\" and \"$200 million for other sites.\" The same report claimed the inventory currently lists 24,990 contaminated sites.\"\nThe federal government exercises some control over environmental protection, the \"provincial and territorial governments issue the bulk of legislation regarding\ncontaminated sites.\" Under the Shared-Responsibility Contaminated Sites Policy Framework (2005), the government may provide funding for the remediation of nonfederal sites, if the contamination is related to federal government activities or national security. See Natural Resources Canada (2012)\n\nWhile Denmark lacks the large land base which creates the magnitude of brownfield issues facing countries such as Germany and the U.S., brownfield sites in areas critical to the local economies of Denmark’s cities require sophisticated solutions and careful interaction with affected communities. Examples include the cleanup and redevelopment of former and current ship building facilities along Copenhagen’s historic waterfront. Laws in Denmark require a higher degree of coordination of planning and reuse than is found in many other countries.\n\nIn France, brownfields are called \"friches industrielles\" and the Ministère de l'Écologie, du Développement Durable et de l'Énergie (MEDDE) maintains a database of polluted sites named BASOL, with \"more than 4000 sites\". of about 300 000 to 400 000 potentially polluted sites total (around 100 000 ha), in a historical inventory named BASIAS, maintained by the Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie (ADEME).\n\nGermany loses greenfields at a rate of about 1.2 square kilometres per day for settlement and transportation infrastructure. Each of the approximately 14,700 local municipalities is empowered to allocate lands for industrial and commercial use. Local control over reuse decisions of German brownfield sites (\"Industriebrache\") is a critical factor. Industrial sites tend to be remote due to zoning laws, and incur costly overhead for providing infrastructure such as utilities, disposal services and transportation.\nIn 1989, a brownfield of the Ruhrgebiet became Emscher Park.\n\nIn the UK centuries of industrial use of lands which once formed the birthplace of the industrial revolution have left entire regions in a brownfield status. New legislation in the UK may provide a needed incentive for brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. Cleanup laws are centered on the premise that the remediation should be \"fit for the purpose\".\n\nAcquisition, adaptive re-use, and disposal of a brownfield site requires advanced and specialized appraisal analysis techniques. For example, the highest and best use of the brownfield site may be affected by the contamination, both before and after remediation. Additionally, the value should take into account residual stigma and potential for third-party liability. Normal appraisal techniques frequently fail, and appraisers must rely on more advanced techniques, such as contingent valuation, case studies, or statistical analyses. A 2011 University of Delaware study has suggested a 17.5:1 return on dollars invested on brownfield redevelopment.\nA 2014 study of EPA brownfield cleanup grants from 2002 through 2008 found an average benefit value of almost $4 million per brownfield site (with a median of $2,117,982).\nTo expedite the cleanup of brownfield sites in the US, some environmental firms have teamed up with insurance companies to underwrite the cleanup and provide a guaranteed cleanup cost to limit land developers' exposure to environmental remediation costs and pollution lawsuits. The environmental firm first performs an extensive investigation.\n\nInnovative remediation techniques used at distressed brownfields in recent years include in situ thermal remediation, bioremediation and in situ oxidation. Often, these strategies are used in conjunction with each other or with other remedial strategies such as soil vapor extraction. In this process, vapor from the soil phase is extracted from soils and treated, which has the effect of removing contaminants from the soils and groundwater beneath a site. Binders can be added to contaminated soil to prevent chemical leaching. Some brownfields with heavy metal contamination have even been cleaned up through an innovative approach called phytoremediation, which uses deep-rooted plants to soak up metals in soils into the plant structure as the plant grows. After they reach maturity, the plants – which now contain the heavy metal contaminants in their tissues – are removed and disposed of as hazardous waste.\n\nResearch is under way to see if some brownfields can be used to grow crops, specifically for the production of biofuels. Michigan State University, in collaboration with DaimlerChrysler and NextEnergy, has small plots of soybean, corn, canola, and switchgrass growing in a former industrial dump site in Oakland County, Michigan. The intent is to see if the plants can serve two purposes simultaneously: assist with phytoremediation, and contribute to the economical production of biodiesel and/or ethanol fuel.\n\nThe regeneration of brownfields in the United Kingdom and in other European countries has gained prominence due to greenfield land restrictions as well as their potential to promote the urban renaissance. Development of brownfield sites also presents an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact on communities, and considerable assessments need to take place in order to evaluate the size of this opportunity.\n\nMany contaminated brownfield sites sit unused for decades because the cost of cleaning them to safe standards is more than the land would be worth after redevelopment. However, redevelopment has become more common in the first decade of the 21st century, as developable land has become less available in highly populated areas, and brownfields contribute to environmental stigma which can delay redevelopment. Also, the methods of studying contaminated land have become more sophisticated and costly.\n\nSome states and localities have spent considerable money assessing the contamination on local brownfield sites, to quantify the cleanup costs in an effort to move the redevelopment process forward. Therefore, federal and state programs have been developed to help developers interested in cleaning up brownfield sites and restoring them to practical uses.\n\nIn the process of cleaning contaminated brownfield sites, previously unknown underground storage tanks, buried drums or buried railroad tank cars containing wastes are sometimes encountered. Unexpected circumstances increase the cost for study and clean-up. As a result, the cleanup work may be delayed or stopped entirely. To avoid unexpected contamination and increased costs, many developers insist that a site be thoroughly investigated (via a Phase II Site Investigation or Remedial Investigation) prior to commencing remedial cleanup activities.\n\n the Atlantic Station project in Atlanta, was the largest brownfield redevelopment in the United States. Dayton, like many other cities in the region, is developing Tech Town in order to attract technology-based firms to Dayton and revitalize the downtown area. In Homestead, Pennsylvania, the site once occupied by Carnegie Steel has been converted into a successful commercial center, The Waterfront.\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has successfully converted numerous former steel mill sites into high-end residential, shopping, and offices. Examples of brownfield redevelopment in Pittsburgh include:\n\nIn Seattle, rusted remains of a gasworks were left in place to add character to Gas Works Park.\nIn Providence, Rhode Island, The Steel Yard is a \"landscape for learning\" built over a once lead contaminated brownfield. \n\nIn the United States, Brownfield regulation and development is largely governed by state environmental agencies in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 1995, the EPA launched the Brownfields Program, which was expanded in 2002 with the Brownfields Law. \nThe EPA, together with local and national government, can provide technical help and some funding for assessment and cleanup. From 2002 through 2013, the EPA awarded nearly 1,000 grants for clean up, for a total of almost $190 million. It can also provide tax incentives for cleanup that is not paid for outright; specifically, cleanup costs are fully tax-deductible in the year they are incurred. Many of the most important provisions on liability relief are contained in state codes that can differ significantly from state to state.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, regulation of contaminated land comes from Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990; responsibility falls on local authorities to create a \"contaminated land register\". For sites with dubious past and present uses the Local Planning Authority may ask for a desktop study, which is sometimes implemented as a condition in planning applications.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9538402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9538402", "title": "Digraphia", "text": "Digraphia\n\nIn sociolinguistics, digraphia refers to the use of more than one writing system for the same language. Synchronic digraphia is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language, while diachronic (or sequential) digraphia is the replacement of one writing system by another for a particular language.\n\nAn example of synchronic digraphia is Serbian, which is equally written in both Serbian Cyrillic alphabet and Gaj's Latin alphabet, and practically all speakers of Serbian can read and write both scripts. Another example is Punjabi which uses two different writing systems: Gurmukhi script, used in Punjab in India, and Shahmukhi (an Arabic script), though there is no difference when both of these scripts are read or pronounced. Konkani is written in no fewer than three scripts; Devnagari, Kannada and Roman. \n\nAn example of diachronic digraphia is Turkish, which replaced a Perso-Arabic writing system with a Latin-based system in 1928.\n\nDigraphia has implications in language planning, language policy, and language ideology.\n\n\"Digraphia\" \"using two writing systems for the same language\" is an uncommon term, generally restricted to linguistic contexts.\n\nEnglish \"digraphia\", like French \"digraphie\", etymologically derives from Greek \"di-\" \"δι-\" \"twice\" and \"-graphia\" \"-γραφία\" \"writing\".\n\n\"Digraphia\" was modeled upon \"diglossia\" \"the coexistence of two languages or dialects among a certain population\", which derives from Greek \"diglossos\" δίγλωσσος \"bilingual.\" Charles A. Ferguson, a founder of sociolinguistics, coined \"diglossia\" in 1959. Grivelet analyzes how the influence of diglossia on the unrelated notion of digraphia has \"introduced some distortion in the process of defining digraphia,\" such as distinguishing \"high\" and \"low\" varieties. Peter Unseth notes one usage of \"digraphia\" that most closely parallels Ferguson’s “diglossia,” situations where a language uses different scripts for different domains; for instance, \"shorthand in English, pinyin in Chinese for alphabetizing library files, etc. or several scripts which are replaced by Roman script during e-mail usage.\"\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\", which does not yet include \"digraphia\", enters two \"digraph\" terms and \"digraphic\". First, the linguistic term \"digraph\" is defined as, \"A group of two letters expressing a simple sound of speech\". This meaning applies to both two letters representing a single speech sound in orthography (e.g., English \"ng\" representing the velar nasal ) and a single grapheme with two letters in typographical ligature (e.g., the Old English Latin alphabet letter æ). Second, the graph theory term \"digraph\" (a portmanteau from directed graph) is defined as, \"A graph in which each line has a direction associated with it; a finite, non-empty set of elements together with a set of ordered pairs of these elements.\" The two \"digraph\" terms were first recorded in 1788 and 1955, respectively. The \"OED2\" defines two \"digraphic\" meanings, \"Pertaining to or of the nature of a digraph\" and \"Written in two different characters or alphabets.\" It gives their earliest examples in 1873 and 1880 (which was used meaning \"digraphia\"). Isaac Hollister Hall, an American scholar of Oriental studies, described an Eteocypriot language publication as \"bilingual (or digraphic, as both inscriptions are in the same language).\" Hall's article was antedated by Demetrios Pieridis's 1875 usage of \"digraphic\" instead of \"bilingual\" for an inscription written in both the Greek alphabet and Cypriot syllabary.\n\nEnglish \"digraphic\" and \"digraphia\" were contemporaneous with their corresponding terms in French linguistics. In 1877, Julius Oppert introduced \"digraphique\" to describe languages written in cuneiform syllabaries. In 1893, Auguste Barth used French \"digraphisme\" for Cambodian inscriptions written in Khmer script and Brāhmī script. In 1971, Robèrt Lafont coined \"digraphie\" regarding the sociolinguistics of French and Occitan.\n\nAlthough the word \"digraphia\" is new, the practice is ancient. Darius the Great's (c. 522-486 BCE) Behistun Inscription was written in three cuneiform scripts for Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian.\n\nFour authors independently neologized English \"digraphia\" from \"diglossia\".\n\nThe Songhay linguist Petr Zima (1974) first used \"digraphia\" to describe the Hausa language having two writing systems, Boko (Latin script) and Ajami script (Arabic script). Zima differentiated these paired situations.\nUsage of \"diorthographia\" is unusual. Compare dysgraphia meaning \"a language disorder that affects a person's ability to write\" and dysorthographia \"a synonym for dyslexia\".\n\nThe anthropologist James R. Jaquith (1976), who studied unconventional spelling in advertising, used \"digraphia\" to describe the practice of writing brand names in all caps (e.g., ARRID). He described digraphia as \"the graphic analog of what linguists call diglossia\", and defined it as \"different versions of a written language exist simultaneously and in complementary distribution in a speech community.\"\n\nThe sociolinguist Ian R. H. Dale (1980) wrote a general survey of digraphia, defined as, \"the use of two (or more) writing systems to represent varieties of a single language.\"\n\nThe sinologist and lexicographer John DeFrancis (1984) used \"digraphia\", defined as \"the use of two or more different systems of writing the same language,\" to translate Chinese \"shuangwenzhi\" (雙文制 \"two-script system\") of writing in Chinese characters and Pinyin. DeFrancis later explained, \"I have been incorrectly credited with coining the term \"digraphia\", which I indeed thought I had created as a parallel in writing to Charles Ferguson’s \"diglossia\" in speech.\"\n\nHegyi coined and suggested the terms \"bigraphism\" and \"multigraphism\", but he only used them in a footnote (fn. 17, p. 268) and did not promote the use of either of these terms, nor follow up on his insights into the importance of studying \"the use of two or more different writing systems for the same language... such cases have been more widespread than commonly assumed.\"\n\n\"Digraphia\" is an uncommon term in current English usage. For instance, the Corpus of Contemporary American English, which includes over 425,000,000 words, lists \"digraphia\" three times in \"academic genre\" contexts.\nStéphane Grivelet, who edited a special \"Digraphia: Writing systems and society\" issue of the \"International Journal of the Sociology of Language\", explains.\nAfter 25 years and various articles on the subject, there are still important differences in the scope of the definition, and the notion itself is rarely used in sociolinguistics, apart from the field of Chinese studies, where the notion of digraphia is nowadays frequently used to describe the coexistence of two writing systems: Chinese script and Pinyin.\n\nDigraphia has some rare synonyms. Orthographic diglossia antedates digraphia, and was noted by Paul Wexler in 1971.\" Bigraphism, bialphabetism, and biscriptality are infrequently used.\n\nSome scholars avoid using the word \"digraphia\". Describing terminology for \"script obsolescence,\" Stephen D. Houston, John Baines, and Jerrold Cooper say, \"'Biscript' refers to a text in two different writing systems. 'Biliteracy' and 'triliteracy' label the concurrent use of two or three scripts.\"\n\nDigraphia can be either \"synchronic\" (or \"concurrent\") or \"diachronic\" (\"historical\" or \"sequential\"), extending Ferdinand de Saussure's classic division between synchronic linguistics and diachronic linguistics. Dale first differentiated \"diachronic (or historical) digraphia\" (\"more than one writing system used for a given language in successive periods of time\") and \"synchronic digraphia\" (\"more than one writing system used contemporaneously for the same language\"). Dale concluded that,\nTwo primary factors have been identified as operating on a society in the choice of script for representing its language. These are the prevailing cultural influence (often a religion) and the prevailing political influence of the period in which the choice is made. Synchronic digraphia results when more than one such influence is operating and none can dominate all groups of speakers of the language in question [ … ] Diachronic digraphia results when different influences prevail over a given speech community at different times.\nSome recent scholarship questions the practicality of this synchronic/diachronic distinction. Grivelet contends that, \"digraphia is a single sociolinguistic process with two types of outcome (concurrent or sequential digraphia) and with specific features related to the causes and types of development of the various cases.\n\nPeter Unseth lists and exemplifies four factors that can influence a language community's choice of a script.\n\nLinguists who study language and gender have analyzed gender-differentiated speech varieties (\"genderlects\", usually spoken by women), and there are a few cases of scripts predominantly used by women. Japanese \"hiragana\" was initially a women's script, for instance, used by Murasaki Shikibu to write \"The Tale of Genji\". Chinese Nüshu script (literally \"women's writing) is a simplification of characters that was traditionally used by women in Jiangyong County of Hunan province.\n\nNot only scripts, but also letters can have iconic power to differentiate social groups. For example, the names of many heavy metal bands (e.g., Motörhead, Infernäl Mäjesty, Mötley Crüe) use umlauts \"to index the musical genre as well as the notion of ‘Gothic’ more generally.\" This digraphic usage is called the \"metal umlaut\" (or \"röck döts\").\n\n\"Synchronic digraphia\" is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language. A modern example is the Serbian language, which is written in either the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet or Gaj's Latin alphabet. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim Bosniaks generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably Bosnian Cyrillic. Inuktitut is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and Inuktitut syllabics. In Hindi-Urdu, the Devanagari or Persian script generally follows the Hindi and Urdu standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script.\n\nThe Japanese writing system has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: \"true digraphia\" of occasionally using \"rōmaji\" Latin alphabet for a few loanwords like \"DVD\", and of regularly using three scripts (technically, \"trigraphia\") for different functions. Japanese is written with \"kanji\" \"Chinese character\" logographs used for Sino-Japanese vocabulary; \"hiragana\" used for native Japanese words; and \"katakana\" used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis. Take \"Nihon\" for instance, the primary name of Japan. It is normally written 日本 (literally, \"sun's origin\") in \"kanji\" – but is occasionally written にほん in \"hiragana\", ニホン in \"katakana\", or Nihon in \"rōmaji\" (\"romanization\"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning.\n\nAnother example is the Malay language, which most often uses the Latin alphabet, while in certain geographic areas (Kelantan state of Malaysia, Brunei) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called Jawi. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across Malay Archipelago since the introduction of Islam. In Java, Javanese people, which predominantly ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdoms, have their own writing system called Hanacaraka. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called Pegon) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously. This phenomenon also occurred in some other cultures in Indonesia.\n\nAn element of synchronic digraphia is present in many languages not using the Latin script, in particular in text messages and when typing on a computer which does not have the facility to represent the usual script for that language. In such cases, Latin script is often used, although systems of transcription are often not standardised.\n\nDigraphia is controversial in modern Written Chinese. The ongoing debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters concerns \"diglyphia\" or \"pluricentricity\" rather than digraphia. Chinese digraphia involves the use of both Chinese characters and Hanyu Pinyin romanization. Pinyin is officially approved for a few special uses, such as annotating characters for learners of Chinese and transcribing Chinese names. Nevertheless, Pinyin continues to be adopted for other functions, such as computers, education, library catalogs, and merchandise labels. Among Chinese input methods for computers, Pinyin is the most popular phonetic method. Zhou Youguang predicts, \"Digraphia is perhaps the key for Chinese to enter the age of Information processing.\" Many writers, both from China (e.g., Mao Dun and Zhou Youguang) and from abroad (e.g., John DeFrancis, Victor H. Mair, J. Marshall Unger, and William Hannas) have argued for digraphia to be implemented as a Chinese language standard. These digraphic reformers call for a generalized used of Pinyin orthography along with Chinese characters. \nYat-Shing Cheung differentiates three Chinese digraphic situations. (1) Both the High and the Low forms derive from the same script system: traditional and simplified characters. (2) Both forms derive from the same system but the Low form borrows foreign elements: Putonghua and topolects (or \"dialects\"). (3) The High and the Low forms derive from two different script systems: Chinese characters and pinyin.\n\n\"Diachronic\" or \"sequential digraphia\", in which a language switches writing systems, can occur historically through language change or suddenly through language reform. \"Abrupt script shift can be seen in the change of Turkish from Arabic script to Roman (in one year), while a gradual change of script can be seen in the change from writing Korean in Chinese characters to Hangul (a process that arguably nearly spanned five centuries).\"\n\nThe Azerbaijani language provides an \"extreme example\" of diachronic digraphia; it has historically been written in runic, Arabic, Latin, Cyrillic, and again Latin alphabets.\n\nThere are many examples of languages that used to be written in a script, which was replaced later. Examples are Romanian (which originally used Cyrillic and changed to Latin) in the 1860s; Vietnamese (which switched from a form of Chinese writing called Chữ Nôm to the Latin alphabet); Turkish, Swahili, Somali, and (partially) Malay, which all switched from Arabic script to the Latin alphabet, and many countries of the former Soviet Union, which abandoned the Cyrillic script after the dissolution of the USSR such as Moldova, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. DeFrancis notes, \"The old literature in the earlier scripts remains, however, so that all these scripts more or less overlap in use, by scholars involved with early texts, or for reprinting earlier materials for a wider readership and for other limited uses.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8110105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8110105", "title": "Dry fire", "text": "Dry fire\n\nDry firing is the practice of \"firing\" a firearm without ammunition or practicing the manipulation of a firearm with an inert training platform such as a SIRT, Laserlyte, or LaserAmmo training firearm. If done incorrectly, dry firing may be mechanically damaging to some firearms – especially rimfire weapons, where the firing pin in most designs will impact the breech face if the weapon is dry-fired. Because of this, precautions (such as the use of snap caps) need to be taken if such a weapon is to be deliberately dry-fired.\n\nThere are many benefits to dry firing. Learning is faster and can be safer with dry fire. It's easier to practice without developing a flinch. Dry fire allows shooters to practice in locations where they couldn't practice with live ammo. You can practice grip, drawing, sight alignment, trigger control, reloads, malfunctions, and more during dry fire practice. The technique allows people to conduct a safe, economical form of training to improve their shooting skills. An emphasis is placed on safety to prevent an accidental discharge. Training should be conducted in an area with no ammunition and with a suitable backstop.\n\nIn recent years, a number of companies have developed methods of enhancing dry fire practice to improve skills. Products that fire a laser, as opposed to a solid projectile, have become increasingly popular. These include chamber inserts available for various caliber firearms, as well as dedicated training pistols or replacement AR-15 bolt carrier groups. There are also a number of target systems for these laser dry fire training aides, that are becoming more affordable and popular. These products help people get more from dry fire practice by providing feedback on shot placement and times, and make dry fire a more enjoyable experience. In addition, there are training aids such as training cards that provide shooters a variety of drills to do that will help them develop skills that will carry over to live fire.\n\nIt is generally acceptable to dry fire more modern centerfire firearms without a cartridge or snap cap for limited volume training. Older designs such as the CZ 52 and Colt Single Action Army are exceptions. However, dry firing a rimfire firearm, striker based firearms or guns with angled firing pins (such as revolvers with hammer-mounted firing pins or older shotguns) can damage the gun. Furthermore, damage can occur to the chamber mouth of a rimfire firearm. Ultimately, one should check with the manufacturer of the gun to ascertain if it is safe to dry fire, but you should use a snap cap for all high volume dry fire training where the firing pin articulates.\n\nDry firing in archery, also known as \"dry loosing\", refers to the releasing of a drawn bow without an arrow. This practice should be avoided as much as possible, because without the mass of the arrow to absorb the elastic energy released, the energy is instead dissipated through vibration of the bowstring and the bow limbs, and can do significant structural damage to the bow itself. Compound bows are particularly susceptible to damage due to high tension and numerous moving parts. Dry firing a modern high-poundage compound bow even once may cause a combination of cracked limbs, bent axles, string derailment, cam warpage, string/cable failure, cable slide failure, and can even cause the bow to shatter. While some bows can survive a dry fire with no apparent damage, typically manufacturers do not warrant their bows for dry firing, and any bow that has been dry fired needs to be thoroughly inspected for damage before shooting again. In particular, the limbs need to be inspected for cracking around cam axles and the opening of the slot where the cams or pulleys fit in (since they tend to tilt sideways during a dry fire). \n\nCrossbows, with their high draw weights, are even more likely to be damaged by dry firing.\n\nThe term dry firing is most likely derived from the similar phrase \"dry run (testing)\", which is a rehearsal or testing process and in the case of the firearm, one is \"testing\" the trigger action and observing the hammer or striker drop, without using live ammunition. Sources indicate that \"dry\" originates from exhibitions by late-19th-century fire departments in the United States, where drills (runs) were conducted for public viewing without the use of water (dry).\n\n"}

The United States (excluding territories) has six time zones (Hawaii–Aleutian, Alaska, Pacific, Mountain, Central and Eastern), with further variation in the observance of daylight saving time. Canada also has six time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, Atlantic and Newfoundland). Mexico has four time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern). This requires broadcast and pay television networks in each country to shift programs in time to show them in different regions.\n\nCanadian broadcasting networks, with six time zones and a much larger percentage of its audience residing in the Mountain Time Zone than in the Central Time Zone, are sometimes able to avoid the issues that affect American programming by airing pre-recorded programs on local time. CBC Television and CTV created delay centres in Calgary in the early 1960s in order to allow programming to air in each time zone based on the region.\n\nUnlike in the United States, virtually all live events, including live entertainment shows and sports television, are simultaneously broadcast nationwide in Canada. For instance, live shows in Canada are aired to entirety at the same time in all time zones based on Eastern time. Several live U.S. shows are also aired simultaneously in all of Canada, including for viewers in the Pacific Coast (unlike in the United States where some viewers on the same side of the continent depend on tape-delayed broadcasts for some otherwise live events). Conversely, live shows aired in Canada are frequently televised simultaneously for some viewers in the U.S. with access to Canadian broadcast networks.\n\nThe vast majority of specialty cable and satellite television channels in Canada each operate a single feed which is distributed in all time zones. This includes all French language channels, as they predominantly serve Francophone areas of the country, mostly in Quebec (almost all of which observes Eastern Time). Even many long-standing specialty channels with a general entertainment format use a single national feed, though in many cases they will repeat core primetime programming three hours after first broadcast, such that programs can be promoted as airing at the same time in both the Eastern and Pacific time zones.\n\nSome specialty channels do operate two separate broadcast feeds for Eastern and Western Canada. The Eastern feed airs programs on an Eastern Time schedule, while the Western feed airs the same programming on a three-hour delay. The separation between feeds is typically implemented at the border between Manitoba and Ontario, which may result in a program that airs at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time in Ontario not airing in Manitoba until 12:00 a.m. CT (whereas an equivalent program in the U.S. would typically be available at 9:00 p.m. for Central Time viewers). However, one channel, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, implements the separation at the border between Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) applies more restrictive censorship regulations to broadcast programming shown in prime time, compared to content transmitted after a watershed hour beyond which few children would be likely to be watching. This can be problematic if the same content is broadcast simultaneously nationwide, as the 9:00 p.m. watershed in Vancouver falls at 12:00 a.m. in Toronto and 1:30 a.m. in St. John's. LGBT specialty broadcaster PrideVision was particularly affected as, from its launch in 2001 until 2005, its format included more innocuous entertainment programming aimed at the gay community during the day and in prime time and hardcore pornographic content in the overnight (with the latter expanding into the mid-evening by 2004). The network's adult programming was spun out into a second channel so that the parent network, now OutTV, could broadcast its non-explicit entertainment and lifestyle programming across its entire broadcast day.\n\nWith four time zones in the contiguous United States, American broadcast television networks generally broadcast at least two separate feeds to their owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, as do cable/satellite channels: the \"eastern feed\" that is aired simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the \"western feed\" that is tape-delayed three hours for those in the Pacific Time Zone. This ensures that a program, for example, that airs at 8:00 p.m. EST on the East Coast is also shown locally at 8:00 p.m. on the West Coast. Networks may also broadcast a third feed specifically for the Mountain Time Zone, on which programs are usually broadcast on a one-hour delay from the Eastern Time Zone. Otherwise, some stations in the Mountain Time Zone use the western feed, while others get a mix of both the Eastern and Pacific feeds.\n\nThe Eastern Time Zone is commonly used as a \" de facto\" official time for the United States because it includes the nation's capital city, Washington D.C.; the most populous city, New York City; and half of the country's population.\n\nEffectively, the East, Mountain and West network feeds allow prime time on broadcast television networks to end at 10:00 p.m. Central and Mountain and 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific. When it first expanded its programming into prime time in April 1987, Fox became the first major broadcast network in the U.S. to offer a \"common prime\" schedule; this type of scheduling subtracts an hour from the prime time schedule, reducing it to two hours on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays – ending evening network programming earlier than NBC, CBS and ABC did – and continue to do (Fox did expand its Sunday primetime schedule into the 10:00 p.m. timeslot in September 1987, before giving back that hour to its stations in September 1993). The WB and UPN followed the \"common prime\" scheduling model when they both launched in January 1995; the replacements for those networks, The CW and the MyNetworkTV program service, similarly used that model upon their launches in September 2006.\n\nIn 2009, PBS began using Internet servers instead of separate feeds for time delaying of its programming to the network's member stations. The servers imitate a delayed program feed, broadcasting the program at the correct airtime as if it were being broadcast via satellite. This was done as PBS had upgraded its main program feed to high definition (or to widescreen digital at the very least) in December 2008, but satellite capacity allowed for only Eastern and Pacific time zone feeds, prompting the removal of the Central and Mountain time zone feeds and a shared feed for Alaska and Pacific time zones in February 2009, which created complaints from PBS stations.\n\nSubscribers to cable or satellite television services may still only receive East Coast feeds for certain channels even if they reside on the West Coast. Some cable channels only offer one broadcast feed, where viewers see the same program in all time zones. For example, until it dropped the program in 2014, superstation-turned-basic cable channel WGN America telecast the noon (Central Time) newscast from WGN-TV in Chicago at 1:00 p.m. Eastern in Washington, D.C. and 10:00 a.m. Pacific in Los Angeles.\n\nBroadcasters offer East and West Coast feeds of some basic cable channels for viewing in all time zones, allowing viewers who missed a particular program to watch it three hours earlier or later.\n\nThe usage of dual feeds of the same channel is a commonplace method for premium channels such as HBO, Showtime and Starz, in which the Pacific time zone feed of the primary channel is packaged with the East Coast feed of the main channel and the pay service's multiplex channels (if the premium channel has any). Most commonly, the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone feeds of only the main channel are packaged together, although some providers may also provide both coastal feeds of a premium service's multiplex channels. In some cases, cable networks (such as cable news and sports channels) \"fake\" the dual feed approach by recycling their same-day prime time programming during the overnight hours on a three (or four) hour cycle; in this case, the programs are automatically rebroadcast at the advertised time (or one hour later) in the Pacific Time Zone.\n\nIn the United States, distant over-the-air broadcast stations affiliated with the six broadcast networks are offered by direct-broadcast satellite providers as well as C-band services that do not offer locally based affiliates for most individual markets, allowing viewers to choose between the east and west feeds of a given network. These designated stations are usually owned-and-operated stations and/or affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW located in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones (usually those based in New York City and Los Angeles such as ABC's respective O&Os [network owned-and-operated] in those markets, WABC-TV and KABC-TV). Dish Network and C-band providers also provide CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates designated as superstations (such as WPIX in New York and KTLA in Los Angeles), with Dish mainly making them available in markets where it does not carry a low-power, digital subchannel-only or non-broadcast affiliate of either network (especially in markets served by The CW's quasi-national feed for areas ranked below #98 in Nielsen Media Research market rankings, The CW Plus).\n\nThe country's two major satellite providers – DirecTV and Dish Network – only offer these de facto coastal feeds in order to provide programming from at least one network to subscribers living in smaller media markets or rural areas where a network does not have a local affiliate available on the provider, if even presently serving the given location at all. Since the services began offering local network affiliates from additional markets in the early 2000s, many local stations have successfully sued DBS providers to deny access to distant stations carrying programming from the same network as them within their markets. This differs from the subscription television model in Canada, most cable and satellite providers carry distant over-the-air broadcast stations from the U.S. (consisting of both affiliates of the Big Four broadcast networks and minor network affiliates classified as superstations), in addition to O&Os and affiliates of domestically-based networks.\n\nFor decades, the Super Bowl (currently aired on rotation by CBS, Fox and NBC) and most sports television programs, including other major national events, have been broadcast to totality live in all time zones across U.S. territories, but also present special problems for local stations. For such events, the networks may either advertise Eastern time only, or list the times in both Eastern and Pacific (e.g. \"8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific\"). As such, a live Sunday sporting event that is played from 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time preempts local 6:00 p.m. newscasts on the East Coast. Likewise, a State of the Union address that is televised at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time preempts local 6:00 p.m. newscasts on the West Coast.\n\nUntil recently, several entertainment shows that are broadcast live in the Eastern and Central time zones, including some that originate from Los Angeles (particularly live reality competition shows as ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" and NBC's \"The Voice\"), are tape-delayed in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, thus making it impossible for viewers in those time zones to vote after performance episodes of live reality competition shows finish airing live on the East Coast. The mechanics of the 2014 ABC series \"Rising Star\" — which allowed for live, real-time voting by viewers — would allow the insertion of live reaction segments in the event that a contestant eliminated by low vote totals in the original Eastern/Central time zone broadcast would be saved by results watching the Pacific/Mountain broadcast, but the show was broadcast live across the mainland U.S. except the Pacific time zone. Moreover, ABC noted that the chances of West Coast votes differing substantially from other viewers was statistically small.\n\nThe Academy Awards, up until the early 21st century, was the only major U.S. entertainment television event to have been aired to all continental U.S. time zones, but with a tape delay for viewers in Hawaii. Beginning the late 2000s, however, several award shows, such as the Golden Globes Awards and Billboard Music Awards, joined the Oscars in conducting the same format of live broadcasts in response to longstanding general criticisms from the multimedia industry and viewers alike on some live shows televised real-time to the East Coast but are being tape-delayed for West Coast viewers, albeit the fact that some of them originate from Los Angeles area. This is to cater for viewers in the Alaskan, Pacific and Mountain time zones who have frequently complained about spoilers made by live viewers east of the Rockies during the broadcasts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Olympic competitions beginning early 2018, aired currently by NBC, joined the Super Bowl and other major domestic and international sports telecasts in airing live in all time zones across the U.S. territories. Nowadays, most live shows are now being discussed openly at the same time online, as social media and television's interaction reached critical mass in the current century in relation to live television, which had gained renewed importance as being \"DVR-proof\" for ratings and social purposes amidst the decline of traditional television due to rise of online streaming of the majority of the recent scripted series.\n\nUntil 2015, the Grammy Awards continued to air on delay for the West Coast broadcast. However, beginning the 2016 Grammys telecast, the award show's rightsholder, CBS, began to allow its stations in the Western U.S. to carry the ceremony live as long as they also carry a prime time rebroadcast. Starting in 2017, CBS aired the Grammys live all across the U.S. (inclusive of time zones outside the contiguous U.S.), with a required primetime encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones. The Grammys continued to use the format in 2018 in coincidence with its broadcast source transfer from Los Angeles to New York, making it the first major award show to have aired live across all U.S. time zones.\n\nAlthough the Primetime Emmy Awards, currently aired on rotation by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, began airing live coast-to-coast in the U.S. in 2010, the awards show followed suit with the Grammys in airing live simultaneously outside the contiguous U.S. time zones with CBS' telecast in 2017. As of 2018, the Tony Awards (which are usually broadcast live from New York City) remain the only major award show to have never conducted live coast-to-coast telecasts.\n\nSome lower-tiered special music telecasts that originate from Los Angeles, such as the American Music Awards, People's Choice Awards and Teen Choice Awards, remain airing live in the East Coast and tape-delayed for the West Coast as their airtime is often purchased as a brokered programming arrangement, which also allows standards and practices to watch the ceremony in advance and determine cuts for profanity or content to insert a bleep censor or cut-away, and the producers cuts for time and superfluous items such as longer walks than expected by an award winner to the stage or a rare botched performance with the replacement of dress rehearsal footage. Some technically complicated ceremonies, such as the MTV Video Music Awards, are usually edited before being recorded for broadcast on separate local primetime slots for both coasts.\n\nSimilarly, media coverage of New Year's Eve celebrations in New York City often leave the Central Time Zone out. \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", though produced in New York City, when broadcast on New Year's Eve took advantage of its later time slot (11:37 p.m. Central time) to lampoon this inconsistency by presenting a New Year's celebration for the Central Time Zone. In some locations, New Year's Eve celebrations held in New York might be repeatedly performed live or delayed one hour to correspond to the Central Time Zone. News channels such as CNN and sports channels such as ESPN that frequently broadcast live events offer a single feed that airs in all time zones. About 80 percent of the U.S. population reside in the Central and Eastern time zones, where the nation's largest city (and the main anchor of television programming) New York is located.\n\nWith the revived prominence of live television as a major broadcast format in the U.S. in recent decades, networks have resorted into airing live shows by repeated live performances of the telecasts, or a single telecast in real time simultaneously across U.S. time zones.\n\nOccasionally, networks will produce and broadcast the same live event twice in one night - broadcasting once on an East Coast feed, and again on a West Coast feed three hours later. This permits more viewers to watch the broadcast live in prime time (although not all), as the show can air in its usual timeslot in all markets, but incurs the expense and difficulty of delivering two live broadcasts. In some cases, the two broadcasts may intentionally differ, prompting fans to compare notes and post scenes from each version online. While rare, the technique of multiple live broadcasts has been not uncommon for some special live episodes of scripted programs since the late 1990s, such as the \"30 Rock\" episodes \"Live Show\" and \"Live from Studio 6H\", \"Will & Grace\" with \"Alive and Schticking\", \"The West Wing\" with \"The Debate\", and \"ER\"'s fourth-season debut with \"Ambush\".\n\nFew regularly scheduled prime time shows, both scripted and non-scripted, and sports and non-sports in genre, have been aired to totality at the same time live across all continental U.S. time zones. This format, similar to aforementioned major awards shows, involves airing live on prime time or late night in the East Coast (and late afternoon hours or on prime time, simultaneously and respectively, on the West Coast). As of 2018, NBC remains the foremost proponent of live television, with its broadcasts of \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"Saturday Night Live\" being transmitted live across the contiguous U.S. states (and for the former, including for U.S. time zones outside the mainland), with a corresponding prime time or late-night encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones.\n\nIn mid-2018, \"American Idol\" became the first ever reality competition series - and first ever non-weekend regularly scheduled prime time program - in all of U.S. television to broadcast live in all U.S. territories upon its revival on ABC after its initial first-run finale on Fox in 2016, beginning with its live shows in the final stages of the competition. In this manner, viewers in both the West Coast and East Coast are enabled to both view the episodes live at the same time, with the prime time East Coast telecast coinciding with the real-time afternoon telecasts across the Pacific to Hawaii, along with real-time voting with the revealing of its results integrated at the end of the performance nights. Despite the format having been in place for the show since 2015, as part of its nationwide voting expansion, a corresponding warning for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones regarding the closing of the voting window will be aired upon their local prime time encore broadcasts.\n\nLocal stations and affiliates must schedule their local and syndicated programming around their respective network's feed. Because primetime programs on the East Coast feed are simulcast in two time zones, stations in the Central Time Zone are affected differently from those in the Eastern Time Zone. An hour of syndicated programming time (between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones) is lost in the Central and Mountain time zones since network primetime in those areas starts at 7:00 p.m., forcing stations in Mountain or Central time (or in parts of both zones) to choose between airing their 6:00 p.m. newscast and another syndicated or locally produced program or airing shows in \"blocks\" preferred by syndicators (for example, \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\" together or \"Entertainment Tonight\" and \"The Insider\" together).\n\nThe most common set of programming chosen by stations aligned with the Big Three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) is to air a local newscast at 5:00 p.m., national news at 5:30 p.m., another local newscast at 6:00 p.m. and syndicated programming at 6:30 p.m., though some Fox stations that maintain a newscast schedule comparable to stations tied to the Big Three (commonly stations that were former ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates themselves) carry a 60- or 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:00 (or 6:30) p.m. with an additional half-hour of local news in the 5:30 p.m. timeslot as Fox does not air a national evening newscast; a few stations not affiliated with the Big Four networks, such as WGN-TV, KTLA in Los Angeles and WJXT in Jacksonville, Florida, follow a similar scheduling format with their early evening newscasts. Most Big Three affiliates in the Eastern and Pacific time zones follow this early evening newscast model as well, running a 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:30 p.m., particularly if they run a network's national evening newscast at 6:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Some stations, regardless of time zone, even show a newscast from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m., which if run on a network station in the Central or Mountain time zones would lead into primetime network programming. Some television stations (such as WKYC and WJW in Cleveland, Ohio, or WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island) have recently begun using the fact that primetime in the Eastern Time Zone begins at 8:00 p.m. to their advantage by carrying a newscast during the 7:00 p.m. hour, generally in order to attract viewers who work longer days and cannot return home to watch a 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nMany stations that do not carry a newscast in the 6:00 p.m. timeslot in the Central Time Zone (commonly independent stations and most affiliates of non-historical networks like Fox – which has some stations that air a 6:00 p.m. newscast, though this is not entirely commonplace – The CW and MyNetworkTV) air situation comedies or other types of syndicated programming, such as reality series or game shows, during that hour. Many stations in the Central Time Zone tend to air one or both parts of the syndicated block at 5:00 p.m. or even earlier. Another more recent dilemma of the 7:00 p.m. primetime start is that a combination of longer commutes and work hours than in the past have caused many people to not come home from work until after 7:00 p.m., cutting into the potential ratings of shows that start at this time. Of course, the reverse is also true since simultaneous broadcasts offer viewers the chance to watch \"prime time television\" without having to stay awake until 11:00 p.m.\n\nLocal programming such as locally produced newscasts are not typically affected as many stations air their morning newscast at 4:00, 4:30, 5:00 or 5:30 a.m., and their early evening newscasts at 5:00 and/or 6:00 p.m.; however, the late evening newscast is affected due to the differences in time between time zones, meaning that if the late local news starts at 10:00 p.m. Central time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Eastern Time Zone airs its newscast at 11:00 p.m.; network evening newscasts on CBS, ABC, and NBC are affected since they are usually scheduled to air at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time (barring preemption due to network sports coverage or at the discretion of the local station, breaking news or severe weather coverage) in order to sync up with its simultaneous broadcast in the Central Time Zone. Midday newscasts are not necessarily affected, depending on whether the station's affiliated network schedules their daytime lineup simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones (as with ABC and CBS) or just to the Eastern Time Zone first (as with NBC). The late night program lineups on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are also similarly timeshifted, airing a half-hour later (after a newscast or syndicated programming if the station does not run news programming) but are shifted due to the time zone differences (a bigger issue with first-run late night programs that air after 12:30 a.m. Eastern Time since the later start time may subject these programs to a potentially decreased audience). Many Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, and some independent stations carry a prime time newscast that is similarly affected by the timeshifting of the prime time schedule, meaning that if said late evening newscast starts at 9:00 p.m. Mountain Time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Pacific time zone would air its news at 10:00 p.m.\n\n"}
{"id": "46246520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46246520", "title": "Electronic visit verification", "text": "Electronic visit verification\n\nElectronic visit verification (often referred to as \"EVV\") was patented and invented by a nurse who also is a technologist, entrepreneur and Home Health Care Consultant and Domain Expert. In 1996 Michelle Boasten, RN designed and created the first clinical documentation information system for Home Health, Home Care and Hospice. EVV was one part of an overall and comprehensive design for the industry that sits under the umbrella term of \"Home Health Care\". Her invention and work are well documented. The exhaustive patent can be reviewed at the US Patent and Trademark website. \n\nIn 1999, Thomas Hoyer, the senior and Chief Policy Maker for Post-Acute Regulations for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, formerly HCFA) invited Michelle Boasten, RN to the Baltimore CMS offices to demonstrate EVV. At that meeting, he congratulated the invention and predicted that it would take two decades to see EVV legislation requiring EVV to be mandated as a practice within every Medicare and Medicaid agency providing publicly funded home visits to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Mr. Hoyer's testimony regarding his work in Post-Acute Regulatory Policy can be found in the CMS Oral History Project that documents the design and implementation of all Medicare and Medicaid Regulations. This 874-page document at the CMS Website helps to explain to any reader the history of Medicare and Medicaid's design by those who created, drafted and authored the system.\n\nRecognizing that EVV was a critical part of the entire documentation process, the patent covers the entire scope of the work. EVV has been sectioned out because of its enormous impact on bringing accountability to the industry. Indeed EVV is a method used to verify visit activity for Home Health (Skilled Service), Home Care (Personal Care Service) and Hospice (End-of-life Service) . This accountability measure will help to ensure that patients are not neglected. EVV can and should cut down on fraudulently documented home visits, and is the means of electronically verifying that a caregiver is physically present with the patient. EVV monitors locations of caregivers and is mandated by certain states, including Texas and Illinois. Other states do not mandate it, but use it as part of its Medicaid fraud oversight created by the passing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. It is also widely used by employers of home healthcare providers to verify employee's locations and hours of work as well as document patient care. Today, most states and other payers rely on EVV as a more effective monitoring tool than a hand-signed document.\n\nElectronic Visit Documentation | Caring Magazine Article\n\nWhile verification of a visit using EVV (\"Electronic Visit Verification\") is important, it doesn’t universally address the scope of the data set that is collected or the timely integration with the provider’s EMR system. EVD (\"Electronic Visit Documentation\") includes EVV-related date, time, and location, but also services, tasks, and other discipline specific information that makes up a complete record of the patient encounter.\n\nBecause EVD solutions integrate tightly with a provider’s EMR system, timely management of field staff can occur, enabling providers to effectively respond to scheduling, clinical, or service exceptions. EVD also yields precise productivity reporting, efficient payroll processing, and generates accurate,and timely claims.\n\nThis article, published in Caring Magazine in July, 2011, describes how EVD can help facilitate a proactive approach to combating fraud and abuse and discusses payer models that best enable home health agencies to provide accurate, accountable services.\n\nElectronic visit verification was created to help cut down on fraud and ensure that people receive the documented care they need. EVV was designed to help verify that services billed for home healthcare are for actual visits made. The passing of the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010 made provisions for the cut down of fraud and over-payments, requiring states to stop Medicaid payments to providers when there is credible evidence of fraud. At least 10 states implemented an office of inspector general to oversee Medicaid fraud investigations, with many moving towards a system of verifying home healthcare visits in order to help reduce fraud.\n\nSeveral states have introduced electronic visit verification with some mandating it for home healthcare. In January 2014, Illinois became the first state to mandate the use of EVV when the Department of Human Services required it for its home services program. As of June 1, 2015, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission mandates that electronic visit verification be used for all home healthcare visits billed to the state. The state of Ohio began the process of implementing an electronic verification system that would be used starting in 2016. It estimated the use of EVV will save the state approximately $9.5 million in its first two years of use. Other states that use but do not mandate EVV include Louisiana, Alaska, and Tennessee.\n\nElectronic visit verification is widely used throughout the healthcare industry, not solely by government entities. Companies use it for compliance and quality assurance. Employers of home healthcare providers use it to verify employee's locations as well as document patient care. It can also be used to verify hours of work and document time sheets for healthcare workers.\n\nHealth care fraud includes health insurance fraud, drug fraud, and medical fraud. Health insurance fraud occurs when a company or an individual defrauds an insurer or government health care program, such as Medicare (United States) or equivalent State programs. The manner in which this is done varies, and persons engaging in fraud are always seeking new ways to circumvent the law. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the False Claims Act, most commonly under the \"qui tam\" provisions which rewards an individual for being a \"whistleblower\", or relator (law).\n\nElectronic visit verification is mainly done through the use of GPS tracking and computer software. It can also include the use of telephone based systems where healthcare workers can call-in from each location. GPS can be used to track the location of nurses, or a \"check-in\" system can be used requiring healthcare providers to clock in when they are at a home visit.\n\nUsing an EVV solution whether a mobile device or a home telephone in electronic based visit verification caregivers authenticate themselves by entering in their unique ID and password. This ID and password are known and controlled ONLY by the caregiver. The combination of this unique ID and the calling from the patient’s phone creates this electronic signature. Some EVV companies also utilize 2-Factor security requiring yet a 3rd randomly generated code that users receive on a special One-Time password device or key chain.\n\nSome companies use Automatic Number Identification (ANI) technology in order to capture the exact address of a landline phone call and the patient’s telephone number. This is the same technology that the E-911 people use because it cannot be blocked and it is delivered electronically to the system with the phone call. This allows it to be 100% reliable. The system also time-stamps every call with the exact time the call was made.\n\nSome EVV systems uses the telephone number captured from the telephone company to match the patient’s telephone number that is stored in the patient’s profile record in the database. With this match, the caregiver does not have to know or key in the patient-ID.\n\nANI enables EVV companies to capture the billing telephone number of patients even if the patient uses caller ID blocking because ANI delivers information electronically. This ensures that the system is 100% reliable in reporting patients’ locations. The system also time-stamps the arrival and departure calls every caregiver makes. In addition, the system uses the telephone number captured from the telephone company to match the patient’s telephone number stored in the patient’s record in your database. This feature of the system means that when caregivers call to report data, they don’t have to key in the ID number of patients.\n\nWhile EVV is used by employers to track employees and determine their compensation and to verify payroll of its caregivers and nurses. synchronizing key information pertinent to the visit in an almost real-time manner. This allows the caregiver to have the most up-to-date information available to them when they call in to document the visit. Collecting EVV and EVD data is very important, but once the data is collected, it has to be entered into the EMR system for documentation, billing and payroll. This is where some EVV companies like take EVV to the next level, integrating with over a dozens of the major EMR companies to seamlessly pass the collected EVV and EVD data automatically to the backend billing and payroll system. Tight integration for a seamless process is helpful in reducing the number of manual touch points a visit has to go before it can be billed.\n\nSome of the enhance features that EVV providers offer when integrating with back-end EMR systems can include:\n\nElectronic visit verification software integrates with payroll systems that allow companies to employ a cloud-based system that integrates with a mobile app to coordinate schedules, billing, payroll, communication, and patient documentation. Nurses can update patient files with the system while also submitting working hours to their employers. In contrast, other companies provide a telephone and computer-based system for verification, similar to the system implemented in the state of Texas in 2015.\n\n"}
{"id": "3522474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3522474", "title": "Enga language", "text": "Enga language\n\nEnga is a language of the East New Guinea Highlands spoken by a quarter-million people in Enga Province, Papua New Guinea. It has the largest number of speakers of any native language in New Guinea, and is second over all after Papuan Malay. \nAn Enga-based pidgin is used by speakers of Arafundi languages.\n\nThe Enga contain more than 150,000 people that occupy the mountainous region ranging from Mount Hagen and westward to Porgera. Enga people are known to be sedentary gardeners that grow sweet potatoes as their staple crop. Coffee and pyrethrum are also grown as cash crops in their culture and they also keep pigs, cattle, and fowls. Pigs, pearls, shells, axes, and plumes are items of wealth and signify social occasions when exchanged or circulated. Enga clans have an definite boundaries defining their homesteads across the territory and have been known to fight with each other over land, women, and vengeance. Men and women traditionally occupy different homes because it it believed that women are unclean and can be dangerous to men. The Enga culture does not include a chief or headman, but instead the wealthy men have the political and administrative control. \n\nVowel sounds include /i e ɑ o u/. \nA /k/ can range to sounding like a fricative between low and back vowels. /t/ is pronounced as an /r/ sound intervocalically. /ts/ may also be realised as [s] . All final vowels are devoiced. Alveolar stops /t, ⁿd/ may be realised as retroflex sounds /ʈ, ᶯɖ/.\n\nThe Enga alphabet includes 21 different letters, only two of which not being in the English alphabet. \n\nLike the English language, Enga nouns use the determiners \"dóko\" and \"méndé\" as \"the\" and \"a, some, or else\" respectively. \n\nAkáli dóko epe-ly-á-mo.\n\n\"man the come-\"PRES\n\n\"The man is coming.\"\n\nAkáli méndé epe-ly-á-mo.\n\n\"man a come-PRES\"\n\n\"A man is coming.\" \n\nNoun classes in Enga have not been studied in great detail just yet, however it is shown to be based primarily on syntactic features. These classes include animates, pronouns, body parts, inanimates, locationals, events, colors, inner states, and minor classes. Nouns may also be inflected for cases such as agentive \"AG ,\" instrumental \"INST,\" possessive \"POSS,\" locative \"LOC\", and temporal. In the chart below it shows the case distribution and the noun classes in relation to one another. \n\nAnimates can occur in different subclasses such as proper names. Some examples of animates can include \"takánge\" (father), \"endángi\" (mother), \"Aluá\" (a man's name), \"Pasóne\" (a woman's name), or \"mená\" (pig). All of which would include a determiner being either demonstrative or indefinite and can be with the agentive or possessive cases, but not used instrumentally or locative. Pronouns in the Enga language can easily be identified and can vary from dialects:\n\n\nThese pronouns are similar to animates in that determiners may occur in agentive, and possessive cases, but not used instrumentally or locative. Body parts are in the animate class and can include words like \"kíngi\" (arm), \"pungí\" (liver), and \"yanúngí\" (skin, body). These differ from the previous classes in which they may have a determiner occur either instrumentally or locative, but not in the agentive or possessive cases. Location nouns are used to determine the place. These words can include \"kákasa\" (bush), \"Wápaka\" (Wabag- a place), or \"Lakáipa\" (Lagaipa- a river). This class only uses a determiner in the location case and nothing else.\n\nThe noun morphology of Enga is an exclusively suffixing language. These suffixes are generally the last member of the noun phrase, being either the determiner or the adjective. This expresses the inflectional categories of the noun such as tense, aspect, person, number, gender or mood. The suffixes can be broken down into two main groups: case suffixes and others. Case suffixes are exclusively expressed in noun and noun phrases while other suffixes can be on either noun and noun phrases or verb and verb phrases. Enga differentiates nouns from noun phrases though the case endings. There are seven different cases in which these are formally marked: associative \"-pa\"(only two)/ \"-pipa\" (two or more), agentive \"-me/-mi,\" instrumental \"-me/mi,\" possessive \"-nya,\" locative \"-nya/-sa/-ka,\" temporal \"-sa/-nya/-pa,\" and vocative \"-oo.\" Other suffixes, besides case suffixes, are broken into six different categories and occur only on nouns. There is the conjunctive suffix \"-pi\" meaning 'and' or 'even', two different suffixes \"-le\"meaning 'rather' or \"-yalé\" 'like' to indicate similarity, two different suffixes \"-mba\" 'very' or an argumentative \"-mba\" to indicate emphasis or contrast. These two forms of \"-mba\"differ in meaning as well as tone. When it is used in a argumentative sense it is said with a higher tone than previous syllables versus when it is used to emphasize.\n\nAlthough it includes conjunctive suffixes, Enga does not actually include any conjunction words such as 'and' other than \"pánde\" 'or'. Instead those conjunctive suffixes are used to combine the noun or noun phrase with the all the noun phrases and then typically followed by the determiner.\n\nThe verb morphology of Enga is an incredibly complex concept in the grammar of the language. This is due to the lack of subordinating or coordinating conjunctions such as 'and' or 'because', the lack of modal auxiliaries such as 'can' or 'want', and the lack of prepositions such as 'for' or 'to'. Instead, Enga uses a nearly unlimited number of concepts and kinds of actions expressed through different grammatical devices. The verb is known to dominate the Enga language. The main verb of a sentenced is always expressed at the end. When there is a question, the suffix \"-pe/-pi\" will occur at the end. \n\nAkáli dokó-mé mená dóko p-i-á-pe?\n\nman DET-AG pig DET hit-PAST\n\n\"Did the man hit the pig?\"\n\nVerb morphology in Enga, much like its noun morphology, is exclusively suffixing. There are two different categories in which the verb can be: person-number and tense-mode. There are five different tenses in Enga. This includes a future tense, a present tense, and three different past tenses. The immediate past refers to actions that occurred within the day. The near past refers to actions that occurred the previous day, a time in which the speaker does not recall, or a time before the previous day but is intending on comparing it to other events in the past. Finally, the far past refers to actions that occurred before the previous day. In terms of person-number, Enga expresses both singular, and plural verbs. However, a dual is also expressed when referring to actions or events that involve exactly two characters or two actions. The verb morphology has only one exception being that verbs are expressed with a prefix \"na-.\"\n\nIn sentences that express two different subjects or two different actions collectively, there unfortunately is no conjunction like most English speakers are used to. For example the sentence \"He went and worked\" it would expressed as the following:\n\nBaá p-é-á. Baa-mé kalái p-i-á.\n\nhe go-PAST. he-AG work do-PAST.\n\n\"He went.\" \"He worked.\"\n\nWhen conjoined, instead of\n\nBaa p-e-a-pi baa-me kalai p-i-a.\n\nIt would be \n\nBaa-mé pá-o kalái p-i-á.\n\nhe-AG go-O work do-PAST\n\n\"He went and worked.\"\n\nThere are three different temporal suffixes. The \"-o\" marker expresses the originating, existing, or happening during the same period of time. In verbs that end in a high vowel it would be changed to a \"-u\" marker. The second temporal suffix if the \"-la\" marker which indicates consecutiveness between sentences with the same subject. Finally, the \"-pa\" marker conjoins sentences with different subjects but still contain consecutiveness. \n\nBaa-mé andá-ka pitu-ú kalái pi-ly-a-mó.\n\nshe-AG house-LOC sit-O work do-PRES\n\n\"She is working while she is sitting in the house.\"\n\nBaa-mé kalái pé-ta-la yólé ny-í-á.\n\nhe-AG work do-COM-LA wage get-PAST\n\n\"Having done the work, he received his wage.\"\n\nNamba-mé meé pyó-o kat-e-ó-pa baa-mé kalái andáke p-i-á.\n\nI-AG for no reason do-O stand-PAST-TEMP he-AG work big do-PAST\n\n\"While I was doing nothing he did a lot of work.\" \n\nOr\n\n\"I did nothing and then he did a lot of work.\"\n\nThere are two different causal suffixes \"-pa\" and \"-sa.\" When the verb ends in a suffixed vowel regarding the past, these two suffixes are added together to fully conjugate the verb. \n\nBaá-mé kalái pyá-a ná-ep-e-a-mo-pa nambá tánge-me kalái ná-i-o. \n\nhe-AG work do-INF NEG-come-PAST-CAUS I sefl-AG work NEG-do-PAST\n\n\"Since he didn't come to work, I didn't work myself.\"\n\nNamba-mé kalái pyá-a ná-ep-e-o-pa/sa baá tánge-me kalái ná-p-i-a.\n\nI-AG work do-INF NEG-come-PAS-CAUS he self-AG work NEG-do-PAST\n\n\"Since I didn't come to work, he didn't work himself.\"\n\nEnga also includes conditional suffixes. These help distinguish what is considered 'real' conditions and 'irreal' conditions. A real condition is one in which real consequences can occur versus an irreal condition which denies the reality of the actions that are expressed as well as their consequences. To express a real conditional clause in the future tense the suffix \"-mo/-no\" are added to the verb with the addition of \"kandao dóko\" followed immediately after. For example when connecting the following two sentences: \n\nAkáli dóko p-é-á.\n\nman DET go-PAST\n\n\"The man went.\"\n\nand\n\nÉnda dóko p-á-a-mo.\n\nwoman DET go-PAST-AUG.\n\n\"The woman went.\"\n\nTogether, as a conditional clause, it would form:\n\nAkáli dóko alémbo pá-t-a-mo kanda-ó dóko énda dóko wámba andípu p-á-a-mo.\n\nman DET (day before yesterday) go-FUT-AUG see-O DET woman DET (before today) go-PAST-AUG \n\n\"If the man went the day before yesterday, then the woman went earlier today.\"\n\nThe crucial difference of the Enga language is that the main verb of the sentence will always be found in sentence-final position. This concept causes varying structures based on the type of sentence. In declarative sentences that include a nominal subject and object, the subject will precede the object. This particular word order is known as subject-object-verb or SOV. \n\nAkáli dokó-mé mená dóko p-í-á.y\n\nman DET-AG pig DET hit-PAST\n\n\"The man hit the pig.\"\n\n"}

It is published by the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) which is under the UK's Joint Forces Command and based in Shrivenham, Wiltshire.\n\nOne of the main findings of \"Global Strategic Trends out to 2040\" is that the era out to 2040 will be a time of transition, characterised by instability both in the relations between states, and in the relations between groups within states. During this timeframe significant global trends will include; climate change, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, a resurgence in ideology and a shift in global power from West to East. The struggle to establish an effective system of global governance, is likely to be a central theme of the era.\n\nThe analysis conducted in Global Strategic Trends was recently highlighted in the UK Public Administration Select Committee Report on Who does UK National Strategy?\n\nComments included:\n\nProfessor Peter Hennessy - \"\"You have to have as a good a system for horizon scanning as you possibly can, with all the necessary caveats. For example, we haven’t talked about it yet, but the one that I find the most helpful was an institutionalisation of something that was done in the last defence review, the DCDC people at Shrivenham, the “Shrivenham Scans” as I call them, I find them absolutely fascinating...\n\"...they produced a very good one [scan], the bulk of which was made public in time for this review and, as far as I can see, it’s having no salience at all in the way the SDSR is being cut—yet another example of an own goal and being less than the sum of our parts. But I’m not defeatist in the way that you might—I suspect you’re teasing me on this because you’re not an opt out of the world man either, are you? It’s not for me to ask you questions.\"\"\"\n\nProfessor Hew Strachan - \"Strategic trends stress those things that are likely to happen to the world, but not much of what they do really focuses on what the United Kingdom is trying to do. It’s extraordinary that DCDC is at Shrivenham, at that distance, (quite apart from the other things that have happened to it), rather than in London and central to the processes that we’re talking about. Professor Hennessy mentioned just now the publication last year of a document called “The Future Character of Conflict”, which was designed to address precisely what its title says, but its arguments are nowhere evident in current thinking in relation to strategy, let alone in relation to the Strategic Defence and Security Review.\"\n\nMr Tom Mckane (Director Strategy MOD) - \"As to how these documents are produced, within the department we have the benefit of the Development Concepts and Doctrine Centre, who produce long range views of the world. Their document “Global Strategic Trends” I think you are familiar with. That type of document feeds into the work of the staff at the centre of the department who are responsible for assisting ministers and the Defence Board to think about defence strategy.\"\n\nRecommendation in Written evidence submitted by Professor Julien Lindley-French - \"Cross-government structures under the NSC/Cabinet Office should ideally include a Strategy Group made up of both officials and non-government experts to build on the Stratefic Trends work of DCDC with a specific remit to establish likely forecasts and context for Intelligence and Planning.\"\n\n\n"}

It is considered a form of BDSM.\n\nThere are number of activities that qualify as impact play.\n\nIn erotic spanking the sub is struck either with the top's open hand, or a rigid implement such a paddle, cane or riding crop. In the latter case the activity is often referred to as \"paddling\", \"caning\" or \"cropping\". The usual targets for spanking are the buttocks and inner or outer thighs.\n\nIn erotic flagellation the sub is struck with a flexible implement such a whip or belt. Whips are classified by how many \"falls\" they have:\n\nFor safety, impact play should be done on areas of the human body well protected by fat or muscle; spots to avoid include the kidneys, neck, tailbone, hipbones, the head and all joints. The usual targets for flagellation are the buttocks and the two areas of the upper back below the shoulder blades. With care, the thighs, the backs of the calves and the chest can be targets as well. Breasts are another potential, but high-risk, target and should only be used with experience.\n\nThe use of a whip means that the Top must take great care to hit the intended target area, and avoid \"wrapping\"; when a whip or flogger makes contact with the target area somewhere up its length and the remaining length wraps around the sub's body to deliver a sharp, non-erotic, and possibly injurious off-target blow, such as to the hipbones or ribs. The longer the falls, the more skill is required by the Top to land a safe blow. Advanced flogging techniques use a pair of floggers employed in a martial arts style alternating pattern, a technique commonly referred to as \"florentining\" or \"florentine flogging.\"\n\nLess common forms of impact play include punching and face slapping.\n\nThe sensations produced by impact play depend on the area in which the impact is concentrated. Wide implements such as an open hand, paddle or flogger produce a dull \"thuddy\" sensation. Narrow implements such as a cane, riding crop, belt or single tail produce a sharp \"stingy\" sensation.\n\nA slapper or smacker may also be used. This consists of a broad (3 to 4 inch wide) semi flexible leather paddle with rounded and tapered edges, designed to minimize the severity of tip strike.\n\n\n"}

Later, to avoid confusion with other types of sinfonia/symphony, the term \"Italian overture\" was used more frequently.\n\nThe structure of the Italian overture/sinfonia was the base from which the classical multi-movement cycle - used in genres including the symphony, concerto, and sonata - developed around the middle of the 18th century.

He was disciple of authors T.N. Srikantaiah and Kuvempu. His literary career spans over decades in which he wrote over thirty-four biographies in Kannada language and other works including children's literature. He campaigned for the promotion of Kannada language. He had received Pampa Prashasti (1998), Padma Shri (2001) and the Karnataka Ratna (2008) awards for his contributions in literature and education. He became a centenarian in 2015 and died on 30 May 2016.\n\nGowda was born on 6 July 1915 in the village called Chakkere in the Channapatna taluk of Ramanagara district in Karnataka state. He was born in a poor family and had three siblings. As his parents could not afford to educate all, only his eldest brother went to school and Gowda would graze goats. Having passion for education, Gowda would let go goats on their own and instead come and listen to teachers from outside near a school window. He recollects that on one such day when the goats entered a wealthy landlord's farm and destroyed the crop, his father beat him and the school principal then rescued him and admitted him in third standard, also providing him with uniform and books.\n\nGowda later went on to study in Bangalore for intermediate classes and completed his BA in Mysore. He wanted to do his BA with History as his major subject but opted for Kannada when he came to know that notable author Kuvempu would be teaching it. Gowda had admired Kuvempu's works long before getting associated with him as his student. After completing BA in 1941, he went on to do post graduates MA in Kannada. With little scope of getting a lectureship in any college, he took up a clerical job at the Secretariat in Vidhan Soudha at Bangalore. He concurrently studied law but did not pursue it as career when he got post of Kannada lecturer at the Central College, Bangalore. After three years, he went on to teach at Maharaja's College, Mysore. Here, he again was associated with Kuvempu and later credited him for his \"academic and spiritual enrichment\".\n\nGowda served as the Vice Chancellor of Mysore University from 1969 to 1975 for consecutive two terms. In his tenure as VC he started various post graduates courses in Home Sciences, Criminology, Law and Journalism at the university. He was known for his sharp criticism of the then government policies. While reappointing him as the VC for the second term, the then state governor Mohan Lal Sukhadia requested \"please try to remember that when you criticize the government, do so mildly\". He also wished to start an Afro-Dravidian Institute of post graduate studies called \"The Kuvempu Vidyavardhaka Trust\", which did not happen because of inadequate government funding.\n\nGowda actively campaigned for promotion of Kannada language. Various encyclopaedias were published in Kannada after his efforts. Kannada was also used in examinations conducted by Karnataka Public Service Commission. He wrote over thirty-four biographies in Kannada language of eminent personalities like Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Ram Manohar Lohia, Motilal Nehru, Basaveshwara and more. He also wrote books for children on Albert Einstein, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rabindranath Tagore, Marie Curie and more. He published various books on Kuvempu and \"Soundarya Yogi Kuvempu\" narrates Gowda's experiences with Kuvempu. In 1970 he chaired the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana which was held at Bangalore.\n\nOn 31 January 2006, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Gowda observed a dawn-to-dusk fast seeking classical language status for Kannada. Earlier he had fasted once before for same cause and also threatened to return his Padma Shri that was conferred on him in 2001. Eventually he did not return the award as he was hopeful of a favourable reply from the then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. In 2014, ex-minister P. G. R. Sindhia requested government to confer upon him the title of poet laureate (\"Rashtrakavi\") for his contributions to the Kannada language.\n\nIn October 2015, Gowda and five others returned the Aralu Sahitya prize, awarded to them by the Kannada Sahitya Parishat and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation in 2011, to protest the perceived delays into the investigation of writer M. M. Kalburgi's death.\n\nGowda was married to Savithramma. Their son J. Shashidhar Prasad was also Vice Chancellor of University of Mysore. Gowda became a centenarian in 2015. In a felicitation program organized by Kannada Catholic Christian Association on the occasion, he mentioned that he had been worshipping Jesus Christ for past 25 years and had no faith in Hindu Gods as the religion is based on \"discrimination\". He died in Mysore on 30 May 2016 from heart failure at the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research where he was admitted on 28 May. His last rites were performed at the Kuvempu Trust, Mysore. His body was laid in repose at his residence in Jayalakshmipuram and at the Chandrakala Hospital. Politicians and writers like H. D. Deve Gowda, H. D. Kumaraswamy, S. M. Krishna and M. Veerappa Moily paid tributes to him.\n\nGowda received his first doctorate in 1975 from the Karnatak University, Dharwad. In 1998, he received doctorate from Mysore University and in 2006 an honorary doctorate was accorded to him by the Kuvempu University at Shimoga. He also received Nadoja Award conferred by the Hampi University. On his centenary, a 30-minutes documentary was made by director Kesari Harvoo for the Department of Kannada and Culture.\n\n\n"}

He was studying Oriental languages at Jesus College, Oxford when Sir Godfrey Rolles Driver, a lecturer in Semitic philology, nominated him to join the Scrolls editorial team.\n\nAlthough Strugnell had no previous experience in palaeography, he learned very quickly how to read the scrolls. He would be involved in the Dead Sea Scrolls project for more than 40 years.\n\nStrugnell was educated at St. Paul's School, in London. He took a double first in Classics and Semitics at the University of Oxford but never finished his dissertation and had only a master's degree.\n\nDespite not having completed his doctorate, Strugnell was given a position at the Oriental Institute of Chicago in 1956-1957, where he met his future wife, Cecile Pierlot, whose father had been Prime Minister of Belgium during the Second World War. He was away from his scrolls again from 1960 to 1967, bow at Duke University, but he returned in summers to continue his efforts in Jerusalem. Still without his doctorate, as he would be for the rest of his life, Strugnell served from 1966 to 1991 as Professor of Christian Origins at Harvard. He succeeded Pierre Benoit as editor-in-chief of the scrolls in 1984, a position he held until 1990. He was then responsible for bringing Elisha Qimron and Emanuel Tov to work on the scrolls, breaking the longstanding exclusion of Israeli scholars. At the same time, he kept Theodor Gaster and Robert Eisenman from having access to the scrolls, a situation that was rectified when Strugnell was removed from his post and the scrolls (such as those at the Huntington Library in California) were opened to the wider scholarly community for the first time.\n\nHis production of editions of texts was not large, but they were all exceptionally important, including \"The Angelic Liturgy\", later published as \"Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifices\" (Shirot 'olat ha-Shabbat), and \"An Unpublished halakhic Letter from Qumran\", later known as MMT [or 4QMMT] from the Hebrew (Miqtsat Ma'asei ha-Torah). The last text was edited with Elisha Qimron, who did much of the work. The texts helped to enrich scholarly knowledge of the cultus of the writers of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nNevertheless, he was a slow worker and the times had changed since it had been acceptable to keep the scrolls protected from what was once considered misuse and hasty publication.\n\nFor many years, scholars had accepted the lack of access to unpublished texts and the slow publication of the texts. That changed during Strugnell's editorship, as there came a growing movement of scholars calling for access to the Scrolls. By then, his health had deteriorated. Only one volume was produced under his general editorship, \"The Greek Minor Prophets Scroll from Nahal Hever\", by Emanuel Tov.\n\nIn 1990, Strugnell gave an interview to \"Ha'aretz\" in which he said that Judaism was a \"horrible religion\" which \"should not exist\". He also said that Judaism was \"a Christian heresy, and we deal with our heretics in different ways. You are a phenomenon that we haven't managed to convert — and we should have managed\". \n\nThere was immediate condemnation of his comments, including an editorial in the \"New York Times\". As a result of the interview, Strugnell was forced to take early retirement on medical grounds at Harvard, and he was finally removed from his editorial post on the scrolls project, the Antiquities Authority, which cited his deteriorating health as reason for his removal. \n\nStrugnell later said that he was suffering from stress-induced alcoholism and manic depression when he gave the interview. He insisted that his remarks were taken out of context and that he meant \"horrible\" only in the Miltonian sense of \"deplored in antiquity\". In a 2007 interview in \"Biblical Archaeology Review\", Frank Moore Cross said that despite Strugnell's comments, which were based on a theological argument of the early Church Fathers that Christianity superseded Judaism, Strugnell had very friendly relationships with a number of Jewish scholars, some of whom signed a letter of support for him which was published in the \"Chicago Tribune\", January 4, 1991, p. N20.\n\nStrugnell had come increasingly under controversy for his slow progress in publishing the scrolls, and his refusal to give scholars free access to the unpublished scrolls. Some argue the removal of Strugnell from his editorial post ended the more than three-decade blockade that he and other Harvard-educated scholars, such as Notre Dame's Eugene Ulrich, had maintained to keep other scholars from accessing the scrolls. The blockade on the publication of the scrolls effected by Strugnell and other members of Harvard's academic community was broken by the combined efforts of Hershel Shanks of the \"Biblical Archaeology Review\" (who had personally waged a 15-year campaign to release the scrolls) and Ben Zion Wacholder of Hebrew Union College, along with his student, Martin Abegg, who published the first facsimile of the suppressed scrolls in 1991. Strugnell insisted that he tried to publish the scrolls as quickly as he could but that his team was the limiting factor.\n\nShortly after Strugnell was dismissed from his post, he was institutionalized in McLean Hospital for a period. At the time of his death, he was Professor Emeritus at the Harvard Divinity School.\n\nIn 2003, City Seminary of Sacramento acquired Strugnell's library of over 4,000 volumes, including texts on Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Greek and Latin; large sections on classical studies, Patristics (Early Church writings), apocryphal, and pseudepigraphal (falsely-attributed) literature; and books on Judaism, Christianity, Hebrew Bible, and New Testament studies. A highlight of the collection is Strugnell's personal copy of the Dead Sea Scrolls \"concordance\".\n\nThe early scrolls team made a concordance of the words in the unpublished texts to assist their own work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2401119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2401119", "title": "Kutenai language", "text": "Kutenai language\n\nThe Kutenai language (), also Kootenai, Kootenay, Ktunaxa, and Ksanka, is the native language of the Kutenai people of Montana and Idaho in the United States and British Columbia in Canada. It is typically considered a language isolate, unrelated to the Salishan family of languages spoken by neighboring tribes on the coast and in the interior Plateau. The Kutenai also speak \"ʾa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam\", Ktunaxa Sign Language.\n\nKutenai is typically considered a language isolate. There have been attempts to place Kutenai in either a Macro-Algonquian or Macro-Salishan language family, most recently with Salish, but they have not been generally accepted as proven.\n\nLike other languages in the area, Kutenai has a rich inventory of consonants and a small inventory of vowels, though there are allophones of the three basic phonemic vowels. The lack of a phonemic distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants is much as in other languages of the area. Because Kutenai is on the periphery of this linguistic area, the loss of a rich lateral inventory is consistent with other nearby languages, which now have only one or two lateral consonants. One such language group contains the Sahaptian languages, which have had a similar loss of laterals. Nez Perce has , believed to be the lateral affricate in the proto-language. Nez Perce, like Kutenai, lies in the eastern periphery of the Northwest Linguistic area. \n\nAnother typological analysis investigates the lexical category of preverbs in Kutenai. This lexical category distinguishes neighboring Algonquian languages, found to the east of the Kootenay Rocky Mountains and near the Kutenai linguistic area. Another typological relationship Kutenai could have is the presence of its obviation system.\n\nAs of 2012, the Ktunaxa people in Canada are working on a language revitalization effort. Tribal councils from the separate communities of the Ktunaxa nation have contributed a selection of audio recordings of Kutenai words and phrases to the FirstVoices website, an online catalogue of the indigenous languages of North America. As of November 2017, the Ktunaxa webpage had 2500 words and 1114 phrases archived, stories and songs recorded, a language learning app available, and First Voices tutor. The FirstVoices Tutor provides lessons and practices in the given language. The Ktunaxa Language app, accessible for iOS devices, is a Ktunaxa dictionary which uses the audio recordings of words and phrases, and provides flashcards with audio, of the vocabulary found on the FirstVoices website.The Ktunaxa nation aims to target younger generations with the FirstVoices materials to teach fluency in the Kutenai language. \n\nOne such example is the ʔaq̓amcommunity of the Ktunaxa Nation, also known as St.Mary's band in Cranbrook B.C, which has a private elementary school called the ʔaq̓amnikSchool. This school, as well as providing standard BC curriculum, teaches the Ktunaxa language and cultural traditions of the people to younger generations. It also has an after school program and a program called Headstart, which helps adults of children up to the age of six learn about teaching the Ktunaxa culture and language to their children.\n\nThe Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation have founded the Salish Kootenai College, a tribal college on the Flathead reservation in Pablo, Montana. The college offers a certificate program in Native American studies, which requires that students have knowledge of the history and culture of the Salish and Ktunaxa people. The curriculum also offers classes in basic Kutenai language pronunciation and grammar. Some sources suggest that the knowledge and preservation of the native communities culture will contribute to the preservation of the communities language, but there is no evidence yet from the Salish Kootenai College to support this claim.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain College of British Columbia's main campus is in Crancrook B.C on the territory of the Ktunaxa people. As such, the college has collaborated with the Ktunaxa people for 40 years as of 2015. As well as offering indigenous studies classes, the Rocky Mountain College offers basic Ktunaxa classes online, KTUN-101 and KTUN-102, using the FirstVoices website as the primary learning resource. They also offer a Ktunaxa Workshop for beginner learners providing basic phrases and pronunciation, and cultural information of the Ktunaxa people.\n\nThe first grammar of Kutenai was compiled by Roman Catholic missionary Philippo Canestrelli, and was published in 1894 in Latin.(Online text here)\n\nIn 1918 Franz Boas published The Kutenai Tales, a transcription and translation of multiple Ktunaxa stories. The stories were gathered by Alexander F. Pierce in 1891 and Boas in 1914 , and told by members of the Ktunaxa people including Andrew Pierre, Numan Pierre, Joe Mission, Andrew Felix, and the major contributor from the community, a man referred to as Barnaby.\n\nPaul L. Garvin did various descriptive work describing the phonemics, morphology, and syllabification in Ktunaxa. He also has two sources of transcriptions of speakers talking.\n\nIn 1991 Lawrence Richard Morgan wrote a description of the Kutenai Language as his PhD dissertation through the University of California, Berkeley. This description is focused on how the language works and specifically defining the working parts of the language. Morgan's work is an exhaustive list of each grammatical particle, morpheme, and affix, with their respective environments and their varying forms.\n\nKutenai has no phonemic distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants.\nVowel length in Ktunaxa is also contrastive, so two words can be differentiated just by lengthening or shortening a vowel. Some such minimal pairs are the verbal stem 'to dig something up' and the noun '(steel animal) trap' and the verbal stem for 'to fall out in this direction/to fall out from somewhere' and 'the place where (someone is) sitting, one's place at a table' . Both pairs differ only in the length of the first vowel, [a] vs [a:].\nIn general terms, Kutenai is an agglutinative language, with many grammatical functions being served by both prefixes and suffixes, primarily on the verb, though some affixes select nouns as well. As mentioned above, a distinctive feature of Kutenai is its use of an obviation system as a way to track which entities and concepts are particularly central/salient to a story being told and as a grammatical way of clarifying the roles of each entity in sentences with two third-person arguments: \"Pronouns, nouns, verbs, and adverbs all take obviative markers\", making it particularly different from some more well-known obviation systems (like the Algonquian one, which allows for obviation only on third-person animate nouns). Kutenai also makes use of an inverse system.\" The language has an overt copula, \"ʔin\" `to be'.\n\nWord order in Kutenai can be flexible in response to discourse and pragmatic concerns. As is the case with many head-marking languages, it is rare to have both an overt subject and an overt object in a sentence since the morphology of the verb makes it clear who is acting on whom. Morgan states that if it \"is\" appropriate to express both arguments of a verb in a \"neutral\" context, VOS word order is preferred; however, it also alternates with VSO order. The pre-verbal position can be occupied by adverbs, as seen in these three examples:\n\nOne aspect of Kutenai that complicates word order somewhat is the fact that the verb is marked for first- or second-person subjects by \"affixal or clitic pronouns\" that precede the stem, \"hu/hun\" for 'I' and \"hin\" for 'you'. It is common in the orthography to write the pronouns as separate words, making it seem as if the word order is Subject Pronoun + Verb (+ Object).\n\nIn many languages, conditions for inverse include situations in which the first or second person is in the \"object\" role, and the third person is the \"subject\" as in 'She saw you/me.' In Kutenai, however, the situations use specific \"first-/second-person object\" morphology, separate from the inverse. As a consequence, Kutenai's inverse system is most clearly observable in interactions between third persons. The following two examples (from Dryer 1991) show the direct and inverse, respectively:\n\nKutenai subordinate/dependent clauses are marked with a \"k\" and a lack of indicative morphology on the verb, as are questions, nominalizations, and relative clauses. The \"k\" can cliticize to the material that follows it, as can be seen in this example.\n\n\n\n"}

This relates to cross-linguistic influence (CLI), a key topic in the field of second-language acquisition (SLA) that analyzes transfer effects from the L1 on later learned languages.\n\nUsing large-scale English data, NLI methods achieve over 80% accuracy in predicting the native language of texts written by authors from 11 different L1 backgrounds. This can be compared to a baseline of 9% for choosing randomly.\n\nThis identification of L1-specific features has been used to study language transfer effects in second-language acquisition. This is useful for developing pedagogical material, teaching methods, L1-specific instructions and generating learner feedback that is tailored to their native language.\n\nNLI methods can also be applied in forensic linguistics as a method of performing authorship profiling in order to infer the attributes of an author, including their linguistic background.\nThis is particularly useful in situations where a text, e.g. an anonymous letter, is the key piece of evidence in an investigation and clues about the native language of a writer can help investigators in identifying the source.\nThis has already attracted interest and funding from intelligence agencies.\n\nNatural language processing methods are used to extract and identify language usage patterns common to speakers of an L1-group. This is done using language learner data, usually from a learner corpus. Next, machine learning is applied to train classifiers, like support vector machines, for predicting the L1 of unseen texts.\nA range of ensemble based systems have also been applied to the task and shown to improve performance over single classifier systems.\n\nVarious linguistic feature types have been applied for this task. These include syntactic features such as constituent parses, grammatical dependencies and part-of-speech tags.\nSurface level lexical features such as character, word and lemma n-grams have also been found to be quite useful for this task. However, it seems that character n-grams are the single best feature for the task.\n\nThe Building Educational Applications (BEA) workshop at NAACL 2013 hosted the inaugural NLI shared task.

{"id": "55957674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55957674", "title": "Paharnic", "text": "Paharnic\n\nThe Paharnic (plural: \"Paharnici\"; also known as \"Păharnic\", \"Paharnec\", or \"Păharnec\"; Moldavian dialect: \"Ceașnic\", , \"Pakharnikos\", , \"Paharnik\") was a historical Romanian rank, one of the non-hereditary positions ascribed to the boyar aristocracy in Moldavia and Wallachia (the Danubian Principalities). It was the local equivalent of a Cup-bearer or \"Cześnik\", originally centered on pouring and obtaining wine for the court of Moldavian and Wallachian Princes. With time, it became a major administrative office and, in Wallachia, also had a lesser military function. The retinue of such boyars, usually called \"Păhărnicei\", was in both countries also a private army.\n\nDating back to ca. 1400, the \"Paharnici\" were at the forefront of political life in Wallachia over the following two centuries, often as a title associated with the Craiovești and Florescu boyars. Wallachian \"Paharnici\" were especially important during the 16th and 17th centuries, when they included figures such as Lupu Mehedințeanu, Șerban of Coiani, and Matei Basarab. They and other \"Paharnici\" established means of boyar protection against the social ascent of immigrant Greeks. Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu, himself a former \"Paharnic\", gave a privileged position to the \"Păhărnicei\", but put to death their controversial \"Paharnic\", Staico Bucșanu. Before 1700, figures associated with the Moldavian office included close relatives of the monarchs, such as Alexandru Coci and Ștefan Lupașcu Hâjdău. Though the office itself steadily declined in importance, it was still subjected to a meritocratic reform by Prince Dimitrie Cantemir.\n\nThe \"Paharnici\" grew in numbers and declined in political relevancy from ca. 1720, with the rise of the Phanariotes, and ultimately fell into a second class of boyars. Their descendants were recognized as a branch of the small boyardom, alongside the \"Păhărnicei\". While these became a rural middle class, the \"Paharnici\" offices were increasingly permeable to the commercial classes of the city. The three groups intertwined, with some \"Paharnici\", including Ianache Hafta and Manuc Bei, having a noted effect on the development of Bucharest. Various \"Paharnici\" also participated first-hand in the cultivation of Romanian nationalism, leading up to Gavril Istrati's clashes with the Greek \"Sacred Band\".\n\nFrom Moldavia, the office was for a while inherited by the Russian Empire, which preserved titular \"Paharnici\" in its Bessarabia Governorate. In both Moldavia and Wallachia, the Russian regime of 1834–1854 recognized a multitude of titular \"Paharnici\", from inspectors Ion Heliade Rădulescu and Constantin N. Brăiloiu to painter Constantin Lecca. The proliferation of \"Paharnici\" and other offices, taken up by Moldavian Princes Ioan and Mihail Sturdza, contributed to social tensions, and then to a failed revolutionary attempt. Following the Crimean War, the position of \"Paharnic\" was abolished, alongside all other historical titles. \n\n\"Paharnic\" is a Romanianized term, originating with the Church Slavonic variant, (\"Peharnik\"). Dimitrie Cantemir, the intellectual Prince of Moldavia, was the first to note that the institution was copied from the old Serbian nomenclature, as opposed to other boyar titles, which were originally Byzantine or (in one case) Hungarian. However, legal historian Ivan Biliarsky notes that both the Serbian and the Romanian term originate with a Byzantine office, the \"Pinkernes\", being its functional equivalents. The component Romanian term is \"pahar\" (\"glass\" or \"chalice\"), which reached Romanian either from the Hungarian \"pohár\" or the Serbo-Croatian \"pehar\". After passing through Slavonic, \"Paharnic\" acquired a form in historical Romanian, and Romanian Cyrillic, as , transliterated \"Păharnic\" (, rather than ). It was still codified in this manner by the early-18th-century scholar Anthim the Iberian.\n\nAll these terms continued to be spelled in Cyrillic for as long as the titles they represented were in use. However, attempts at Romanization were made as early as 1468, when \"Paharnic\" appeared as \"Poharnig\" in a Renaissance Latin document; this was also rendered as \"Paharnig\". In the 1670s, Miron Costin, using standardized Polish spellings, produced \"Paharnik\". Before 1600, Slavonic documents also admitted a Romanian translation, \"Canatnic\", created from the dialectal \"canată\", \"tiny mug\". \"Ceașnic\" was another Slavonic variant which acquired use in Moldavia, where it was generally spelled as ; it could also appear in Wallachia, but as . Both have their etymological source in \"Cześnik\", used by \"szlachta\" nobility to the north. A term originating from the Second Bulgarian Empire, (\"Picernic\"), only appears once, in 1392 Wallachia.\n\n\"Paharnici\" or similar were first mentioned in Wallachia under Mircea the Old (1386–1418) and in Moldavia under Alexander the Good (1400–1432). The Moldavian version of the office ranked it immediately after the \"Spatharios\"; in Wallachia, it was originally mentioned as below the \"Vistier\", who was fourth or fifth in line in the Boyar Council: the \"Ban\", \"Vornic\", \"Logothete\", and sometimes also the \"Spatharios\", ranked above them. A social and functional differentiation cut across these boyar classes. According to such typologies, some boyar offices were administrative or \"public\" (\"Ban\" or \"Logothete\"), while others, including \"Ban\" and \"Spatharios\", were purely military. \"Paharnici\" fell into a third category of offices, deemed \"courtly\" (\"de curte\")—alongside \"Cluceri\", \"Jitniceri\", \"Medelniceri\", \"Pitari\", \"Postelnici\", \"Slugeri\", and \"Stolnici\". \n\nAs summarized by historian Constantin Rezachevici, a \"Paharnic\"s function was \"to fill up the first cup at the prince's table, and while in the country he supervised the princely vineyards and made sure that these were well kept\". Biliarsky also notes that the \"Paharnic\" acted as a waiter and a wine taster, who made sure that the beverage was safe to drink, being thus \"close to and very highly trusted by the ruler.\" From the beginning, these attributes alternated with the business of state: in October 1407, \"Paharnic\" Iliaș \"Dumitrovscio\" was present on the Moldavian delegation which swore fealty to the Kingdom of Poland, and consequently fought at Grunwald. A variation of the office, already present in 1540s Moldavia, was the \"Paharnic\" in service to the Princess-consort.\n\nAlso in Moldavia, \"Paharnici\" had direct control over the \"Staroste\" of Cotnari, who produced the eponymous sweet wine variety, seen as the region's best, as well as over the wine regions of Dealu Morii, Hârlău, Huși, and Târgu Trotuș. After 1482, the Moldavian institution also appeared in the wine-rich Panciu, Putna County, which had been previously disputed between the two principalities. By 1700, the greater \"Paharnic\" was, \"ex officio\", the head of Putna's administration, while his assistant only controlled the princely vineyards of Huși. Historian N. Stoicescu proposes that the Wallachian \"Paharnici\" may have also exercised some control over the winemakers of Dealurile Buzăului. This function remains unattested, but is suggested by the \"Paharnici\" being traditionally reliant on support from that area, on the Wallachian border with Putna. \n\nIn tandem, \"Paharnici\" in both principalities operated as tax farmers, receiving a small contribution from all other winemakers. This was presented to them personally on September 14 of each year. Moldavia's \"Paharnic\" collected only the wine tithe known as \"vinărici\". For the Wallachians, the \"vinărici\" was set at 1,000 barrels of wine yearly, from the wineries of Argeș County (Ștefănești, Topoloveni) and Vâlcea County (Drăgășani). Here, another special tribute, also collected from private wine cellars, was generally known as \"păhărnicie\", and was primarily lucrative in Bucharest. 18th-century sources inform that the \"Paharnic\" of Wallachia also collected the wine tax known as \"cămănărit\", which had its origins in feudal aid (\"plocon\").\n\nThe \"Paharnici\" were assisted by their own private army, the \"Păhărnicei\" (\"little \"Paharnici\"\", singular \"Păhărnicel\"). At least originally, these were junior members of the aristocracy: the first known Moldavian \"Păhărnicel\", mentioned as such in December 1437, was a \"Pan\" Ureche. He had earlier been Iliaș I's \"Paharnic\", and went on to become his \"Vornic\" in 1438. At some point in or after 1479, Stephen the Great rewarded another \"Păhărnicel\", Cârstea, with the deeds to Coșești village. Also in Moldavia, \"Paharnici\" were the only ones mandated to pass judgment in cases involving their retinue. Other records show that they (assisted by the relevant \"Pârcălabi\") passed judgment in all cases directly involving wine, either at Cotnari or Hârlău. The \"Paharnici\" were nevertheless entirely subject to the Prince's expedient justice, as already shown in the 1480s, when Stephen the Great ordered the execution of his \"Paharnic\" Negrilă, for reasons unrecorded.\n\nDuring the Wallachian 15th century, the titles of \"Paharnic\" and \"Ban\" were closely associated with a family known as Craiovești. Its founder, Barbu I, emerged ca. 1431 as \"Paharnic\" of Alexander I Aldea, sitting on the Boyar Council, but was probably chased out of the country by Vlad II Dracul. This period highlighted the civil war between the houses of Dănești, to whom the Craiovești were loyal, and the family of Vlad II, or Drăculești. A differentiation of boyar offices first occurred in Wallachia under Dănești rulers. Vladislav II (1447–1456) created the Craiovești family as his \"Vlastelini\", presumably meaning \"strong\" or \"immovable boyars\". That category included the \"Paharnic\" alongside the \"Ban\", \"Vornic\", \"Logothete\" and other lesser dignities. Most of these functions (20/34) went to boyars who were also family with the Prince, descending from the earlier House of Basarab. \n\nLater in the 1450s, Vlad the Impaler staged a boyar purge, reportedly killing all of his Council who identified the Dănești as actual Princes. In 1482, Basarab Țepeluș, who also relegated the Craiovești, raised his \"Paharnic\" Mircea to a second position in the Council ranks. The first Craiovești Prince, Neagoe Basarab (reigned 1512–1521), assigned the office of \"Paharnic\" to a more distant relative, Drăghici Florescu, to whom he also gave ownership of Tismana. The \"Teachings\", a political treatise often attributed to Neagoe, go further in proposing that the office of \"Paharnic\" be assigned to foreign mercenaries, thus ensuring meritocracy. Historian P. P. Panaitescu notes that this detail, as well as the designation of \"Paharnici\" as \"Credinciari\", establishes that the book is a forgery.\n\nThe Wallachian \"Paharnic\" was also a rank in the feudal levy army, commanding the \"Păhărnicei\" as a mounted corps. The latter, alongside lesser boyars in service to the \"Paharnici\", formed a special military corps and fiscal category, separate from the retinues of other boyar ranks. There were probably 13 such \"orders\" in 1580s Moldavia, where the \"Păhărnicei\" themselves were still relevant landowners. Before 1600, a \"Păhărnicel\" Ionașcu owned the entire village of Drăgușeni, which his family later sold to Prince Miron Barnovschi. Nevertheless, the office of \"Paharnic\" in itself did not guarantee financial independence. In 1557, under Wallachia's Pătrașcu the Good, \"Paharnic\" Vlad of Bârsești became financially destitute and, as one record shows, even faced starvation.\n\nWith the delegation of military power came the \"Paharnic\"s involvement in more rebellions. This also coincided with the increase of power for the Ottoman Empire, which was Wallachia and Moldavia's suzerain power throughout the Late Medieval and Early Modern eras. In the early 1540s, a holder of the title, Stroe Florescu, followed Șerban of Izvorani and fought against Wallachian Prince Radu Paisie; both rebels were executed. At around the same time, Moldavia's Petru Rareș was facing boyar rebellions in Cârligătura County, confiscating a village from \"Paharnic\" Ștefan Mânjea and donating another to the loyalist replacement, Nicoară. The 1570s witnessed one of several wars between the two principalities, with Moldavia's John III occupying Bucharest, allowing Radu Paisie's putative grandson, Vintilă, to take over as Prince of Wallachia. This days-long reign was probably ended by the supporters of Alexandru Mircea, including a \"Paharnic\" Bratu. In the early 1580s, one of Vintilă's surviving brothers, Prince Petru Cercel, ordered the execution of another rebellious \"Paharnic\", Gonțea.\n\nIn 1595, Vintilă and Cercel's alleged brother, Michael the Brave, took up the anti-Ottoman cause in the Long Turkish War. Shortly after, he punished his \"Paharnic\" Iane of Boleasca, taking over Iane's estate at Daia. This was possibly a payback for cowardice shown in the battle of Călugăreni. Instead, Michael's other \"Paharnici\" were held in high esteem for their service, and received villages from Michael's personal land fund: Lupu Mehedințeanu took the villages of Dobra and Ponorălul; \"Paharnic\" Turturea was awarded Găuriciu. A mercenary commander, known as Necula \"Paharnic\", was also awarded the village of Roșiani, in Romanați County. \n\nAmong the holders of the \"Paharnic\" title since the days of Mihnea Turcitul was a matrilineal Craiovești, Șerban of Coiani, who successfully litigated over his family's assets. Șerban continued to serve under Michael the Brave and his son Nicolae Pătrașcu, selling his estates at Seaca de Pădure and Segarcea to the former. In 1600, having already conquered the Principality of Transylvania, Michael also extended his rule into Moldavia. The uprooted Movilești regime of Moldavia continued to exist in exile, receiving crucial backing from the loyalist \"Paharnic\" and diplomat, Ion Caraiman. The following year, during the troubles that followed Michael's downfall, Șerban of Coiani was elected Wallachian Prince by the boyar assembly at Sălătrucu, taking the new name of \"Radu Șerban\". \n\nThis new ruler extended his protection to Michael's other associates. Turturea was present by Michael's side at Câmpia Turzii, where Michael was assassinated. He rescued his lord's severed head and kept it as a relic. Radu Șerban's court also included Mehedințeanu as a \"Paharnic\", until 1611, when he defected to the Ottoman-appointed Prince, Radu Mihnea. The office of \"Paharnic\" was also a major station in the career of Matei Basarab, a junior Craiovești boyar; in 1612, Matei began using a personal seal that showed the \"Paharnic\" seated on a throne and carrying his special cane. Radu Șerban's regime, allied with the Holy Roman Empire, was finally ended by the Ottomans. The deposed Prince tried to return by way of Moldavia, supported by the local Prince, Alexandru Movilă. However, Costea Bucioc, the Moldavian \"Paharnic\", ended this campaign by refusing to fight.\n\nMehedințeanu, who continued to serve as \"Paharnic\", found himself at odds with the new establishment and especially the Greek immigrants, fleeing the country during the reign of Alexandru IV Iliaș (1616–1618). He returned as leader of a popular revolt, taking control of both Bucharest and Târgoviște, where he inspired an anti-Greek pogrom. Appointed Prince by the Ottomans, Gabriel Movilă handed Mehedințeanu over to Iskender Pasha, who ordered the \"Paharic\" impaled at Ciocănești. A decade later, under Leon Tomșa, the office of \"Paharnic\" was held by a Greek, Balasache Muselim, whose tenure sparked another revolt, which peaked at Bucharest and had Matei Basarab among its leaders. The movement was weakened when Prince Leon appointed locals to the higher offices, making Barbu Brădescu his new \"Paharnic\". Brădescu switched sides in 1632, helping to seize Wallachia's throne for Matei.\n\nIn ca. 1655, the \"Paharnic\"s private army was largely amassed on the border with Moldavia: in Buzău and Râmnicu Sărat Counties there were 300–400 \"Păhărnicei\". These were commanded by a Captain, 6 \"Iuzbași\", and 6 \"Ceauși\". By that moment in history, \"Paharnici\" had declined in relative importance. This was manifest under Matei Basarab, who ordered his new \"Paharnic\", Chisar Rudeanu, to be caned in the throne room, then jailed. Under his regime, the \"Păhărnicei\" and other servants of the \"Paharnic\" owed a yearly tax of 8 ducats, while boyars subordinated to the \"Spatharios\" paid 12. Both countries' \"Paharnici\" were soon outranked by the \"Stolnici\" and \"Comiși\"; in Wallachia, however, they continued to command the \"Păhărnicei\", and were also placed in charge of a new cavalry force, the \"Roșii\" (\"Redcoats\"). Both groups fought alongside the Ottoman Army in the Polish war of 1672.\n\nAfter 1650, some Wallachian \"Paharnici\" opposed the steady rise of the Cantacuzino family, whose scion Drăghici Cantacuzino also held the title in 1661–1662, while others embraced it. Among the anti-Cantacuzino boyars, 1660s \"Paharnic\" Constantin Vărzarul plotted, alongside Stroe Leurdeanu, to have Constantin I Cantacuzino unlawfully executed. Another such conflict erupted in the early 1680s between Prince Șerban Cantacuzino and his \"Paharnic\", Papa Buicescul (son of the \"Spatharios\" Diicul). Under the Cantacuzinos, the lesser \"Paharnici\" were all placed under the command of the greater \"Paharnic\", who organized them into a single military unit. By then, the armed retinues, and those of all other high-ranking boyars, were collectively known as \"Feciori\" (\"Young Men\" or \"Boys\") or \"Slugi\" (\"Servants\"). With the peak of serfdom in both countries, these \"Feciori\" were exclusively recruited from among free or manumitted peasants. According to historian Constantin Giurescu, the Wallachian \"Păhărnicei\", as a special set of \"Feciori\", might have been supporting themselves from \"păhărnicie\" revenues, which they collected for their patron. This practice is attested in Moldavia, where, following the drought of September 1663, Princess Ecaterina Dabija warned \"Feciori\" not to collect the tithe from Armenians and Jews, as this would have exhausted the supply. \n\nA Cantacuzino ally, Constantin Brâncoveanu, took the throne in 1688, replacing Șerban. He himself had for long been a regular boyar, first serving as a \"Paharnic\" when he was aged 17. During his subsequent reign, the \"Păhărnicei\" appear to have been almost exclusively confined to Râmnicu Sărat County, with some also present in Mehedinți County. Scholar Alexandru Ligor notes that, \"during and especially after Brâncoveanu's era\", the \"Păhărnicei\" and other such boyar retinues \"will be more seriously engaged in productive life (in agriculture, in trades, etc.).\" Brâncoveanu's reign was overall marked by a steady increase in taxation, but the \"Păhărnicei\" were explicitly excluded from some of the new duties, including a levy on vacated villages (\"siliști\"). Ligor proposes that this exemption reflected the Prince's military priorities, and his secret anti-Ottoman alliance with the Tsardom of Russia.\n\nBrâncoveanu's first \"Paharnic\" was Staico Bucșanu, whose scheming against the regime ended with his public hanging at Bucharest's Outer Market. His public humiliation and killing were received with hostility by the Bucharest populace. The period thus inaugurated came with a set of administrative reforms, recorded in the princely register, or \"Anatefter\". This shows \"Paharnic\" as one of the great offices, but also creates an overlapping function therein, as \"Cupar\" (from \"cupă\", \"cup\"); at the top of boyar advancement, these two offices coexisted with \"Spatharios\", \"Stolnic\", \"Clucer\", and another new office, that of \"Șufar\" (the intendant of kitchen staffs). Under Brâncoveanu, these particular offices were designated as \"Zvolearnici\". In addition to receiving payment from the exercise of their offices, they relied on princely handouts, including kaftans colored in accordance with their function.\n\nUntil his own downfall in 1714, Brâncoveanu relied on various other noblemen to fill in Bucșanu's role. One of these, Cornea Brăiloiu, served the Prince as both ambassador and organizer of defense expeditions against the \"Kurucok\". In 1696, the Greek \"Paharnic\" Vergo was part of a caretaker government of \"Caimacami\". The following year, Brâncoveanu had another Greek \"Paharnic\", Skarlatakes Mavrocordatos, son of the influential Alexander Mavrocordatos. In October, Skarlatakes married the Prince's daughter, Ilinca. Brâncoveanu also promoted Șerban II Cantacuzino as \"Paharnic\", in which capacity Cantacuzino attended, in 1702, the formal meeting between the Prince and Baron Paget. Brăiloiu returned as \"Paharnic\" under the last Cantacuzino Prince, Ștefan, with increased powers that allowed him to set an arbitrary \"vinărici\" and \"collect wine as he pleases\".\n\nMoldavia's own \"Paharnici\" and \"Păhărnicei\" greatly increased in number between 1550 and 1650; by 1710, some 24 were permanently present at the princely court in Iași, acting as waiters to the Moldavian Princes' foreign guests. Though the office's prestige declined, various Moldavian rulers maintained a practice of assigning it, alongside other offices, to their most trusted courtiers, often members of the monarchs' own families. Vasile Lupu (reigned 1634–1653) made his young nephew, Alexandru Coci, a \"Paharnic\"; meanwhile Lupu's in-laws, including \"Paharnici\" Alexandru Ciogolea and Neculai Mogâldea, were involved in conspiracies to topple him. Coci and his brother Enache were later tortured and killed by Lupu's rival, Gheorghe Ștefan, at the princely court in Podoleni. In the 1670s, holders of the \"Paharnic\" title included Ștefan Lupașcu Hâjdău, who was both a close relative and in-law of Prince Ștefan Petriceicu. The office of \"Cupar\" also existed in Moldavia, for instance during Petriceicu's successor Antonie Ruset, who assigned it to his brother Constantin. This function was alluded to in the canting arms used by the Rosetti family, which prominently feature a silver cup.\n\nMoldavia also experienced a Cantacuzino ascendancy, which resulted in the promotion of Greek boyars, to the irritation of local competitors. The latter sentiment was notably expressed in the anti-Greek outburst of 1673, narrated favorably by chronicler Ion Neculce. It came shortly after Dumitrașcu Cantacuzino abdicated, and targeted his courtiers, notably the \"Paharnic\" Mavrodin, who was paraded on a donkey and made to speak shibboleth phrases in Romanian. Upon returning to the throne, Petriceicu maintained a court that included Greek boyars such as Ilie Stamatie, who was a \"Paharnic\" of Huși. By 1703, the Moldavian Cantacuzinos were in conflict with the Greek Prince Constantine Ducas, with \"Paharnic\" Ilie Cantacuzino fleeing the country. Brâncoveanu's contemporary Dimitrie Cantemir, a native boyar and Enlightened absolutist, strove to reform the old order, appointing distinguished soldiers, such as Adam Luca, as his \"Paharnici\". Under Cantemir, the \"Postelnic\" was the seventh of eight boyars admitted to a privy council, while the \"Păhărnicei\" were inducted en masse into a category called \"boiernași\" (\"little boyars\"). His second and final reign was curbed by the Pruth River Campaign, during which Cantemir supported Russia. When he left into exile, he took with him Neculce and the \"Paharnic\" Gheorghiță, both of them against their will.\n\nProgressively over the 1710s, competing dynasties of culturally Greek aristocrats, collectively known as \"Phanariotes\", took power as Ottoman intermediaries in both Wallachia and Moldavia. The first such ruler, Nicholas Mavrocordatos, awarded tax privileges to the \"Paharnici\", exempting them from the levy on \"siliști\". The \"Păhărnicei\" continued to be a strong presence in the borderland region of Wallachia, where in 1729 they still had a corps and a Captain. Overtures were made to tone down conflicts between the Romanians and the Greeks in Moldavia, such as when Grigore II Ghica refused to prosecute a treasonous \"Paharnic\" Gavriil. In 1754, Matei Ghica created more resources for the two \"Paharnici\" of Panciu, allowing them to collect half of the tax revenue previously kept by the \"Staroste\". However, the erosion of \"Paharnici\" importance continued and was enhanced: under the same Matei Ghica, who ruled over both countries in succession, twenty \"Paharnici\" were created at each court. While some historians credit this anomaly to the Prince, others identify his \"Postelnic\", Alexandros Soutzos, as the culprit.\n\nMatei's predecessor, Mihai Racoviță, had redesigned the Wallachian table of ranks, making \"Paharnic\" the eighth position, within a second category of boyars. Accordingly, \"Paharnici\" were entitled to 40 \"scutelnici\", or clients, and had a yearly salary of 960 thaler; by comparison, all boyars of the first class received 70 \"scutelnici\" and 1,680 thaler. As noted by historian Pompiliu Eliade, \"an inflexible protocol govern[ed] the relationship between classes.\" Third-class boyars were required to bow down and kiss the hem of first-class superiors. \"Paharnici\" and others of the intermediary class were only expected to kiss their hand and display timidity in interactions. Under the new Phanariote regulations, these second-class aristocrats could not wear fur kaftans and had special \"kalpaks\", surmounted by green cushions; their coats could only be colored in dark tones of green, blue, and brown, but, unlike inferior boyars, they were allowed to grow beards.\n\nIn parallel, scholar Nicolae Iorga notes, Wallachia's \"old \"cursus honorum\" had yielded to personal assets or demands.\" Before 1796, the \"Paharnici\" had fallen to ninth or tenth place, but only because higher offices had been \"doubled\"—for instance, in 1768 there were two Wallachian \"Vornici\". Another stratification occurred in Moldavia. There were 27 \"Paharnici\" at Grigore Callimachi's court: 13 enjoyed the full privileges; 14 were secondary (\"vtori-\") and tertiary (\"treti-\") \"Paharnici\". There were still 14 \"Păhărnicei\" performing military duty at the Moldavian court in 1763. Their commander, now called \"Vătaf\" (plural: \"Vătafi\"), was a Greek boyar, Miche. Reduced to the role of rural legatees of the urban \"Paharnic\", the \"Păhărnicei\" of both countries were then stripped of all their remaining tax privileges under Constantine Mavrocordatos; the \"Paharnici\" themselves were required to pay for any military levy. Nevertheless, these new norms also stipulated that holders of any boyar rank from the top 19 would be spared taxation. That privilege was also extended to three generations of their descendants, known as \"Mazili\" or \"Mazâli\". A Western visitor, Friedrich Wilhelm von Bauer, assessed that Mavrocordatos' intervention had only left 100 \"Păhărnicei\" throughout Wallachia, with 12 more performing service for the Prince as \"Mazili\". By 1760, the boyars, including three \"Paharnici\", had lodged a formal complaint against Mavrocordatos with Sultan Mustafa III, accusing him of embezzlement.\n\nShortly after Mavrocordatos' death in the Russian occupation of 1769, the chronicler Franz Sulzer noted that the function of Moldavia's great \"Paharnic\" was to reside in Cotnari and collect revenue for Princess-dowager Ecaterina. The town, Sulzer noted, had greatly declined. Before 1810, the \"Paharnic\" had fallen to an even lesser position on the table of ranks of Moldavia. It was twelfth, although ahead of the \"Stolnic\" and \"Serdar\". The \"Păhărnicei\"s \"Vătafi\" moved in the opposite direction and, by 1796, had been recognized as a component of Wallachia's fifth-class boyardom.\n\n\"Paharnici\" and \"Păhărnicei\" also had a decorative function at the ceremonies in honor of Wallachia's Phanariote Princes, notably at the coronations of Alexander Ypsilantis (1775) and Nicholas Mavrogenes (1786), and the wedding of Princess Zamfira, daughter of John Caradja (1782). Some of the holders of the title focused their activity on cultural and educational projects. In Oltenia, Romanian or Greek schools were founded by local \"Paharnici\", including Fota Vlădoianu (Craiova, 1777), Stan Jianu (Preajba, 1783), and Alexandru Farfara (Cerneți, 1793). The 1780s \"Paharnic\" Mihail Fotino, a Wallachian Greek, became noted for his contributions to jurisprudence and moral philosophy. By 1806, Toma Carra, the Moldavian \"Paharnic\", was helping to draft a set of modenizing \"Pandects\", to be used by Prince Alexander Mourouzis in reforming the justice system.\n\nOther \"Paharnici\" were primarily involved in administrative or entrepreneurial work. Under Prince John Mavrocordatos, the Bucharest caretakers, or \"ispravnici\", comprised \"Paharnic\" Nicolae Ruset. In 1724, \"Paharnic\" Manolache owned one of the larger Bucharest bakeries. By 1804, Wallachian dignitaries included an Armenian businessman and \"Paharnic\", Manuc Bei, made famous by his establishing of Manuc's Inn. In 1800, while reigning in Wallachia, Mourouzis appointed his \"Paharnic\" Ștefănică, alongside Constantin Pastia, to redesign a system for Bucharest's drainage and sewage. In 1819, Wallachian Prince Alexandros Soutzos ordered his \"Paharnic\", Ianache Hafta, to carry out a modern surveying of Bucharest. Another \"Paharnic\", Vasile Iconomu, helped \"Spatharios\" Gheorghe Vlahuț in capturing a gang of English counterfeiters. Moldavia's second-class boyars were similarly dedicated to commercial pursuits. Around 1740, \"Paharnic\" Radu Racoviță established a pioneering glass factory at Luizi-Călugăra. While ranked as \"Paharnici\", Ioniță Cuza took up usury (1770s) and Ionică Tăutu became one of the major tenant farmers in Hotin County (1810).\n\nFrictions between the Phanariotes and the provincial second-class boyars continued with some regularity. In one incident of 1799, \"Paharnic\" Constantin Bălăceanu of Ialomița County refused to carry out an order issued by Constantine Hangerli. Under Constantine Ypsilantis, another Ialomița \"Paharnic\", Fălcoianu, was charged with embezzlement. With the era of national awakening, the \"Paharnici\" opposition to the Greeks extended to other classes of foreigners. In 1784, a \"Paharnic\" \"Carpoff\" made sustained efforts to block the penetration into Moldavia of Galician Armenians. \"Paharnic\" Manuc remained one of only three only Armenians to have reached a boyar rank in either country under the Phanariote reigns. During the war of 1806, a Wallachian \"Paharnic\", Ștefan Belu, had a publicized conflict with the Bulgarians colonized at Lichirești, who were under the protection of Dimitrie Macedonski.\n\nThe Phanariote era also pushed Moldavia and Wallachia into the orbit of the Russian Empire, prompting some boyars to accept Russian suzerainty. In the 1760s, a \"Paharnic\", Semyon Mikulin, moved to Novorossiya and was received into Russian nobility. In 1812, pursuant to the Treaty of Bucharest, eastern Moldavia was detached and assigned to Russia. This led to the creation of a Bessarabian Governorate which recognized Moldavian titles, including that of \"Paharnic\", as the basis for inclusion into Russian nobility. Two of the earliest Bessarabian \"Paharnici\" were Nicolae Done and Toma Stamati. From a Wallachian family, Done served as judge in Hotin County during the early 1820s; Stamati, who took part in the inaugural gentry assembly, was the father of poet Constantin Stamati. Yet another \"Paharnic\" under Russian rule, Dinu Negruzzi of Șirăuți was the father of writer Costache Negruzzi.\n\nUnder late Phanariotes such as Wallachia's Caradja, the rank of a lesser \"Paharnic\" was openly trafficked: Hagi Ianus, a merchant from Craiova, offered to purchase it at 400 ducats in 1816. By the time of Soutzos' death in 1821 there were six greater \"Paharnici\" in Wallachia, all of them present at his funeral. According to a note by visiting bureaucrat Ignaty Yakovenko, the number of \"scutelnici\" had increased, with each of these \"Paharnici\" commanding the allegiance of 25 clients; the \"Păhărnicei\"s \"Vătafi\" had three \"scultenici\" of their own. \n\nThe rise of Wallachian clienteles was again curbed in 1821 by an anti-boyar uprising, under Tudor Vladimirescu; having a peasant base, this insurgency was probably led by disgruntled third-class boyars. Also in 1821, the Phanariote warlord Alexander Ypsilantis, leading a \"Sacred Band\" of Greek revolutionaries, had taken control over Moldavia and parts of Wallachia. Ypsilantis' expedition sparked another Ottoman intervention, which provided a settling of scores between Romanians and Greeks. Second-class boyars played significant parts: according to Eliade, a \"Spatharios\" and a \"Paharnic\" traveled from one Moldavian town to another, replacing Ypsilantis' men with friendly locals. The \"Paharnic\" Gavril Istrati was involved alongside Sturdza in the fight against Sacred Band Greeks, at the head of a national party. At Zvoriștea, he organized a guerrilla force which flew red flags. It then marched on Botoșani, driving out the Greek insurgents.\n\nIstrati's counterpart in Wallachia was Scarlat Cerchez, who organized the reception of Moldavia's first post-Phanariote Prince, Ioan Sturdza. Even before arriving in his capital, Sturdza rewarded the expectations of Romanian nationalists, inducting his partisans into the boyardom. By 1825, he had created 350 second-class boyars, \"Paharnici\" included. These changes perplexed Moldavia's first-class boyardom, whose delegates asked Mahmud II to mediate. Eventually, the Russo-Turkish War of 1828 drove Sturdza into exile in Bessarabia. This moment showed the tensions between the two aristocratic systems, as Sturdza began handing out titles to commoners, and allegedly created a house servant as \"Paharnic\".\n\nThe post-Phanariote agitation ended as a lengthy Russian occupation of both principalities, providing them with a modernizing constitution known as \"Regulamentul Organic\". Under this system, \"Paharnici\" were a seventh aristocratic rank, below \"Cluceri\" and ahead of \"Serdari\". The Russian-appointed Moldavian Prince, Mihail Sturdza, replicated the policy of inducting new boyars, and, in 1835, raised most civil servants into the aristocracy: 140 \"Paharnici\" and 352 \"Serdari\" were counted in the census of 1849. In 1820, in Botoșani alone there were five \"Paharnici\": Alexandru, Ion Brănișteanu, Necula Dalamaci, Gavril Istrati, and Sterie. By 1847, the same city held six \"Paharnici\", none of them present in the older count. Nationality restrictions for Armenians were also lifted with the Treaty of Adrianople. As noted by scholar H. Dj. Siruni, 35 Armenians became Moldavian boyars in the subsequent social uplift, including \"Paharnici\" Hacic Cerchez at Roman and G. Țăranu at Botoșani. \n\nSturdza's measures were derided by the genealogist Constantin Sion, himself a \"Paharnic\". According to Sion, Sturdza had managed to make boyars out of \"the sons of butchers and publicans\", and \"condemned the country to fall under his companions\". The spread of liberal and radical ideas influenced such perceptions, leading up to the abortive coup of 1848. During the preceding crisis in 1846, the \"Paharnic\" Teodor Sion was arrested, alongside \"Spahtarios\" Tucidide Durmuz, for having joined Teodor Râșcanu's attempt at tax resistance against Sturdza.\n\nThe Wallachian and Moldavian military forces were both restructured, though some importance was paid to the old table of ranks and the concept of \"Mazili\". As such, the radical conspirator Ion Câmpineanu was allowed to serve as a Wallachian Major because of his descent from a \"Paharnic\". By 1841, the role of \"Paharnici\" in Bucharest's government had been formalized, with \"Paharnic\" Scarlat Rosetti serving as City Council President. Other boyars of that rank continued to be involved primarily in trade. Pitești was home to a \"Paharnic\" Berindei, who, by 1855, was a major player in Wallachia's pork trade. In Moldavia's Piatra Neamț, the era is commemorated by a former manor-and-warehouse, known as \"Casa Paharnicului\" (\"House of the \"Paharnic\"\"). It was built by the boyar and grain trader Dimitrie C. Gheorghiadis, who held the office for only part of his career.\n\nThe title was also held in the 1830s and '40s by two inspector-generals of Wallachia's schools, Ion Heliade Rădulescu and Constantin N. Brăiloiu, as well as by painter Constantin Lecca. Before the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, which sought to outlaw boyar ranks, the father of revolutionary Gheorghe Magheru also served as \"Paharnic\" and administrator of Romanați County. Another \"Paharnic\", the poet Grigore Alexandrescu, discarded his rank and job in the bureaucracy to participate in the revolutionary events. \n\nThe revolution was defeated, but Russian influence was curbed from 1853, with the Crimean War. Under the regime of Prince Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei, Wallachian revolutionaries were allowed back home from exile. They included the \"Paharnic\" Rădulescu, who alternated roles between civilian boyar and general in the Ottoman Army. Eventually, all boyar ranks and tax privileges were ended by the Convention of Paris (1858), which also opened the way for a Moldo–Wallachian union in 1859. The title continued to be used in the 1860s by those who already held it, including jurists Gheorghe Lehliu and Barbu Slătineanu.\n"}
{"id": "310123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310123", "title": "Paul de Man", "text": "Paul de Man\n\nPaul de Man (December 6, 1919 – December 21, 1983), born Paul Adolph Michel Deman, was a Belgian-born literary critic and literary theorist. At the time of his death, de Man was one of the most prominent literary critics in the United States—known particularly for his importation of German and French philosophical approaches into Anglo-American literary studies and critical theory. Along with Jacques Derrida, he was part of an influential critical movement that went beyond traditional interpretation of literary texts to reflect on the epistemological difficulties inherent in any textual, literary, or critical activity. This approach aroused considerable opposition, which de Man attributed to \"resistance\" inherent in the difficult enterprise of literary interpretation itself.\n\nDe Man began his teaching career in the United States at Bard College. In 1960 he completed his Ph.D. at Harvard University, then taught at Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Zurich. He joined the faculty in French and Comparative Literature at Yale University, where he was considered part of the Yale School of Deconstruction. At the time of his death from cancer, he was Sterling Professor of the Humanities and chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Yale. De Man oversaw the dissertations of Gayatri Spivak (at Cornell), Barbara Johnson (at Yale), Samuel Weber (at Cornell), and many other noted scholars.\n\nAfter his death, a researcher uncovered some two hundred previously unknown articles which de Man had written in his early twenties for Belgian collaborationist newspapers during World War II, some of them implicitly and two explicitly anti-Semitic. These, in combination with revelations about his domestic life and financial history, caused a scandal and provoked a reconsideration of his life and work.\n\nPaul de Man was born in Antwerp, Belgium, to a prominent and cultivated upper-class Flemish family. His maternal great-grandfather was the noted Flemish Poet, Jan Van Beers, and the family spoke French at home. His uncle Henri de Man (Dutch: Hendrik) was a famous socialist theorist and politician, who became a Nazi-collaborator during World War II. Paul's father, Robert (\"Bob\") de Man, was a moderately successful businessman whose firm manufactured X-ray equipment. De Man's father and his mother, Madeleine De Braey, who were first cousins, married over the family's opposition. The marriage proved unhappy.\n\nDe Man's early life was difficult and shadowed by tragedy. His mother Madeleine's first pregnancy with her oldest son Hendrik (\"Rik,\" b. 1915) coincided with the intense German bombings of World War I and strained her physical and mental health. The stillbirth of a daughter two years later pushed her into intermittent but lifelong suicidal depression. She was psychologically fragile and had to be watched. The family walked on eggshells and \"Bob\" de Man found solace with other women. In contrast to Rik, who was backward and a failure in school, Paul dealt with his difficult home life by becoming a brilliant student and accomplished athlete. He was enrolled in the Dutch-speaking cohort of boys admitted to the prestigious and highly competitive Royal Athenaeum of Antwerp. There, he followed his father's career path in choosing to study science and engineering, consistently receiving top marks in all subjects and graduating at the top of his class. He took no courses in literature or philosophy but developed a strong extracurricular interest in both as well as in religious mysticism. In 1936, his brother Rik de Man was killed at the age of 21 when his bicycle was struck by a train at a railroad crossing. The following year, it was Paul, then seventeen, who discovered the body of their mother, who had hanged herself a month before the anniversary of Rik's death.\n\nThat fall Paul enrolled in the Free University of Brussels. He wrote for student magazines and continued to take courses in science and engineering. For stability he turned to his uncle Henri as a patron and surrogate emotional father, later on several occasions telling people Henri was his real father and his real father was his uncle. He fathered a son with Romanian-born Anaïde Baraghian, the wife of his good friend, Gilbert Jaeger. They lived in a menage a trois until August 1942, when Baraghian left her husband. Paul married her in 1944, and the couple had two more sons together.\n\nDe Man, Baraghian and Jaeger fled to the south of France near the Spanish border when the Nazis occupied Belgium in 1940. Uncle Henri, who by then was a self-avowed fascist, welcomed the Nazi invaders, whom he saw as essential for instituting his brand of socialism. For a year, Henri de Man was appointed as de facto puppet Prime Minister of Belgium under the Nazis. Some believed that he used his influence to secure his nephew a position as an occasional cultural critic for \"Le Soir\", the influential Belgian French-language newspaper. After contributing an essay, “The Jews in Present-Day Literature,” to \"Le Soir volé\"'s notorious anti-Semitic attack of March 4, 1941, de Man became its official book reviewer and a cultural critic. Later he contributed to the Flemish daily \"Het Vlaamsche Land\"; both publications were violently anti-Semitic when under Nazi control. As a cultural critic, de Man would contribute hundreds of articles and reviews to these publications. His writings supported the Germanic ideology and the triumph of Germany in the war, while never referring directly to Hitler himself. In spite of that he maintained friendships with individual Jews.\n\nHolding three different jobs, de Man became very highly paid, but he lost all three between November 1942 and April 1943, failures that resulted from a combination of losing a coup he had launched against one employer and his own incompetence as a businessman at another. After this, de Man went into hiding; the Belgian Resistance had now begun assassinating prominent Belgian pro-Nazis. He had lost his protection in late 1942, when Uncle Henri, mistrusted by his collaborators on the right and himself marked for death as a traitor by the Belgian Resistance, went into exile.\n\nDe Man spent the rest of the war in seclusion reading American and French literature and philosophy and organizing a translation into Dutch of \"Moby Dick\" by Herman Melville, which he published in 1945. He would be interrogated by prosecutor Roger Vinçotte, but not charged after the war. Henri de Man was tried and convicted in absentia for treason; he died in Switzerland in 1953, after crashing his car into an oncoming train, an accident that was almost certainly a suicide.\n\nIn 1948 de Man left Belgium and immigrated to New York City. He had fled as an exile to avoid what became two trials for criminal and financial misdeeds (thefts of money from investors in a publishing company he ran) for which he was convicted in absentia to five years of imprisonment and heavy fines. Baraghian sailed with their three young sons to Argentina, where her parents had recently immigrated. De Man found work stocking books at the Doubleday Bookstore at New York City's Grand Central Station. From there he wrote to his friend Georges Bataille, a French philosopher, and through him, he met Dwight MacDonald, a key figure on the New York intellectual and literary scene. At MacDonald's apartment, de Man met the celebrated novelist Mary McCarthy. McCarthy recommended de Man to her friend, Artine Artinian, a professor of French at Bard College, as a temporary replacement while Artinian spent the academic year of 1949–50 in France as a Fulbright fellow.\n\n\"De Man was to teach Mr. Artinian's courses, advise Mr. Artinian's advisees, and move into Mr. Artinian's house. By December [1949], de Man had married one of the advisees, a French major named Patricia Kelley, and when the first Mrs. de Man turned up with their three young boys, Hendrik, Robert, and Marc, in the spring of 1950, Patricia de Man [sic] was pregnant.\"De Man persuaded the devastated Baraghian to accept a sum of money, agree to a divorce, and return to Argentina. She, however, surprised him when she left the eldest boy with him, while he surprised her when his first check proved worthless. The boy was raised by Kelley's parents while she took the younger ones back to Argentina with a promise of child support that de Man was never to honor.\n\nA heavily fictionalized account of this period of de Man's life is the basis of Henri Thomas's 1964 novel \"Le Parjure\" (\"The Perjurer\"). His life also provides the basis for Bernhard Schlink's 2006 novel, translated as \"Homecoming\". De Man married Kelley a first time in June 1950, but did not tell her that he had not actually gotten a divorce and that the marriage was bigamous. They underwent a second marriage ceremony in August 1960, when his divorce from Baraghian was finalized, and later had a third ceremony in Ithaca. In addition to their son, Michael, born while the couple was at Bard College, they had a daughter, Patsy. The couple remained together until de Man's death, aged 64, in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nThe de Mans moved to Boston, where Paul earned money teaching conversational French at Berlitz and did translations assisted by Patricia de Man; he also gave private French lessons to Harvard student Henry Kissinger, then running a small center and publication of his own. There, de Man met Harry Levin, the Harvard Professor of Comparative Literature, and \"was invited to join an informal literary seminar that met at Levin's house (alongside, e.g., George Steiner and John Simon). By the fall of 1952, he was officially admitted to graduate study in comparative literature.\" In 1954 someone sent Harvard an anonymous letter denouncing de Man as a wartime collaborator and questioning his immigration status (a letter not surviving, and known only on the basis of de Man's response to it). According to Harvard faculty members, de Man offered a thorough and more than satisfactory account of his immigration status and the nature of his political activities. While he was writing his dissertation, de Man was awarded a prestigious appointment at the Harvard Society of Fellows. In 1960, because his thesis was unsatisfactory to his mentors on several counts, and especially its philosophical approach, they were prepared to dismiss him, but he moved immediately to an advanced position at Cornell University, where he was highly valued.\n\nPeter Brooks, who was de Man's undergraduate student at Harvard, and later became his friend and colleague at Yale, wrote that rather than brand de Man as a confidence man, as his critics were inclined to do:\n\"One might consider this a story of remarkable survival and success following the chaos of war, occupation, postwar migration, and moments of financial desperation: without any degrees to his name, de Man had impressed, among others, Bataille, Macdonald, McCarthy, and Levin, and entered the highest precincts of American academia. During the following decade, he contributed nine articles to the newly established \"New York Review\": astute and incisive short essays on major European writers—Hölderlin, Gide, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger, as well as Borges—that display notable cultural range and critical poise.\n\nIn 1966, de Man attended a conference on structuralism held at Johns Hopkins University, where Jacques Derrida delivered his celebrated essay, \"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\"; de Man and Derrida soon became fast friends. Both were to become identified with Deconstruction. De Man came to reflect the influence primarily of Heidegger and used deconstruction to study Romanticism, both English and German, as well as French literature, specifically the works of William Wordsworth, John Keats, Maurice Blanchot, Marcel Proust, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Walter Benjamin, William Butler Yeats, Friedrich Hoelderlin and Rainer Maria Rilke.\n\nFollowing an appointment to a professorship in Zurich, de Man returned to the United States in the 1970s to teach at Yale University, where he served for the rest of his career. At the time of his death of cancer at age 64, he was a Sterling Professor and chairman of the department of comparative literature at Yale.\n\nAlthough de Man's work in the 1960s differs from his later deconstructive endeavors, considerable continuity can also be discerned. In his 1967 essay \"Criticism and Crisis,\" he argues that because literary works are understood to be fictions rather than factual accounts, they exemplify the break between a sign and its meaning: literature \"means\" nothing, but critics resist this insight: \n\"When modern critics think they are demystifying literature, they are in fact being demystified by it. But since this necessarily occurs in the form of a crisis, they are blind to what takes place within themselves. What they call anthropology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, is nothing but literature reappearing like the hydra's head in the very spot where it had been suppressed. The human mind will go through amazing feats to avoid facing 'the nothingness of human matters'.\"De Man would later observe that, due to this resistance to acknowledging that literature does not \"mean\", English departments had become \"large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter\" (\"The Return to Philology\"). He said that the study of literature had become the art of applying psychology, politics, history, philology or other disciplines to the literary text, in an effort to make the text \"mean\" something.\n\nAmong the central threads running through de Man's work is his attempt to tease out the tension between rhetoric (which de Man's uses as a term to mean figural language and trope) and meaning, seeking moments in the text where linguistic forces \"tie themselves into a knot which arrests the process of understanding.\" De Man's earlier essays from the 1960s, collected in \"Blindness and Insight\", represent an attempt to seek these paradoxes in the texts of New Criticism and move beyond formalism. One of De Man's central topoi is of the blindness on which these critical readings are predicated, that the \"insight seems instead to have been gained from a negative movement that animates the critic's thought, an unstated principle that leads his language away from its asserted stand. . . as if the very possibility of assertion had been put into question.\" Here de Man tries to undercut the notion of the poetic work as a unified, atemporal icon, a self-possessed repository of meaning freed from the intentionalist and affective fallacies. In de Man's argument, formalist and New Critical valorization of the \"organic\" nature of poetry is ultimately self-defeating: the notion of the verbal icon is undermined by the irony and ambiguity inherent within it. Form ultimately acts as \"both a creator and undoer of organic totalities,\" and \"the final insight...annihilated the premises which led up to it.\"\n\nIn \"Allegories of Reading\", de Man further explores the tensions arising in figural language in Nietzsche, Rousseau, Rilke, and Proust. In these essays, he concentrates on crucial passages which have a metalinguistic function or metacritical implications, particularly those where figural language has a dependency on classical philosophical oppositions (essence/accident, synchronic/diachronic, appearance/reality) which are so central to Western discourse. Many of the essays in this volume attempt to undercut figural totalization, the notion that one can control or dominate a discourse or phenomenon through metaphor. In de Man's discussion of Nietzsche's \"The Birth of Tragedy\", for instance, he claims that \"genetic\" conceptions of history appearing in the text are undercut by the rhetorical strategies Nietzsche employs: \"the deconstruction does not occur between statements, as in a logical refutation or a dialectic, but happens instead between, on the one hand, metalinguistic statements about the rhetorical nature of language and, on the other hand, a rhetorical praxis that puts these statements into question.\" For de Man, an \"Allegory of Reading\" emerges when texts are subjected to such scrutiny and reveal this tension; a reading wherein the text reveals its own assumptions about language, and in so doing dictates a statement about undecidability, the difficulties inherent in totalization, their own readability, or the \"limitations of textual authority.\"\n\nDe Man is also known for his readings of English and German romantic and post-romantic poetry and philosophy (\"The Rhetoric of Romanticism\"), and concise and deeply ironic essays. Specifically noteworthy is his critical dismantling of the Romantic ideology and the linguistic assumptions which underlie it. His arguments follow roughly as follows. First, de Man seeks to deconstruct the privileged claims in Romanticism of symbol over allegory, and metaphor over metonymy. In his reading, because of the implication of self-identity and wholeness which is inherent in the Romantics' conception of metaphor, when this self-identity decomposes, so also does the means of overcoming the dualism between subject and object, which Romantic metaphor sought to transcend. In de Man's reading, to compensate for this inability, Romanticism constantly relies on allegory to attain the wholeness established by the totality of the symbol.\n\nIn addition, in his essay \"The Resistance to Theory\", which explores the task and philosophical bases of literary theory, de Man uses the example of the classical \"trivium\" of grammar, rhetoric, and logic to argue that the use of linguistic sciences in literary theory and criticism (i.e. a structuralist approach) was able to harmonize the logical and grammatical dimension of literature, but only at the expense of effacing the rhetorical elements of texts which presented the greatest interpretive demands. He posits that the resistance to theory is the resistance to reading, thus the resistance to theory is theory itself. Or the resistance to theory is what constitutes the possibility and existence of theory. Taking up the example of the title of Keats's poem \"The Fall of Hyperion\", de Man draws out an irreducible interpretive undecidability which bears strong affinities to the same term in Derrida's work and some similarity to the notion of incommensurability as developed by Jean-François Lyotard in \"The Postmodern Condition\" and \"The Differend\". De Man argues that the recurring motive of theoretical readings is to subsume these decisions under theoretical, futile generalizations, which are displaced in turn by harsh polemics about theory.\n\nDe Man's influence on literary criticism was considerable, in part through his numerous and vocal disciples. Although much of his work brought to bear insights on literature drawn from German philosophers such as Kant and Heidegger, De Man also closely followed developments in contemporary French literature, criticism, and theory.\n\nMuch of de Man's work was collected or published posthumously. His book, \"Resistance to Theory\" was virtually complete at the time of his death. In 1996 a collection of essays, edited by his former Yale colleague Andrzej Warminski, was published by the University of Minnesota Press under the title, \"Aesthetic Ideology\".\n\nIn 1988, Ortwin de Graef, a Belgian graduate student at the University of Leuven, discovered some two hundred articles which de Man had written during World War II for \"Le Soir\". That year a conference on Paul de Man took place at the University of Antwerp. \"On the last day, Jean Stengers, a historian at the Free University of Brussels, addressed a topic pointedly titled: \"Paul de Man, a Collaborator?\" Then Georges Goriely, professor emeritus of sociology at the Free University of Brussels, rose to deliver what he called \"A Personal Testimony\":\n\nM. Goriely began by extolling de Man, whom he had known intimately in his youth, as \"a charming, humorous, modest, highly cultured\" \"homme de lettres\" renowned in Belgian literary circles during their youth. Then the professor dropped his bombshell. De Man, he asserted, wasn't all that he appeared to be. He was \"completely, almost pathologically, dishonest,\" a crook who had bankrupted his family. \"Swindling, forging, lying were, at least at the time, second nature to him.\" \n\nThe European press was in an uproar. \"There were stories in La \"Quinzaine Litteraire\", the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", The \"(Manchester) Guardian\". \"Newsweek\" juxtaposed a photograph of de Man with another of Nazis on the march. \"Le Soir\" reported 'a Waldheim \"academique\"'.\"\n\nDe Man's disciples tried to portray the attacks on de Man as a cover for his critics' dislike of Deconstruction, alleging that the attacks were a ruse that used de Man's youthful errors as evidence of what they considered the decadence at the heart of the Continental thought behind de Man and his theories. The controversies quickly spread from the pages of scholarly journals to the broader media. \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" and the front page of the \"New York Times\" exposed the sensational details of de Man's personal life, particularly the circumstances of his marriage and his difficult relationships with his children.\n\nIn the most controversial and explicitly anti-semitic essay from this war-time journalism, titled \"Jews in Contemporary Literature\" (1941), de Man described how \"[v]ulgar anti-semitism willingly takes pleasure in considering post-war cultural phenomenon (after the war of 14–18) as degenerate and decadent because they are [enjewished].\" He notes that \n\"Literature does not escape this lapidary judgement: it is sufficient to discover a few Jewish writers under Latinized pseudonyms for all contemporary production to be considered polluted and evil. This conception entails rather dangerous consequences ... it would be a rather unflattering appreciation of western writers to reduce them to being mere imitators of a Jewish culture which is foreign to them.\"The article claimed that contemporary literature had not broken from tradition as a result of the First World War and that\n\"the Jews cannot claim to have been its creators, nor even to have exercised a preponderant influence over its development. On any closer examination, this influence appears to have extraordinarily little importance since one might have expected that, given the specific characteristics of the Jewish Spirit, the later would have played a more brilliant role in this artistic production.\" The article concluded that \"our civilization... [b]y keeping, in spite of Semitic interference in all aspects of European life, an intact originality and character... has shown that its basic character is healthy.\" It concluded that \"the creation of a Jewish colony isolated from Europe\" as \"a solution to the Jewish problem\" would not entail any \"deplorable consequences\" for \"the literary life of the west.\" This is the only known article in which de Man pronounced such views so openly, though two or three other articles also accept without demurral the disenfranchisement and ostracization of Jews, as some contributors to \"Responses\" have noted.\n\nDe Man's colleagues, students, and contemporaries tried to respond to his early writings and his subsequent silence about them in the volume \"Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism\" (edited by Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan; Nebraska, 1989). His longtime friend, Jacques Derrida, who was Jewish, published a long piece responding to De Man's critics, declaring:\n\"To judge, to condemn the work or the man on the basis of what was a brief episode, to call for closing, that is to say, at least figuratively, for censuring or burning his books is to reproduce the exterminating gesture which one accuses de Man of not having armed himself against sooner with the necessary vigilance. It is not even to draw a lesson that he, de Man, learned to draw from the war.\"Some readers objected to what they considered was Derrida's objectionable effort to relate criticism of de Man to the greater tragedy of extermination of the Jews.\n\nFredric Jameson lengthily defended de Man in \"Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism\" (1991), observing about de Man's critics that \"it does not seem to me that North American intellectuals have generally had the kind of experience of history that would qualify them to judge the actions and choices of people under military occupation.\" According to Jameson, the efforts to implicate de Man in the Holocaust hinged on a fundamental misunderstanding of Nazi anti-Semitism:\n\nThe exclusive emphasis on anti-Semitism ignores and politically neutralizes its other constitutive feature in the Nazi period: namely, anticommunism. [The] very possibility of the Judeocide was absolutely at one with and inseparable from the anticommunist and radical right-wing mission of National Socialism (...). But put this way, it seems at once clear that DeMan was neither an anticommunist nor a right-winger: had he taken such positions in his student days (...), they would have been public knowledge.\n\nTurning to the content and ideology of de Man's wartime journalism, Jameson contended that it was \"devoid of any personal originality or distinctiveness,\" simply rehearsing corporatist commonplaces found in a broad range of European political movements. From this, Jameson concluded that none of the wartime articles \"had any relevance to Paul DeMan, for whom the thing dramatically called 'collaboration' was simply a job, in a Europe henceforth and for the foreseeable future united and German, and who as long as I knew him personally was simply a good liberal.\"\n\nSince the late 1980s, some of de Man's followers, many of them Jewish, have pointed out that de Man at no time in his life displayed personal animus against Jews. Shoshana Felman, recounted that \n\"about a year after the journalistic publication of his compromising statement, he and his wife sheltered for several days in their apartment the Jewish pianist Esther Sluszny and her husband, who were then illegal citizens in hiding from the Nazis. During this same period, de Man was meeting regularly with Georges Goriely, a member of the Belgian Resistance. According to Goriely's own testimony, he never for one minute feared denunciation of his underground activities by Paul de Man.\"But, his disciples and defenders have failed to agree about the nature of de Man's silence about his wartime activities. His critics, on the other hand, point out that throughout his life de Man was not only passively silent but also engaged in an active coverup through lies and misdirections about his past.\n\nThe question of de Man's personal history has continued to fascinate scholars, as evidenced by Evelyn Barish's 2014 biography, \"The Double Life of Paul de Man\". In an advance review published in \"Harpers Magazine\", Christine Smallwood concluded that, as portrayed by Barish, de Man turns out to have been: \"a slippery Mr. Ripley, a confidence man, and a hustler who embezzled, lied, forged, and arreared his way to intellectual acclaim.\" Writing in the \"New York Review of Books\", Peter Brooks, who succeeded to de Man's post as Sterling professor at Yale, defended his friend, calling some of Barish's accusations overblown and identifying errors in her footnotes: \"One could do a review of Barish's footnotes that would cast many doubts on her scholarship\", he complains. For example, he cites the footnote Barish provides to support her claim that in 1942 de Man planned to launch a Nazi literary magazine: \"I shared this information, and it has since been previously published in Belgian sources not now available to me\", noting that this sort of thing \"does not pass any sort of muster.\" Harvard professor Louis Menand, on the other hand, in his review in \"The New Yorker\", finds Barish's biography important and credible, notwithstanding the presence of occasional errors and exaggerations. Menand writes \"[h]er book is a brief for the prosecution. But it is not a hatchet job, and she has an amazing tale to tell. In her account, all guns are smoking. There are enough to stock a miniseries.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "841864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=841864", "title": "Petro Grigorenko", "text": "Petro Grigorenko\n\nPetro Grigorenko or Petro Hryhorovych Hryhorenko or Pyotr Grigoryevich Grigorenko (, , – 21 February 1987) was a high-ranking Soviet Army commander of Ukrainian descent, who in his fifties became a dissident and a writer, one of the founders of the human rights movement in the Soviet Union.\n\nFor 16 years, he was a professor of cybernetics at the Frunze Military Academy and chairman of its cybernetic section before joining the ranks of the early dissidents. In the mid-1970s Grigorenko helped to found the Moscow Helsinki Group and the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, before leaving the USSR for medical treatment in the United States. The Soviet government barred his return, and he never again returned to the Soviet Union. In the words of Joseph Alsop, Grigorenko publicly denounced the \"totalitarianism that hides behind the mask of so-called Soviet democracy.\"\n\nPetro Grigorenko was born in Borisovka village in Taurida Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day\nZaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine).\n\nIn 1939, he graduated with honors from the Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy and the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia. He took part in the battles of Khalkhin Gol, against the Japanese on the Manchurian border in 1939, and in the Second World War. He commanded troops in initial battles following 22 June 1941. During the war, he also commanded an infantry division in the Baltic for three years.\n\nHe went on a military career and reached high ranks during World War II. After the war, being a decorated veteran, he left active career and taught at the Frunze Military Academy, reaching the rank of a Major General.\n\nIn 1949, Grigorenko defended his Ph.D. thesis on the theme \"Features of the organization and conduct of combined offensive battle in the mountains.\"\n\nIn 1960, he completed work on his doctoral thesis. Over 70 of his scientific works on military science were published.\n\nIn 1961, Petro Grigorenko started to openly criticize what he considered the excesses of the Khrushchev regime. He maintained that the special privileges of the political elite did not comply with the principles laid down by Lenin. Grigorenko formed a dissident group — The Group for the Struggle to Revive Leninism. Soviet psychiatrists sitting as legally constituted commissions to inquire into his sanity diagnosed him at least three times — in April 1964, August 1969, and November 1969. When arrested, Grigorenko was sent to Moscow's Lubyanka prison, and from there for psychiatric examination to the Serbsky Institute where the first commission, which included Snezhnevsky and Lunts, diagnosed him as suffering from the mental disease in the form of a paranoid delusional development of his personality, accompanied by early signs of cerebral arteriosclerosis. Lunts, reporting later on this diagnosis, mentioned that the symptoms of paranoid development were \"an overestimation of his own personality reaching messianic proportions\" and \"reformist ideas.\" Grigorenko was not responsible for his actions and was thereby forcibly committed to a special psychiatric hospital. While there, the government deprived him of his pension despite the fact that, by law, a mentally sick military officer was entitled to a pension. After six months, Grigorenko was found to be in remission and was released for outpatient follow-up. He required that his pension be restored. Although he began to draw pension again, it was severely reduced.\n\nHe became much more active in his dissidence, stirred other people to protest some of the State's actions and received several warnings from the KGB. In 1968, after Grigorenko protested the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, he was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, arrested and ultimately committed to a mental hospital until 26 June 1974 after 5 years of detention. As Grigorenko had followers in Moscow, he was lured to the far-away Tashkent. While there, he was again arrested and examined by a psychiatric team. None of the manifestations or symptoms cited by the Lunts commission were found there by the second examination conducted under the chairmanship of Fyodor Detengof. The diagnosis and evaluation made by the commission was that \"Grigorenko's [criminal] activity had a purposeful character, it was related to concrete events and facts... It did not reveal any signs of illness or delusions.\" The psychiatrists reported that he was not mentally sick, but responsible for his actions. He had firm convictions which were shared by many of his colleagues and were not delusional. Having evaluated the records of his preceding hospitalization, they concluded that he had not been sick at that time either. The KGB brought Grigorenko back to Moscow and, three months later, arranged a second examination at the Serbsky Institute. Once again, these psychiatrists found that he had \"a paranoid development of the personality\" manifested by reformist ideas. The commission, which included Lunts and was chaired by Morozov, recommended that he be recommitted to a special psychiatric hospital for the socially dangerous. Eventually, after almost four years, he was transferred to a regular mental hospital. On 17 January 1971 Grigorenko was asked whether he had changed his convictions and replied that \"Convictions are not like gloves, one cannot easily change them\".\n\nIn 1971, Dr. Semyon Gluzman wrote an in-absentia psychiatric report on Grigorenko. Gluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp for defending Grigorenko against the charge of insanity. Amnesty International declared Grigorenko a prisoner of conscience.\n\nGrigorenko became the key defender of Crimean Tatars deported to Soviet Central Asia. He advised the Tatar activists not to confine their protests to the USSR, but to appeal also to international organizations including the United Nations.\n\nGrigorenko was one of the first who questioned the official Soviet version of World War II history. He pointed out that just prior to the German attack on June 22, 1941, vast Soviet troops were concentrated in the area west of Białystok, deep in occupied Poland, getting ready for a surprise offensive, which made them vulnerable to be encircled in case of surprise German attack. His ideas were later advanced by Viktor Suvorov.\n\nAfter publishing Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov's book \"Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party: A Study in the Technology of Power\", Grigorenko made and distributed its copies by photographing and typewriting. In 1976, Grigorenko helped found the Moscow Helsinki Group and the Ukrainian Helsinki Group.\n\nOn 20 December 1977, Grigorenko was allowed to go abroad for medical treatment. His health was ruined during forcible confinement in KGB-run mental hospitals. On 30 November 1977, Grigorenko arrived in the United States and was stripped of his Soviet citizenship. In Grigorenko's words, Leonid Brezhnev signed the decree of depriving Grigorenko of Soviet citizenship on the ground that he was undermining the prestige of the Soviet Union. The 1970s marked a peak in the use of external exile as a punitive measure by the Soviet Union (as opposed to the internal type, which was highest between the mid-1930s and early 1950s); often the pattern was that a trip abroad for work or medical treatment was transformed into permanent exile. In the same year, Grigorenko became a U.S. citizen.\nBeing in USA since 1977, Grigorenko took an active part in the activities of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group foreign affiliate. On 23 July 1978, Grigorenko made a statement condemning the trials of Soviet dissidents Anatoly Shcharansky, Aleksandr Ginzburg and Viktoras Petkus.\n\nIn 1979 in New York, Grigorenko was examined by the team of psychologists and psychiatrists including Alan A. Stone, the then President of American Psychiatric Association. The team could find no evidence of mental disease in Grigorenko and his history consistent with mental disease in the past. Their findings were drawn up and publicized by Walter Reich. Grigorenko's case confirmed accusations, Stone wrote, that psychiatry in the Soviet Union was at times a tool of political repression.\n\nPetro Grigorenko described his life and views, and his assessment by Soviet psychiatrists and periods of incarceration in prison hospitals in his 1981 memoirs \"V Podpolye Mozhno Vstretit Tolko Krys…\" (\"In the Underground One Can Meet Only Rats…\"). In 1982, the book was translated into English by Thomas P. Whitney under the title \"Memoirs\" and reviewed by Alexander J. Motyl, Raymond L. Garthoff, John C. Campbell, Adam Ulam, Raisa Orlova and Lev Kopelev.\n\nIn 1983, he said he considered the American political-economic system to be \"the best that mankind has found to date.\" In 1983, a stroke he suffered left him partially paralyzed. Grigorenko died on 21 February 1987 in New York City.\n\nIn 1991, a commission, composed of psychiatrists from all over the Soviet Union and led by Modest Kabanov, then director of the Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute in St Petersburg, spent six months reviewing Grigorenko's patient files. They drew up 29 thick volumes of legal proceedings, and in October 1991 reversed the official Soviet diagnosis of Grigorenko's psychiatric condition. In 1992, an official post-mortem forensic psychiatric commission of experts met in Ukraine. They removed the stigma of being a mental patient and confirmed that there were no grounds for the debilitating treatment he underwent in high security psychiatric hospitals for many years. The 1992 psychiatric examination of Grigorenko was described by the \"Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal\" in its numbers 1–4 of 1992.\n\nPetro Grigorenko was married to Zinaida Mikhailovna Grigorenko and they had five sons: Anatoly, Georgi, Oleg, Viktor and Andrew. Two of them died as children.\n\nIn 1975, Andrew, an electrical engineer, was declared to have inherited his father's insanity. He was expelled from the USSR to the USA, two years before Petro and Zinaida Grigorenko themselves travelled to the United States. Andrew was repeatedly told that since his father was mentally ill, then he was also mad. If he did not stop speaking out in defense of human rights and his father, they told him, he would also be sent to the psikhushka.\n\nThe different Latin spellings of Grigorenko's name exist due to the lack of uniform transliteration rules for the Ukrainian names in the middle of 20th century, when he became internationally known. The correct modern transliteration would be \"Petro Hryhorenko\". However, according to the American identification documents of the late general the official spelling of his name was established as \"Petro Grigorenko\". The same spelling is engraved on his gravestone at the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of St. Andrew in South Bound Brook, New Jersey, USA. The same spelling is also retained by his surviving American descendants: son Andrew and granddaughters Tatiana and Olga.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the regional languages of France and is not as commonly spoken as it once was, as the standard form of French now predominates. Poitevin is now classified as one of the langues d'oïl but is distinguished by certain features of the langue d'oc. The language is spoken on what was the border between the two language families of \"oïl\" and \"oc\" (placenames in the region clearly show historical settlement of \"oc\" speakers). The langue d’oïl subsequently spread south, absorbing \"oc\" features.\n\nPoitevin is also widely referred to as \"parlanjhe\" (the language). François Rabelais wrote that he learned this dialect, along with many other languages and dialects, since he was educated in Fontenay-le-Comte. François Villon spoke some Poitevin as well.\n\nThe earliest attested written use of the language is in charters and legal documents dating from the 13th century; people who spoke it were known as the Poitevins. The earliest printed text is dated 1554 (La Gente Poitevinrie). A tradition of theatrical writing and dramatic monologues for performance typifies the literary output in the language, although from the 19th century and in the 20th century (especially with the publication of a weekly paper \"Le Subiet\" from 1901) regular journalistic production was also established.

Outside France the language is spoken in Northern California, especially in Sacramento, Plumas, Tehama and Siskiyou counties, the latter with both large French ancestry and speaking populations.

In modern contexts, the term is sometimes used synonymously with \"Kashubian\" and may also include extinct Slovincian.\n\nThe name \"Pomerania\" comes from Slavic , which means \"[land] by the sea\".\n\nDuring the early medieval Slavic migrations, the area between the Oder and Vistula rivers was settled by tribes grouped as Pomeranians. Their dialects, sometimes referred to as Ancient Pomeranian, had transitory character between the Polabian dialects spoken west of Pomerania, and the Old Polish dialects spoken to the Southeast. While there are no surviving documents written in Pomeranian, medieval Pomeranian names are mentioned in contemporary documents written in other languages.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, German immigration and assimilation of the Slavic Pomeranians () introduced Low German \nEast Pomeranian, \nCentral Pomeranian, and dialects, which became dominant in Pomerania except for some areas in the East, where the populace remained largely Slavic and continued the use of the Slavic Pomeranian language. This was especially the case in Pomerelia, where the Slavic population became known as Kashubians and their language accordingly as Kashubian. An insular Slavic Pomeranian dialect spoken northwest of Kashubia until the 20th century became known as Slovincian. It is disputed whether Slovincian may be regarded as a dialect of Kashubian or a separate language. Likewise, it is disputed whether Kashubian may be regarded as a dialect of Polish or a separate language. Stefan Ramułt (1859–1913) was fascinated by Florian Ceynowa and decidedly supported giving Kashubian the status of a full-fledged standard language.\n\nThe Pomeranian language influenced the formation of other Polish language dialects, such as: the Kociewski, Borowiacki and Krajniacki dialects. Undoubtedly, they belong to the Polish language, but they also have some features in common with the Pomeranian language, which proves their character was transitional.\n\nFriedrich Lorentz supposed that Kociewski and Borewiacki dialects first belonged to the Pomeranian language and was then Polonized as a result of the Polish colonization of these territories. According to Lorentz, the Krajniacki dialect most probably was originally a part of the Polish language.\n\nThe common feature of the Kociewski dialects and the Kashubian language is, for example, the partial preservation of the so-called “TarT” group and a part of its lexis also. For the Borowiacki dialects and the Pomeranian language, the common feature was affrication of dorsal consonants.\n\nThe Pomeranian language also influenced the Low German dialects, which were used in Pomerania. After Germanisation, the population of Western Pomerania started to use the Low German dialects. Those dialects, though, were influenced by the Pomeranian language (Slavic).\nMost words originating from Pomeranian can be found in vocabulary connected with fishery and farming. The word / may serve as an example. It describes a kind of a fishing net and is still known in the Low German dialects of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern today. The word comes from the old Pomeranian word of the same meaning: . It moved to Kashubian and Slovincian dialects through Low German, and appeared in Pomeranian dictionaries as meaning “flounder and perch fishing net”. Thus, it is so called “reverse loan-word” as the Pomeranian language borrowed the word from Low German in which it functioned as “Pomoranism” (a borrowing from the Pomeranian language).\n\nA borrowing from the Pomeranian language which has been used in everyday German language and has appeared in dictionaries is a phrase “” (it means: come on, come on). It moved to the German language through the German dialects of West Prussia, and is also present in the Kashubian language (spelled: )\n\nThe classification of the Pomeranian ethnolect is problematic. It was classified by Aleksander Bruckner as one of the Old Polish dialects. At the same time, he classified the extant Kashubian and Slovincian dialects as those belonging to the Modern Polish language. Other linguists relate the Pomeranian language to the Polabian group of dialects (forming the Pomeranian-Polabian group). \n\nAfter Slovincian and all the Pomeranian dialects (except Kashubian) became extinct, the Kashubian language is the term most often used in relation to the language spoken by the Pomeranians. However, it is still not clear from where the words “Kashubians” and “Kashubian” ( and , and ) originated and how they were brought from the area near Koszalin to Pomerelia. None of the theories proposed has been widely accepted so far. There is also no indication Pomeranians wandered from the area of Koszalin to Pomerelia.\n\nWhile Western Pomerania was being Germanized, the Germans (both colonizers and Germanized descendants of Slavic Pomeranians) started using the words “Pomeranian” (; ) and “Pomeranians” (; ) referring to their own population. The part of the Pomeranian population which kept their Slavic language was called the Wends () or the Kashubians (). As the West lost its Slavic character, those two terms were more often used in the East.\nIn 1850, in the preface to his Kashubian-Russian dictionary, Florian Ceynowa wrote about the language of Baltic Slavic peoples:\n\nThe word dialect was probably used by Ceynowa because he was a follower of Pan-Slavism, according to which all the Slavic languages were dialects of one Slavic language. In his later works, though, he called his language .\n\nIn 1893, Stefan Ramułt, the Jagiellonian University linguist, referred to the early history of Pomerania, publishing the \"Dictionary of the Pomoranian i.e. Kashubian Language\". In the preface, Ramułt wrote:\n\nand\n\nFriedrich Lorentz (the author of \"Pomeranian Grammar\" and \"The History of Pomeranian/Kashubian Language\") referred in his works to Ramułt’s dictionary. After Lorentz died, Friedhelm Hinze published a great Pomeranian dictionary in five volumes (), which was based on Lorentz’s writing.\n\nThe Pomeranian language, and its only surviving form, Kashubian, traditionally have not been recognized by the majority of Polish linguists, and have been treated in Poland as \"the most distinct dialect of Polish\". However, there have also been some Polish linguists who treated Pomeranian as a separate language. The most prominent of them were Stefan Ramułt, and Alfred Majewicz, who overtly called Kashubian a language in the 1980s.\n\nFollowing the collapse of communism in Poland, attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing. It is increasingly seen as a fully-fledged language, as it is taught in state schools and has some limited usage on public radio and television. A bill passed by the Polish parliament in 2005 recognizes it as the only regional language in the Republic of Poland, and provides for its use in official contexts in 10 communes where its speakers constitute at least 20% of the population.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18930", "title": "Subject (philosophy)", "text": "Subject (philosophy)\n\nA subject is a being who has a unique consciousness and/or unique personal experiences, or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (called an \"object\").\n\nA \"subject\" is an observer and an \"object\" is a thing observed. This concept is especially important in Continental philosophy, where 'the subject' is a central term in debates over the nature of the self. The nature of the subject is also central in debates over the nature of subjective experience within the Anglo-American tradition of analytical philosophy.\n\nThe sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction, in the philosophy of René Descartes, between thought and extension. Descartes believed that thought (subjectivity) was the essence of the mind, and that extension (the occupation of space) was the essence of matter.\n\n\"Subject\" as a key-term in thinking about human consciousness began its career with the German Idealists, in response to David Hume's radical skepticism. The idealists' starting point was Hume's conclusion that there is nothing to the self over and above a big, fleeting bundle of perceptions. The next step was to ask how this undifferentiated bundle comes to be experienced as a unity – as a single \"subject\". Hume had offered the following proposal:\n\nKant, Hegel and their successors sought to flesh out the process by which the subject is constituted out of the flow of sense impressions. Hegel, for example, stated in his Preface to the \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" that a subject is constituted by \"the process of reflectively mediating itself with itself.\"\n\nHegel begins his definition of the subject at a standpoint derived from Aristotelian physics: \"the unmoved which is also \"self-moving\"\" (Preface, para. 22). That is, what is not moved by an outside force, but which propels itself, has a \"prima facie\" case for subjectivity. Hegel's next step, however, is to identify this power to move, this unrest that is the subject, as \"pure negativity\". Subjective self-motion, for Hegel, comes not from any pure or simple kernel of authentic individuality, but rather, it is\n\nThe Hegelian subject's \"modus operandi\" is therefore cutting, splitting and introducing distinctions by injecting negation into the flow of sense-perceptions. Subjectivity is thus a kind of structural effect – what happens when Nature is diffused, refracted around a field of negativity and the \"unity of the subject\" for Hegel, is in fact a second-order effect, a \"negation of negation\". The subject experiences itself as a unity only by purposively negating the very diversity it itself had produced. The Hegelian subject may therefore be characterized either as \"self-restoring sameness\" or else as \"reflection in otherness within itself\" (Preface, para. 18).\n\nThe thinking of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud provided a point of departure for questioning the notion of a unitary, autonomous Subject, which for many thinkers in the Continental tradition is seen as the foundation of the liberal theory of the social contract. These thinkers opened up the way for the deconstruction of the subject as a core-concept of metaphysics.\n\nSigmund Freud's explorations of the unconscious mind added up to a wholesale indictment of Enlightenment notions of subjectivity.\n\nAmong the most radical re-thinkers of human self-consciousness was Martin Heidegger, whose concept of \"Dasein\" or \"Being-there\" displaces traditional notions of the personal subject altogether. With Heidegger, phenomenology tries to go beyond the classical dichotomy between subject and object, because they are linked by an inseparable and original relationship, in the sense that there can be no world without a subject, nor the subject without world.\n\nJacques Lacan, inspired by Heidegger and Ferdinand de Saussure, built on Freud's psychoanalytic model of the subject, in which the \"split subject\" is constituted by a double bind: alienated from jouissance when he or she leaves the Real, enters into the Imaginary (during the mirror stage), and separates from the Other when he or she comes into the realm of language, difference, and demand in the Symbolic or the Name of the Father.\n\nThinkers such as structural Marxist Louis Althusser and poststructuralist Michel Foucault theorize the subject as a social construction, the so-called poststructuralist subject. According to Althusser, the \"subject\" is an ideological construction (more exactly, constructed by the \"Ideological State Apparatuses\"). One's subjectivity exists, \"always already\" and is discovered through the process of interpellation. Ideology inaugurates one into being a subject, and every ideology is intended to maintain and glorify its idealized subject, as well as the metaphysical category of the subject itself (see antihumanism). \n\nAccording to Foucault, it is the \"effect\" of power and \"disciplines\" (see \"Discipline and Punish\": construction of the subject (subjectivation or subjectification, ) as student, soldier, \"criminal\", etc.). Foucault believed it was possible to transform oneself; he used the word ethopoiein from the word \"ethos\" to describe the process. Subjectification was a central concept in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's work as well.\n\nIn contemporary analytic philosophy, the issue of subject—and more specifically the \"point of view\" of the subject, or \"subjectivity\"—has received attention as one of the major intractable problems in philosophy of mind (a related issue being the mind–body problem). In the essay \"What is it like to be a bat?\", Thomas Nagel famously argued that explaining subjective experience—the \"what it is like\" to be something—is currently beyond the reach of scientific inquiry, because scientific understanding by definition requires an objective perspective, which, according to Nagel, is diametrically opposed to the subjective first-person point of view. Furthermore, one cannot have a definition of objectivity without being connected to subjectivity in the first place since they are mutual and interlocked.\n\nIn Nagel's book \"The View From Nowhere\", he asks: \"What kind of fact is it that I am Thomas Nagel?\". Subjects have a perspective but each subject has a unique perspective and this seems to be a fact in Nagel's view from nowhere (i.e. the birds-eye view of the objective description in the universe). The Indian view of \"Brahman\" suggests that the ultimate and fundamental subject is existence itself, through which each of us as it were \"looks out\" as an aspect of a frozen and timeless everything, experienced subjectively due to our separated sensory and memory apparati. These additional features of subjective experience are often referred to as \"qualia\" (see Frank Cameron Jackson and Mary's room).\n\n\n"}

The database offers millions of English and French terms from various specialized fields. Terms in Spanish and Portuguese are also available in the multilingual database.\n\nTERMIUM Plus was initially developed by the Université de Montréal in October 1970. The database, initially named Banque de Terminologie de l’Université de Montréal (BTUM), was under the direction of Marcel Paré, with a vision to produce the most flexible bilingual language file that would be available to all. BTUM was initially funded by private donors and government subsidies, and it grew with the help of professionals in the field of translation over the following years. In 1975, the BTUM was able to obtain data and user responses in collaboration with the language services of Bell Canada.\n\nAt the end of 1974, however, the Translation Bureau under the Canadian Secretary of State Department showed interest in the operation of BTUM. The goal of the Translation Bureau at the time was to standardize terminology throughout the public service, as well as the federal public administration. In January 1976, the Canadian Secretary of State Department officially acquired BTUM, and renamed the database \"TERMIUM\" (TERMInologie Université de Montréal). The system was then transferred to the central computer of the federal government in Ottawa, and began to integrate approximately 175,000 files that the BTUM initially compiled with the files that the Translation Bureau had been working on. In the years to follow, the bureau began the sorting process, along with the input process onto the computer. The database grew to 900,000 records by 1987.\n\nAs terminological records grew in the TERMIUM database, the Canadian government received a proposal, in 1985, from a Toronto-based company to launch TERMIUM in a CD-ROM format, in order to make the database more accessible to users. By fall of 1987, a pilot project for CD-ROM was launched to investigate the responses from its users, which included services under the Translation Bureau and other private Canadian companies. After some data compilation and investigation, the bureau incorporated an indexing system to improve the speed and accuracy of term extraction.\n\nBy 1990, TERMIUM on CD-ROM was commercially available through subscription (with an annual fee of $1,100 to $1,500). Updates were released every three to four months. In 1996, TERMIUM on CD-ROM received an award from ATIO (The Association of Translators and Interpreters of Ontario).\n\nIn October 2009, TERMIUM Plus and an array of language tools under the Language Portal of Canada were launched with free online access.\n\nTERMIUM was initially developed to contain terminological records in both of Canada’s official languages (English and French). As the system upgraded to its third-generation version in 1985, it contained records in other languages such as Spanish, in order to accommodate its growing range of users. It is worth noting, however, that in these “multilingual” records, the term in the source language would be in English or French, with its equivalent in a non-official language.\n\nCurrently, there is a vast collection of specialized domains and fields covered by TERMIUM Plus, ranging from administration (including appellations), arts, sciences to law and justice.\n\nAside from the millions of entries recorded by TERMIUM Plus, the database also contains writing tools for both the English and French language (such as \"The Canadian Style\", a writing style guide; and \"Dictionnaire des cooccurrences\", a guide to French collocations), archived glossaries, as well as a link to the Language Portal of Canada (containing various French and English writing resources).\n\n"}
{"id": "147619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147619", "title": "Tithe", "text": "Tithe\n\nA tithe (; from Old English: \"teogoþa\" \"tenth\") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government. Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques, or stocks, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.\n\nTraditional Jewish law and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. Orthodox Jews commonly practice \"ma'aser kesafim\" (tithing 10% of their income to charity). In modern Israel, Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, e.g., \"ma'aser rishon\", \"terumat ma'aser\", and \"ma'aser sheni\". \n\nWith respect to Christianity, Jesus Christ taught the Jews that \"tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness\" (Matthew 23:23). Tithing was taught at early Christian ecumenical councils, including the Council of Tours in 567, as well as the Synod of Mâcon in 585, and remains an important doctrine in many Christian denominations, such as the Congregationalist Churches, Methodist Churches and Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n\nNone of the extant extrabiblical laws of the Ancient Near East deal with tithing, although other secondary documents show that it was a widespread practice in the Ancient Near East. William W. Hallo (1996) recognises comparisons for Israel with its ancient Near Eastern environment, however, as regards tithes, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern evidence is ambiguous, and Ancient Near Eastern literature provides scant evidence for the practice of tithing and the collection of tithes.\n\nListed below are some specific instances of the Mesopotamian tithe, taken from \"The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago\", Vol. 4 \"E\" p. 369:\n\nHebrew is a Semitic language, related to Akkadian, the lingua franca of that time.\n\nIn , Abraham, after rescuing Lot, met with Melchizedek. After Melchizedek's blessing, Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he has obtained from battle:\nIn , Jacob, after his visionary dream of Jacob's Ladder and receiving a blessing from God, promises God a tenth:\nThe tithe is specifically mentioned in the Books of Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The tithe system was organized in a three-year cycle, corresponding to the \"Shemittah\"-cycle. These tithes were in reality more like taxes for the people of Israel and were mandatory, not optional giving. This tithe was distributed locally \"within thy gates\" () to support the Levites and assist the poor.\n\nEvery year, \"Bikkurim\", \"Terumah\", \"Ma'aser Rishon\" and \"Terumat Ma'aser\" were separated from the grain, wine and oil (). (As regards other fruit and produce, the Biblical requirement to tithe is a source of debate.) The \"first tithe\" is giving of one tenth of agricultural produce (after the giving of the standard \"terumah\") to the Levite (or Aaronic priests). Historically, during the First Temple period, the first tithe was given to the Levites. Approximately at the beginning of the Second Temple construction, Ezra and his Beth din implemented its giving to the kohanim.\n\nUnlike other offerings which were restricted to consumption within the tabernacle, the \"second tithe\" could be consumed anywhere . On years one, two, four and five of the \"Shemittah\"-cycle, God commanded the Children of Israel to take a second tithe that was to be brought to the place of the Temple (). The owner of the produce was to separate and bring 1/10 of his finished produce to the Old City of Jerusalem after separating \"Terumah\" and the first tithe, but if the family lived too far from Jerusalem, the tithe could be redeemed upon coins (). Then, the Bible required the owner of the redeemed coins to spend the tithe \"to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish\" (). Implicit in the commandment was an obligation to spend the coins on items meant for human consumption.\n\nIn years three and six of the \"Shemittah\"-cycle the Israelites set aside the (second) tithe instead as the \"poor tithe\", and it was given to the strangers, orphans, and widows.\n\nThe Levites, also known as the Tribe of Levi, were descendants of Levi. They were assistants to the Aaronic priests (who were the children of Aaron and, therefore, a subset of the Tribe of Levi) and did not own or inherit a territorial patrimony (). Their function in society was that of temple functionaries, teachers and trusted civil servants who supervised the weights and scales and witnessed agreements. The goods donated from the other Israeli tribes were their source of sustenance. They received from \"all Israel\" a tithe of food or livestock for support, and in turn would set aside a tenth portion of that tithe (known as the \"Terumat hamaaser\") for the Aaronic priests.\n\nAn additional tithe mentioned in the Book of Leviticus () is the cattle tithe, which is to be sacrificed as a \"korban\" at the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nLMLK seals may represent the oldest archaeological evidence of tithing. About 10 percent of the storage jars manufactured during Hezekiah's reign (circa 700 BC) were stamped (Grena, 2004, pp. 376–78). See 2 Chronicles 29–31 for a record of this early worship reformation.\n\nThe Book of Nehemiah also talks about the collection of tithes to Leviim and distribution of Terumah to the priests: . People were actually appointed to collect mandatory tithes and place them in specially designated chambers which eventually came to be known as storehouses: .\n\nThe Book of Malachi has one of the most quoted Biblical passages about tithing, directed to the sons of Jacob:\n\nThe deuterocanonical Book of Tobit provides an example of all three classes of tithes practiced during the Babylonian captivity:\n\nOrthodox Jews continue to follow the laws of \"Terumah\" and \"Ma'aser\" as well as the custom of tithing 10% of one's earnings to charity (\"ma'aser kesafim\"). Due to doubts concerning the status of persons claiming to be Kohanim or Levi'im arising after severe Roman/Christian persecutions and exile, the Hebrew Bible tithe of 10% for the Levites, and \"tithe of the tithe\" () of 10% of 10% (1%) for the priests are dealt with in accordance with Jewish Law. The Mishnah and Talmud contain analysis of the first tithe, second tithe and poor tithe.\n\nAnimals are not tithed in the present era when the Temple is not standing.\n\nJesus Christ taught that \"tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23)\". Many of the ancient and historic Christian Churches, such as the Catholic Church and the Methodist Churches, practice tithing, as it was taught by the Council of Tours in A.D. 567, and in the Council of Macon in A.D. 585, a penalty of excommunication was prescribed for those who did not adhere to this ecclesiastical law. Tithes can be given to the Church at once (as is the custom in many Christian countries with a Church tax), or distributed throughout the year; during the part of Western Christian liturgies known as the offertory, people often place a portion of their tithes (sometimes along with additional offerings) in the collection plate. \n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches in its Fundamental Beliefs that \"We acknowledge God's ownership by faithful service to Him and our fellow men, and by returning tithes and giving offerings for the proclamation of His gospel and the support of His Church.\"\n\nThe Mennonite Church teaches that \"tithing as a minimum baseline is one of the principles on which financial giving in this 'first fruits' system is based\":\nThe National Baptist Convention of America teaches that \"Baptists believe that a proper sense of stewardship begins with the 'tithe'; a presentation of which belongs to Him. 'The tithe is the Lord's.' We have not given as a result of presenting the tithe. Our giving begins with the offering {after we have tithed}.\"\n\nThe Council of Trent, which was held after the Reformation, taught that \"tithes are due to God or to religion, and that it is sacrilegious to withold [\"sic\"] them.\" Nowadays the Catholic Church no longer requires anyone to give ten percent of income. The Church simply asks Catholics to support the mission of their parish. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church \"The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material needs of the Church, each according to his own abilities\" \n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) bases its tithing on the following additional scriptures:\n\nTithing is currently defined by the church as payment to the church of one-tenth of one's annual income. Many LDS leaders have made statements in support of tithing. Every Latter-day Saint receives an opportunity once a year to meet with their bishop about their tithing settlement. The payment of tithes is mandatory for members to receive the priesthood or obtain admission to temples.\n\nNone of the funds collected from tithing is paid to church officials. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Lay Ministry. The money that is given is used to build and maintain church buildings as well as to further the work of the church. Brigham Young University, a practically all-LDS school, also receives \"a significant portion\" of its maintenance and operational costs from LDS tithes.\n\nThe Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod teaches that \"Encourage[s] cheerful, first-fruit, proportionate (including but not limited to tithing) living and giving in all areas of life by Christian stewards\".\n\n\"The Discipline of The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection\" teaches: \n\nThe Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church states that it is the responsibility of ecclesiastics to \"educate the local church that tithing is the minimum goal of giving in The United Methodist Church.\" \n\nThe Church of the Nazarene teaches to pay a tithe, although not necessarily the one-tenth under Old Testament law. People pay according to ability.\n\nThe Moravian Church encourages its members to \"financially support the ministry of the Church toward the goal of tithing.\" It \"deem[s] it a sacred responsibility and genuine opportunity to be faithful stewards of all God has entrusted to us: our time, our talents, [and] our financial resources\".\n\nTithing in medieval Eastern Christianity did not spread so widely as in the West. A Constitution of the Emperors Leo I (reigned 457–474) and Anthemius (reigned 467–472) apparently expected believers to make voluntary payments and forbade compulsion.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America teaches \"proportionate giving and tithing as normal practices of Christian giving.\"\n\nThe Pentecostal Church of God teaches that \"We recognize the scriptural duty of all our people, as well as ministers, to pay tithes as unto the Lord. Tithes should be used for the support of active ministry and for the propagation of the Gospel and the work of the Lord in general.\"\n\nThe International Pentecostal Holiness Church likewise instructs the faithful that:\nThe Book of Order of the Presbyterian Church (USA) states, with respect to the obligation to tithe:\nThe United Church of Christ, a denomination in the Congregationalist tradition, teaches that:\nThe right to receive tithes was granted to the English churches by King Ethelwulf in 855. The Saladin tithe was a royal tax, but assessed using ecclesiastical boundaries, in 1188. The legal validity of the tithe system was affirmed under the Statute of Westminster of 1285. The Dissolution of the Monasteries led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and the Crown – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of Henry VIII's reign. Adam Smith criticized the system in \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776), arguing that a fixed rent would encourage peasants to work far more efficiently.\n\nSee below for a fuller description and history, until the reforms of the 19th century, written by Sir William Blackstone and edited by other learned lawyers of the period.\nThe system gradually ended with the Tithe Commutation Act 1836, whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and took the opportunity to map out (apportion) residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.\n\nThis commutation reduced problems to the ultimate payers by effectively folding tithes in with rents however, it could cause transitional money supply problems by raising the transaction demand for money. Later the decline of large landowners led tenants to become freeholders and again have to pay directly; this also led to renewed objections of principle by non-Anglicans. It also kept intact a system of chancel repair liability affecting the minority of parishes where the rectory had been lay-appropriated. The precise land affected in such places hinged on the content of documents such as the content of deeds of merger and apportionment maps.\n\nRent charges in lieu of abolished English tithes paid by landowners were converted by a public outlay of money under the Tithe Act 1936 into annuities paid to the state through the Tithe Redemption Commission. Such payments were transferred in 1960 to the Board of Inland Revenue, and those remaining were terminated by the Finance Act 1977.\n\nThe Tithe Act 1951 established the compulsory redemption of English tithes by landowners where the annual amounts payable were less than £1 so abolishing the bureaucracy and costs of collecting small sums of money.\n\nIn France, the tithes – called \"la dîme\" – were a land tax. Originally a voluntary tax, the \"dîme\" became mandatory in 1585. In principle, unlike the taille, the \"dîme\" was levied on both noble and non-noble lands. The dîme was divided into a number of types, including the \"grosses dîmes\" (grains, wine, hay), \"menues\" or \"vertes dîmes\" (vegetables, poultry), \"dîmes de charnage\" (veal, lamb, pork). Although the term \"dîme\" comes from the Latin \"decima [pars]\" (\"one tenth\", with the same origin as that of the U.S. coin, the dime), the \"dîme\" rarely reached this percentage and (on the whole) it was closer to 1/13th of the agricultural production.\n\nThe \"dîme\" was originally meant to support the local parish, but by the 16th century many \"dîmes\" went directly to distant abbeys, monasteries, and bishops, leaving the local parish impoverished, and this contributed to general resentment. In the Middle Ages, some monasteries also offered the \"dîme\" in homage to local lords in exchange for their protection (see Feudalism) (these are called \"dîmes inféodées\"), but this practice was forbidden by the Lateran Council of 1179.\n\nAll religious taxes were constitutionally abolished in 1790, in the wake of the French Revolution.\n\nThere has never been a separate church tax or mandatory tithe on Greek citizens. The state pays the salaries of the clergy of the established Church of Greece, in return for use of real estate, mainly forestry, owned by the church. The remainder of church income comes from voluntary, tax-deductible donations from the faithful. These are handled by each diocese independently.\n\nFrom the English Reformation in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain Roman Catholic and had by now to pay tithes valued at about 10 per cent of an area's agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland, to which only a small minority of the population converted. Irish Presbyterians and other minorities like the Quakers and Jews were in the same situation.\n\nThe collection of tithes was resisted in the period 1831–36, known as the Tithe War. Thereafter, tithes were reduced and added to rents with the passing of the Tithe Commutation Act in 1836. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the Irish Church Act 1869, tithes were abolished.\n\nWhile the federal government has never collected a church tax or mandatory tithe on its citizens, states collected a tithe into the early 19th century. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax itemized deduction). Also, churches may be permitted exemption from other state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) may be exempt from federal self-employment tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, and pay the employer's share for the non-exempt income.\n\nBoth the tithe (\"diezmo\"), a levy of 10 per cent on all agricultural production, and \"first fruits\" (\"primicias\"), an additional harvest levy, were collected in Spain throughout the medieval and early modern periods for the support of local Catholic parishes.\n\nThe tithe crossed the Atlantic with the Spanish Empire; however, the Indians who made up the vast majority of the population in colonial Spanish America were exempted from paying tithes on native crops such as corn and potatoes that they raised for their own subsistence. After some debate, Indians in colonial Spanish America were forced to pay tithes on their production of European agricultural products, including wheat, silk, cows, pigs, and sheep.\n\nThe tithe was abolished in several Latin American countries, including Mexico, soon after independence from Spain (which started in 1810). The tithe was abolished in Spain itself in 1841, and in Argentina in 1826.\n\nIn Austria a colloquially called church tax (\"Kirchensteuer\", officially called \"Kirchenbeitrag\", i. e. \"church contribution\") has to be paid by members of the Catholic and Protestant Church. It is levied by the churches themselves and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax can just be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1 per cent (Catholic church) and 1.5 per cent (Protestant church).\n\nAll members of the Church of Denmark pay a church tax, which varies between municipalities. The tax is generally around 1% of the taxable income.\n\nMembers of state churches pay a church tax of between 1% and 2% of income, depending on the municipality. In addition, 2.55 per cent of corporate taxes are distributed to the state churches. Church taxes are integrated into the common national taxation system.\n\nGermany levies a church tax, on all persons declaring themselves to be Christians, of roughly 8–9% of their income tax, which is effectively (very much depending on the social and financial situation) typically between 0.2% and 1.5% of the total income. The proceeds are shared among Catholic, Lutheran, and other Protestant Churches.\n\nThe church tax (Kirchensteuer) actually traces its roots back as far as the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803. It was reaffirmed in the Concordat of 1933 between Nazi Germany and the Catholic Church. Today its legal basis is article 140 of the Grundgesetz (the German \"constitution\") in connection with article 137 of the Weimar constitution. These laws originally merely allowed the churches themselves to tax their members, but in Nazi Germany, collection of church taxes was transferred to the German government. As a result, both the German government and the employer are notified of the religious affiliation of every taxpayer. This system is still in effect today. Mandatory disclosure of religious affiliation to government agencies or employers constituted a violation of the original European data protection directives but is now permitted after the German government obtained an exemption.\n\nChurch tax (Kirchensteuer) is compulsory in Germany for those confessing members of a particular religious group. It is deducted at the PAYE level. The duty to pay this tax theoretically starts on the day one is christened. Anyone who wants to stop paying it has to declare in writing, at their local court of law (Amtsgericht) or registry office, that they are leaving the Church. They are then crossed off the Church registers and can no longer receive the sacraments, confession and certain services; a Roman Catholic church may deny such a person a burial plot. In addition to the government, the taxpayer also must notify his employer of his religious affiliation (or lack thereof) in order to ensure proper tax withholding.\n\nThis opt-out is also used by members of \"free churches\" (e.g. Baptists) (non-affiliated to the scheme) to stop paying the church tax, from which the free churches do not benefit, in order to support their own church directly.\n\nOriginally the Italian government of Benito Mussolini, under the Lateran treaties of 1929 with the Holy See, paid a monthly salary to Catholic clergymen. This salary was called the \"congrua\". The eight per thousand law was created as a result of an agreement, in 1984, between the Italian Republic and the Holy See.\n\nUnder this law Italian taxpayers are able to vote how to partition the 0.8% ('eight per thousand') of the total income tax IRPEF levied by Italy among some specific religious confessions or, alternatively, to a social assistance program run by the Italian State. This declaration is made on the IRPEF form. This vote is not compulsory; the whole amount levied by the IRPEF tax is distributed in proportion to explicit declarations.\n\nThe last official statement of Italian Ministry of Finance made in respect of the year 2000 singles out seven beneficiaries: the Italian State, the Catholic Church, the Waldenses, the Jewish Communities, the Lutherans, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Assemblies of God in Italy.\n\nThe tax was divided up as follows:\n\nIn 2000, the Catholic Church raised almost a billion euros, while the Italian State received about €100 million euros.\n\nIn Scotland \"teinds\" were the tenths of certain produce of the land appropriated to the maintenance of the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the Privy Council of Scotland provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed Church of Scotland. In 1925 the system was recast by statute and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The Court of Session acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.\n\nUntil the year 2000, Sweden had a mandatory church tax, to be paid if one did belong to the Church of Sweden, which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths as well as the Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.\n\nThere is no official state church in Switzerland; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support at least one of the three traditional denominations — Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, or Protestant — with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3 per cent) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.\n\nExcerpts from Sir William Blackstone, \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\":\n\n. . . tithes; which are defined to be the tenth part of the increase, yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants:\nin general, tithes are to be paid for every thing that yields an annual increase, as corn, hay, fruit, cattle, poultry, and the like; but not for any thing that is of the substance of the earth, or is not of annual increase, as stone, lime, chalk, and the like; nor for creatures that are of a wild nature, or \"ferae naturae\", as deer, hawks, &c, whose increase, so as to profit the owner, is not annual, but casual.\n\nWe cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country. Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, about the end of the fifth century. But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts ; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.\n\nAnd upon their first introduction (as hath formerly been observed), though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called \"arbitrary\" consecrations of tithes: or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.\n\n...It is now universally held, that tithes are due, of common right, to the parson of the parish, unless there be a special exemption. This parson of the parish, we have formerly seen, may be either the actual incumbent, or else the appropriator of the benefice: appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries, which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy, by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithes.\n\nWe observed that tithes are due to the parson of common right, unless by special exemption: let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.\n\nFirst, a real composition is when an agreement is made between the owner of the lands, and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron, that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompence given to the parson, in lieu and satisfaction thereof.\n\nSecondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been, either partially or totally, discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties, as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence; and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either \"de modo decimandi\", or \"de non decimando\".\n\nA \"modus decimandi\", commonly called by the simple name of a \"modus\" only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him: sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs ; and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a \"modus decimandi\", or special manner of tithing.\n\nA prescription \"de non decimando\" is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them. Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for \"ecclesia decimas non folvit ecclesiae\". But these \"personal\" to both the king and the clergy ; for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes of the same land, though in their own occupation it is not tithable. And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in \"lay\" hands, \"modus de non decimando non valet\". But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbots, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes, by various ways: as\n\nZakāt ( ) or \"alms giving\", one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is the giving of a small percentage of one's assets to charity. It serves principally as the welfare contribution to poor and deprived Muslims, although others may have a rightful share. It is the duty of an Islamic state not just to collect zakat but to distribute it fairly as well.\n\nZakat is payable on three kinds of assets: wealth, production, and animals. The more well-known zakat on wealth is 2.5 per cent of accumulated wealth, beyond one's personal needs. Production (agricultural, industrial, renting, etc.), is subject to a 10 per cent or 5 per cent zakat (also known as Ushur (عُشر), or \"one-tenth\"), using the rule that if both labor and capital are involved, 5% rate is applied, if only one of the two are used for production, then the rate is 10 per cent. For any earnings, that require neither labor nor capital, like finding underground treasure, the rate is 20 per cent. The rules for zakat on animal holdings are specified by the type of animal group and tend to be fairly detailed.\n\nMuslims fulfill this religious obligation by giving a fixed percentage of their surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed on the same level of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer (salat). Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business. In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich. Because it holds such a high level of importance the \"punishment\" for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\" it states, \"...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted\". This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting heard, those who are able should be practicing this third pillar of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.\n\nNon-Muslims (able-bodied adult males of military age) living in an Islamic state are required to pay Jizya, this exempts them from military service and they do not pay Zakat.\n\n\"Daswandh\" (Punjabi: ਦਸਵੰਧ), sometimes spelled \"Dasvandh\", is the one tenth part (or 10 per cent) of one's income that should be donated in the name of the God, according to Sikh principles.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "161711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161711", "title": "Truth value", "text": "Truth value\n\nIn logic and mathematics, a truth value, sometimes called a logical value, is a value indicating the relation of a proposition to truth.\n\nIn classical logic, with its intended semantics, the truth values are \"true\" (1 or T), and \"untrue\" or \"false\" (0 or ⊥); that is, classical logic is a two-valued logic. This set of two values is also called the Boolean domain. Corresponding semantics of logical connectives are truth functions, whose values are expressed in the form of truth tables. Logical biconditional becomes the equality binary relation, and negation becomes a bijection which permutes true and false. Conjunction and disjunction are dual with respect to negation, which is expressed by De Morgan's laws:\n\nPropositional variables become variables in the Boolean domain. Assigning values for propositional variables is referred to as valuation.\n\nIn intuitionistic logic, and more generally, constructive mathematics, statements are assigned a truth value only if they can be given a constructive proof. It starts with a set of axioms, and a statement is true if one can build a proof of the statement from those axioms. A statement is false if one can deduce a contradiction from it. This leaves open the possibility of statements that have not yet been assigned a truth value.\nUnproven statements in intuitionistic logic are not given an intermediate truth value (as is sometimes mistakenly asserted). Indeed, one can prove that they have no third truth value, a result dating back to Glivenko in 1928.\n\nInstead, statements simply remain of unknown truth value, until they are either proven or disproven.\n\nThere are various ways of interpreting intuitionistic logic, including the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation. See also Intuitionistic logic#Semantics.\n\nMulti-valued logics (such as fuzzy logic and relevance logic) allow for more than two truth values, possibly containing some internal structure. For example, on the unit interval such structure is a total order; this may be expressed as the existence of various degrees of truth.\n\nNot all logical systems are truth-valuational in the sense that logical connectives may be interpreted as truth functions. For example, intuitionistic logic lacks a complete set of truth values because its semantics, the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation, is specified in terms of provability conditions, and not directly in terms of the necessary truth of formulae.\n\nBut even non-truth-valuational logics can associate values with logical formulae, as is done in algebraic semantics. The algebraic semantics of intuitionistic logic is given in terms of Heyting algebras, compared to Boolean algebra semantics of classical propositional calculus.\nIntuitionistic type theory uses types in the place of truth values.\n\nTopos theory uses truth values in a special sense: the truth values of a topos are the global elements of the subobject classifier. Having truth values in this sense does not make a logic truth valuational.\n\n"}

{"id": "13878013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13878013", "title": "Verisimilitude (fiction)", "text": "Verisimilitude (fiction)\n\nVerisimilitude is the \"lifelikeness\" or believability of a work of fiction. The word comes from meaning truth and \"similis\" meaning similar. Language philosopher Steve Neale distinguishes between two types: cultural verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and generic verisimilitude, meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own genre (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the fictional universe of a musical).\n\nVerisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of mimesis, the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to Plato and Aristotle, it must have grounding in reality.\n\nThis idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the Middle Ages particularly in Italian heroic poetry. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, decorum: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.\n\nThis classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness to suspend his/her disbelief, a phrase used originally by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.\n\nThe idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. \n\nAs more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist Pierre Nicolas Desmolets' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own internal logic. \n\nThe focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.\n\nDuring the rise of the postmodern novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.\n\nThe reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.\n\n"}
{"id": "2603115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2603115", "title": "Wildlife management", "text": "Wildlife management\n\nWildlife management attempts to balance the needs of wildlife with the needs of people using the best available science. Wildlife management can include game keeping, wildlife conservation and pest control. Wildlife management draws on disciplines such as mathematics, chemistry, biology, ecology, climatology and geography to gain the best results.\n\nWildlife conservation aims to halt the loss in the Earth's biodiversity by taking into consideration ecological principles such as carrying capacity, disturbance and succession and environmental conditions such as physical geography, pedology and hydrology with the aim of balancing the needs of wildlife with the needs of people. Most wildlife biologists are concerned with the preservation and improvement of habitats although rewilding is increasingly being used. Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, nitrification and denitrification, irrigation, coppicing and hedge laying.\n\nGame keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well being of game and may include killing other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of the more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book \"Game Management\", Aldo Leopold, one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as \"the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use\".\n\nPest control is the control of real or perceived pests and can be used for the benefit of wildlife, farmers, game keepers or safety reasons. In the United States, wildlife management practices are often implemented by a governmental agency to uphold a law, such as the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, wildlife management undertaken by several organizations including government bodies such as the Forestry Commission, Charities such as the RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts and privately hired gamekeepers and contractors. Legislation has also been passed to protect wildlife such as the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The UK government also give farmers subsidies through the Countryside Stewardship Scheme to improve the conservation value of their farms.\n\nThe history of wildlife management begins with the game laws, which regulated the right to kill certain kinds of fish and wild animal (game). In Britain game laws developed out of the forest laws, which in the time of the Norman kings were very oppressive. Under William the Conqueror, it was as great a crime to kill one of the king's deer as to kill one of his subjects. A certain rank and standing, or the possession of a certain amount of property, were for a long time qualifications indispensably necessary to confer upon any one the right of pursuing and killing game.\n\nThe Game Act of 1831 protected game birds by establishing close seasons when they could not be legally taken. The act made it lawful to take game only with the provision of a game licence and provided for the appointment of gamekeepers around the country. The purposes of the law was to balance the needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both environment and populations of fish and game.\nEarly game laws were also enacted in the US; - in 1839 Rhode Island closed the hunting season for white-tailed deer from May to November. Other regulations during this time focused primarily on restricting hunting. At this time, lawmakers did not consider population sizes or the need for preservation or restoration of wildlife habitats.\n\nThe late 19th century saw the passage of the first pieces of wildlife conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869 was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world after extensive lobbying from the Association for the Protection of Seabirds.\n\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was founded as the Plumage League in 1889 by Emily Williamson at her house in Manchester as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB. The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton.\n\nThe National Trust formed in 1895 with the manifesto to \"...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural aspect.\" On 1 May 1899, the Trust purchased two acres of Wicken Fen with a donation from the amateur naturalist Charles Rothschild, establishing the first nature reserve in Britain. Rothschild was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in Britain, and went on to establish many other nature reserves, such as one at Woodwalton Fen, near Huntingdon, in 1910. During his lifetime he built and managed his estate at Ashton Wold in Northamptonshire to maximise its suitability for wildlife, especially butterflies. Concerned about the loss of wildlife habitats, in 1912 he set up the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the forerunner of The Wildlife Trusts partnership.\n\nDuring the society's early years, membership tended to be made up of specialist naturalists and its growth was comparatively slow. The first independent Trust was formed in Norfolk in 1926 as the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, followed in 1938 by the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which after several subsequent changes of name is now the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that more Naturalists' Trusts were formed in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Cambridgeshire. These early Trusts tended to focus on purchasing land to establish nature reserves in the geographical areas they served.\n\nThe profession of wildlife management was established in the United States in the 1920s and '30s by Aldo Leopold and others who sought to transcend the purely restrictive policies of the previous generation of conservationists, such as anti-hunting activist William T. Hornaday. Leopold and his close associate Herbert Stoddard, who had both been trained in scientific forestry, argued that modern science and technology could be used to restore and improve wildlife habitat and thus produce abundant \"crops\" of ducks, deer, and other valued wild animals.\n\nThe institutional foundations of the profession of wildlife management were established in the 1930s, when Leopold was granted the first university professorship in wildlife management (1933, University of Wisconsin, Madison), when Leopold's textbook 'Game Management' was published (1933), when The Wildlife Society was founded, when the Journal of Wildlife Management began publishing, and when the first Cooperative Wildlife Research Units were established. Conservationists planned many projects throughout the 1940s. Some of which included the harvesting of female mammals such as deer to decrease rising populations. Others included waterfowl and wetland research. The Fish and Wildlife Management Act was put in place to urge farmers to plant food for wildlife and to provide cover for them.\n\nIn 1937, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act) was passed in the U.S.. This law was an important advancement in the field of wildlife management. It placed a 10% tax on sales of guns and ammunition. The funds generated were then distributed to the states for use in wildlife management activities and research. This law is still in effect today.\n\nWildlife management grew after World War II with the help of the GI Bill and a postwar boom in recreational hunting. An important step in wildlife management in the United States national parks occurred after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park. In 1963, United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management. In a paper known as the Leopold Report, the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended active management of Yellowstone's elk population.\n\nElk overpopulation in Yellowstone is thought by many wildlife biologists, such as Douglas Smith, to have been primarily caused by the extirpation of wolves from the park and surrounding environs. After wolves were removed, elk herds increased in population, reaching new highs during the mid-1930s. The increased number of elk apparently resulted in overgrazing in parts of Yellowstone. Park officials decided that the elk herd should be managed. For approximately thirty years, the park elk herds were culled: Each year some were captured and shipped to other locations, a certain number were killed by park rangers, and hunters were allowed to take more elk that migrated outside the park. By the late 1960s the herd populations dropped to historic lows (less than 4,000 for the Northern Range herd). This caused outrage among both conservationists and hunters. The park service stopped culling elk in 1968. The elk population then rebounded. Twenty years later there were 19,000 elk in the Northern Range herd, a historic high.\n\nSince the tumultuous 1970s, when animal rights activists and environmentalists began to challenge some aspects of wildlife management, the profession has been overshadowed by the rise of conservation biology. Although wildlife managers remain central to the implementation of the Endangered Species Act and other wildlife conservation policies, conservation biologists have shifted the focus of conservation away from wildlife management's concern with the protection and restoration of single species and toward the maintenance of ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nThere are two general types of wildlife management: \n\n\nThe control of wildlife through killing and hunting has been criticized by animal rights and animal welfare activists. Critics object to the real or perceived cruelty involved in some forms of wildlife management.-\nEnvironmentalists have also opposed hunting where they believe it is unnecessary or will negatively affect biodiversity. Critics of game keeping note that habitat manipulation and predator control are often used to maintain artificially inflated populations of valuable game animals (including introduced exotics) without regard to the ecological integrity of the habitat.\n\nGame keepers in the UK claim it to be necessary for wildlife conservation as the amount of countryside they look after exceeds by a factor of nine the amount in nature reserves and national parks.\n\nWildlife management studies, research and lobbying by interest groups help designate times of the year when certain wildlife species can be legally hunted, allowing for surplus animals to be removed. In the United States, hunting season and bag limits are determined by guidelines set by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for migratory game such as waterfowl and other migratory gamebirds. The hunting season and bag limits for state regulated game species such as deer are usually determined by State game Commissions, which are made up of representatives from various interest groups, wildlife biologists, and researchers.\n\nOpen and closed season on deer in the UK is legislated for in the Deer Act 1991 and the Deer Act (Scotland) 1996\n\nOpen season is when wildlife is allowed to be hunted by law and is usually not during the breeding season. Hunters may be restricted by sex, age or class of animal, for instance there may be an open season for any male deer with 4 points or better on at least one side.\n\nWhere the number of animals taken is to be tightly controlled, managers may have a type of lottery system called limited. Many apply, few are chosen. These hunts may still have age, sex or class restrictions.\n\nClosed season is when wildlife is protected from hunting and is usually during its breeding season. Closed season is enforced by law, any hunting during closed season is punishable by law and termed as illegal hunting or poaching.\n\nIn wildlife management one of the conservation principles is that the weapon used for hunting should be the one that causes the least damage to the animal and is sufficiently effective so that it hits the target. Given State and Local laws, types of weapon can also vary depending on type, size, sex of game and also the geographical layout of that specific hunting area.\n\n\n\n"}

She was taught locally before attending Carysfort Training College from 1925 to 1927, graduating with a qualification for primary level. She later studied at UCD, where she obtained an M.A. in education.\n\nShe taught at Scoil Mhuire in Howth from 1927, and became principal of Scoil Eoin Baiste girls' school in Clontarf in 1941. By the 1950s, Scoil Eoin was one of the most prestigious in Dublin. The following decade she introduced audio-visual equipment, years before their official introduction as part of the curriculum in 1974.\n\nNí Cheanainn was actively involved in many areas of education, such as the Eigse Raifteri summer school, the Comoradh Mhic Eil, the Irish branch of UNESCO, the Irish-German society, and Corfheile na Scoileanna.\n\nShe was a co-founder of Cumann Scannán na nÓg, which was merged with the Irish Film Institute to form the Irish Film Centre. She was the only woman appointed to the Radio Éireann authority, serving from 1960 to 1965, but was disappointed not to be asked to serve a second term. It was at her insistence that the authority's name was changed to Raidió Teilifís Éireann in 1966.\n\nShe published a biography of John MacHale in 1983.\n\nÁine Ní Cheanainn remained unmarried. She spent the last years of her life at Grove Nursing Home, Killiney, County Dublin. She died in June 1999 and was buried in Kiltimagh, survived by one sister.\n\n"}
