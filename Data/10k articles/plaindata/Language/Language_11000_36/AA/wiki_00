The implementation of this decision became mandatory after the 2011 Croatian census, according to which Serbs in Vukovar comprise more than one-third (34.8%) of Vukovar's total population. Signs in the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet had been put up as the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities mandates bilingual signs in any area where more than one-third of the population belongs to an ethnic minority. This decision became subject of intense agitation by, among others, Croatian war veterans and many ordinary citizens who believe that due to events, particularly the Battle of Vukovar, the city should have been excluded from the application of the law on minority rights, although protests and vandalism have occurred in other towns and cities (i.e. Split, Dubrovnik, etc). The Serbs of Croatia are a minority group that have the narrowest usage of right to bilingualism among all national minorities in Croatia.<ref name=\"Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\"></ref>\n\nThe Group called \"HQs for defense of Croatian Vukovar\" initiated protest rallies on 2 September, as soon as the placement of the signs written in both the Latin and the Cyrillic scripts began in Vukovar. With protests in Vukovar, in April 2013 there were also organized protests in Zagreb's main square with around 20,000 participants. Parallel protests were held in Tovarnik, Bogdanovci, Lovas, and Nuštar. A number of signs in the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet were torn down, others were smashed with hammers, and protesters clashed with the police, leaving four police officers slightly injured. Some of supporters not directly connected to the protesters organized actions of writing pro-fascist Ustaše graffiti on the Orthodox Church of the Holy Annunciation in Dubrovnik and in Zadar.\n\nOn 12 August 2014 Constitutional Court of Croatia decided that referendum proposal on the restriction of the use of minority languages in such a way to increase the required proportion of total population to 50%, is unconstitutional. City Council of Vukovar was required to regulate the use of minority language in its statute within a year after court decision. Government of Croatia was required to define legal mechanism for cases when the representative bodies of local self-government does not implement the obligations under the Law regarding minority languages. National authorities competent for implementation of laws on minority languages were instructed not to implement Law in the City of Vukovar by use of coercive measures until Government of Croatia fulfill its obligation.\n\nIn April 2015 United Nations Human Rights Committee urged Croatia to ensure the right of minorities to use their language and alphabet. Committee report stated that particularly concerns the use of Serbian Cyrillic in the town of Vukovar and municipalities concerned. Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dačić said that his country welcomes the UN Human Rights Committee's report.\n\nOn 17 August 2015, under requirement of Constitutional Court of Croatia, the City Council of Vukovar decided to amend the city statute in such a way as not to provide bilingual signs in Latin and Cyrillic scripts at official town buildings, institutions, squares and streets. Council of Europe stated its regret about this decision. Decision was taken by MP's from Croatian Democratic Union and Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja while MP's FROM Social Democratic Party of Croatia, Independent Democratic Serb Party and Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats left session at which the decision was taken. Ministry of Public Administration (Croatia) announced that it would overturn the decision if it is established to be contrary to the constitution.\n\nThe local civic society \"The city, that's us too\" suggested that the dispute could be resolved by putting on the right side of the entrance to local government buildings a sign in Croatian Latin script, and on the left side a sign in the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities living in Vukovar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1861 General Assembly of Syrmia County unanimously adopted decision on introduction of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet as official alphabet on the territory of county. This decision was reversed eight years later in 1869 when the Parliament of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia adopted decision on exclusive usage of Gaj's Latin alphabet and repealed the county decision on usage of Cyrillic. This caused dissatisfaction among the Serbs of Vukovar who sent a letter of protest to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria since the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia was part of Austro-Hungarian Empire. Citizens of Vukovar asked the emperor to protect his subjects from the parliament's decision, pointing out that the decision was unreasonable, especially since even the Diet of Hungary of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen accepted their letters in Cyrillic.\n\nDuring World War II, the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was banned throughout the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nState sanctioned Bookocide was carried out by the Government of the Republic of Croatia between 1990 and 2010. Books that were written in Serbian Cyrillic were burned with an estimated 2,8 million books destroyed in this period. \n\nOn 5 November 2013, the Croatian Democratic Union and Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starčević adopted amendments to the city's statutes, declaring Vukovar to be a \"place of special reverence\" of the Serbian destruction of the town during the Battle of Vukovar and prohibited usage of Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Milorad Pupovac, president of Serb National Council, said he expects that the Croatian government or Constitutional Court of Croatia would annul this decision.\n\n"}

Sometimes the ego follows the instructions of the superego in doing so; sometimes however it develops a double-countercathexis, so as to block feelings of guilt and anxiety deriving from the superego, as well as id impulses.\n\nFreud saw the establishment of a permanent anticathexis as a prerequisite for successful psychological repression. He also saw countercathexis as playing a central role in isolation.\n\nIn a late work, Freud further distinguished between the external anticathexis of repression and what he called “internal anticathexis\" (i.e. alteration of the ego through reaction formation).\n\nAnticathexis has also been linked to the phenomenon of figure-ground, in that it may entail the suppression of the margin or ground of a perceptual field.\n\n"}

He founded the weekly \"Fedraheim\" in 1877, in which he urged reforms in many spheres including political, social, religious, agrarian, and linguistic. He was married to Hulda Garborg.\n\nHe was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature six times.\n\nGarborg grew up on a farm named Garborg, near Undheim, in Time municipality at Jæren in Rogaland county. He grew up together with eight siblings. Although he was to become known as an author, it was as a newspaperman that he got his start. In 1872 he established the newspaper Tvedestrandsposten, and in 1877 the Fedraheimen, which he served as managing editor until 1892. In the 1880s he was also a journalist for the Dagbladet. In 1894 he laid the ground, together with Rasmus Steinsvik, for the paper \"Den 17de Mai\"; which changed its name to Norsk Tidend in 1935.\n\nHis novels are profound and gripping while his essays are clear and insightful. He was never inclined to steer clear of controversy. His work tackled the issues of the day, including the relevance of religion in modern times, the conflicts between national and European identity, and the ability of the common people to actually participate in political processes and decisions.\n\nIn 2012 the Garborg Centre opened at Bryne, Time. It is dedicated to the literature and philosophy of Arne and his wife, Hulda.

{"id": "4693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4693", "title": "Berber languages", "text": "Berber languages\n\nThe Berber languages, also known as Berber or the Amazigh languages (Berber name: , ; Neo-Tifinagh: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ, Tuareg Tifinagh: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵗⵜ, ⵝⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵗⵝ, , ), are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family. They comprise a group of closely related dialects spoken by the Berbers, who are indigenous to North Africa. The languages were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of Tifinagh.\n\nBerber is spoken by large populations of Morocco, Algeria and Libya, by smaller populations of Tunisia, northern Mali, western and northern Niger, northern Burkina Faso and Mauritania and in the Siwa Oasis of Egypt. Large Berber-speaking migrant communities, today numbering about 4 million, have been living in Western Europe, spanning over three generations, since the 1950s. The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers. The bulk of the populations of the Maghreb countries are considered to have Berber ancestors.\n\nAround 90% of the Berber-speaking population speak one of seven major varieties of Berber, each with at least 2 million speakers. They are, in order of number of speakers: Shilha (\"Tacelḥit/Tasussit\"), Kabyle (\"Taqbaylit\"), Central Atlas Tamazight (\"Tamaziɣt\"), Riffian (internal:\"Tmaziɣt, external:Tarifit\"), Shawiya (\"Tacawit\") and Tuareg (\"Tamaceq/Tamajaq/Tamahaq\"). The extinct Guanche language spoken on the Canary Islands by the Guanches as well as the languages of the ancient C-Group culture in present-day southern Egypt and northern Sudan are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.\n\nThe Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition, on and off, for about 2,500 years, although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by cultural shifts and invasions. They were first written in the Libyco-Berber abjad, which is still used today by the Tuareg in the form of Tifinagh. The oldest dated inscription is from 3rd century BCE. Later, between about 1000 CE and 1500 CE, they were written in the Arabic script, and since the 20th century they have been written in the Berber Latin alphabet, especially among the Kabyle and Riffian communities of Morocco and Algeria. The Berber Latin alphabet was also used by most European and Berber linguists during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nA modernised form of the Tifinagh alphabet, called Neo-Tifinagh, was adopted in Morocco in 2003 for writing Berber, but many Moroccan Berber publications still use the Berber Latin alphabet. Algerians mostly use the Berber Latin alphabet in Berber-language education at public schools, while Tifinagh is mostly used for artistic symbolism. Mali and Niger recognise a Tuareg Berber Latin alphabet customised to the Tuareg phonological system. However, traditional Tifinagh is still used in those countries.\n\nThere is a cultural and political movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to promote and unify them under a written standard language called \"Tamaziɣt\" (or \"Tamazight\"). The name \"Tamaziɣt\" is the current native name of the Berber language in the Moroccan Middle Atlas and Rif regions and the Libyan Zuwarah region. In other Berber-speaking areas, this name was lost. There is historical evidence from medieval Berber manuscripts that all indigenous North Africans from Libya to Morocco have at some point called their language \"Tamaziɣt\". The name \"Tamaziɣt\" is currently being used increasingly by educated Berbers to refer to the written Berber language, and even to Berber as a whole, including Tuareg.\n\nIn 2001, Berber became a constitutional national language of Algeria, and in 2011 Berber became a constitutionally official language of Morocco. In 2016, Berber became a constitutionally official language of Algeria alongside Arabic.\n\nThe term \"Berber\" has been used in Europe since at least the 17th century and is still used today. It was borrowed from Latin \"barbari\". The Latin word is also found in the Arabic designation for these populations, البربر (\"al-Barbar\"); see Names of the Berber people.\n\nEtymologically, the Berber root \"M-Z-Ɣ\" (\"Mazigh\") (singular noun: \"Amazigh\", feminine: \"Tamazight\") means \"free man\", \"noble man\", or \"defender\". The feminine \"Tamazight\" traditionally referred specifically to the Riffian and Central Atlas Tamazight languages. Many Berber linguists prefer to consider the term \"Tamazight\" as a pure Berber word to be used only in Berber text while using the European word \"Berber/\"Berbero\"/\"Berbère\"\" in European texts to follow the traditions of European writings about the Berbers. European languages distinguish between the words \"Berber\" and \"barbarian\", while Arabic has the same word \"al-Barbari\" for both meanings.\n\nSome other Berber writers, especially in Morocco, prefer to refer to Berber with \"Amazigh\" when writing about it in French or English.\n\nTraditionally, the term \"Tamazight\" (in various forms: \"Thamazighth\", \"Tamasheq\", \"Tamajaq\", \"Tamahaq\") was used by many Berber groups to refer to the language they spoke, including the Middle Atlas, the Riffians, the Sened in Tunisia and the Tuareg. However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance, some Berber populations of Algeria called their language \"Taznatit\" (Zenati) or \"Shelha\", while the Kabyles called theirs \"Taqbaylit\", and the inhabitants of the Siwa Oasis called their language \"Siwi\". In Tunisia, the local Amazigh language is usually referred to as \"Shelha\", a term which has been observed in Morocco as well.\n\nOne group, the Linguasphere Observatory, has attempted to introduce the neologism \"Tamazic languages\" to refer to the Berber languages.\n\nBerber is a branch of the Afroasiatic language family. Since modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous, the date of the Proto-Berber language from which the modern group is derived was probably comparatively recent, comparable to the age of the Germanic or Romance subfamilies. In contrast, the split of the group from the other Afroasiatic sub-phyla is much earlier, and is therefore sometimes associated with the local Mesolithic Capsian culture. A number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afroasiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the C-Group culture in present-day southern Egypt and northern Sudan spoke Berber languages. The Nilo-Saharan Nobiin language today contains a number of key pastoralism related loanwords that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/Nile. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population — which, along with the Kerma culture, inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.\n\nRoger Blench (2018) suggests that Proto-Berber speakers had spread from the Nile River valley to North Africa 4,000-5,000 years ago due to the spread of pastoralism, and experienced intense language leveling about 2,000 years ago as the Roman Empire was expanding in North Africa. Hence, although Berber had split off from Afroasiatic several thousand years ago, Proto-Berber itself can only be reconstructed to a period as late as 200 A.D. Blench (2018) notes that Berber is considerably different from other Afroasiatic branches, but modern-day Berber languages display low internal diversity. The presence of Punic borrowings in Proto-Berber points to the diversification of modern Berber language varieties subsequent to the fall of Carthage in 146 B.C.; only Zenaga lacks Punic loanwords. Additionally, Latin loanwords in Proto-Berber point to the breakup of Proto-Berber between 0-200 A.D. During this time period, Roman innovations including the ox-plough, camel, and orchard management were adopted by Berber communities along the \"limes\", or borders of the Roman Empire. This resulted in a new trading culture involving the use of a lingua franca which became Proto-Berber.\n\nVarious orthographies have been used to transcribe the Berber languages. In antiquity, the Libyco-Berber script (Tifinagh) was utilised to write Berber. Early uses of the script have been found on rock art and in various sepulchres. Among these are the 1,500 year old monumental tomb of the Tuareg matriarch Tin Hinan, where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.\n\nFollowing the spread of Islam, some Berber scholars also utilised the Arabic script. There are now three writing systems in use for Berber languages: Tifinagh, the Arabic script, and the Berber Latin alphabet.\n\nAfter independence, all the Maghreb countries to varying degrees pursued a policy of Arabisation, aimed partly at displacing French from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy. Under this policy the use of the Amazigh/Berber languages was suppressed or even banned. This state of affairs has been contested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria—especially Kabylie—and was addressed in both countries by affording the language official status and introducing it in some schools.\n\nThe 2011 constitution of Morocco makes \"Amazigh\" an official language alongside Arabic. Morocco is a country with several competing linguistically different languages, including French, Modern Standard Arabic, Moroccan Arabic and Amazigh. As the higher status of Modern Standard Arabic grew, so did the relation between the male population and the language, as well as the female population and the lower status language Amazigh. Women became the main carriers of the Amazigh language as the lower-status language in the country. On 17 June 2011 King Mohammed VI announced in a speech of new constitutional reform that \"Tamazight\" became an official language of Morocco alongside Arabic and will be used in all the administrations in the future. On 30 April 2012 Fatima Chahou, alias \"Tabaamrant\", member of the Moroccan House of Representatives and former singer became the first person to ask questions and discuss the minister's answer in Tamazight inside the Parliament of Morocco.\n\nAlgeria recognized Berber as a \"national language\" in 2002, though not as an official one. However, on 7 February 2016 the Algerian parliament recognised Berber languages as having official status along with Arabic.\n\nAlthough regional councils in Libya's Nafusa Mountains affiliated with the National Transitional Council reportedly use the Berber language of Nafusi and have called for it to be granted co-official status with Arabic in a prospective new constitution, it does not have official status in Libya as in Morocco and Algeria. As areas of Libya south and west of Tripoli such as the Nafusa Mountains were taken from the control of Gaddafi government forces in early summer 2011, Berber workshops and exhibitions sprang up to share and spread the Tamazight culture and language.\n\nIn Mali and Niger, there are a few schools that teach partially in Tuareg languages.\n\nThe exact population of Berber speakers is hard to ascertain, since most North African countries do not record language data in their censuses. Ethnologue provides a useful academic starting point; however, its bibliographic references are very inadequate, and it rates its own accuracy at only B-C for the area. Early colonial censuses may provide better documented figures for some countries; however, these are also very much out of date.\n\n\nA survey included in the official Moroccan census of 2004 and published by several Moroccan newspapers gave the following figures: 34 percent of people in rural regions spoke a Berber language and 21 percent in urban zones did; the national average would be 28.4 percent or 8.52 million. It is possible, however, that the survey asked for the language \"used in daily life\", which would result in figures lower than those of native speakers, as the language is not recognised for official purposes and many Berbers who live in an Arabic-speaking environment cannot use it in daily life; also, the use of Berber in public was frowned upon until the 1990s, which may have affected the result of the survey.\n\nAdding up the population (according to the official census of 2004) of the Berber-speaking regions as shown on a 1973 map from the CIA results in at least 10 million speakers, not counting the numerous Berber population which lives outside these regions in the bigger cities.\n\nMoroccan linguist Mohamed Chafik claims that 80 percent of Moroccans are Berbers. It is not clear, however, whether he means \"speakers of Berber languages\" or \"people of Berber descent\".\n\nThe division of Moroccan Berber languages into three groups, as used by Ethnologue, is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by the presence of local differences: Shilha is subdivided into Shilha of the Draa River valley, Tasusit (the language of the Souss) and several other mountain languages. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain languages cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the central and eastern Atlas area) or Shilha.\n\nOther Berber languages spoken in Algeria include: the Tamazight of Blida, the languages of the Beni Snouss and Beni Boussaid villages in the province of Tlemcen, the Matmata Berber spoken in the Ouarsenis region, the Mozabite language spoken in the region of the province of Mzab and the language of the Ouargla oasis.\n\nThus, the total number of speakers of Berber languages in the Maghreb proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if we take Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million. The vast majority are concentrated in Morocco and Algeria. The Tuareg of the Sahel adds another million or so to the total.\n\nNouns in the Berber languages vary in gender (masculine versus feminine), number (singular versus plural) and state (free state versus construct state). In the case of the masculine, nouns generally begin with one of the three vowels of Berber, \"a\", \"u\" or \"i\" (in standardised orthography, \"e\" represents a schwa inserted for reasons of pronunciation):\n\nWhile the masculine is unmarked, the feminine (also used to form diminutives and singulatives, like an ear of wheat) is marked with the circumfix \"t...t\". Feminine plural takes a prefix \"t...\":\n\nBerber languages have two types of number: singular and plural, of which only the latter is marked. Plural has three forms according to the type of nouns. The first, \"regular\" type is known as the \"external plural\"; it consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a suffix \"-n\":\nThe second form of the plural is known as the \"broken plural\". It involves only a change in the vowels of the word:\nThe third type of plural is a mixed form: it combines a change of vowels with the suffix \"-n\":\n\nBerber languages also have two types of states or cases of the noun, organized ergatively: one is unmarked, while the other serves for the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called \"free state\", the latter \"construct state\". The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:\nThe first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel \"a\" becomes \"u\":\nThe second involves the loss of the initial vowel, in the case of some feminine nouns:\nThe third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (\"w\" or \"y\") word-initially:\nFinally, some nouns do not change for free state:\n\nThe following table gives the forms for the noun \"amghar\" \"old man / leader\":\n\nBerber pronouns show gender distinction in the second- and third-persons, but in verbal agreement markers, the distinction is lost in the second-person.\n\nA listing of the other Berber languages is complicated by their closeness; there is little distinction between language and dialect. The primary difficulty of subclassification, however, lies in the eastern Berber languages, where there is little agreement. Otherwise there is consensus on the outlines of the family:\n\nThe various classifications differ primarily in what they consider to be Eastern Berber, and in how many varieties they recognise as distinct languages.\n\nThere is so little data available on Guanche that any classification is necessarily uncertain; however, it is almost universally acknowledged as Afro-Asiatic on the basis of the surviving glosses, and widely suspected to be Berber. Much the same can be said of the language, sometimes called \"Numidian\", used in the Libyan or Libyco-Berber inscriptions around the turn of the Common Era, whose alphabet is the ancestor of Tifinagh.\n\nMaarten Kossmann (1999) describes Berber as two dialect continua,\nplus a few peripheral languages, spoken in isolated pockets largely surrounded by Arabic, that fall outside these continua, namely\nWithin Northern Berber, however, he recognises a break in the continuum between Zenati and their non-Zenati neighbours; and in the east, he recognises a division between Ghadamès and Awjila on the one hand and Sokna (Fuqaha, Libya), Siwa and Djebel Nefusa on the other. The implied tree is:\n\nEthnologue, mostly following Aikhenvald and Militarev (1991), treats the eastern varieties differently:\n\nBlench (ms, 2006) has the following classification:\n\nand within Berber,\n\nThe Berber languages have influenced Maghrebi Arabic languages, such as Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian Arabic. Their influence is also seen in some languages in West Africa. F. W. H. Migeod pointed to strong resemblances between Berber and Hausa in such words and phrases as these: Berber: obanis; Hausa \"obansa\" (his father); Berber: a bat; Hausa \"ya bata\" (he was lost); Berber: eghare; Hausa \"ya kirra\" (he called). In addition he notes that the genitive in both languages is formed with n = \"of\".\n\nA number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afro-Asiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the C-Group culture in present-day southern Egypt and northern Sudan spoke Berber languages. The Nilo-Saharan Nobiin language today contains a number of key pastoralism related loanwords that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/Nile. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population — which, along with the Kerma culture, inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.\n\nAdditionally, historical linguistics indicate that the Guanche language, which was spoken on the Canary Islands by the ancient Guanches, likely belonged to the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.\n\nThe Berber letter \"c\" is pronounced (like the English \"sh\").\n\nThe Berber letter \"x\" is pronounced (like the Spanish \"j\" or the German \"ch\" (Ach-Laut)).\n\nThe Berber letter \"ɣ\" is pronounced (like the French or German \"r\").\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39700", "title": "Dari language", "text": "Dari language\n\nDarī ( ) or Dari Persian ( ' ) or synonymously Farsi ( ' ) is a variation of the Persian language spoken in Afghanistan. Dari is the term officially recognized and promoted since 1964 by the Afghan government for the Persian language, hence, it is also known as Afghan Persian in many Western sources. This has resulted in a naming dispute. Many Persian speakers in Afghanistan prefer and use the name \"Farsi\" and say the term Dari has been forced on them by the dominant Pashtun ethnic group as an attempt to distance Afghans from their cultural, linguistic, and historical ties to the Persian-speaking world, which includes Iran, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nAs defined in the Constitution of Afghanistan, it is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan; the other is Pashto. Dari is the most widely spoken language in Afghanistan and the native language of approximately 15–30% of the population, serving as the country's lingua franca. The Iranian and Afghan types of Persian are mutually intelligible, with differences found primarily in the vocabulary and phonology.\n\nBy way of Early New Persian, Dari Persian, like Iranian Persian and Tajik, is a continuation of Middle Persian, the official religious and literary language of the Sassanian Empire (224–651 CE), itself a continuation of Old Persian, the language of the Achaemenids (550–330 BC). In historical usage, \"Dari\" refers to the Middle Persian court language of the Sassanids.\n\nDari is a name given to the New Persian language since the 10th century, widely used in Arabic (compare Al-Estakhri, Al-Muqaddasi, and Ibn Hawqal) and Persian texts.\n\nSince 1964, it has been the official name in Afghanistan for the Persian spoken there. In Afghanistan, Dari refers to a modern dialect form of Persian that is the \"standard language\" used in administration, government, radio, television, and print media. Because of a preponderance of Dari native speakers, who normally refer to the language as \"Fārsi\" (; \"Persian\"), it is also known as \"Afghan Persian\" in some Western sources.\n\nThere are different opinions about the origin of the word \"Dari\". The majority of scholars believes that \"Dari\" refers to the Persian word \"dar\" or \"darbār\" (), meaning \"Court\", as it was the formal language of the Sassanids. The original meaning of the word \"dari\" is given in a notice attributed to Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ (cited by Ibn al-Nadim in \"Al-Fehrest\"). According to him, \"\"Pārsī\" was the language spoken by priests, scholars, and the like; it is the language of Fars.\" This language refers to the Middle Persian. As for \"Dari\", he says, \"it is the language of the cities of Madā'en; it is spoken by those who are at the king’s court. [Its name] is connected with presence at court. Among the languages of the people of Khorasan and the east, the language of the people of Balkh is predominant.”\n\nThe Dari language spoken in Afghanistan is not to be confused with the language of Iran called Dari or Gabri, which is a language of the Central Iranian subgroup spoken in some Zoroastrian communities.\n\nNote: according to the CIA Fact Book, the percentage of Persian/Dari speakers in Afghanistan is 80%. 1a\nThe CIA Fact Book writes: Afghan Persian or Dari (official) 80% (Dari functions as the lingua franca), Pashto (official) 47%...\n\nDari comes from Middle Persian which was spoken during the rule of the Sassanid dynasty. In general, Iranian languages are known from three periods, usually referred to as Old, Middle, and New (Modern) periods. These correspond to three eras in Iranian history, the old era being the period from some time before, during and after the Achaemenid period (that is, to 300 BC), the Middle Era being the next period, namely, the Sassanid period and part of the post-Sassanid period, and the New era being the period afterwards down to the present day.\n\nBut it is thought that the first person in Europe to use the term \"Deri\" for \"Dari\" was Thomas Hyde, at Oxford, in his chief work, \"Historia religionis veterum Persarum\" (1700).\n\n\"Dari\" or \"Deri\" has two meanings:\nTranslation according to literature and poetry:\n\"Even though in euphonious Hindi* is sugar\" –\n\"Rhyme method in Dari (Persian) is sweeter *\"\n\n\"Qandi Parsi\" or \"[Ghand e Parsi]\" (Rock candy of Parsi\") is a metaphor for the Persian language and poetry.\n\nThis poem is a poetic statement of the poet Iqbal with respect to the poetry of the 14th century Persian poet Hafez:\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nPersian replaced the Central Asian languages of the Eastern Iranics. Ferghana, Samarkand, and Bukhara were starting to be linguistically Darified in originally Khorezmian and Soghdian areas during Samanid rule. Dari Persian spread around the Oxus River region, Afghanistan, and Khorasan after the Arab conquests and during Islamic-Arab rule. The replacement of the Pahlavi script with the Arabic script in order to write the Persian language was done by the Tahirids in 9th century Khorasan. The Dari Persian language spread and led to the extinction of Eastern Iranian languages like Bactrian, Khwarezmian with only a tiny amount of Sogdian descended Yaghnobi speakers remaining among the now Persian-speaking Tajik population of Central Asia, due to the fact that the Arab-Islamic army which invaded Central Asia also included some Persians who governed the region like the Sassanids. Persian was rooted into Central Asia by the Samanids. Persian phased out Sogdian. The role of lingua franca that Sogdian originally played was succeeded by Persian after the arrival of Islam.\n\nPersian was a major language of government and diplomacy until the middle of the 1700s. Subsequently the strength of Persia declined relative to the industrializing states of Europe (many of whom pursued imperialist policies in the regions where Persian was spoken).\n\nThis table gives information how many times the poets of the Persian literature wrote the terms Iran, Turan, Parsi, Farsi, Dari, Khorassan and Pahlevi. It is worth mentioning that many of Nazm ( = Poem نظم) yi Dari or \"Dastan i Dari\" (tale of Dari), Tarz e Guftar e Dari (طرز گفتار دری style of Dari convers) have spoken. Nazm (verse form) and Nassir (نثر = novel, short story etc.) and درامه drama) - the three genres of literature. New Persian literature begins with Poems of Rudaki.\n\nDari, which is sometimes called \"Farsi\" (Persian), is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan (the other being Pashto). In practice though, it serves as the de facto lingua franca among the various ethno-linguistic groups.\n\nDari is spoken natively by about twenty-five percent to about eighty percent population of Afghanistan as a primary language. Tajiks, who comprise approximately 27% of the population, are the primary speakers, followed by Hazaras (9%) and Aymāqs (4%). Moreover, many Pashtuns living in Tajik and Hazara concentrated areas also use Dari as a first language. The World Factbook states that eighty percent of the Afghan population speaks the Dari language. About 2.5 million Afghans in Iran and Afghans in Pakistan, part of the wider Afghan diaspora, also speak Dari as one of their primary languages.\n\nDari dominates the northern, western and central areas of Afghanistan, and is the common language spoken in cities such as Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Fayzabad, Panjshir, Bamiyan, and the Afghan capital of Kabul where all ethnic groups are settled. Dari-speaking communities also exist in southwestern and eastern Pashtun-dominated areas such as in the cities of Ghazni, Farah, Zaranj, Lashkar Gah, Kandahar, and Gardez.\n\nDari has contributed to the majority of Persian borrowings in other Asian languages, such as Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, etc., as it was the administrative, official, cultural language of the Persocentric Mughal Empire and served as the lingua franca throughout the South Asian subcontinent for centuries. Often based in Afghanistan, Turkic Central Asian conquerors brought the language into South Asia. The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties. The sizable Persian component of the Anglo-Indian loan words in English and in Urdu therefore reflects the Dari pronunciation. For instance, the words dopiaza and pyjama come from the Dari pronunciation; in the Iranian Persian they are pronounced \"do-piyāzeh\" and \"pey-jāmeh\". Persian lexemes and certain morphological elements (e.g., the \"ezāfe\") have often been employed to coin words for political and cultural concepts, items, or ideas that were historically unknown outside the South Asian region, as is the case with the aforementioned \"borrowings\". The Dari language has a rich and colorful tradition of proverbs that deeply reflect Afghan culture and relationships, as demonstrated by U.S. Navy Captain Edward Zellem in his bilingual books on Afghan Dari proverbs collected in Afghanistan.\n\nThere are phonological, lexical, and morphological differences between Afghan Persian and Iranian Persian. There are no significant differences in the written forms, other than regional idiomatic phrases.\n\nThe principal differences between standard Iranian Persian, based on the dialect of the capital Tehran, and Afghan Persian, as based on the Kabul dialect, are:\n\n\nThe dialects of Dari spoken in Northern, Central and Eastern Afghanistan, for example in Kabul, Mazar, and Badakhshan, have distinct features compared to Iranian Persian. However, the dialect of Dari spoken in Western Afghanistan stands in between the Afghan and Iranian Persian. For instance, the Herati dialect shares vocabulary and phonology with both Dari and Iranian Persian. Likewise, the dialect of Persian in Eastern Iran, for instance in Mashhad, is quite similar to the Herati dialect of Afghanistan.\n\nThe Kabuli dialect has become the standard model of Dari in Afghanistan, as has the Tehrani dialect in relation to the Persian in Iran. Since the 1940s, Radio Afghanistan has broadcast its Dari programs in Kabuli Dari, which ensured the homogenization between the Kabuli version of the language and other dialects of Dari spoken throughout Afghanistan. Since 2003, the media, especially the private radio and television broadcasters, have carried out their Dari programs using the Kabuli variety.\n\nSuccessive governments of Afghanistan have promoted New Persian as an official language of government since the time of the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526), even as those governments were dominated by Pashtun people. Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty (1826–1973) first introduced the Pashto language as an additional language of administration. The local name for the Persian variety spoken in Afghanistan was officially changed from Farsi to Dari, meaning \"court language\", in 1964. Within their respective linguistic boundaries, Dari and Pashto are the media of education.\n\n\n\n"}

Deeplearning4j includes implementations of the restricted Boltzmann machine, deep belief net, deep autoencoder, stacked denoising autoencoder and recursive neural tensor network, word2vec, doc2vec, and GloVe. These algorithms all include distributed parallel versions that integrate with Apache Hadoop and Spark.\n\nDeeplearning4j is open-source software released under Apache License 2.0, developed mainly by a machine learning group headquartered in San Francisco and Tokyo and led by Adam Gibson. It is supported commercially by the startup Skymind, which bundles DL4J, Tensorflow, Keras and other deep learning libraries in an enterprise distribution called the Skymind Intelligence Layer. Deeplearning4j was contributed to the Eclipse Foundation in October 2017.\n\nDeeplearning4j relies on the widely used programming language Java, though it is compatible with Clojure and includes a Scala application programming interface (API). It is powered by its own open-source numerical computing library, ND4J, and works with both central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nDeeplearning4j has been used in several commercial and academic applications. The code is hosted on GitHub. A support forum is maintained on Gitter.\n\nThe framework is composable, meaning shallow neural nets such as restricted Boltzmann machines, convolutional nets, autoencoders, and recurrent nets can be added to one another to create deep nets of varying types. It also has extensive visualization tools, and a computation graph.\n\nTraining with Deeplearning4j occurs in a cluster. Neural nets are trained in parallel via iterative reduce, which works on Hadoop-YARN and on Spark. Deeplearning4j also integrates with CUDA kernels to conduct pure GPU operations, and works with distributed GPUs.\n\nDeeplearning4j includes an n-dimensional array class using ND4J that allows scientific computing in Java and Scala, similar to the functions that NumPy provides to Python. It's effectively based on a library for linear algebra and matrix manipulation in a production environment.\n\nDataVec vectorizes various file formats and data types using an input/output format system similar to Hadoop's use of MapReduce; that is, it turns various data types into columns of scalars termed vectors. DataVec is designed to vectorize CSVs, images, sound, text, video, and time series.\n\nDeeplearning4j includes a vector space modeling and topic modeling toolkit, implemented in Java and integrating with parallel GPUs for performance. It is designed to handle large text sets.\n\nDeeplearning4j includes implementations of term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf–idf), deep learning, and Mikolov's word2vec algorithm, doc2vec, and GloVe, reimplemented and optimized in Java. It relies on t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for word-cloud visualizations.\n\nReal-world use cases for Deeplearning4j include network intrusion detection and cybersecurity, fraud detection for the financial sector, anomaly detection in industries such as manufacturing, recommender systems in e-commerce and advertising, and image recognition. Deeplearning4j has integrated with other machine-learning platforms such as RapidMiner, Prediction.io, and Weka.\n\nDeeplearning4j serves machine-learning models for inference in production using the free developer edition of SKIL, the Skymind Intelligence Layer. A model server serves the parametric machine-learning models that makes decisions about data. It is used for the inference stage of a machine-learning workflow, after data pipelines and model training. A model server is the tool that allows data science research to be deployed in a real-world production environment.\n\nWhat a Web server is to the Internet, a model server is to AI. Where a Web server receives an HTTP request and returns data about a Web site, a model server receives data, and returns a decision or prediction about that data: e.g. sent an image, a model server might return a label for that image, identifying faces or animals in photographs.\n\nThe SKIL model server is able to import models from Python frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, Theano and CNTK, overcoming a major barrier in deploying deep learning models.\n\nDeeplearning4j is as fast as Caffe for non-trivial image recognition tasks using multiple GPUs. For programmers unfamiliar with HPC on the JVM, there are several parameters that must be adjusted to optimize neural network training time. These include setting the heap space, the garbage collection algorithm, employing off-heap memory and pre-saving data (pickling) for faster ETL. Together, these optimizations can lead to a 10x acceleration in performance with Deeplearning4j.\n\nDeeplearning4j can be used via multiple API languages including Java, Scala, Python and Clojure. Its Scala API is called ScalNet. Keras serves as its Python API. And its Clojure wrapper is known as DL4CLJ. The core languages performing the large-scale mathematical operations necessary for deep learning are C, C++ and CUDA C.\n\nTensorflow, Keras and Deeplearning4j work together. Deeplearning4j can import models from Tensorflow and other Python frameworks if they have been created with Keras.\n\n"}

It is the totality of things relevant to some subject matter. Without expressed or implied limits, it may refer to anything. The Universe is everything that exists theoretically, though a multiverse may exist according to theoretical cosmology predictions. It may refer to an anthropocentric worldview, or the sum of human experience, history, and the human condition in general. Every object and entity is a part of everything, including all physical bodies and in some cases all abstract objects.\n\nIn ordinary conversation, \"everything\" usually refers only to the totality of things relevant to the subject matter. When there is no expressed limitation, \"everything\" may refer to the universe, the world.\n\nThe \"Universe\" is most commonly defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term \"universe\" may be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting such concepts as the \"cosmos\", the \"world\" or \"Nature\". According to some speculations, this universe may be one of many disconnected universes, which are collectively denoted as the multiverse. In the bubble universe theory, there is an infinite variety of universes, each with different physical constants. In the many-worlds hypothesis, new universes are spawned with every quantum measurement. By definition, these speculations cannot currently be tested experimentally, yet, if they exist, they would still be part of everything.\n\nEspecially in a metaphysical context, \"World\" may refer to everything that constitutes reality and the Universe: see World (philosophy). However, world may \"only\" refer to \"Earth\" envisioned from an anthropocentric or human worldview, as a place by human beings.\n\nIn theoretical physics, a \"theory of everything\" (TOE) is a hypothetical theory that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena. Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of Ijon Tichy—a character from a cycle of Stanisław Lem's science fiction stories of 1960s—was known to work on the \"General Theory of Everything\". Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of quantum physics to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all fundamental interactions of nature.\n\nThere have been many theories of everything proposed by theoretical physicists over the last century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that the accepted theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity are hard to combine. Whereas theories exploring quantum mechanics and string theory are easier to combine. \n\nBased on theoretical holographic principle arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional M-theory, which is described in many sectors by matrix string theory, and in many other sectors by perturbative string theory, is the complete theory of everything. Other physicists disagree.\n\nIn philosophy, a \"theory of everything\" or \"TOE\" is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation of nature or reality. Adopting the term from physics, where the search for a theory of everything is ongoing, philosophers have discussed the viability of the concept and analyzed its properties and implications. Among the questions to be addressed by a philosophical theory of everything are: \"Why is reality understandable?\" \"Why are the laws of nature as they are?\" \"Why is there anything at all?\"\n\n"}

Genealogy typically includes very little of the medical history of the family, but the medical history could be considered a specific subset of the total history of a family. Accurate knowledge of a patient's family history may identify a predisposition to developing certain illnesses, which can inform clinical decisions and allow effective management or even prevention of conditions.\n\nAlthough sometimes neglected, many healthcare professionals glean information on family morbidity of particular diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, mental disorders, diabetes, cancer) to assess whether a person is at risk of developing similar problems. \n\nFamily histories may be imprecise because of various possible reasons:\n\nSome medical conditions are carried only by the female line such as X-linked conditions and some Mitochondrial diseases. Tracing female ancestors can be difficult in societies that change the woman's family name when she marries. Death records often give the maiden name of the deceased, and possibly also the deceased's mother’s maiden name. Some of the most useful records for tracing women are wills and probate records. \n\nOther medical conditions are carried only by the male line, though these Y-linked conditions are rare owing to the small size of the Y Chromosome. Tracing male ancestors may be impossible if the conception is due to rape or sexual activity outside of a marriage.\n\nNot all positive family histories imply a genetic cause. If various members of the same family have been exposed to the same toxin, then they may develop similar symptoms without a genetic cause.\n\nIf a patient has a strong family history of a particular disorder (or group of disorders), this will generally lead to a lower threshold for investigating symptoms or initiating treatment. This is seen particularly in cardiac disease, where a strong family history is considered a significant cardiovascular risk factor.\n\nIn diseases with a known hereditary component, many otherwise healthy people with a positive family history are tested early, with the aim of an early diagnosis and intervention to prevent the symptoms from developing. This has become accepted in hemochromatosis and various other disorders.\n"}

It is both a colloquial term and defined and used in laws, generally referred to as Goonda Acts.\n\nThe word comes from the Tamil word \"goondan\"/\"goondar\" (குண்டன் / குண்டர்) or Telugu word \"goonda\" (గూండా) as well as the Hindustani word \"guṇḍā\" (, , \"rascal\"). There is also the identically-spelled Marathi word with a similar meaning, attested as early as the 17th century, and possibly ultimately having Dravidian roots. Another theory suggests that it originates from the English word \"goon\". However, the first English-language appearance of \"goonda\" (in British newspapers of the 1920s, with the spelling \"goondah\") predates the use of \"goon\" to mean criminal, a semantic change which seems to go back only as far as the 1930s comic strip character Alice the Goon. A related term is \"goonda-gardi\", roughly meaning \"bully-boy tactics\". Another is \"goonda tax\", referring to bribes or money extorted in a protection racket.\n\nMany legislative bodies have passed \"Goonda Acts\" (a colloquial name, due to the long titles) providing legal definitions of who constitutes a \"goonda\". Some of these laws permit harsh treatment such as giving the police the power to shoot them on sight.\n\nBangladesh's Control of Disorderly and Dangerous Persons (Goondas) Act (East Bengal Act IV of 1954), Section 13(1), gives seven grounds under which a tribunal may declare a person to be a goonda and place him on the prescribed list of goondas:\n\nSection 13(2) additionally establishes the category of \"dangerous goonda\", giving more than twenty further grounds on which a tribunal may declare a person to be a dangerous goonda, mostly related to violence, prostitution, and forgery, or offences committed by a person previously declared a goonda under the Act. Per Section 14, goondas may be required to post a bond, and may be restricted from entering gambling houses; dangerous goondas may have much broader restrictions placed on their freedom of movement, and per Section 18 also may have enhanced punishment imposed on them for future offences.\n\nMany states of India have enacted special laws to deal with goondas.\n\nMadhya Pradesh once had a goonda act in force, known as the Central Provinces and Berar Goondas Act (Act X of 1946), amended by Act XLIX of 1950. However it was struck down in 1960 in the Supreme Court of India case \"State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Baldeo Prasad\". The court held that \"the definition of a goonda laid down by the Act, which is of an inclusive character, indicated no tests for deciding whether the person fell within the first part of the definition\".\n\nThe Uttar Pradesh Control of Goondas Act (U.P. Act No. 8 of 1971, amended by U.P. Act No. 1 of 1985) Section 2(b) defines a goonda as a person who:\nSection 3 gives the district magistrate the power to order a goonda in writing to remove himself from a jurisdiction, or to report his movements, for periods of up to six months.\n\nThe Rajasthan Control of Goondas Act (Act No. 14 of 1975), in Section 2(b) defines who is a \"goonda\" for purposes of the Act. Like the similar act in Uttar Pradesh, it provided that goondas may be ordered to leave the district (\"externment\") for up to six months. However, the Rajasthan High Court struck down the externment provisions as unconstitutional in 2001. In particular, the Court pointed out that a person imprisoned had to be provided with a residential accommodation and subsistence at the expense of the state government, whereas the Control of Goondas Act made no provision for a goonda under externment to be provided with residential accommodation, putting him in a comparatively worse situation than a prisoner; this was held to violate the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug-offenders, Forest-offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Slum-grabbers and Video Pirates Act (Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982; \"Video Pirates\" was not added by Act 32 of 2004), Section 2(f) states \"\"goonda\" means a person, who either by himself or as a member of or leader of a gang habitually commits, or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offence, punishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII or Chapter XXII of the Indian Penal Code (Central Act XLV of 1860)\". According to a 2011 ruling of the Madras High Court, even a single offense under the Act permits detention of a person as a goonda.\n\nThe Karnataka Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug-Offenders, Gamblers, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum-Grabbers Act (Act 12 of 1985), as amended by Act 16 of 2001, in Section 2(g) states \"\"goonda\" means a person who either by himself or as a member of or leader of a gang, habitually commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission of offences punishable under Chapter VIII, Chapter XV, Chapter XVI, Chapter XVII or Chapter XXII of the Indian Penal Code (Central Act XLV of 1860)\". In 2014 the Karnataka government brought most offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and Indian Copyright Act, 1957, under the ambit of the Goonda Act. Until now, people with a history of offences like bootlegging, drug offences and immoral trafficking could be taken into preventive custody. But the government, in its enthusiasm, while adding acid attackers and sexual predators to the law, has also added 'digital offenders', meaning \"any person who knowingly or deliberately violates, for commercial purposes, any copyright law in relation to any book, music, film, software, artistic or scientific work and also includes any person who illegally enters through the identity of another user and illegally uses any computer or digital network for pecuniary gain for himself or any other person or commits any of the offences specified under sections 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74 and 75 of the Information Technology Act, 2000\".\n\nThe Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act (Act 34 of 2007), Section 2(j), states \"\"goonda\" means a person who indulges in any anti-social activity or promotes or abets any illegal activity which are harmful for the maintenance of the public order directly or indirectly and includes a bootlegger, a counterfeiter, a depredator of environment, a digital data and copy right pirate, a drug offender, a hawala racketeer, a hired ruffian, rowdy, an immoral traffic offender, a loan shark or a property grabber\".\n\nThe Punjab Control of Goondas Ordinance (W.P. Ordinance XXXV of 1959), Section 13, establishes a list of more than twenty offences (mostly related to violence, public drunkenness, sexual crimes, and habitual counterfeiting or smuggling) under which a tribunal may declare a person a \"goonda\" and place his name on the prescribed list of goondas, after which he may be subject to enhanced punishment for any future offenses. It overrode the earlier Punjab Control of Goondas Act (Act XIV of 1951).\n"}

Both languages are standard registers of Hindustani. As a result of linguistic and cultural similarities, Hindi has had notable influences in Pakistan and is taught as an academic subject in some institutions. Hindi uses more words closer to Sanskrit while Urdu incorporates more Arabic, Persian, and Turkish words. Most shairo shairy, ghazals, qawalis & lyrics use Urdu words.\n\nBefore the partition of British India, Hindi was spoken in the region forming Pakistan by the Hindus and Sikhs residing there. It was taught across school and university levels, mainly in Punjab and Sindh. After the partition, most of these communities left for India; prominent Hindi writers with origins in Pakistan include Bhisham Sahni, Shailendra, Hullad Moradabadi, Uday Bhanu Hans, Narendra Mohan and others. Conversely, some first-generation Pakistanis who migrated from India during Pakistan's independence in 1947 were familiar with Hindi and the Devanagari script. \n\nUrdu was long associated with the Muslims of South Asia by virtue of its historical development and the Urdu movement. During the Pakistan Movement, it was given preference over Hindi as their lingua franca and thus achieved official status in Pakistan.\n\nHindi has drawn increasing focus as an academic subject. There is a growing trend of Hindi experts and the availability of texts in Pakistan. Many Hindi instructors migrated from India, or were educated at Indian universities.\n\nThe Department of Hindi at the National University of Modern Languages (NUML) in Islamabad was established in 1973. It became the first university department in Pakistan to provide certificates, diplomas, language courses, Masters and PhD degrees in Hindi, including the country's first Hindi MPhil degree. It has provided instruction to Pakistani as well as foreign students. \n\nThe Hindi Department at the University of the Punjab in Lahore has roots going back to the establishment of the Oriental College; however, it wasn't until 1983 that accredited courses were started. The department awards both undergraduate and postgraduate Hindi courses. At the University of Punjab's Centre for South Asian Studies, Hindi is a mandatory subject for those pursuing an M.Phil in regional languages.\n\nThe University of Karachi also once had a Hindi department, which was later closed.\n\nAs a result of Bollywood films, Indian soap opera viewership and cable television in Pakistan, Hindi has had a notable cultural influence. Several Hindi words have entered the casual Pakistani lexicon, such as vishwas (\"trust\"), ashirvad (\"blessing\"), charcha (\"talk\"), pati-patni (\"husband-wife\"), bina (\"without\"), shanti (\"peace\"), sambandh (\"relations\") and other popular phrases. The advent of internet and social media has accelerated such exchanges. \n\nThe screening of Hindi films in Pakistani cinemas, which was restricted for nearly four decades, has resumed over the last few years. Much of the dialogues, themes and script-writing used in Hindi films are influenced by Urdu, therefore capturing familiarity with Pakistani audiences. Furthermore, several actors in the Hindi film industry have roots in present Pakistan. Hindi music from Bollywood remains popular and shares similarities with Pakistani music. This has enabled several Indian artists to contribute to Pakistani film soundtracks and vice versa. \n\nSome commentators view these tendencies as an example of globalisation and soft power, while others have described it as a silent cultural invasion or a reignition of the Hindi-Urdu controversy. In January 2017, the Punjab provincial assembly passed a resolution demanding a ban on television cartoons containing Hindi dubbing, and called for their replacement with Urdu. For some Pakistanis, knowing Hindi provides an opportunity to follow Hindi media and develop a cultural understanding of neighboring India, while for others it is an individual interest. In 2015, an Urdu-Hindi cookbook described as the \"first of its kind\" was published in Pakistan. At Lahore's Information Technology University, the Data Science Lab created an application called the Urdu-Hindi Dictionary which translates words written in Roman transliteration to their selected language.\n\nSome Pakistani Hindus learn Hindi in order to study Hindu texts. Hindi is also spoken amongst the small Indian community in Pakistan.

{"id": "374370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374370", "title": "Hugh MacDiarmid", "text": "Hugh MacDiarmid\n\nChristopher Murray Grieve (11 August 1892 – 9 September 1978), known by his pen name Hugh MacDiarmid (), was a Scottish poet, journalist, essayist and political figure. He is best known for his works written in 'synthetic Scots', a literary version of the Scots language that MacDiarmid himself developed. However, Grieve's earliest work -- such as \"Annals of the Five Senses\" was written in English, and from the early 1930s onwards much of the poetry published under MacDiarmid's name was written in an English that was supplemented to varying degrees by scientific and technical vocabularies.\n\nThe son of a postman, MacDiarmid was born in the Scottish border town of Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy before becoming a teacher for a brief time at Broughton Higher Grade School in Edinburgh. He began his writing career as a journalist in Wales, contributing to the socialist newspaper \"The Merthyr Pioneer\" run by Labour party founder Keir Hardie before joining the Royal Army Medical Corps on the outbreak of the First World War. He served in Salonica, Greece and France before developing cerebral malaria and subsequently returning to Scotland in 1918. MacDiarmid's time in the army was influential in his political and artistic development.\n\nAfter the war he continued to work as a journalist, living in Montrose where he became editor and reporter of the \"Montrose Review\" as well as a justice of the peace and a member of the county council. In 1923 his first book, \"Annals of the Five Senses,\" was published at his own expense, followed by 'Sangschaw' in 1925 and 'Penny Wheep' and 'A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle' in 1926. \"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\", is generally regarded as MacDiarmid's most famous and influential work.\n\nMoving to the Shetland island of Whalsay in 1933 with his son Michael and second wife, Valda Trevlyn, MacDiarmid continued to write essays and poetry despite being cut off from mainland cultural developments for much of the 1930s. He died at his cottage Brownsbank, near Biggar, in 1978 at the age of 86.\n\nMacDiarmid was during his life a supporter of both communism and Scottish nationalism, views that often put him at odds with his contemporaries. He was a founding member of the National Party of Scotland (forerunner of the modern Scottish National Party) and stood as a candidate for the Scottish National Party in 1945 and 1950, and for the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1964.\n\nA controversial figure whilst alive, MacDiarmid is now considered one of the principal forces behind the Scottish Renaissance and has had a lasting impact on Scottish culture and politics. Fellow poet Edwin Morgan said of him: 'Eccentric and often maddening genius he may be, but MacDiarmid has produced many works which, in the only test possible, go on haunting the mind and memory and casting Coleridgean seeds of insight and surprise.’\n\nChristopher Grieve was born in Langholm in 1892. His father was a postman; his family lived above the town library, giving MacDiarmid access to books from an early age. Grieve attended Langholm Academy and, from 1908, Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh, where he studied under George Ogilvie who introduced him to the magazine The New Age. He left the school on 27 January 1911, following the theft of some books and postage stamps; his father died eight days later, on 3 February 1911.\n\nFollowing Grieve's departure from Broughton, Ogilvie arranged for Grieve to be employed as a journalist with the \"Edinburgh Evening Dispatch\". Grieve was to lose this job later in 1911, but on 20 July of that year he had his first article, \"The Young Astrology\" published in \"The New Age\". Later in 1922 Grieve moved to Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, Wales, where he worked as a newspaper reporter; by 1913 he had returned to Scotland and was working for the \"Clydebank and Renfrew Press\" in Clydebank, near Glasgow. It was here that Grieve first encountered the work of John Maclean, Neil Malcolm Maclean, and James Maxton.\n\nIn July 1915 Grieve left the town of Forfar in eastern Scotland and travelled to the Hillsborough barracks in Sheffield. He went on to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Salonica, Greece and France during the First World War. After the war, he married and returned to journalism.\n\nMacDiarmid's first book, \"Annals of the Five Senses\", was a mixture of prose and poetry written in English, and was published in 1923 while MacDiarmid was living in Montrose. At about this time MacDiarmid turned to Scots for a series of books, culminating in what is probably his best known work, the book-length \"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\". This poem is widely regarded as one of the most important long poems in 20th-century Scottish literature. After that, he published several books containing poems in both English and Scots.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1930 MacDiarmid lived in London, and worked for Compton Mackenzie's magazine, \"Vox\". MacDiarmid lived in Liverpool from 1930 to 1931, before returning to London; he left again in 1932, and lived in the village of Thakeham in West Sussex until he returned to Scotland in 1932.\n\nMacDiarmid lived in the island of Whalsay, Shetland, from 1933 until 1942.\n\nIn 1942 MacDiarmid was directed to war work and moved to Glasgow, where he lived until 1949. Between 1949 and 1951 he lived in a cottage on the grounds of Dungavel House, Lanarkshire, before moving to his final home: \"Brownsbank\", a cottage in Candymill, near Biggar in the Scottish Borders. He died, aged 86, in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1928, MacDiarmid helped found the National Party of Scotland, but was expelled during the 1930s.\n\nMacDiarmid was at times a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but he was expelled twice, and biographer John Baglow reports that \"his comrades never really knew what to make of him\". He joined the party in 1934, was expelled in 1937, rejoined later that same year, and was expelled seemingly for good in 1938, on the grounds of \"national deviationism\". He rejoined the party again much later, in 1956.\n\nFrom 1931, whilst he was in London, until 1943, after he had left the Shetland island of Whalsay, MacDiarmid was watched by the British Intelligence Services. In 1949, George Orwell compiled a list of suspected communist sympathisers for British intelligence. He included MacDiarmid in this list.\n\nHe was a member of Clann Albain, a secret Scottish nationalist society.\n\nMacDiarmid stood in the Glasgow Kelvingrove constituency in the 1945 and 1950 general elections. He stood against the Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home in Kinross and Western Perthshire at the 1964 election, taking only 127 votes.\n\nMacDiarmid listed Anglophobia among his hobbies in his \"Who's Who\" entry.\n\nIn 2010 letters were discovered showing that he believed a Nazi invasion of Britain would benefit Scotland. In a letter sent from Whalsay, Shetland, in April 1941, he wrote: “On balance I regard the Axis powers, tho’ more violently evil for the time being, less dangerous than our own government in the long run and indistinguishable in purpose.\" A year earlier, in June 1940, he wrote: “Although the Germans are appalling enough, they cannot win, but the British and French bourgeoisie can and they are a far greater enemy. If the Germans win they could not hold their gain for long, but if the French and British win it will be infinitely more difficult to get rid of them.” \n\nMarc Horne in the \"Daily Telegraph\" commented: \"MacDiarmid flirted with fascism in his early thirties, when he believed it was a doctrine of the left. In two articles written in 1923, Plea for a Scottish Fascism and Programme for a Scottish Fascism, he appeared to support Mussolini’s regime. By the 1930s however, following Mussolini’s lurch to the right, his position had changed and he castigated Neville Chamberlain over his appeasement of Hitler’s expansionism.\" Deirdre Grieve, MacDiarmid’s daughter-in-law and literary executor, noted: “I think he entertained almost every ideal it was possible to entertain at one point or another.\"\n\nAs his interest in science and linguistics increased, MacDiarmid found himself turning more and more to English as a means of expression so that most of his later poetry is written in that language. His ambition was to live up to Rilke's dictum that 'the poet must know everything' and to write a poetry that contained all knowledge. As a result, many of the poems in \"Stony Limits\" (1934) and later volumes are a kind of found poetry reusing text from a range of sources. Just as he had used Jameson's dialect dictionary for his poems in 'synthetic Scots', so he used Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary for poems such as 'On a Raised Beach'. Other poems, including 'On a Raised Beach' and 'Etika Preobrazhennavo Erosa' used extensive passages of prose. This practice, particularly in the poem 'Perfect', led to accusations of plagiarism from supporters of the Welsh poet Glyn Jones, to which MacDiarmid's response was 'The greater the plagiarism the greater the work of art.' The great achievement of this late poetry is to attempt on an epic scale to capture the idea of a world without God in which all the facts the poetry deals with are scientifically verifiable. In his critical work \"Lives of the Poets\", Michael Schmidt notes that Hugh MacDiarmid 'had redrawn the map of Scottish poetry and affected the whole configuration of English literature'.\n\nMacDiarmid wrote a number of non-fiction prose works, including \"Scottish Eccentrics\" and his autobiography \"Lucky Poet\". He also did a number of translations from Scottish Gaelic, including Duncan Ban MacIntyre's \"Praise of Ben Dorain\", which were well received by native speakers including Sorley MacLean.\n\nHe had a daughter, Christine, and a son, Walter, by his first wife Peggy Skinner. He had a son, James Michael Trevlyn, known as Michael, by his second wife Valda Trevlyn (1906-1989); Michael was a conscientious objector to post-World War II National Service and became vice chair of the Scottish National Party.\n\nMacDiarmid grew up in the Scottish town of Langholm in Dumfriesshire. The town is home to a monument in his honour made of cast iron which takes the form of a large open book depicting images from his writings.\n\nMacDiarmid lived in Montrose for a time where he worked for the local newspaper the \"Montrose Review\".\n\nMacDiarmid also lived on the isle of Whalsay in Shetland, in Sodom (Sudheim). The house is now one of Shetland's 'Camping Bods', offering basic, bothy-style accommodation to visitors.\n\nBrownsbank Cottage, near Biggar, South Lanarkshire, the home of MacDiarmid and his wife Valda from 1952 until their deaths, has been restored by the Biggar Museum Trust.\n\nHugh MacDiarmid is commemorated in Makars' Court, outside The Writers' Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. Selections for Makars' Court are made by The Writers' Museum, The Saltire Society and The Scottish Poetry Library.\n\nHugh MacDiarmid sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill and a bronze was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery. The terracotta original is held in the collection of the artist. The correspondence file relating to the MacDiarmid bust is held in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation's Henry Moore Institute in Leeds.\n\n\n\nAlso see:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Isovists are naturally three-dimensional, but they may also be studied in two dimensions: either in horizontal section (\"plan\") or in other vertical sections through the three-dimensional isovist. Every point in physical space has an isovist associated with it.\n\nThe boundary-shape of an isovist may or may not vary with location in, say, a room. If the room is convex (for example, a rectangle or circle), then the boundary-shape of every isovist in that room is the same; and so is its volume (or area, if we are thinking in plan). But the location of the viewpoint relative to the boundary would or could be different. However, if the room were non-convex (for example, an L-shaped or partitioned room), then there would be many isovists whose volume (area) would be less than that of the whole room, and perhaps some that were the whole room; and many would have different, perhaps unique shapes: large and small, narrow and wide, centric and eccentric, whole and shredded.\n\nOne can also think of the isovist as the volume of space illuminated by a point source of light.\n\nIt is used in the field of architecture for analysis of buildings and urban areas, typically as one of a series of methods used in space syntax.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a journalist and Zionist activist.\n\nItamar Ben-Avi was born as Ben-Zion Ben-Yehuda () in Jerusalem on July 31, 1882, the son of Deborah and Eliezer Ben-Yehuda. Eliezer is credited with reviving the Hebrew language; Itamar was brought up to be the first native speaker of Hebrew in the modern era. At his father's insistence, Itamar was not permitted to hear any language other than Hebrew at home. When he was very young, Itamar always wanted someone to play with, but his parents did not want him to speak with the other children who spoke different languages. He made friends with a dog which he called Maher (Hebrew: מהר), meaning \"fast\" in Hebrew. His three siblings died in a diphtheria epidemic and his mother died of tuberculosis in 1891. He and his family were ostracized from the ultra-orthodox community, due to their usage of Hebrew as a day-to-day language. The religious community saw this as sacrilege because they viewed it as the language of the Torah and prayers, and not for use in \"idle chatter.\"\n\nAfter his mother's death in 1891, his father married his late wife's younger sister, the writer Hemda Ben-Yehuda (née Beila Jonas), so Itamar's aunt became his stepmother. After his mother's death, he changed his name to Itamar, as that was the name his parents originally intended to give him. The name \"Itamar\" means \"Island of Dates\" and derives from the Hebrew word \"tamar\" (date or palm tree), which is a symbol of Zionism. As his last name, he used Ben-Avi. \"Avi\" (אב\"י) is an acronym for Eliezer Ben Yehuda (as written in Hebrew) and also means \"my father\", so Ben-Avi means \"my father's son\".\n\nAt the age of 19, Ben-Avi sailed to Europe and studied at universities in Paris and Berlin. He returned to Palestine in 1908 as a journalist, joining his father in editing and writing Hebrew newspapers.\n\nBen-Avi married Leah Abushedid (1889-1982), born in Jerusalem to a wealthy Moroccan-Jewish family. Ben-Avi met her when he was 26 and she was 16. Due to his poor financial situation, his Ashkenazi background, and their age difference, Abushedid's parents did not approve of their marriage. Hoping to convince her parents, he published poems proclaiming his love for her in HaOr. After three years, when he published a poem about suicide, they relented and permitted the marriage. After two years of negotiating the marriage contract, the couple married in 1914. They had three daughters: Dror-Eilat (1917-1921), Drora (1922-1981), and Rina (1925-2016). Drora and Rina became radio news broadcasters.\n\nIn 1919, he founded a Hebrew daily newspaper called \"Doar HaYom\" (The Daily Mail), and ran it until 1929. In addition, he was a Zionist activist and officer with Bnei Binyamin and the Jewish National Fund. He served as a Jewish National Fund emissary to various countries. He also had a role in the founding of Netanya. \n\nIn 1939, as his financial situation deteriorated and in need of a steady income, Ben-Avi left his family for the United States to take up a posting as the Jewish National Fund representative in New York City. He died there in 1943 at the age of 60, five years before the establishment of Israel. His body was brought back to Palestine for burial in 1947, and was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.\n\nHe was the chief editor and journalist of \"Doar HaYom\", the then Hebrew style-twin of the British \"Daily Mail\", from 1920-1933. In his numerous opinion and commentary articles in \"Doar HaYom\" he also advocated the widespread use of the International language Esperanto.\n\nBen-Avi was an advocate for the Romanization of Hebrew. He favored the Latin alphabet, a full alphabet with vowel letters, rather than the traditional Hebrew alphabet, a consonantal orthography of Hebrew (with limited matres lectionis) using \"squared Assyrian letters\". The Hebrew writing system dates back to the time of Ezra the scribe, 500 BCE.\n\nHe wrote a Hebrew biography of his father. This biography was titled \"Avi\" (\"My Father\") and was printed in his own made-up version of a Hebrew alphabet using Latin letters and some variations thereof. He pioneered and was chief editor of two short lived Hebrew weeklies in reformed Latin script. The first was \"Hashavua Hapalestini\" (The Palestinian Week, 1928) and the second was \"Dror\" (Liberty, 1934).\n\n"}

The identity of Joseph Bekor Shor and the tosafist Joseph ben Isaac of Orleans has been sufficiently demonstrated by Gross, who showed that the same explanations given in the Tosafot (Ḥul. 112-b; Yeb. 25-b, 36-b) in the name of \"Joseph ben Isaac\", are quoted in the \"Semak\" (No. 205) and in Meir of Rothenburg's Responsa (ed. Prague, No. 863) as those of \"Joseph Bekor Shor.\"\n\nJoseph was on very friendly terms with his teacher Jacob Tam, with whom he carried on a learned correspondence (\"Sefer ha-Yashar\", p. 71a). Besides tosafot on the greater part of the Talmud, he wrote a Biblical commentary marked by considerable acumen. Even more than Rashi, to whose exegetical school he belonged, he confined himself to literal interpretations (peshat). Anticipating later Biblical criticism, he assumed the presence of duplicate narratives in the Bible, and he strove to give rational explanations to the miraculous stories. Thus he interprets \"tree of life\" (Genesis ii. 9) as \"tree of healing\", explaining that the fruit of the tree possessed the virtue of healing the sick, without, however, bestowing eternal life. In regard to the transformation of Lot's wife into a pillar of salt (Gen. xix. 26) he explains that, disbelieving in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, she lingered on the road, and was overtaken by the rain of brimstone and fire, which are usually mixed with salt.\n\nWell acquainted with the Vulgate and Christian Biblical exegesis, Joseph, in commenting on Psalm ii., cites Jerome, whose explanation of the word he criticizes. His commentary on the Pentateuch is still extant in manuscript in the libraries of Leyden and Munich. Part of it, on Genesis and Exodus, was published by Jellinek (Leipsic, 1855). Extracts from the remaining books were published by Berliner in \"Peleṭat Soferim\" (1872).\n\nHis commentary on the Pentateuch has been published in Hebrew by Mossad HaRav Kook.\n\nRabbi Bekhor Shore was explicitly anti-Christian, since he wrote commentaries on (against the belief in the Trinity), on (against Christian allegorizing) and on , tempting to connect the magical powers of false prophets with the miracles of Jesus in the New Testament.\n\nJoseph was the author also of a number of liturgical poems (piyyutim).

The 19th edition of Ethnologue lists 35 languages and dialects spoken in local communities. Hebrew is the country's official language, and almost the entire population speaks it either as native speakers or proficiently as a second language. Its standard form, known as Modern Hebrew, is the main medium of life in Israel. Arabic, used mainly by Israel's Arab minority, which comprises about one-fifth of the population, has a special status under Israeli law. English, spoken as a second language by the majority of the Israeli population, is used widely in official logos, road signs and product labels. Russian, spoken by the large immigrant population from the former Soviet Union, is also heavily used.\n\nModern Hebrew emerged as a result of the revival of the Hebrew language that began the late 19th century, and is based on different dialects of ancient Hebrew and somewhat influenced by many languages (English, Jewish languages, Slavic languages, Arabic, Aramaic, German and others).\n\nAccording to a 2011 Government Social Survey of Israelis over 20 years of age, 49% report Hebrew as their native language, Arabic 18%, Russian 15%, Yiddish 2%, French 2%, English 2%, 1.6% Spanish, and 10% other languages (including Romanian, German and Amharic, which were not offered as answers by the survey). This study also noted that 90% of Jews and over 60% of Arabs have a good understanding of Hebrew.\n\nSeveral laws determine the official status of languages and language policy in Israel. This confusing situation has led to several appeals to the Supreme Court, whose rulings have enforced the current policies of national and local authorities.\n\nOn 19 July 2018, the Knesset passed a basic law under the title , which defines Hebrew as \"the State's language\" and Arabic as a language with \"a special status in the State\" (article 4). The law further says that it should not be interpreted as compromising the status of the Arabic language in practice prior to the enactment of the basic law, namely, it preserves the status quo and changes the status of Hebrew and Arabic only nominally.\n\nBefore the enactment of the aforementioned basic law, the status of official language in Israel was determined by the 82nd paragraph of the \"Order in Council\" issued on 14 August 1922, for the British Mandate, as amended in 1939:\n\nThis law, like most other laws of the British Mandate, was adopted in the State of Israel, subject to certain amendments published by the provisional legislative branch on 19 May 1948. The amendment states that:\n\nThe British Mandate articles, issued by the Council of the League of Nations in 1922, and the 1922 Palestine Order in Council were the first in modern times to acknowledge Hebrew as an official language of a political entity. This was a significant achievement for the Zionist movement, which sought to establish Hebrew as the national language of the Jewish people and discouraged the use of other Jewish languages, particularly Yiddish, just like Aramaic replaced Hebrew in ancient times.\n\nThe movement for the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language was particularly popular among new Jewish Zionist immigrants who came to Ottoman ruled Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem beginning in the 1880s. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda (born in the Russian Empire) and his followers created the first Hebrew-speaking schools, newspapers, and other Hebrew-language institutions. As Max Weinreich notes in his book, \"History of the Yiddish Language, Volume 1\", the \"very making of Hebrew into a spoken language derives from the will to separate from the Diaspora\". After Ben Yehuda's immigration to Israel, and due to the impetus of the Second Aliyah (1905–1914), Hebrew prevailed as the single official and spoken language of the Jewish community of Mandatory Palestine. When the State of Israel was formed in 1948, the government viewed Hebrew as the \"de facto\" official language and initiated a melting pot policy, where every immigrant was required to study Hebrew and often to adopt a Hebrew surname. Use of Yiddish, which was the main competitor prior to World War II, was discouraged, and the number of Yiddish speakers declined as the older generations died out. However, Yiddish is still often used in Ashkenazi Haredi communities worldwide, and is sometimes the first language for the members of the Hasidic branches of such communities.\n\nToday, Hebrew is the official language used in government, commerce, court sessions, schools, and universities. It is the language most commonly used in everyday life in Israel. Native Hebrew speakers comprise about 53% of the population. The vast majority of the rest speak Hebrew fluently as a second language. Native-born Israeli Jews are typically native speakers of Hebrew, but a significant minority of Israelis are immigrants who learned Hebrew as a second language. Immigrants who come under the Law of Return are entitled to a free course in an ulpan, or Hebrew language school. Most of them speak fluent Hebrew, but some do not. Most Israeli-Arabs, who comprise a large national minority, and members of other minorities are also fluent in Hebrew. Historically, Hebrew was taught in Arab schools from the third grade onward, but it has been gradually introduced from kindergarten onward starting in September 2015. A Hebrew exam is an essential part of the matriculation exams for students of Israeli schools. The state-affiliated Academy of the Hebrew Language, established in 1953 by a Knesset law, is tasked with researching the Hebrew language and offering standardized rules for the use of the language by the state.\n\nA survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics released in 2013 found that 90% of Israeli Jews were proficient in Hebrew and 70% were highly proficient. It also found that 60% of Israeli Arabs were proficient or highly proficient in Hebrew, while 17% could not read it and 12% could not speak it.\n\nLiterary Arabic, along with Hebrew, has special status under Israeli law, and was the country's second official language until 2018, when Hebrew was declared the sole official language. Various spoken dialects are used. Arabic is the native language among Israeli-Arabs. In 1949, 156,000 Palestinian Arabs were left inside Israel’s armistice line, most of whom did not speak Hebrew. Today, the figure stands at about 1.6 million, and although most are proficient in Hebrew, Arabic remains their primary native language.\n\nIn addition, a significant number of Israeli Jews know spoken Arabic, although only a very small number are fully literate in written Arabic. Arabic is the native language of older generations of Mizrahi Jews who immigrated from Arabic-speaking countries. Arabic lessons are widespread in Hebrew-speaking schools from the seventh through ninth grades. Those who wish to do so may opt to continue their Arabic studies through the twelfth grade and take an Arabic matriculation exam. A 2015 study found that 17% of Israeli Jews can understand Arabic and 10% can speak it fluently, but only 2.5% can read an article in the language, 1.5% can write a letter in it, and 1% can read a book in it.\n\nFor many years the Israeli authorities were reluctant to use Arabic, except when explicitly ordered by law (for example, in warnings on dangerous chemicals), or when addressing the Arabic-speaking population. This has changed following a November 2000 supreme court ruling which ruled that although second to Hebrew, the use of Arabic should be much more extensive. Since then, all road signs, food labels, and messages published or posted by the government must also be translated into Literary Arabic, unless being issued by the local authority of an exclusively Hebrew-speaking community. As of December 2017, 40% of digital panels on public buses list their routes in both Hebrew and Arabic across the country, and, starting in 2015, Arabic has been increasingly featured in signs along highways and in railway stations.\n\nArabic was always considered a legitimate language for use in the Knesset alongside Hebrew, but only rarely have Arabic-speaking Knesset members made use of this privilege as while all Arabic-speaking MKs are fluent in Hebrew, fewer Hebrew-speaking MKs can understand Arabic.\n\nIn March 2007, the Knesset approved a new law calling for the establishment of an Arabic Language Academy similar to the Academy of the Hebrew Language. This institute was established in 2008, its centre is in Haifa and it is currently headed by Prof. Mahmud Ghanayem.\n\nIn 2008, a group of Knesset members proposed a bill to remove Arabic's status as an official language, making it an \"official secondary language\". That bill did not pass.\n\nIn 2009, Israel Katz, the transport minister, suggested that signs on all major roads in Israel, East Jerusalem and possibly parts of the West Bank would be amended, replacing English and Arabic place names with straight transliterations of the Hebrew name. Currently most road signs are in all three languages. Nazareth, for example, would become \"Natzeret\". The Transport Ministry said signs would be replaced gradually as necessary due to wear and tear. This has been criticized as an attempt to erase the Arabic language and Palestinian heritage in Israel. Israel's governmental names' committee unanimously rejected that suggestion in 2011.\n\nRussian is by far the most widely spoken non-official language in Israel. Over 20% of Israelis are fluent in Russian after mass Jewish immigration from the USSR (Russian Jews in Israel) and its successor states in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s. The government and businesses often provide both written and verbal information in Russian. There is also an Israeli television broadcast channel in Russian. In addition, some Israeli schools also offer Russian language courses. The children of Russian immigrants to Israel generally pick up Hebrew as their dominant language, but most still speak Russian, and a majority still use Russian instead of Hebrew with family and Russian-speaking friends. As of 2017 there are up to 1.5 million Russian-speaking Israelis.\n\nMost Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union were highly educated with almost 45 percent of them having some kind of higher education. Despite the fact that the native language of a significant part of the country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called \"Na'leh 16\" included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.\n\nTraditionally, Russian speakers read newspapers and listen to radio more often than Hebrew speakers. \"Nasha strana\" was the major Russian-newspaper in Israel during the 1970s, when it competed with \"Tribuna\" for the immigrant reader. In 1989, there was only one daily in Russian, and 6 in 1996. Since the 2000s, the number of Russian-language newspapers started to decline due to the increasing number of television and online media. Israeli television provides daily translation in Hebrew, Arabic, and Russian. In 2002, the Israeli Russian-speaking commercial Channel 9 was launched. It is also known as Israel Plus. In November 2007, a typical digital package included 45 channels in foreign languages, with 5 in Russian. At 2004 there were four dailies, 11 weeklies, five monthlies and over 50 local newspapers published in Russian in Israel, with a total circulation of about 250,000 during weekends. Daily radio services in Russian are also available throughout Israel.\n\nIn 1999, the High Court of Justice ruled that English, Arabic and Hebrew were inherited as official languages by Israel, but that English had been removed by the Law and Administration Ordinance of 1948. The Ordinance said:\nIn practice the use of English decreased dramatically during the state's early years. At first, French was used as a diplomatic language, even though most state officials and civil servants were more fluent in English. During the late 1960s, the Israeli-French alliance was undermined, giving way to a stronger Israeli-United States alliance and paving the way for the English language to regain much of its lost status. Today, English is the primary language for international relations and foreign exchange, but it is not sanctioned for use in Knesset debates or in drafting legislation. Some British Mandate laws are still formulated in English, and the process of their translation into Hebrew has been gradual. English is required as a second language in schools and universities, for both Hebrew and Arabic-speaking students. Despite the country's history of British mandatory rule, written English in Israel today uses primarily American spelling and grammar.\n\nThe usage of the language is influenced by factors related to the birthplace of the speaker or the speaker's ancestors: those who are born to American-descended parentages are more likely to speak American English as their preferred dialect of the language, Western Continental European descendants are more likely to speak with accents heavily influenced by languages such as French, German and Yiddish, and so on. A distinctively Israeli dialect of the language has been slow in development due to continued migration to Israel, large established communities of persistent speakers of languages and dialects from outside of Israel, and the state's focus upon education in Hebrew; the development of English in Israel may depend upon the future of assimilation and integration of generations of native-born Israeli citizens as well as the status of Israel's relations with English-speaking countries including the United States and Canada.\n\nAlthough English does not enjoy the same status as Hebrew and Arabic do, English proficiency is a core requirement in the public education system and road signs are generally written in English after Hebrew and Arabic. English is taught in public schools from the third grade to high school, and passing an English oral and written test is a prerequisite for receiving a \"Bagrut\" (matriculation certificate). Most universities also regard a high level of English as a prerequisite for admission. Exposure to American culture has been massive in Israel since the early 1990s, and in Israel, foreign language television shows are generally presented in the original language with Hebrew subtitles rather than dubbed, which means that there is a high level of exposure to English in the media. \nMost Israelis can converse in and read English on at least a basic level, and secular Israelis who are of a high social and economic status usually possess greater capabilities in English than those who are of a lower social and economic status (this is mostly due to differing levels of state-sponsored education, as well as variation in cultural exposure to the language). Israelis born from the 1980s onward generally have better English language skills than their parents and grandparents due to growing up with a higher level of exposure to the language in the media. Proper usage of the English language is considered a mark of good education among Israelis. In the past, several politicians, including David Levy and Amir Peretz, were mocked openly in the media and in public for their poor English skills.\n\nDue to immigration from English-speaking countries, a small but significant minority of Israeli Jews are native English speakers. One survey found that about 2% of Israelis spoke English as their native language.\n\nFrench is spoken by many Moroccan, Algerian, and Tunisian Jews, either as a native or second language of these francized Maghrebi Jews, French is also spoken by the increasing number of new immigrants from France and other French-speaking countries, as well as by foreign workers from French speaking Africa.\n\nIn practice the use of French decreased dramatically after the state's early years. At first, French was used as a diplomatic language and French was also used alongside Hebrew on official documents such as passports until the 1990s, even though most state officials and civil servants were more fluent in English. Hoewer during the late 1960s, the Israeli-French alliance was undermined, giving way decreased use of French. Israeli passports switched from French to English during the 1990s.\n\nToday, French is still taught in many Israeli schools and universities and due to immigration from France a small but significant 2% of Israeli Jews are native French speakers.. The French embassy's \"Institut Français\" supports French studies in Israeli schools. Israel has tried to join La Francophonie, but has been rebuffed by its Arab members. Tel Aviv University is a member of the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF).\n\nThe melting pot policy, which governed the Israel language policy in its early days, was gradually neglected during the late 1970s. While in the 1950s Israeli law banned Yiddish-language theaters and forced civil servants to adopt Hebrew surnames, the new policy allowed immigrants to communicate with the authorities in their language of origin and encouraged them to keep their original language and culture. This new practice has become evident since the early 1990s with massive immigration from the former Soviet Union and the additional immigration from Ethiopia (Ethiopian Jews in Israel). Israeli authorities began to use Russian and Amharic extensively when communicating with these new immigrants. During the 1991 Gulf War, warnings and instructions were issued in at least seven languages. In 1991, a new radio station was erected, called \"REKA\", which is a Hebrew acronym for \"Aliyah Absorption Network\". At first, it broadcast exclusively in Russian, also containing programming aimed at teaching Hebrew, which included veteran Israel radio broadcasters recapping news in \"easy Hebrew\"; some years later, Amharic and Tigrinya time slots were introduced. Just as news in Arabic existed on Arutz 1, news programmes appeared in Russian, Amharic and Tigrinya. Several newspapers and magazines were published in Russian and easy Hebrew with Niqqud. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, the first Russian-language TV channel was created.\n\nAfter Hebrew and Arabic, many other languages are used by large sectors of the Israeli population such as English, Russian, French and many others, including:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18000", "title": "Latin conjugation", "text": "Latin conjugation\n\nConjugation has two meanings. One meaning is the creation of derived forms of a verb from basic forms, or principal parts. It may be affected by person, number, gender, tense, mood, aspect, voice, or other language-specific factors. \n\nThe second meaning of the word conjugation is a group of verbs which all have the same pattern of inflections. Thus all those Latin verbs which have 1st singular -ō, 2nd singular -ās, and infinitive -āre are said to belong to the 1st conjugation, those with 1st singular -eō, 2nd singular -ēs and infinitive -ēre belong to the 2nd conjugation, and so on. The number of conjugations of regular verbs is usually said to be four.\n\nThe word \"conjugation\" comes from the Latin \"coniugātiō\", a calque of the Greek , literally \"yoking together (horses into a team)\".\n\nFor simple verb paradigms, see the appendix pages for first conjugation, second conjugation, third conjugation, and fourth conjugation.\n\nThe ancient Romans themselves, beginning with Varro (1st century BC), originally divided their verbs into three conjugations (\"coniugationes verbis accidunt tres: prima, secunda, tertia\" \"there are three different conjugations for verbs: the first, second, and third\" (Donatus), 4th century A.D.), according to whether the ending of the 2nd person singular had an \"a\", an \"e\" or an \"i\" in it. However, others, such as Sacerdos (3rd century AD), Dositheus (4th century A.D.) and Priscian (c. 500 A.D.), recognised four different groups.\n\nModern grammarians generally recognise four conjugations, according to whether their active present infinitive has the ending -āre, -ēre, -ere, or -īre (or the passive equivalent of these), for example: (1) amō, amāre \"to love\", (2) videō, vidēre \"to see\", (3) regō, regere \"to rule\" and (4) audiō, audīre \"to hear\". There are also some verbs of mixed conjugation, having some endings like the 3rd and others like the 4th conjugation, for example, capiō, capere \"to capture\" and orior, orīrī \"to arise\".\n\nIn addition to regular verbs, which belong to one or other of the four conjugations, there are also a few irregular verbs, which have a different pattern of endings. The most important of these is the verb sum, esse \"to be\". There also exist deponent and semi-deponent Latin verbs (verbs with a passive form but active meaning), as well as defective verbs (verbs in which some of the tenses are missing).\n\nThe grouping in conjugations is based on the behaviour of the verb in the present system; the stems for other tenses cannot be inferred from the present stem, so several forms of the verb are necessary to be able to produce the full range of forms for any particular verb.\n\nIn a dictionary, Latin verbs are therefore listed with four \"principal parts\" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs) which allow the reader to deduce the other conjugated forms of the verbs. These are:\n\nThe present infinitive active form tells you what conjugation the verb is in. \n\nThe first conjugation is characterized by the vowel \"ā\" and can be recognized by the \"-āre\" ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation all follow the pattern below, which is the passive of the first type above:\n\nThe second conjugation is characterized by the vowel \"ē\", and can be recognized by the \"-eō\" ending of the first person present indicative and the \"-ēre\" ending of the present active infinitive form. The principal parts usually adhere to one of the following patterns:\n\nDeponent verbs in this conjugation are few. They mostly go like the passive of \"terreō\", but \"fateor\" and \"confiteor\" have a perfect participle with \"ss\":\n\nThe third conjugation is characterized by a short thematic vowel, which alternates between \"e\", \"i\", and \"u\" in different environments. Verbs of this conjugation end in \"–ere\" in the present active infinitive. There is no regular rule for constructing the perfect stem of third-conjugation verbs, but the following patterns are used:\n\nDeponent verbs in the 3rd conjugation include the following:\n\nIntermediate between the third and fourth conjugation are the third-conjugation verbs with suffix \"–iō\". These resemble the fourth conjugation in some forms. Some examples are:\n\nDeponent verbs in this group include:\n\nThey resemble the fourth conjugation in the following parts of the verb:\n\nThe fourth conjugation is characterized by the vowel \"ī\" and can be recognized by the \"–īre\" ending of the present active infinitive. Principal parts of verbs in the fourth conjugation generally adhere to the following patterns:\n\nDeponent verbs in the 4th conjugation include the following:\n\nThe verb \"orior, orīrī, ortus sum\" (to arise) is also regarded as 4th conjugation, although some parts, such as the 3rd singular present tense \"oritur\" and imperfect subjunctive \"orerer\", have a short vowel like the 3rd conjugation. But its compound \"adorior\" (to rise up, attack) is entirely 4th conjugation.\n\nPersonal endings are used in all tenses. The present, imperfect, future, pluperfect and future perfect use the same personal endings in the active voice. The perfect has its own endings. In the perfect, future perfect, and pluperfect passive, the tenses are formed from a perfect participle and the appropriate part of \"sum\", e.g. \"portātus sum\" 'I was carried'.\n\nThe third person plural alternative ending \"-ēre\" is common in poetry, but not often used in prose.\n\nThe 2nd person singular passive alternative ending \"-re\" can be used in the future and imperfect, but not usually in the present, where there might be confusion with the infinitive (\"portāre\"). In early Latin \"-re\" was the most usual form.\n\nThe tenses of the present-tense system are the present, imperfect, and future tenses. As examples, the following verbs will be used here:\n\nIn all the conjugations except for the third conjugation, the \"–re\" is removed from the second principal part (for example, \"portāre\" without the suffix \"–re\" becomes \"portā–\") to form the present stem, which is used for all of the tenses in the imperfective aspect. In the third conjugation, the \"–ō\" ending of the present indicative is dropped in order to form the present stem (for example, the present indicative form of \"petere\" is \"petō\", and without the \"-ō\" it is the present stem, \"pet–\"). Occasionally, the terminating vowel of the stem is lengthened and/or shortened, and sometimes completely changed. This is often true both in the third conjugation and in the subjunctive mood of all conjugations.\n\nThe present tense (Latin \"tempus praesēns\") is used to show an uncompleted action that happens in the current time. The present tense does not have a tense sign. Instead, the personal endings are added to the bare present stem. However, in this tense the thematic vowel, most notably the \"ě\" in the third conjugation, changes the most frequently.\n\nA present tense like \"portō\" can be translated as \"I carry,\" \"I do carry,\" or \"I am carrying\". In all but the third conjugation, the thematic vowel of the stem is used. In the third conjugation, the linking vowel varies between \"e\", \"i\" and \"u\". The first person singular of the indicative active present is the first principal part of the verb.\nThe passive voice \"portor\" can be translated as \"I am carried,\" or \"I am being carried\".\nThe present subjunctive \"portem\" can be translated as \"I may carry\", \"I would carry\", \"I should carry\", \"May I carry\", \"Let me carry\", or in subordinate clauses simply as \"I carry\". \"Portēmus\" can be \"Let us carry\".\n\nThe vowels of the verb endings in the present subjunctive differ from the indicative:\n\nThe passive subjunctive \"porter\" can be translated as \"I may be carried\", \"I would be carried\", \"I should be carried\", \"Let me be carried\", \"May I be carried\" or in subordinate clauses simply as \"I am carried\". \"Portēmur\" can be \"Let us be carried\".\n\nThe present imperative conveys commands, pleas and recommendations. \"Portā\" can be translated as \"(You) Carry\" or simply, \"Carry\". The imperative present occurs only in the second person.\nThe imperative present of the passive voice is rarely used, except in the case of deponent verbs, whose passive forms carry active meaning. \"Portāminī\" can be translated as \"(You) Be carried\". The deponent \"sequiminī\", on the other hand, means \"(You) Follow!\".\n\nThe imperfect (Latin \"tempus praeteritum imperfectum\") indicates a perpetual, but incomplete action in the past. It is recognized by the tense signs \"bă\" and \"bā\" in the indicative, and \"re\" and \"rē\" in the subjunctive.\n\nThe imperfect indicative simply expresses an action in the past that was not completed. \"Portābam\" can be translated to mean, \"I was carrying,\" \"I carried,\" or \"I used to carry\".\nAs with the present tense, active personal endings are taken off, and passive personal endings are put in their place. \"Portābar\" can be translated as \"I was being carried,\" \"I kept being carried,\" or \"I used to be carried\".\n\nIn the subjunctive, the imperfect is quite important, especially in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is largely translated conditionally. \"Portārem\" can mean, \"I should carry,\" or \"I would carry\".\nAs with the indicative subjunctive, active endings are removed, and passive endings are added. \"Portārer\" may be translated as \"I should be carried,\" or \"I would be carried.\"\nThe future tense (Latin \"tempus futūrum simplex\") expresses an uncompleted action in the future. It is recognized by its tense signs \"bō\", \"bi\", \"bu\", \"a\" and \"ē\" in the indicative and the vowel \"ō\" in the imperative mood.\n\nThe future tense always refers to an incomplete action. In addition, the future tense is stricter in usage temporally in Latin than it is in English. Standing alone, \"portābō\" can mean, \"I shall carry,\" or \"I will carry.\"\nAs with all imperfective system tenses, active personal endings are removed, and passive personal endings are put on. \"Portābor\" translates as, \"I shall be carried.\"\n\nThe future imperative is used to instruct someone to do something at a later time, or if something else happens first (e.g. \"write (\"scrībitō\") to me if anything happens\"). It can also be used in recipes. The 3rd person is mainly used in laws (e.g. \"censors shall hold (\"habentō\") office for five years\"). A few verbs, such as \"mementō\" \"remember\" and \"scītō\" \"know\", use this form as their only imperative.\n\n\"Portātō\" can be translated as \"carry\" or \"you should carry\".\nThe ending \"-or\" marks the passive voice in the future imperative. \"Portātor\" translates as \"You shall be carried.\" The second person plural is exceptionally rare and only occurs in Plautus with select deponent verbs: \"arbitrāminō\", \"opperīminō\", and not attested with any second conjugation verbs at all.\nThe tenses of the perfect system, which are the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses, are used to express actions that have been, had been, or will have been completed. The verbs used for explanation are:\n\nTo find the stem for the three perfect tenses active in all of the conjugations, the \"–ī\" is removed from the 3rd principal part. For example, from \"portāvī\", \"portāv-\" is formed. \n\nDeponent and passive verbs, however, use the perfect passive participle together with part of the verb \"esse\" \"to be\" to make the perfect tenses. The participle is formed by taking the 4th principal part and changing the ending to the appropriate gender and number, e.g. \"audītus est\" \"he was heard\", \"audītī sunt\" \"they were heard\". \n\nUnlike the present-system tenses, inflection is the same in every conjugation.\n\nThe perfect (Latin \"tempus praeteritum perfectum\") refers to an action completed in the past. Tense signs are only used in this tense with the indicative. The tense signs of the subjunctive are \"eri\" and \"erī\".\n\nThe indicative perfect expresses a finished action in the past. \"Portāvī\" is translated as \"I carried,\" \"I did carry,\" or \"I have carried.\"\n\nIn the passive voice, the perfect passive participle is used with the auxiliary verb \"esse\". It uses the present indicative form of \"esse\". \"Portātus sum\" translates as \"I was carried,\" or \"I have been carried.\"\n\nNote the participle changes from singular to plural when the subject changes respectively. The participle must also be declined for gender in the same way as an adjective.\n\nLike the imperfect subjunctive, the perfect subjunctive is largely used in subordinate clauses. Independently, it is usually translated as the potential subjunctive (\"quis crediderit?\" 'who would have believed it?/who would believe it?') With \"nē\" it makes a negative command: \"nē timuerītis\" \"do not fear\". In subordinate clauses such as indirect questions, \"portāverim\" usually means \"I carried\" or \"I have carried\". \n\nThe passive voice uses the perfect passive participle with the subjunctive present forms of \"esse\". \"Portātus sim\" means, \"I may have been carried.\"\nThe pluperfect (Latin \"tempus praeteritum plūsquamperfectum\") expresses an action which was completed before another completed action. It is recognized by the tense signs \"era\" and \"erā\" in the indicative and \"isse\" and \"issē\" in the subjunctive.\n\nAs with English, in Latin, the pluperfect indicative is used to assert an action that was completed before another (perfect). \"Portāveram\" translates as \"I had carried.\"\nIn the passive voice, the perfect passive participle is used with \"esse\" in the imperfect indicative. \"Portātus eram\" is translated as \"I had been carried.\"\nThe pluperfect subjunctive is to the perfect subjunctive as the imperfect subjunctive is to the present subjunctive. Simply put, it is used with the perfect subjunctive in subordinate clauses. Like the imperfect subjunctive, it is translated conditionally independently. \"Portāvissem\" is translated as \"I should have carried,\" or \"I would have carried.\"\nAs always, the passive voice uses the perfect passive participle. The imperfect subjunctive of \"esse\" is used here. \"Portātus essem\" may mean \"I should have been carried,\" or \"I could have been carried,\" in the conditional sense.\nProbably the least used of all the tenses, the future perfect (Latin \"tempus futūrum exāctum\") conveys an action that will have been completed before another action. It is signified by the tense signs \"erō\" and \"eri\". The future perfect is the only tense that occurs in a single mood.\n\nAs said, the future perfect is used to mention an action that will have been completed in futurity before another action. It is often used with the future tense. In simple translation, \"portāverō\" means, \"I will have carried,\" or \"I shall have carried.\"\n\nEndings with short -i- (e.g. \"portāveris, portāverimus, portāveritis\") are found in the 2nd singular and 1st and 2nd person plural in some authors, e.g. Terence, \"Eunuchus\" 592, but Cicero and Catullus preferred the form with long -i-, e.g. Catullus 5.10 (with Fordyce's note).\n\nAs with all perfective aspect tenses, the perfect passive participle is used in the passive voice. However, the future perfect uses the future indicative of \"esse\" as the auxiliary verb. \"Portātus erō\" is \"I will have been carried,\" or \"I shall have been carried.\"\nThe non-finite forms of verbs are participles, infinitives, supines, gerunds and gerundives. The verbs used are:\n\nThere are four participles: present active, perfect passive, future passive, and future active.\n\nThere are six infinitives. They are in the present active, present passive, perfect active, perfect passive, future active and future passive.\nThe Future Passive Infinitive was actually not very commonly used (Wheelock's Latin mentions it exists but makes it a point to avoid using it in any practice examples). In practice, the Romans themselves often used an alternate expression, \"fore ut\" followed by a subjunctive clause.\n\nThe supine is the fourth principal part of the verb, as given in Latin dictionaries. It resembles a masculine noun of the fourth declension. Supines only occur in the accusative and ablative cases.\nThe gerund is formed similarly to the present active participle. However, the \"–ns\" becomes an \"–ndus\", and the preceding \"ā\" or \"ē\" is shortened. Gerunds are neuter nouns of the second declension, but the nominative case is not present. The gerund is a noun, meaning \"the act of doing (the verb)\", and forms a suppletive paradigm to the infinitive, which cannot be declined. For example, the genitive form \"portandī\" can mean \"of carrying\", the dative form \"portandō\" can mean \"to carrying\", the accusative form \"portandum\" can mean \"carrying\", and the ablative form \"portandō\" can mean \"by carrying\", \"in respect to carrying\", etc.\nOne common use of the gerund is with the preposition \"ad\" to indicate purpose. For example, \"paratus ad oppugnandum\" could be translated as \"ready to attack\". However the gerund was avoided when an object was introduced, and a passive construction with the gerundive was preferred. For example, for \"ready to attack the enemy\" the construction \"paratus ad hostes oppugnandos\" is preferred over \"paratus ad hostes oppugnandum\".\n\nThe gerundive has a form similar to that of the gerund, but it is a first and second declension adjective, and functions as a future passive participle (see above). It means \"(which is) to be ...ed\". Often, the gerundive is used with an implicit \"esse\", to show obligation.\n\n\nFor some examples of uses of Latin gerundives, see the Gerundive article.\n\nThere are two periphrastic conjugations. One is active, and the other is passive.\n\nThe first periphrastic conjugation uses the future participle. It is combined with the forms of \"esse\". It is translated as \"I am going to carry,\" \"I was going to carry\", etc.\n\nThe second periphrastic conjugation uses the gerundive. It is combined with the forms of \"esse\" and expresses necessity. It is translated as \"I am to be carried,\" \"I was to be carried\", etc., or as \"I have to (must) be carried,\" \"I had to be carried,\" etc.\nThere are a few irregular verbs in Latin that are not grouped into a particular conjugation (such as \"esse\" and \"posse\"), or deviate slightly from a conjugation (such as \"ferre, īre,\" and \"dare\"). It consists of the following list and their compounds (such as \"conferre\"). Many irregular verbs lack a fourth principal part.\n\nOf these, \"esse\", \"ferre\", and \"fierī\" are suppletive, that is, their deviating third and fourth principal parts reflect what was an entirely different verb historically (in Proto-Indo-European).\n\nThe various parts of these verbs go as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\"Abeō\" \"I go away\", \"adeō\" \"I go up to\", \"redeō\" \"I go back\" etc. have similar endings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeponent verbs are verbs that are passive in form (that is, conjugated as though in the passive voice) but active in meaning. These verbs have only three principal parts, since the perfect of ordinary passives is formed periphrastically with the perfect participle, which is formed on the same stem as the supine. Some examples coming from all conjugations are:\n\nDeponent verbs use active conjugations for tenses that do not exist in the passive: the gerund, the supine, the present and future participles and the future infinitive. They cannot be used in the passive themselves (except the gerundive), and their analogues with \"active\" form do not in fact exist: one cannot directly translate \"The word is said\" with any form of \"loquī\", and there are no forms like \"loquō\", \"loquis\", \"loquit\", etc.\n\nSemi-deponent verbs form their imperfective aspect tenses in the manner of ordinary active verbs; but their perfect tenses are built periphrastically like deponents and ordinary passives; thus, semi-deponent verbs have a perfect active participle instead of a perfect passive participle. An example:\n\nUnlike the proper passive of active verbs, which is always intransitive, some deponent verbs are transitive, which means that they can take an object. For example:\n\nNote: In the Romance languages, which lack deponent or passive verb forms, the Classical Latin deponent verbs either disappeared (being replaced with non-deponent verbs of a similar meaning) or changed to a non-deponent form. For example, in Spanish and Italian, \"mīrārī\" changed to \"mirar(e)\" by changing all the verb forms to the previously nonexistent \"active form\", and \"audeō\" changed to \"osar(e)\" by taking the participle \"ausus\" and making an \"-ar(e)\" verb out of it (note that \"au\" went to \"o\").\n\nDefective verbs are verbs that are conjugated in only some instances.\n\n\nThe following are conjugated irregularly:\n\nThe Romance languages lost many of these verbs, but others (such as \"ōdī\") survived but became regular fully conjugated verbs (in Italian, \"odiare\").\n\nImpersonal verbs are those lacking a person. In English impersonal verbs are usually used with the neuter pronoun \"it\" (as in \"It seems,\" or \"It storms\"). Latin uses the third person singular. These verbs lack a fourth principal part. A few examples are:\n\nThe third person forms of \"esse\" may also be seen as impersonal when seen from the perspective of English:\n\nAs stated, the future active participle is normally formed by removing the \"–um\" from the supine, and adding a \"–ūrus.\" However, some deviations occur.\n\nSeveral verb forms may occur in alternative forms (in some authors these forms are fairly common, if not more common than the canonical ones):\n\nLike in most Romance languages, syncopated forms and contractions are present in Latin. They may occur in the following instances:\n\n \"Futūrus esse\" is sometimes contracted as \"fore\" as seen in Caesar's \"De Bello Gallico\".\nThe archaic uncontracted form \"potesse\" occurs frequently in Lucretius.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20143", "title": "Manx language", "text": "Manx language\n\nManx (native name or , pronounced or or ), also known as Manx Gaelic, and also historically spelled Manks, is a Goidelic Celtic language of the Indo-European language family, that was spoken as a first language by the Manx people on the Isle of Man until the death of the last native speaker, Ned Maddrell, in 1974. Despite this, the language has never fallen completely out of use, with a minority having some knowledge of it; in addition, Manx still has a role as an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Manx has been the subject of language revival efforts with estimates, in 2015, of around 1,800 people with varying levels of second language conversational ability. Since the late 20th century, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a bilingual primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well-recorded; for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.\n\nIn Manx, the language is called \"Gaelg\" or \"Gailck\" (pronounced \"gilk\" or \"gilg\" or \"gelg\" with hard Gs), a word which shares the same etymology as the word \"Gaelic\", borrowed from Northern Irish. The sister languages of Irish and Scottish Gaelic use \"Gaeilge\" (dialect variants Gaoluinn, Gaedhlag, Gaelge and Gaelic) and \"Gàidhlig\", respectively, for their languages. As with Irish and Scottish, the form with the definite article is frequently used in Manx, e.g. \"y Ghaelg\" or \"y Ghailck\" (Irish \"an Ghaeilge\", Scottish \"a' Ghàidhlig\").\n\nTo distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases \"Gaelg\"/\"Gailck Vannin\" (Gaelic of Mann) and \"Gaelg\"/\"Gailck Vanninnagh\" (Manx Gaelic) also are used. In addition, the nickname \"Çhengey ny Mayrey\" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother, lit. the mother's tongue) is occasionally used.\n\nThe language is usually referred to in English as \"Manx\". The term \"Manx Gaelic\" is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with Anglo-Manx, the form of English spoken on the island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply \"Gaelic\", but this is less common with Manx and Irish.\n\nA feature of Anglo-Manx deriving from Gaelic is the use of the definite article, e.g. \"the Manx\", \"the Gaelic\", in ways not generally seen in standard English.\n\nThe word \"Manx\" is frequently spelled \"Manks\" in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means \"Mannish\", and originates from the Old Norse \"Mannisk\". The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled \"Mann\". It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, \"MAN-en\". The island is named after the Irish god Manannán mac Lir, thus \"Ellan Vannin\" (Irish \"Oileán Mhannanáin\") 'Mannanán's Island'.\n\nManx is a Goidelic language, closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. On the whole it is partially mutually intelligible with these, and native speakers of one find it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.\n\nThe earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of Brythonic (the language which developed into Welsh, Cornish and Breton); however, like Scottish Gaelic and modern Irish, Manx is descended from Primitive Irish, which is first attested in Ogham inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of Great Britain. Primitive Irish transitioned into Old Irish through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the Latin script and is attested primarily in marginalia to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man. By the 10th century Old Irish had evolved into Middle Irish, which was spoken throughout Ireland, in Scotland and in the Isle of Man. Like the coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, the Isle of Man was colonised by the Norse, who left their legacy in certain loanwords, personal names, and place names such as Laxey (Laksaa) and Ramsey (Rhumsaa). However, they made very little impact on the language overall.\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the English language has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Beginning in 1405, Manx experienced even more English influence under the rule of Sir John Stanley. As contact between Manx speakers and Gaelic speakers from Scotland and Ireland declined, the language diverged further from its related neighbours.\n\nIn the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.\n\nThomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of \"The Principles and Duties of Christianity\" (\"Coyrie Sodjey\"), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767. In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.\n\nIn 1848, J. G. Cumming wrote, \"there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English.\" Henry Jenner estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%. Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic \"prestige\", and parents tended to not teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.\n\nFollowing the decline in the use of Manx during the 19th century, (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century, only a few elderly native speakers remained (the last of them, Ned Maddrell, died on December 27, 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few individuals had started teaching it in schools. The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer Brian Stowell, \"which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools.\" This led to an increased interest in studying the Manx language and encouraged a renewed sense of ethnic identity. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers. Most notably, the Irish Folklore Commission was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by Éamon de Valera. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by language enthusiast and fluent speaker Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language. The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language's continued revitalization.\n\nIn 2009, Unesco's Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger declared Manx as an extinct language, despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man. Since then, Unesco's classification of the language has changed to \"critically endangered\".\n\nIn the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx, an increase of 134 people from the 2001 census. These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in Douglas 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in Peel, 146 in Onchan, and 149 in Ramsey.\n\nTraditional Manx given names are once again becoming common on the Isle of Man, especially \"Moirrey\" and \"Voirrey\" (Mary, properly pronounced similarly to the Scottish \"Moira\", but often mispronounced as \"Moiree/Voiree\" when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), \"Illiam\" (William), \"Orry\" (from the Manx King of Norse origin), \"Breeshey\" (also \"Breesha\") (Bridget), \"Aalish\" (also \"Ealish\") (Alice), \"Juan\" (Jack), \"Ean\" (Ian), \"Joney\" (John), \"Fenella\" (Fionnuala), \"Pherick\" (Patrick) and \"Freya\" (from the Norse Goddess) remain popular.\n\nThose who have learned Manx as a second language as part of the Manx language revival speak what has been called \"Neo-Manx\". In Neo-Manx the grammar is different to the Manx spoken to by native speakers like Ned Maddrell and English words have been resubstituted by Gaelic words, leading some to say the new speakers of the language are not speaking \"true Manx\".\n\nBecause Manx has never had a large number of speakers, it has never been practical to produce large amounts of written literature. However, a body of oral literature did exist. The \"Fianna\" tales and others like them are known, including the Manx ballad \"Fin as Oshin\", commemorating Finn MacCool and Ossian. With the coming of Protestantism, Manx spoken tales slowly disappeared, while a tradition of \"carvals\" - religious songs or carols - developed with religious sanction.\n\nAs far as is known, there was no distinctively Manx written literature before the Reformation. By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was \"The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey)\", translated by Bishop of Man Thomas Wilson.\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer was translated by John Phillips, the Welsh-born Bishop of Sodor and Man (1605–33). The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the Book of the Dean of Lismore, as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular Manx literature has been preserved.\n\nThe New Testament was first published in 1767. When the Anglican church authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further \"anglicised\"; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of to represent schwa (e.g. \"horse\" and \"help\" as well as (e.g. \"knowledge\"), though it is also used to represent , as in English (e.g. \"John\" (vocative), \"fish\").\n\nOther works produced in the 18th and 19th century include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of \"Paradise Lost\" was made in 1796.\n\nA considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, \"Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley\" (\"The Vampire Murders\") was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the \"Gruffalo\" and \"Gruffalo's Child\".\n\nManx is not officially recognised by any national or regional government, although its contribution to Manx culture and tradition is acknowledged by some governmental and non-governmental bodies. For example: \n\nThe Standing Orders of the House of Keys provide that: \"The proceedings of the House shall be in English; but if a Member at any point pronounces a customary term or sentence in Manx Gaelic or any other language, the Speaker may call upon the Member for a translation.\"\n\nManx is used in the annual Tynwald ceremony and Manx words are used in official Tynwald publications.\n\nFor the purpose of strengthening its contribution to local culture and community, Manx is recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and in the framework of the British-Irish Council.\nManx is taught as a second language at all of the island's primary and secondary schools. The lessons are optional and instruction is provided by the Department of Education's Manx Language Team which teach up to A Level standard. \n\nThe Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, a primary school at St John's, has 67 children, as of September 2016, who receive nearly all of their education through the medium of the language. Children who have attended the school have the opportunity to receive some of their secondary education through the language at Queen Elizabeth II High School in Peel.\n\nThe playgroup organisation Mooinjer Veggey, which operates the , runs a series of preschool groups that introduce the language.\n\nThere are an increasing number of resources available for those wanting to learn the language. The Manx Language Development Officer for Culture Vannin manages the Learnmanx.com website which has a wide variety of resources. These include mobile apps a new podcast in Manx, the 1000 words-in-Manx challenge and the Video-a-day in Manx series.\nThe most recent development on the adult language front is the creation of a new on-line course, Say Something in Manx which has been created in conjunction with the Say Something in Welsh \nIt is hoped that this will be the main way on-line learners will access the language from now on.\n2016 also saw the launch of a new dictionary for learners published by Culture Vannin \n\nTwo weekly programmes in Manx are available on medium wave on Manx Radio: \"Traa dy liooar\" on Monday and \"Jamys Jeheiney\" on Friday. The news in Manx is available on-line from Manx Radio, who have three other weekly programmes that use the language: \"Clare ny Gael\"; \"Shiaght Laa\" and \"Moghrey Jedoonee\".\n\nThe \"Isle of Man Examiner\" has a monthly bilingual column in Manx.\n\nThe first film to be made in Manx – the 22-minute-long \"Ny Kirree fo Niaghtey\" (The Sheep [plural] Under the Snow) – premiered in 1983 and was entered for the 5th Celtic Film and Television Festival in Cardiff in 1984. It was directed by Shorys Y Creayrie (George Broderick) for Foillan Films of Laxey, and is about the background to an early 18th-century folk song. In 2013, a short film, Solace in Wicca, was produced with financial assistance from Culture Vannin, CinemaNX and Isle of Man Film. A series of short cartoons about the life of Cuchulain which were produced by BBC Northern Ireland are available as are a series of cartoons on Manx mythology. Most significant is a 13-part DVD series Manx translation of the award-winning series \"Friends and Heroes\".\n\nBilingual road, street, village and town boundary signs are common throughout the Isle of Man. All other road signs are in English only.\n\nBusiness signage in Manx is gradually being introduced but is not mandated by law.\n\nThe Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The four Gospels were produced in 1763 and Conaant Noa nyn Jiarn as Saualtagh Yeesey Creest (the New Testament of our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ) in 1767 by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew and printed, together with the Books of Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) from the Apocrypha. Yn Vible Casherick (The Holy Bible) of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775. The bicentenary was celebrated on the Isle of Man in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.\n\nThis 1775 edition effectively fixed the modern orthography of Manx Gaelic, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some bowdlerisation had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of Rahab the prostitute is rendered as \"ben-oast\", a hostess or female inn-keeper.\n\nThere was a translation of the Psalmyn Ghavid (Psalms of David) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the Book of Common Prayer of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these Metrical Psalms were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by the Manx Language Society in 1905.\n\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) published the Conaant Noa (New Testament) in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. Yn Vible Casherick (the Holy Bible) of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted Noo Ean (the Gospel of St John); this was reprinted by Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh (The Manx Gaelic Society) in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as Bible Chasherick yn Lught Thie (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.\n\nSince 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.\n\nManx was used in some churches into the late 19th century. Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now. Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh, the Manx Language Society, hold an annual Christmas Service at locations around the island.\n\nManx is one of the three descendants of Old Irish (via Middle Irish and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two attested dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx. A third dialect may have existed in-between, around Douglas.\n\nManx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive palatalisation of labial consonants; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants contrast phonemically with palatalised , in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent. A consequence of this phonemic merger is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final (spelled \"-(a)ibh\", \"-(a)imh\" in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with (\"-(e)abh\", \"-(e)amh\") in Manx; both have become , spelled \"-oo\" or \"-u(e)\". Examples include (\"to stand\"; Irish ), (\"religion\"; Irish ), (\"fainting\"; Early Modern Irish , lit. \"in clouds\"), and (\"on you (plural)\"; Irish ). \n\nMedial and final *bh and *mh have become and in general in Manx, thus \"shiu\" 'you PL', Scottish and Irish Gaelic \"sibh\" (\"siph\" in Northern Irish, \"sib\" in South Connacht Irish; Lewis Gàidhlig has the variant \"siù\", besides the more general \"sibh\"), -bh in final consonant clusters, e.g. Manx \"sharroo\" 'bitter', Scottish \"searbh\" , Northern and Western Irish \"searbh\" , Southern Irish \"searbh\" , between vowels, e.g. Manx \"awin\" 'river' , Scottish \"abhainn\" , Irish \"abhainn\" , word-finally in monosyllables, e.g. Manx \"laaue\" 'hand', Scottish \"làmh\" , Northern Irish , Western Irish \"lámh\" , Southern Irish , at the end of stressed syllables (see further below), as in \"sourey\" 'summer', Scotland and Ireland \"samhradh\", Scottish , Northern Irish , Western and Southern Irish . In all this Manx is virtually identical to Northern Irish. Rare retentions of the older pronunciation of \"bh\" include \"Divlyn\", \"Divlin\", Middle Irish \"Duibhlinn\" , also written \"Duibhlinn\" in Modern Irish and Scots Gaelic.\n\nMoreover, similarly to Munster Irish, historical \"bh\" and \"mh\" (nasalised ) tend to be lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx, either with compensatory lengthening or vocalisation as u resulting in diphthongisation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx (\"winter\") and (\"mountains\") correspond to Irish and (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation \"gíre\" () and \"sléte\" ()). Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs before velarised consonants (spelled \"ao\" in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to in many words, as in (\"carpenter\") and (\"narrow\") (spelled and in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).\n\nLike western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. Irish phonology) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical consonant clusters to . For example, Middle Irish (\"mockery\") and (\"women\") have become and respectively in Manx. The affrication of to is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.\n\nAlso like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. Arran, Kintyre), the unstressed word-final syllable of Middle Irish (spelled \"-(a)idh\" and \"-(a)igh\") has developed to in Manx, where it is spelled \"-ee\", as in (\"buy\"; cf. Irish ) and (\"apparatus\"; cf. Gaelic ).\n\nAnother property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that rather than appears in unstressed syllables before (in Manx spelling, \"agh\"), for example (\"straight\") (Irish ), (\"to remember\") (Gaelic ).\n\nLike southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of Ulster Irish and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish fortis and lenis sonorants. For example, (\"children\") , (\"brown\") , (\"butter\") correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic , , and respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the Outer Hebrides and Skye, thus western Irish , Southern Irish/Northern Scottish , , ), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre, , and .\n\nAnother similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed , spelled \"-(e)adh\" in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including verbal nouns), this became in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g. (\"war\") , (\"to praise\") ; cf. Irish and , pronounced and in southern Irish. In finite verb forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) became in Manx, as in southern Irish, e.g. (\"would praise\"), cf. Irish , pronounced in southern Irish.\nLinguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx is reflected by speakers from towns and villages from Maughold in the northeast of the island to Peel on the west coast. Southern Manx is used by speakers from the Sheading of Rushen. It is possible that written Manx represents a 'midlands' dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.\n\nIn Southern Manx, older \"á\" and in some cases \"ó\" have become . In Northern Manx the same happens, but \"á\" sometimes remains as well. For example, (\"day\", cf. Irish ) is in the south but or in the north. Old \"ó\" is always in both dialects, e.g. (\"young\", cf. Irish ) is in both dialects. In many words before \"rt\", \"rd\" and \"rg\", and in one or two other words \"á\", lengthened \"a\" and \"ó\" have become /œ:/, as in \"paayrt\" 'part' /pœ:rt/, \"ard\" 'high' /œ:rd/, \"jiarg\" 'red' /dʒœ:rg/, \"argid\" 'money, silver' /œ:rgid/ and \"aarey\" 'gold GEN' /œ:rə/.\n\nIn Northern Manx, older \"(e)a\" before \"nn\" in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a monophthong. For example, (\"head\", cf. Irish ) is in the north but in the south.\n\nWords with \"ua\" and in some cases \"ao\" in Irish and Scottish are spelled with \"eay\" in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound is , while in Southern Manx it is , , or . For example, (\"wind\", cf. Irish ) is in the north and in the south, while (\"coal\", cf. Irish ) is in the north and , , or in the south.\n\nIn both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short sound before a word-final in monosyllabic words, as in for (\"whole\") and for (\"woman\"). This phenomenon is known as pre-occlusion. In Southern Manx, however, there is pre-occlusion of before and of before , as in for (\"walking\") and for (\"ship\"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of before , on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in (\"heavy\"), which is in the north but or in the south. This feature is also found in Cornish.\n\nSouthern Manx tends to lose word-initial before , while Northern Manx usually preserves it, e.g. (\"glen\") is in the north and in the south, and (\"knee\") is in the north and in the south.\nSome simple conversational words and phrases:\n\nThe Manx orthography is unlike that of Irish and Scottish Gaelic, both of which use similar spelling systems derived from written Early Modern Irish, which was language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it was called Classical Gaelic) until the mid-19th century. In general, these orthographies retain spelling and derivation from older Gaelic, which means that there is not in a one-to-one system. Both systems use only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx in effect uses the English spelling system, except for and , the 24 letters used in its orthography likewise do not cover a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.\n\nThe Manx orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in Welsh and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography is based of early Modern English pronunciation, and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from a pan-Gaelic point of view. The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonemic spelling system, in a similar way as spelling in English. T. F. O'Rahilly expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with an inadaquate spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.\n\nThere is no evidence of Gaelic script having been used on the island.\n\nManx uses relatively few diacritics, but a cedilla is often (but not exclusively) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of \"ch\":\n\nThe following examples are taken from Broderick 1984–86, 1:178–79 and 1:350–53. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from Ned Maddrell, a speaker of Southern Manx.\n\nThe Lord's Prayer has been translated into all the Goidelic tongues. Although the wordings are not completely cognate, they demonstrate the different orthographies.\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Manx are as follows:\n\nThe voiceless plosives are pronounced with aspiration. The dental, postalveolar and palato-velar plosives are affricated to in many contexts.\n\nManx has an optional process of lenition of plosives between vowels, whereby voiced plosives and voiceless fricatives become voiced fricatives and voiceless plosives become either voiced plosives or voiced fricatives. This process introduces the allophones to the series of voiced fricatives in Manx. The voiced fricative may be further lenited to , and may disappear altogether. Examples include:\n\nAnother optional process of Manx phonology is pre-occlusion, the insertion of a very short plosive consonant before a sonorant consonant. In Manx, this applies to stressed monosyllabic words (i.e. words one syllable long). The inserted consonant is homorganic with the following sonorant, which means it has the same place of articulation. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. Examples include:\n\nThe trill is realised as a one- or two-contact flap at the beginning of syllable, and as a stronger trill when preceded by another consonant in the same syllable. At the end of a syllable, can be pronounced either as a strong trill or, more frequently, as a weak fricative , which may vocalise to a nonsyllabic or disappear altogether. This vocalisation may be due to the influence of Manx English, which is itself a non-rhotic accent. Examples of the pronunciation of include:\n\nThe vowel phonemes of Manx are as follows:\n\nThe status of and as separate phonemes is debatable, but is suggested by the allophony of certain words such as \"is\", \"women\", and so on. An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels and have allophones ranging from through to . As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of . This depends mainly on the 'broad' and 'slender' status of the neighbouring consonants:\n\nWhen stressed, is realised as .\n\nManx has a relatively large number of diphthongs, all of them falling:\nStress generally falls on the first syllable of a word in Manx, but in many cases, stress is attracted to a long vowel in the second syllable. Examples include:\n\nLike all modern Celtic languages, Manx shows initial consonant mutations, which are processes by which the initial consonant of a word is altered according to its morphological and/or syntactic environment. Manx has two mutations: lenition and eclipsis, found on nouns and verbs in a variety of environments; adjectives can undergo lenition but not eclipsis. In the late spoken language of the 20th century the system was breaking down, with speakers frequently failing to use mutation in environments where it was called for, and occasionally using it in environments where it was not called for.\n\nIn the corpus of the late spoken language, there is also one example of the elipisis (nasalisation) of : the sentence (\"I have found the lamb\"), where \"ng\" is pronounced . However, probably this was a mis-transcription; the verbal noun in this case is not \"get, fetch\", but rather \"find\".\n\nManx nouns fall into one of two genders, masculine or feminine. Nouns are inflected for number. The plural is formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix , but also by vowel change, changing to or or by adding other endings. There is usually no inflection for case, except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways. (Most common is the addition of the suffix \"-ey\" to feminine nouns.) Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in compounds even when they are no longer productive forms; for example \"cowhouse\" uses the old genitive of \"cattle\". There are also traces of a dative singular in set phrases such as \"on foot\", contrasting with nominative and genitive (cf. \"footwear\", \"football, soccer, rugby\").\n\nCertain adjectives have plural as well as singular forms (through the addition \"-ey\" ), although the use of the singular adjective with a plural noun is usual. Most adjectives end in \"-agh\" and form their comparative/superlative form by replacing this with \"-ee\" , e.g. \"atçhimagh\" \"terrible\" becomes \"atçhimee\", giving \"ny s'atçhimee\" \"more terrible\" and \"s'atçhimee\" \"most terrible\". As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the comparative-superlative is commonly marked by the copula verb \"s\" (\"is\") in the present, and \"by\" in the past; the superlative is often shown by the word \"nys\" /nis/, from Middle Irish \"ní as\" \"thing that is\" (cf. Irish \"níos\", past \"ní ba\"). A number of adjectives form their comparative/superlative irregularly:\n\nThe comparative/superlative can also be formed using \"more\" with the positive form e.g. = .\n\nIn common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to its regular personal pronouns, Manx has also a series used for emphasis. Under certain phonological circumstances, these can be used as unemphatic pronouns, e.g. \"you were not\" is as sounds too similar to \"they/he/she was not\".\n\nNotice the only difference between the masculine and feminine third person singular possessive pronouns is the initial sound change, namely lenition and h-prefixing, they cause, e.g. \"her laptop\", \"his laptop\", \"e ooh\" \"his egg\", \"e hooh\" \"her egg\".\n\nAn alternative to using the possessive pronouns is to precede a noun with the definite article and follow it with the inflected form of \"at\" to show the person, e.g. \"my house\" (literally \"the house at me\") instead of \"my house\". This is especially useful in the plural, where all persons share one possessive pronoun, e.g. \"their house\", as opposed to \"our/your/their house\".\n\n1. Causes lenition.\n\n2. Causes eclipsis.\n\nManx verbs generally form their finite forms by means of periphrasis: inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs \"to be\" or \"to do\" are combined with the verbal noun of the main verb. Only the future, conditional, preterite, and imperative can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx. Examples:\n\nThe future and conditional tenses (and in some irregular verbs, the preterite) make a distinction between \"independent\" and \"dependent\" forms. Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g. \"not\") does precede the verb. For example, \"you will lose\" is with the independent form (\"will lose\"), while \"you will not lose\" is with the dependent form (which has undergone eclipsis to after ). Similarly \"they went\" is with the independent form (\"went\"), while \"they did not go\" is with the dependent form . This contrast is inherited from Old Irish, which shows such pairs as (\"(s)he carries\") vs. (\"(s)he does not carry\"), and is found in Scottish Gaelic as well, e.g. (\"will take\") vs. (\"will not take\"). In Modern Irish, the distinction is found only in irregular verbs (e.g. (\"saw\") vs. (\"did not see\").\n\nThe fully inflected forms of the regular verb \"to throw\" are as follows. In addition to the forms below, a past participle may be formed using : \"thrown\".\n\n1. First person singular, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant\n\n2. First person plural, making the use of a following subject pronoun redundant\n\n3. Used with all other persons, meaning an accompanying subject must be stated, e.g. \"he will throw\", \"they will throw\"\n\nThere are a few peculiarities when a verb begins with a vowel, i.e. the addition of in the preterite and in the future and conditional dependent. Below is the conjugation of \"to grow\".\n\n1. may also be spelt when pronounced i.e. before a slender vowel, e.g. \"ate\" can be either or .\n\nThese peculiarties extend to verbs begins with f, e.g. \"to leave\".\n\n1. Again, may also be spelt where appropriate.\n\nA number of verbs are irregular in their inflection. \n\n1. Future relative: \n2. Future relative: \n\nThe most common and most irregular verb in Manx is \"to be\", often used as an auxiliary verb. In addition to the usual inflected tenses, also has a present tense. The full conjugation of \"to be\" is as follows.\n\nManx adverbs can be formed from adjectives by means of the word , e.g. \"good\", \"well\"; \"cheerful\", \"cheerfully\". This is omitted when preceded by such words as \"too\" and \"very\" or followed by \"enough\", e.g. \"very good, very well\", \"cheerful(ly) enough\". The adverb for \"home(wards)\" is formed with and the noun \"place, town, homestead\" to give , whereas the noun \"house, home\" can be used unchanged to convey the same meaning.\n\nThe language has a number of adverbs corresponding to English \"up\" and \"down\", the meaning of which depend upon such things as motion or lack thereof and starting point in relation to the speaker.\n\nExamples of practical usage are \"There's a man down the street\" and \"I'm going down the street\", \"Climb up (towards me)\" and \"Climb up (away from me)\".\n\nLike the other Insular Celtic languages, Manx has so-called inflected prepositions, contractions of a preposition with a pronominal direct object, as the following common prepositions show. Note the sometimes identical form of the uninflected preposition and its third person singular masculine inflected form.\nIn addition to the above \"simple\" prepositions, Manx has a number of prepositional phrases based on a noun; being based on nouns, the possessive personal pronouns are used to refer to what would in English be pronominal prepositional objects. This also happens in English phrases such as \"for my sake\".\nAlternative conjugation patterns are sometimes found with these more complex prepositions using inflected prepositions, e.g. for \"concerning me\", \"for our sake\" instead of \"for our/your/their sake\".\n\nLike most Insular Celtic languages, Manx uses verb–subject–object word order: the inflected verb of a sentence precedes the subject, which itself precedes the direct object. However, as noted above, most finite verbs are formed periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb in conjunction with the verbal noun. In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a modal verb rather than a form of (\"be\") or (\"do\"). Particles like the negative (\"not\") precede the inflected verb. Examples:\n\nWhen the auxiliary verb is a form of (\"do\"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle :\n\nAs in Irish (cf. Irish syntax#The forms meaning \"to be\"), there are two ways of expressing \"to be\" in Manx: with the substantive verb , and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the predicate is an adjective, adverb, or prepositional phrase. Examples:\n\nWhere the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition (\"in\") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:\n\nOtherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form or in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:\n\nIn questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is :\n\nManx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially Latin, Old Norse, French (particularly Anglo-Norman), and English (both Middle English and Modern English).\n\nThe following table shows a selection of nouns from the Swadesh list and indicates their pronunciations and etymologies.\n\nSee Celtic Swadesh lists for the complete list in all the Celtic languages.\n\nForeign loanwords are primarily Norse and English, with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are \"garey\" (\"garden\", from \"garðr\", \"enclosure\") and \"sker\" meaning a sea rock (from \"sker\", compare with \"skjær\" and \"sker\"). Examples of French loanwords are \"danjeyr\" (\"danger\", from \"danger\") and \"vondeish\" (\"advantage\", from \"avantage\").\n\nEnglish loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. \"boy\" (\"boy\"), \"badjer\" (\"badger\"), rather than the more usual Gaelic \"guilley\" and \"brock\". Henry Jenner, on asking someone what he was doing, was told \"Ta mee smokal pipe\" (\"I am smoking a pipe\"), and that \"[he] certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it.\" In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, calques exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers.\n\nSome religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. \"casherick\" (holy), from the Latin \"consecrātus\"; \"mooinjer\" (people) from the Latin \"monasterium\" (originally a monastery; \"agglish\" (church) from the Greek \"ἐκκλησία\" (\"ekklesia\", literally meaning assembly) and \"abb\" (abbot) from the Hebrew \"אבא\" (\"abba\", meaning \"father\"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, \"ulpan\" has been borrowed from modern Hebrew. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. \"çhellveeish\" (Irish \"teilefís\") and \"çhellvane\" meaning television and telephone respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo, spaghetti.\n\nTo fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.\n\nGoing in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced Manx English (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include \"tholtan\" (the \"th\" is pronounced as a \"t\") meaning a ruined farmhouse, \"quaaltagh\" meaning a first-foot, \"keeill\" meaning a church (especially an old one), \"cammag\", \"traa-dy-liooar\" meaning \"time enough\", and Tynwald (\"tinvaal\"), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is suggested that the House of Keys takes its name from \"Kiare as Feed\" (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.\n\n\n\n"}

Historians of antiquity recognised the task of the portrait as representation; we find the beginnings of the narrative portrait in Livy and Tacitus. However, the portrait began to emerge from the need to describe oneself (self-portrait) or one's contemporaries, as in the \"Essays\" of Montaigne. This latter work develops a line of questioning around the movement of the representation of the individual (or of a society) from the pictorial mode to the discursive mode.\n\nThe portrait can be realised in prose or in verse. Its objectives vary according to context: sociocultural, sociopolitical, historical, or again according to the subjectivity of the portraitist (the writer). Thus one can speak of a fictional portrait (corresponding to the characters who populate the fictional universe of each author) as much as a realist one (representing real-life people).\n\nThe portrait oscillates between reality and fiction, between eulogy and satire, between one portrait which imitates its original and another which moves away from it (such as the caricatures found in newspapers or in Molière). Nevertheless, the objective portrait which describes the flaws and qualities of the individual represented (or equally the object or the idea) is quite widespread. The literary portrait evolved through the centuries and its development has been shaped by writers as well as literary critics and theorists.\n\nIt is from the 1650s that the portrait began to be defined as a literary genre. It is through the social innovations of the \"précieuses\" - such as La Grande Mademoiselle who, influenced by the portrait-laden works of Madeleine de Scudéry, gathered around her (as a \"salonnière\" or ‘salon hostess’) men of letters - that the portrait was transformed into a ‘diversion of society’.\n\nThe literary portrait held to the essential aesthetic rules of the pictorial mode - that is, it had to describe the individual (model) faithfully in order to disguinguish it as a type apart. Nevertheless, it was not to be inferred from the recognition of the individual represented, but rather from the portraitist's style. This narrative representation had the function of highlighting fixed and timeless physical and mental features, as one sees in the works of Molière or in the \"Caractères\" by Jean de La Bruyère. It had to be achieved through layers of successive description - as in painting - which were only distinct phrases describing the real model's features.\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment heralded a new phase in the development of the literary portrait. It invaded literature and even contaminated music. Mozart and Beethoven excelled in this genre. Nevertheless, the portrait carried more of the psychology of the model represented than his or her physical appearance.\n\nIn Denis Diderot, it is precisely the pictorial portrait that is the occasion of a narrative self-portrait effected in the form of an artistic critique of the paintings and statues which were made of him. Thus he did not like the painting by Louis Michel van Loo portraying him:\nThe philosopher blamed the painter's wife for having prevented him from being himself: “It is this madwoman, madame Van Loo, who had come to gossip with him while he was being painted, who gave him that air, and who spoiled everything.” Diderot took to imagining what his portrait would have been like: \n\nAfter criticizing the portrait that portrays him, he writes:\n\nHe informs them, “My children, I tell you that it is not me,” and undertakes to trace in writing the real portrait of himself:\n\nAccording to Diderot, only one painter managed to make a pictorial portrait of him in which he recognizes himself and that is Jean-Baptiste Garand: by an apparent irony of fate, this success was the result of chance: \n\nMoreover, the semi-private sphere of correspondence also allowed the sketching of portraits in principle intended solely for the use of the recipient of the letter. Thus, Marie Du Deffand, taking the thermal waters at Forges-les-Eaux, was able to draw a sharp and cheerful portrait of Madame de Pecquigny, the companion that fate had assigned her during her treatment: \n\nHowever, it is not so much her spirit - or the way she uses it - that irritates Marie Du Deffand as the woman's quirks:\n\nMarie Du Deffand completes this portrait of an eccentric by linking her to her interlocutor: “I am sorry that you have in common with her the impossibility of staying a minute at rest.” After which she concludes, in accordance with the philosophy of resignation and disinterest she defends, the temporary nature of that which she will have to endure on this “holiday meeting”: \nThe evolution of the narrative portrait did not stop at the nineteenth century but, on the contrary, it became more refined and took on nuances through the intervention of Sainte-Beuve in the works or the critiques of such literary portraits.\n\nIn fact, the portrait found a true place in the novel where it represented not only real-life individuals but also fictional individuals (who could also be symbolic). It is in this way that the portrait became a predominant and recurring theme in the work of Balzac.\n\nThe portrait continued its journey throughout the twentieth century with the modern novel. In Nathalie Sarraute (in the Portrait d'un inconnu) the features are not fixed, the temporality plays its role in the genre of the moving portrait, progressive, fragmented, as in the life of a human.\n"}

In December 2004, users on the Romanian Wikipedia started to talk about founding a local chapter of Wikimedia, \"\".\n\nThe first articles in the Romanian Wikipedia were written in July 2003, with the first version of the main page being drafted on 12 July. The user interface, initially in English, started being translated into Romanian by Bogdan Stăncescu (registered with the username Gutza) as soon as he was given sysop rights. The same user subsequently contacted several Romanian universities that were available on the internet, as well as the Romanian Academy, in order to attract new contributors. His efforts were soon remarked by the Romanian media, who invited him on several occasions to introduce the project to the public. By the end of 2003, the Romanian Wikipedia had exceeded 3,000 articles, ranking 16th among all Wikipedias. The 10,000th article was written on 13 December 2004, and the 50,000th on 5 January 2007.\n\nIn April 2004, the Romanian Wikipedia supported the launch of the (see Aromanian language).\n\nIn June 2004, the Romanian Wikipedia encountered problems concerning its division and the creation of a separate (see Moldovan language). A Moldovan language version of Wikipedia exists as it was created automatically together with a larger number of other Wikipedias, because the language had been assigned a separate ISO 639 code (\"mo/mol\"—which were deprecated in November 2008 by the ISO authorities). At its beginnings, it worked as a portal redirecting to the Romanian Wikipedia, but in March 2005, it eventually began allowing content (although only intended for Cyrillic Moldovan/Romanian as it was used before 1989 in the Moldavian SSR and remains in use only in Transnistria), starting big editing wars and endless discussion. Starting from December 2006 it is frozen and editing is no longer permitted. This question is still raised from time to time, although users on Wikipedia voted on its closure.\n\nThe Romanian Wikipedia reached the 100,000 article milestone on 11 January 2008. As of April 2015, it has 300,000 articles and 330,000 registered users, of which 21 are administrators.\n\nThe logo of the Romanian Wikipedia was slightly different from the logos of other Wikipedias. The letter \"И\" in the logo was replaced with the Romanian letter \"Ă\" (A-breve), further adapting this Wikipedia to the local readership.\n\nArticles can contain small spelling variations, mostly regarding the use of the letters \"â\" and \"î\", both used for the close central unrounded vowel (cf. Romanian alphabet).

Still, between 1953 and 1993, the Romanian language only used \"î\" - after 1964 an exception was made for derivations of the words \"România\" (\"Romania\"), \"român\" (\"Romanian\") and related words. The Academy rules are mandatory in government organisations and in state schools in Romania. Moldova adopted the Latin alphabet for the Romanian language before the spelling reform in 1993, and it didn't switch to the new spelling up until 2001, using the letter \"î\" before exclusively (exceptions were made for \"România\" and the other related words, spelled with \"â\"). In practice, either usage is acceptable in both countries, and indeed there are publishing houses and printed magazines that use either or both of the two rules. Vojvodina uses the new Romanian spelling. Other spelling differences include \"sunt\"/\"sînt\" or \"niciun\"/\"nici un\". The Romanian Wikipedia community adopted a language policy stating that both pre-1993 and post-1993 spelling norms are permitted, and editing an article just to switch it from one norm to the other is not acceptable; switching is allowed if the article is significantly expanded or rewritten.\n\nConcerning the addressing policy, Romanian Wikipedia uses the polite forms of the personal pronouns and verbs. A policy on this was discussed in early 2006, and consensus was reached for the use of \"dumneavoastră\" (polite \"you\") instead of \"tu\" (familiar \"you\") on its pages.\n\n\nRef.\n\n"}

It relates to spindle speed via variables such as cutter diameter (for rotating cutters) or workpiece diameter (for lathe work).\n\nSFM is a combination of \"diameter\" and the \"velocity\" (RPM) of the material measured in feet-per-minute as the spindle of a milling machine or lathe. 1 SFM equals 0.00508 m/s (meter per second, the SI unit of speed). The faster the spindle turns, and/or the larger the diameter, the higher the SFM. The goal is to tool a job to run the SFM as high as possible to increase hourly part production. However some materials will run better at specific SFMs. When the SFM is known for a specific material (\"ex 303 annealed stainless steel = 120 SFM for high speed steel tooling\"), a formula can be used to determine spindle speed for live tools or spindle speeds for turning materials.\n\nIn a milling machine, the \"tool\" diameter is substituted for \"stock\" diameter in the following formulas when the cutter is revolving and the stock is stationary.\n\nSpindle Speed can be calculated using the following equation:\n\nSFM can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\n"}

They are often regarded as a classic specimen of medieval documentation in Kerala.\n\nThe central theme of the writings on these copper plates are concerned with the management of resources for specific rituals in the temple. It was first published in Travancore Archeological Series by T A Gopinatha Rao, under the tite \"The Huzur Treasury Plates Belonging to the Visnu Temple At Tiruvalla\". The Tiruvalla copper plates consist of forty four plates, but at least seven plates are missing. \n\nThe Moozhikkulam Kacham is mentioned in the Tiruvalla copper plates which points to the fact that the Moozhikulam Kacham was not restricted to checking the corruption of Ooralanmar. A condition in the inscription is that Idangazhi (a measuring vessel) of ghee should be provided for the thiruvamrithu (special savouring) to the God. The karalan who defaults it should pay 50 kazhanju gold to the king, 25 kazhanju gold to the Oorala sabha and 12.50 kazhanju gold to the ruler.\n\nIt can be learned from the inscriptions that the karalan paid paattam (rent) to the owners in the rates 2/5, 1/5 and 1/3. The wordings \"kadappanangadu bhoomiyum aalum\" and \"kuzhikkaattu bhoomiyum aalum\" point to the fact that there were permanent workers for each farmland.\n\nThe inscription says that 27,105 paras (a measuring vessel) of paddy were required for the kedavilakku and naivedyam rituals of the temple. Free education, food and accommodation were given to over 100 chithiranmar (meaning Brahmin students) at the Tiruvalla Salai.\n\nThe inscription says that 350 nazhi (a measuring vessel) of rice was spent a day for the meals of around 175 chithiranmar during Onam. The temple had paddy field where 12,634 kalam (one kalam = 10 para) paddy was sown for feeding the Brahmins. The inscription also has indications on a hospital which functioned along with the temple.\n\n"}

He is noted for his role as the editor of the Konkani daily, \"Sunaparant\", and as a Konkani language activist. Bhembre is also widely known as the lyricist of the famed Goan Konkani language song Channeache Rati.\n\nUday Bhembre was born in Zambaulim, a village in South Goa. He is the son of eminent freedom fighter Laxmikant Bhembre.\n\nAfter his early education in Goa, Bhembre went to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1957 for pursuing higher education. Bhembre is an alumnus of Mumbai's Siddharth College. He joined Mumbai's Akashvani (radio broadcaster) centre and became a lyricist. Bhembre is a lawyer by profession.\n\nBhembre has been a vociferous advocate for the cause of Konkani language. He played a great role in various movements related to the language.\n\nIn the Goa Opinion Poll, Bhembre campaigned against Goa's merger with Maharashtra. At that time, Bhembre authored a column in the popular anti-merger Marathi newspaper \"Rashtramat\". In his column entitled \"Bhahmastra\", Uday Bhembre campaigned for the anti-merger camp and his column played a great role in influencing the Goans in supporting the anti-merger camp.\n\nBhembre was also a leader of the Konkani language agitation, and he played a great role in the movement which led to the enactment of the Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987.

{"id": "22777652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22777652", "title": "Ullage (wine)", "text": "Ullage (wine)\n\nUllage (from the French \"ouillage\") is a winemaking term that has several meanings but most commonly refers to the headspace of air between wine and the top of the container holding the wine. It can also refer to the process of evaporation that creates the headspace itself or it can be used as a past tense verb to describe a wine barrel or bottle that has gone through the evaporation process (\"to be ullaged\", etc.). The headspace of air is a mixture mostly of alcohol and water vapors with carbon dioxide that is a by-product of the fermentation process. In containers that are not completely air-tight (such as an oak wine barrel or a cork-stoppered wine bottle), oxygen can also seep into this space. While some oxygen is beneficial to the aging process of wine, excessive amounts can lead to oxidation and other various wine faults. This is why wine in the barrels is regularly \"topped up\" and refilled to the top with wine in order to minimize the head space. In the bottle, the ullage or \"fill level\" of the wine can be an important indicator of the kind of care and storage conditions that the wine was kept in. After-market resellers and wine auction houses will often inspect the ullage levels of older vintages to determine the potential quality and value of wine.\n\nAt the winery, the natural process of evaporation creates ullage in the barrel by causing some of the alcohol and water particles to escape as vapors, a loss sometimes referred to as the \"angel's share\". If the wine is in a container that is not completely air-tight, these vapor molecules (along with carbon dioxide) will diffuse out of the container through openings in the wood and around the bung and be replaced with oxygen molecules. While some oxygen is beneficial in the maturation and break-down of some phenolic compounds such as tannin, excessive amounts of oxygen can interact with \"Acetobacter\" present in the wine and start the process of turning the wine into vinegar. To prevent this possible oxidation and spoilage wineries will regularly \"top up\" the barrels by replacing the lost liquid with new wine.\n\nThe exact method and timing of topping up a wine barrel is determined by the individual wineries and can depend on the type of wine or grape variety that is being produced. A barrel can be topped off anywhere from once a week to every month and a half. The position of the barrel can affect the speed and degree of evaporation and the need for topping up. If the barrel is sitting with its bung hole on top, aeration and evaporation occurs more quickly. If the barrel is turned to the side in the \"bung over\" position, the bung is kept moist with the wine and aeration occurs at a slower pace. The wine that is replaced during the topping up is usually the same wine taken from another smaller container (such as a carboy) with the barrel filled to the very top to where the reinsertion of the bung causes some spillage.\n\nThe ullage level of a wine bottle is sometimes described as the \"fill level\". This describes the space between the wine and the bottom of the cork. During the bottling process, most wineries strive to have an initial ullage level of between 0.2–0.4 inches (5–10mm). As a cork is not a completely airtight sealant, some wine is lost through the process of evaporation and diffusion. As a wine ages in the bottle, the amount of ullage will continue to increase unless a wine is opened, topped up and recorked. If the wine is stored on its side, in contact with the cork, some wine will also be lost by absorption into the cork with longer corks having the potential to absorb more wine (and thus create more ullage) than shorter corks.\n\nGenerally the greater the amount of ullage, the more potential that the wine has been exposed to harmful levels of oxidation. This is why auction houses and retailers of mature wines pay close attention to the ullage levels in determining the resale value of the wine. The ullage level can also give insight as to the type of care and storage condition that the wine was kept in. Wines that have been kept at ambient humidity levels and in temperatures between 50–59°F (10–15°C) will experience evaporation and diffusion at a slower rate than wine kept in lesser conditions and will thus have a lower ullage levels. Ullage levels are generally important to the likelihood of almost any wine being in good shape. Vintage Port might be slightly less prone to damage since it is fortified, but the only wines that can not be damaged by oxidation are Madeira wines, which are already oxidized.\n\nThere are standard descriptions used by wine merchants and auction houses for the fill levels (ullage levels) of wine. The fill levels descriptions are different for Bordeaux and Burgundy wines due to the different shape of the bottles from those two regions.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Master of Wine and senior consultant of Christie's auction Michael Broadbent developed a guide for evaluating the ullage levels of matured wines. While the focus of his guide was primarily on Bordeaux, it has been generally accepted and widely used in the wine market as an evaluation tool for all sorts of wine. The terms are used to describe the levels of wine in a wine bottle. They are commonly used to describe old wine bottles offered for sale in wine auctions and by dealers in rare wine. Despite the guide's popularity, Broadbent has been quoted as regretting his decision not to copyright it.\n"}
{"id": "22261390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22261390", "title": "Uropi", "text": "Uropi\n\nUropi is a constructed language which was created by Joël Landais, a French English teacher. Uropi is a synthesis of European languages, explicitly based on the common Indo-European roots and aims at being used as an international auxiliary language for Europe and thus contributing to building a European identity. Besides, given the spread of Indo-European languages outside Europe (today half the world population speaks an I-E language).\n\nUropi was begun in 1986; since then, it has undergone certain modifications; its vocabulary keeps growing (the French-Uropi dictionary has over 10,000 words).\n\nUropi became known in Europe in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter studying languages at the University of Orléans, then at the Sorbonne and at the \"École Normale Supérieure\" in Paris, Joël Landais obtained the Agrégation diploma in English. He speaks French, English, Italian, Spanish, German and has a working knowledge of modern Greek and Russian. Today, he teaches English in a Chartres college. Parallel to his training as a linguist, his travels throughout Europe, Senegal, the Maghreb, Egypt, Mexico, former USSR, Vietnam and the West Indies, together with a passion for languages, led him to create Uropi.\n\nThe Uropi alphabet has 26 letters, the 26 letters of the ISO Basic Latin alphabet minus q, plus the letter ʒ, which comes from the International Phonetic Alphabet. Each letter corresponds to a sound and each sound to a letter.\n\nAll consonants are pronounced as in English except\n\nThe vowels \"a, e, i, o, u\" are pronounced as in Italian or Spanish: \"casa, solo, vino, luna, pepe\". Stress normally falls on the main root. For example, in \"apkebo\" = to behead, the stress falls on \"keb\" = head. However some suffixes (such as \"-èl\" indicating an instrument) and the ending \"-ì\" for the past are always stressed; when two or more suffixes are combined, the stress always falls on the penultimate suffix (the last but one). The stress is marked with a written accent (à è ì ò ù) on the stressed vowel when it falls on the last syllable. For example: \"kotèl, perì, fotò, menù\" = \"knife, carried, photo, menu\".\n\nUropi roots can be divided into three categories:\n\nFirst and foremost Uropi claims to be a way to recreate a unity between Indo-European languages. With this aim, a great many Uropi roots correspond to common Indo-European roots which have been simplified, in their pronunciation and length (very often Uropi roots have one or two syllables). Thus, mother is \"mata\" (from Indo-European: \"mātēr*\"); sun is \"sol\" (from Indo-European: \"sāwel*\"). This simplification corresponds to the natural evolution of Indo-European roots which have given birth to the words which are used today in modern I-E languages. Thus \"mata\" corresponds to Hindi \"mata, sol\" to Spanish and Scandinavian \"sol\".\n\nWhen there is no common Indo-European root or when there are several roots to express the same reality in various languages, Uropi may use \"hybrid\" words, crossing two different roots taken from different languages so as to create the most easily recognizable term for speakers of the greatest number of Indo-European languages. Thus, in \"liamo\", to love, the \"li-\" comes from Germanic and Slavic languages (cf German \"lieben\" and Russian \"liubit\"), and the \"-am\", from Latin languages (\"amo, amare, amar\"); or in \"mand\", hand, the ma- comes from Latin languages and the -and, from Germanic languages. This process is not so artificial as it seems at first sight: It has been observed in natural languages, for example, the French \"haut\" (high) comes from the crossing between old Fr. \"aut\" (from Latin \"altus\") and Frankish \"hōh\". It has also been deliberately used in languages like English to form new words: \"portmanteau-words\", for instance, the famous London \"smog\" comes from the crossing of '\"smoke\" and \"fog\". Let us also mention the words \"'franglais\" (Fr = \"français\" + \"anglais\"), \"denglisch\" (Ger. = \"deutsch\" + English), \"spanglish\" (US = Spanish + English). These \"hybrid\" words only account for 3% of Uropi vocabulary.\n\nUropi also uses many words which are already \"international\", like \"taksì, skol\" (school), \"bus, art, matc\" (match), \"polìz\" (police), \"simfonij\" (symphony), and \"tabàk\" (tobacco).\n\nAs many other conlangs, Uropi uses many compounds, either combining two roots, or using prefixes and suffixes.\nAmong the former, there are the following examples: \"lucitòr\", \"lighthouse\", from \"luc\", \"light\" and \"tor\", \"tower\"; or, with \"sopo\", \"to sleep\", \"sopisàk\", \"sleeping-bag\", or \"sopivagòn\", \"sleeper\" (train).\n\nThere are also numerous examples of compounds built with prefixes or suffixes: for example with \"davo\", \"to give\", \"disdavo\", \"to distribute\", can be formed; with \"tel\", \"goal, purpose\", \"atelo\", \"end up in, come to\", can be formed; with \"breko\", \"to break\", and \"us\", \"out\", \"usbreko\", \"to break out\", can be formed; with \"apel\", \"apple\", \"aplar\", \"apple tree\", and \"aplaria\", \"apple orchard\", can be formed.\n\nIn most cases, those compounds reveal the roots and thus the meaning of the compound. However, some of those compounds, even if they follow the etymology of equivalent words in living European languages, have a more obscure, rather metaphorical meaning. Thus, \"ruspeko\", literally \"to look back\", means \"to respect\"; or \"incepo\", literally \"to seize, to grasp inside, means \"to understand\".\n\nLike some modern Indo-European languages, Uropi has a very limited declension with only two cases: nominative and genitive in the singular and the plural.\nUropi substantives are divided into three groups: those ending in a consonant, those ending in \"-a\" and those ending in another vowel.\n\nAmong those ending in a consonant are all masculine nouns, \"i.e.,\" nouns denoting men or male animals: \"man\": \"man\"; \"kat\": \"(tom)cat\". \n\nThose nouns take an -e in the plural; the genitive singular is marked with an \"-i\", and the genitive plural with \"-is\": \"man, mane, mani, manis\" = \"man, men, man's, men's\".\n\nAll feminine nouns, \"i.e.,\" nouns denoting women or female animals end in \"-a\": \"ʒina\": \"woman\"; \"kata\": \"(she)cat\". These nouns take an -s in the plural. The \"-a\" becomes \"-u\" in the genitive singular, \"-us\" in the genitive plural: \"gala, galas, galu, galus\" = \"hen, hens, hen's, hens'\".\n\nAll the other substantives are neuter: they can equally end with a consonant or with an \"-a\": for example, \"tab\": \"table\", \"ment\": \"mind\", or \"teatra\": \"theatre\", \"centra\": \"centre\". They correspond to the neuter personal pronoun \"je\" = \"it\".\n\nThe nouns ending with another vowel are essentially \"international\" words like \"taksì, eurò, menù\". They take an \"-s\" in the plural, but no specific mark in the genitive.\n\nAs in English, qualifying adjectives are invariable. They are placed before the noun they qualify. Some are \"pure\" adjectives: \"bun\": \"good\"; \"glen\": \"green\", \"kurti\": \"short\", others are derived from nouns. In this case, their form is identical to that of the genitive singular: \"mani\": \"manly, man's\"; \"ʒinu\": feminine, \"woman's\".\n\nA few quantitative indefinite adjectives which are also pronouns take an \"-e\" in the plural: \"mol, mole\" = \"much, many\", \"poj, poje\" = \"little, few\", \"tal, tale\" = \"every, all\", \"ek, eke\" = \"some, a few\".\n\nPersonal pronouns have three cases: nominative, accusative (also used with all prepositions) and dative. Possessive adjectives are used for the genitive. As in English, there are three pronouns in the third person singular (masculine: \"he\"; feminine: \"ce\"; neuter: \"je\") as well as a reflexive pronoun. For example: \"i\" = \"I\" (nominative), \"ma\" = \"me\" (accusative), \"mo\" = \"to me\" (dative), \"tu, ta, to\" = \"you\", etc.\n\nList of personal pronouns: \"i, tu, he, ce, je, nu, vu, lu\" = \"I, you \"(singular)\", he, she, it, we, you \"(plural & polite form)\", they\". Reflexive pronoun: \"sia\" = \"oneself\".\n\nUropi verbs have indicative, imperative and conditional moods, as well as a simple form, a durative (continuous) form and a perfect form.\n\n1: \"un\"; 2: \"du\"; 3: \"tri\"; 4: \"kwer\"; 5: \"pin\"; 6: \"ses\"; 7: \"sep\"; 8: \"oc\"; 9: \"nev\"; 10: \"des\"; 100: \"sunte\"; 1000: \"tilie\". 357: \"trisunte pindes-sep\".\nOrdinal numbers are formed by adding \"-i\" or \"-j\" (after a vowel): \"duj\": \"second\"; \"trij\": \"third\", \"kweri\": \"fourth\", \"pini\": \"fifth\"; the exception is \"pri\": \"first\".\n\nFractions are formed by adding \"-t\" to numbers: \"u trit\": \"a third\", \"u kwert\": \"a fourth, a quarter\"; the exception is \"mij\": \"half\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4565015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4565015", "title": "Wallisian language", "text": "Wallisian language\n\nWallisian, or Uvean (), is the Polynesian language spoken on Wallis (also known as Uvea). The language is also known as East Uvean to distinguish it from the related West Uvean language spoken on the outlier island of Ouvéa near New Caledonia. The latter island was colonised from Wallis Island in the 18th century.\n\nWallisian may be most closely related to Rennellese. It is also closely related to Tongan, though part of the Samoic branch, and has borrowed extensively from Tongan due to the Tongan invasion of the island in the 15th and 16th centuries. Uvea was settled about 3,000 years ago. \nThe standard 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u, with their lengthened variants: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū.\n\nThe consonants: f, g (always pronounced as ŋ (ng)), h, k, l, m, n, p, s (rare, usually from foreign words), t, v, '.\n\nThe \"\", representing the glottal stop (see also okina), is known in Wallisian as \"fakamoga\" (belonging to the throat). The fakamoga is nowadays taught at schools, and can be written with straight, curly or inverted curly apostrophes. Similarly the macron (Wallisian: \"fakaloa\", 'to lengthen') is now taught in schools to mark long vowels, even though the older generation has never marked the glottal stop or vowel length.\n\nFor example: \"Mālō te ma'uli\" (hello)\n\nIn Wallisian, there are three registers: the honorific language is used by both commoners and royals themselves. The royalty use it as it is the chiefly language and the commoners use it when talking to either a royal or when talking to God. The honorific language is also used by commoners when talking about God or about a royal figure regardless of their presence. The second language is the commoner language which is what is considered “ordinary” Wallisian, and finally there is vulgar or derogatory language. For example, the word for “to remain” in honorific, commoner, and vulgar registers are respectively , , & . Each of the three are used in their respective circumstances.\n\nWallisian is a Polynesian language that comes from Proto-Polynesian. However, its classification has been a subject of debate among scholars. Due to its proximity with Tongan language, Wallisian has sometimes been classified within the tongic subgroup (Elbert, 1953), but later linguists stated it belonged to the Nuclear Polynesian group: Pawley and Green (1966), Bruce Biggs (1978) and Jeffrey Marck (2000).\n\nThe closest langage to Wallisian is the Niuafo'ou language, spoken on the island of Niuafo'ou (Northern Tonga, Niuas group). Intercomprehension is very high between those two languages, due to intense contacts between both islands until the mid-20th century.\n\nWallisian is related to Rennellese. It is also closely related to Tongan, because of former Tonga invasions in Wallis. For instance, the past form \"ne'e\" comes from Tongan. Wallisian is very closely related to Tongan, while Futunan is more closely related to Samoan. \n\nDuring the 19th century, a form of pidgin English was used by Wallisians to communicate with traders, mainly due to the fact that the natives of Wallis and Futuna had a lot of contact with New England whaling ships as they frequently stopped at Wallis and Futuna. Currently, there are about 70 pidgin words that are still in use on Wallis island. In 1937 however an infestation of coconut beetles on Wallis island scared many of the trade partners of Wallis island whom happened to have been mainly English. Trade to Fiji for example was halted because of the infestation. Loanwords included european foods (\"laisi\" : rice, \"suka\": sugar) and objects (\"pepa\": paper), but also some animals (\"hosi\": horse)\n\nInfluence from English grew stronger after the American army set a military base on the island in 1942. Loanwords such as \"puna\" (spoon), \"motoka\" (car, from \"motor car\"), \"famili\" (family), \"suka\" (sugar), \"peni\" (pen), \"tini\" (tin), etc. have integrated the Wallisian language.\n\nWhen the missionaries came, they also introduced many Latin words, mainly for religious purposes. Jesus Christ was rendered into \"Sesu Kilisito\", words like \"komunio\" (communion), \"kofesio\" (confession), \"temonio\" (devil, from \"demonio\", fr \"démon\"), but also some non religious vocabulary : \"hola\" (time, hour (lat. \"hora\")) ; \"hisitolia\" (history (lat. \"historia\")) were introduced and are now part of the everyday Wallisian language. Not all religious words have been borrowed, though. Missionaries also tried to use existing concepts in Wallisians and give them a new Christian meaning. Thus \"Tohi tapu\" (\"sacred book\") refers to the Bible, while \"aho tapu\" (\"holy day\") means Sunday and \"Po Tapu\" (\"sacred night\") is Christmas; the concept of Trinity was translated into \"Tahitolu tapu\" which literally translates to \"one-three holy\". Missionaries also introduced the days of the week into the language, using the Latin ecclesiastical style of naming weekdays with \"feria\" (translitterated into \"felia\"), much like in Portuguese.\n\nClaire Moyse-Faurie explains that in Wallisian, \"loanwords conform to the syllabic structure by inserting an epenthetic vowel into the cluster and by either adding a final vowel or eliminating the final consonant\".\n\nWallisian has been heavily influenced by French. French missionaries arrived at the end of the 19th century; in 1961, Wallis and Futuna became a French oversea territory and French is now the official language. According to many linguists such as Dr Karl Rensch, French did not affect much the language in the beginning but is now profoundly transforming Wallisian. Many neologisms have been created by transliterating French words into Wallisian, as in the vocabulary of politics. Words such as \"Falanise\" (France), \"Telituale\" (Territory), \"politike\", (politics), \"Lepupilika\" (Republic)..., many technical words (\"telefoni\", \"televisio\"...), food that was brought in Wallis by the Europeans (\"tomato\", \"tapaka\" (tobacco, from fr \"tabac\", ), \"alikole\" (alcohol), \"kafe\" (coffee, from fr \"café\")), etc. are borrowings from French.\n\nIn 1984, Karl Rensch stated that more and more French loanwords were entering the Wallisian language . In the 2000s, young people have started mixing both languages in their speech.\n\n-French influence in Uvea can be seen through media and in schools. French was even implemented as a primary and secondary school language since 1961, reinforcing the French governmental dominance over the island. During the year 1968-1969 when a Wallisian was caught speaking in his native language in school they would be forced to wear a tin corned beef lid as a necklace and then write an hour long French composition during the weekend marked by the French teacher. When the next student were to be caught speaking Wallisian then necklace would be passed on to them but whoever holds the necklace will have to wear it until someone else is caught speaking their suppressed native language. \n\nDue to the French influence on Wallis island about half of the media is in French and constantly available while for example some news stations and television programs in Wallisian are only available once a week and are usually at the and of week which discourages people from watching them since they would have already seen the news earlier in the week. This only leads to people interacting more with the French language and feeling more discouraged to learn Wallisian. Some parents even discourage the learning of Wallisian in nursery and primary schools calling the language a waste of time to learn. \n\nDespite being two different polynesian languages, Wallisian and Futunan are similar enough to one another that knowing one language makes it much easier to learn the other as well.\n\nMany Wallisians see themselves as superior to Futunans, such as reinforcing stereotypes claiming that Wallisian is easy while Futunan is a difficult language to pronounce. These stereotypes arise from the fact that since Wallis island was chosen as the administrative center for the French and as the seat of the Catholic bishop. Wallis island enjoyed more benefits from France and hence Wallisian became dominant to Futunan, especially since Futuna island lacked the educational resources that Wallis island could provide in the 1990s. A highly educated Futunan is typically expected to be trilingual is French, Futunan, & Wallisian. Only by being trilingual in all three can a Futunan retain the pride of Futuna island while being able to have the opportunity to advance economically and educationally on Wallis island.\n\nThe natives of Wallis islands and Futuna were able to get very close to the Catholic missionaries as the missionaries stayed, learned the native languages Wallisian and Futunan, and the missionaries created schools in order to educate the young and encourage young men to join the priesthood. The natives of the islands had a poor relationship with administrative officials since administrators only stay for two to three years before being moved elsewhere, this causes administrators to typically not learn local languages as they had very little use for it being exposed for such a relatively short period of time compared to the missionaries. The natives being close to the Catholics however caused the locals to begin learning Latin words which they began to incorporate into their own language, especially in religious settings. \n\nThis rift between the clergy and the administration was seen all the way in France where anticlericalism was widespread. French politicians and church officials had been having difficulties agreeing with one another. The clergy for example found very little to no reason to impose the French language of the natives of Wallis and Futuna, however Paris demanded that the islands learn the language and an agreement between French politicians and the Catholic church was made. French would be taught two hours a day, four times a week, and as long as French classes did not interfere with Catholic studies. In 1959 when the islands of Wallis and Futuna joined the French republic as an overseas territory the educational system changed dramatically. The Catholic church lost control of the educational system to the French politicians who ordered teachers of the French language from France to teach French on the islands. Most of these teachers had very little experience teaching French as a second language and the change in the educational system led to a sociolinguistic split, younger generations became more or less bilingual while the older generations had a very little grasp of the French language. French teachers on the Wallis and Futuna islands were in a similar position as the French administrators. French teachers only taught for two to three years before their teaching contract ended and they are moved elsewhere.\n\nHaving similar opinions to the priests the French teachers were asked about their experience when returning to France and they usually said that teaching French on the islands was a waste of time as only few people saw the need for the locals to become fluent in French. As the debates over how the people should be educated continued, Wallisians realized the cultural importance of their language and found a new desire to protect it by attempting to standardize the language, creating social media/entertainment in Wallisian rather than in French (despite the fact that most media comes from France anyways), and by making Wallisian a school subject.\n\nAs the French missionaries arrived in 1837 spreading Latin language, the natives became weary of a loss of Wallisian culture. The natives of Wallis islands began to have Wallisian classes for middle school children, and when the community obtained F.M. & A.M. transmitters the community began operating radio channels specifically in Wallisian.\n\n\n"}

The last known speaker, Jopi Mabinda, was murdered in 1988. However, a reporter for the South African newspaper Mail & Guardian reports that ǁXegwi may still be spoken in the Chrissiesmeer district.\n\nThe ǁXegwi name for their language has been spelled \"giǁkwi:gwi\" or \"kiǁkwi:gwi.\" Their name for themselves has been transcribed \"tlou tle\" or \"kxlou-kxle\", presumably . The Nguni (Zulu and Swazi) called them \"(a)batwa, amaNkqeshe, amaNgqwigqwi\"; the Sotho called them \"Baroa/Barwa\".\n\nǁXegwi lost the abrupt clicks (the various manners of and ) found in its relatives. It reacquired from Nguni Bantu languages, but clicks remained relatively infrequent, compared to other Tuu languages. It also had a series of uvular plosives not found in other Tuu languages.\n\n"}
