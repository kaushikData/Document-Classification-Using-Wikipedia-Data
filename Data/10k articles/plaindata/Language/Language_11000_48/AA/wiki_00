Abkhaz has a large consonantal inventory that contrasts 58 consonants in the literary Abzhywa dialect, coupled with just two phonemic vowels ().\n\nAbkhaz has three major dialects, Abzhywa, Bzyp and Sadz, which differ mainly in phonology.\n\nBelow is the IPA phoneme chart of the consonant phonemes of Abkhaz:\n\nPhonemes preceded by an asterisk (*) are found in the Bzyp and Sadz dialects of Abkhaz, but not in Abzhywa; phonemes preceded by a dagger (†) are unique to the Bzyp dialect. The total number of consonant phonemes in Abkhaz is, therefore, 58 in the Abzhywa dialect, 60 in the Sadz dialect, and 67 in Bzyp. The Sadz dialect also has distinctive consonant gemination; for example, Sadz Abkhaz contrasts ('ashes') vs. ('worm'), where Abzhywa and Bzyp Abkhaz have only the one form for both; it seems that many Sadz singletons reflect positions where a consonant has been dropped from the beginning of a cluster in the Proto-Northwest Caucasian form (compare Ubykh 'ashes'). Some scholars (for instance, ) prefer to count the Sadz consonant inventory at well over 100 (thus forming the largest consonant inventory in the Caucasus, outstripping Ubykh's 80–84) by treating the geminated consonants as a set in their own right. (Note, however, that this practice is not usual in counting the consonant inventory of a language.)\n\nThe Bzyp consonant inventory appears to have been the fundamental inventory of Proto-Abkhaz, with the inventories of Abzhywa and Sadz being reduced from this total, rather than the Bzyp series being innovative. Plain alveolopalatal affricates and fricatives have merged with their corresponding alveolars in Abzhywa and Sadz Abkhaz (compare Bzyp 'to know' vs. Abzhywa ), and in Abzhywa the labialised alveolopalatal fricatives have merged with the corresponding postalveolars (compare Bzyp 'to measure' vs. Abzhywa ).\n\nThe non-pharyngealised dorsal fricatives of Abkhaz may be realised as either velar or uvular depending upon the context in which they are found; here, they have been ranged with the uvulars. Also, while the labialised palatal approximant is here placed with the approximants, it is actually the reflex of a labialised voiced pharyngeal fricative, preserved in Abaza, and a legacy of this phoneme's origin is a slight constriction of the pharynx for some speakers, resulting in the phonetic realisation .\n\nAbkhaz has only two distinctive vowels: an open vowel and a close vowel . These basic vowels have a wide range of allophones in different consonantal environments, with allophones and respectively next to palatals, and next to labials, and and next to labiopalatals. also has a long variant , which is the reflex of old sequences of or , preserved in Abaza.\n\n\n"}

The actual slang varied greatly from place to place; often \"Bargoens\" denotes the variety from the Holland region in the Netherlands. While many words from Bargoens have faded into obscurity, others have become part of standard Dutch (but are more often used in the \"Hollandic\" than in other Dutch dialects). \"Hufter\" (jerk), \"gappen\" (to steal) and \"poen\" (money) are examples of words now common in Dutch. As is the case for most thieves' languages, many of the words from \"Bargoens\" are either insults or concern money, crime or sex.\n\nDue to the historically large number of Jews in Amsterdam, Bargoens has many Yiddish loanwords.

{"id": "166028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166028", "title": "Bokmål", "text": "Bokmål\n\nBokmål (literally \"book tongue\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway. Unlike for instance the Italian language, there is no nationwide standard or agreement on the pronunciation of Bokmål.\n\nBokmål is regulated by the governmental Norwegian Language Council. A more conservative orthographic standard, commonly known as \"Riksmål\", is regulated by the non-governmental Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature. The written standard is a Norwegianised variety of the Danish language.\n\nThe first Bokmål orthography was officially adopted in 1907 under the name \"Riksmål\" after being under development since 1879. The architects behind the reform were Marius Nygaard and Jacob Jonathan Aars. It was an adaptation of written Danish, which was commonly used since the past union with Denmark, to the Dano-Norwegian koiné spoken by the Norwegian urban elite, especially in the capital. When the large conservative newspaper \"Aftenposten\" adopted the 1907 orthography in 1923, Danish writing was practically out of use in Norway. The name \"Bokmål\" was officially adopted in 1929 after a proposition to call the written language \"Dano-Norwegian\" lost by a single vote in the Lagting (a chamber in the Norwegian parliament).\n\nThe government does not regulate \"spoken\" Bokmål and recommends that normalised pronunciation should follow the phonology of the speaker's local dialect. Nevertheless, there is a spoken variety of Norwegian that, in the region of South-Eastern Norway, is commonly seen as the \"de facto\" standard for spoken Bokmål. In \"The Phonology of Norwegian\", Gjert Kristoffersen writes that\n\nStandard Østnorsk (Standard East Norwegian) is the pronunciation most commonly given in dictionaries and taught to foreigners in Norwegian language classes. Standard Østnorsk as a spoken language is not used and does not have any particular prestige outside South-Eastern Norway. All spoken variations of the Norwegian language are used e.g. in the Storting and in Norwegian national broadcasters such as NRK and TV 2, even in cases where the conventions of Bokmål are used. The spoken variation typically reflects the region the person grew up in.\n\nUp until about 1300, the written language of Norway, Old Norwegian, was essentially the same as the other Old Norse dialects. The speech, however, was gradually differentiated into local and regional dialects. As long as Norway remained an independent kingdom, the written language remained essentially constant.\n\nIn 1380, Norway entered into a personal union with Denmark. By the early 16th century, Norway had lost its separate political institutions, and together with Denmark formed the political unit known as Denmark–Norway until 1814, progressively becoming the weaker member of the union. During this period, the modern Danish and Norwegian languages emerged. Norwegian went through a Middle Norwegian transition, and a Danish written language more heavily influenced by Low German was gradually standardised. This process was aided by the Reformation, which prompted Christiern Pedersen's translation of the Bible into Danish. Remnants of written Old Norse and Norwegian were thus displaced by the Danish standard, which became used for virtually all administrative documents. \n\nNorwegians used Danish primarily in writing, but it gradually came to be spoken by urban elites on formal or official occasions. Although Danish never became the spoken language of the vast majority of the population, by the time Norway's ties with Denmark were severed in 1814, a Dano-Norwegian vernacular often called the \"educated daily speech\" had become the mother tongue of elites in most Norwegian cities, such as Bergen, Kristiania and Trondheim. This Dano-Norwegian \"koiné\" could be described as Danish with regional Norwegian pronunciation (see Norwegian dialects), some Norwegian vocabulary, and simplified grammar. \n\nWith the gradual subsequent process of Norwegianisation of the written language used in the cities of Norway, from Danish to Bokmål and Riksmål, the upper-class sociolects in the cities changed accordingly. In 1814, when Norway was ceded from Denmark to Sweden, Norway defied Sweden and her allies, declared independence and adopted a democratic constitution. Although compelled to submit to a dynastic union with Sweden, this spark of independence continued to burn, influencing the evolution of language in Norway. Old language traditions were revived by the patriotic poet Henrik Wergeland (1808–1845), who championed an independent non-Danish written language. Haugen indicates that:\n\"Within the first generation of liberty, two solutions emerged and won adherents, one based on the speech of the upper class and one on that of the common people. The former called for Norwegianisation of the Danish writing, the latter for a brand new start.\"\n\nThe more conservative of the two language transitions was advanced by the work of writers like Peter Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, schoolmaster and agitator for language reform Knud Knudsen, and Knudsen's famous disciple, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, as well as a more cautious Norwegianisation by Henrik Ibsen. In particular, Knudsen's work on language reform in the mid-19th century was important for the 1907 orthography and a subsequent reform in 1917, so much so that he is now often called the \"father of Bokmål\".\n\nThe term \"Riksmål\", meaning \"National Language\", was first proposed by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in 1899 as a name for the Norwegian variety of written Danish as well as spoken Dano-Norwegian. It was borrowed from Denmark where it denoted standard written and spoken Danish. The same year the Riksmål movement became organised under his leadership in order to fight against the growing influence of Nynorsk, eventually leading to the foundation of the non-governmental organisation Riksmålsforbundet in 1907. Bjørnson became Riksmålsforbundet's first leader until his death in 1910.\n\nThe 1917 reform introduced some elements from Norwegian dialects and Nynorsk as optional alternatives to traditional Dano-Norwegian forms. This was part of an official policy to bring the two Norwegian languages more closely together, intending eventually to merge them into one. These changes met resistance from the Riksmål movement, and \"Riksmålsvernet\" (The Society for the Protection of Riksmål) was founded in 1919.\n\nThe 1938 reform in Bokmål introduced more elements from dialects and Nynorsk, and more importantly, many traditional Dano-Norwegian forms were excluded. This so-called \"radical\" Bokmål or \"\" (Common Norwegian) met even stiffer resistance from the Riksmål movement, culminating in the 1950s under the leadership of Arnulf Øverland. Riksmålsforbundet organised a parents' campaign against Samnorsk in 1951, and the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature was founded in 1953. Because of this resistance, the 1959 reform was relatively modest, and the radical reforms were partially reverted in 1981 and 2005.\n\nCurrently, Riksmål denotes the moderate, chiefly pre-1938, unofficial variant of Bokmål, which is still in use and is regulated by the Norwegian Academy and promoted by Riksmålsforbundet. Riksmål has gone through some spelling reforms, but none as profound as the ones that shaped Bokmål. A Riksmål dictionary was published in four volumes in the period 1937 to 1957 by Riksmålsvernet, and two supplementary volumes were published in 1995 by the Norwegian Academy. After the latest Bokmål reforms, the difference between Bokmål and Riksmål have diminished and they are now comparable to American and British English differences, but the Norwegian Academy still upholds its own standard.\n\nNorway's most popular daily newspaper, \"Aftenposten\", is notable for its use of Riksmål as its standard language. Use of Riksmål is rigorously pursued, even with regard to readers' letters, which are \"translated\" into the standard.\n\nIn the Norwegian discourse, the term \"Dano-Norwegian\" is seldom used with reference to contemporary Bokmål and its spoken varieties. The nationality of the language has been a hotly debated topic, and its users and proponents have generally not been fond of the implied association with Danish (hence the neutral names \"Riksmål\" and \"Bokmål\", meaning \"state language\" and \"book language\" respectively). The debate intensified with the advent of Nynorsk in the 19th century, a written language based on rural Modern Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to the Danish and Dano-Norwegian spoken in Norwegian cities.\n\nThe following table shows a few central differences between Bokmål and Danish.\n\nMost natives of Oslo today speak a dialect that is an amalgamation of vikværsk (which is the technical term for the traditional dialects in the Oslofjord area) and written Danish; and subsequently Riksmål and Bokmål, which primarily inherited their non-Oslo elements from Danish. The present day Oslo dialect is also influenced by other Eastern Norwegian dialects.\n\nThe following table shows some important cases where traditional Bokmål and Standard Østnorsk followed Danish rather than the traditional Oslo dialect as it is commonly portrayed in literature about Norwegian dialects. In many of these cases, radical Bokmål follows the traditional Oslo dialect and Nynorsk, and these forms are also given.\n\n"}

It is a play on the phrase \"contempt of court\", and not an actual offense. The phrase is associated with unlawful arbitrary arrest and detention of individuals, often for expressing or exercising rights guaranteed to them by the United States Constitution. Contempt of cop is often discussed in connection to police misconduct such as use of excessive force or even police brutality as a reaction to perceived disrespectful behavior rather than for any legitimate law enforcement purpose.\n\nArrests for contempt of cop may stem from a type of \"occupational arrogance\" when a police officer thinks his or her authority cannot or should not be challenged or questioned.\nFrom such officers' perspective, contempt of cop may involve perceived or actual challenges to their authority, including a lack of deference (such as disobeying instructions, or expressing interest in filing a complaint against the officer). Fleeing from the police is sometimes considered a variant of contempt of cop. Contempt of cop situations may be exacerbated if other officers witness the allegedly contemptuous behavior.\n\nCharges such as disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, fleeing from police and assaulting an officer may be cited as official reasons in a contempt of cop arrest. Obstructing a police officer or failure to obey a police order is also cited in arrests in some jurisdictions, particularly as a stand-alone charge without any other charges brought.\n\nFreedom of speech is protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, so non-threatening verbal \"abuse\" of a police officer is not in itself criminal behavior, though some courts have disagreed on what constitutes protected speech in this regard.\nThe United States Supreme Court ruled in 1942 that fighting words that \"tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace\" are not protected speech, but later cases have interpreted this narrowly, especially in relation to law enforcement officers. In 2013, a federal appeals court ruled that giving the finger \"alone cannot establish probable cause to believe a disorderly conduct violation has occurred\".\n\nThe \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" conducted a study in 2008 that found that in the city of Seattle, \"African-Americans were arrested for the sole crime of obstructing eight times as often as whites when population is taken into account.\" In 2009 the New Jersey Attorney General also found a significant number of contempt of cop cases while investigating racial profiling by the New Jersey State Police, and concluded that \"improper attitude and demeanor\" of officers toward the public was a nationwide problem.\n\n\"Contempt of cop\" has been in use since the 1960s. The word \"cop\" is slang for \"police officer\"; the phrase is derived by analogy from \"contempt of court\", which, unlike contempt of cop, is an offense in many jurisdictions (e.g., California Penal Code section 166, making contempt of court a misdemeanor). Similar to this is the phrase \"disturbing the police\", a play on \"disturbing the peace\". It has also been referred to as \"flunking the attitude test\". In some areas it is called P.O.P. (for \"Pissing Off the Police\") when a suspect's demeanor influences officer's response to people. \"Leniency might be afforded to persons who treat officers with respect, whereas the heavy hand of the law is extended to persons who are disrespectful, ill mannered or rude.\"\n\nIn crime writing and works about police misconduct, it has become something of a cliché to sardonically refer to contempt of cop as the worst possible crime.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "601399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601399", "title": "Display resolution", "text": "Display resolution\n\nThe display resolution or display modes of a digital television, computer monitor or display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, flat-panel displays (including liquid-crystal displays) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.\n\nIt is usually quoted as width × height, with the units in pixels: for example, \"1024 × 768\" means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as \"ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight\" or \"ten twenty-four by seven six eight\".\n\nOne use of the term \"display resolution\" applies to fixed-pixel-array displays such as plasma display panels (PDP), liquid-crystal displays (LCD), Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors, OLED displays, and similar technologies, and is simply the physical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display (e.g. 1920 × 1080). A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that, for multi-format video inputs, all displays need a \"scaling engine\" (a digital video processor that includes a memory array) to match the incoming picture format to the display.\n\nFor device displays such as phones, tablets, monitors and televisions, the use of the word \"resolution\" as defined above is a misnomer, though common. The term \"display resolution\" is usually used to mean \"pixel dimensions,\" the number of pixels in each dimension (e.g. 1920 × 1080), which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed: resolution properly refers to the pixel density, the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not \"total\" number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be given in pixels per inch (PPI). In analog measurement, if the screen is 10 inches high, then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10 inches wide. For television standards, this is typically stated as \"lines horizontal resolution, per picture height\"; for example, analog NTSC TVs can typically display about 340 lines of \"per picture height\" horizontal resolution from over-the-air sources, which is equivalent to about 440 total lines of actual picture information from left edge to right edge.\n\nSome commentators also use display resolution to indicate a range of input formats that the display's input electronics will accept and often include formats greater than the screen's native grid size even though they have to be down-scaled to match the screen's parameters (e.g. accepting a 1920 × 1080 input on a display with a native 1366 × 768 pixel array). In the case of television inputs, many manufacturers will take the input and zoom it out to \"overscan\" the display by as much as 5% so input resolution is not necessarily display resolution. Graphics wise, the input rate of resolution only changes frame rate by a little bit (e.g. 1080p - 720p = 5f).\n\nThe eye's perception of \"display resolution\" can be affected by a number of factors see image resolution and optical resolution. One factor is the display screen's rectangular shape, which is expressed as the ratio of the physical picture width to the physical picture height. This is known as the aspect ratio. A screen's physical aspect ratio and the individual pixels' aspect ratio may not necessarily be the same. An array of 1280 × 720 on a display has square pixels, but an array of 1024 × 768 on a 16:9 display has oblong pixels.\n\nAn example of pixel shape affecting \"resolution\" or perceived sharpness: displaying more information in a smaller area using a higher resolution makes the image much clearer or \"sharper\". However, most recent screen technologies are fixed at a certain resolution; making the resolution lower on these kinds of screens will greatly decrease sharpness, as an interpolation process is used to \"fix\" the non-native resolution input into the display's native resolution output.\n\nWhile some CRT-based displays may use digital video processing that involves image scaling using memory arrays, ultimately \"display resolution\" in CRT-type displays is affected by different parameters such as spot size and focus, astigmatic effects in the display corners, the color phosphor pitch shadow mask (such as Trinitron) in color displays, and the video bandwidth.\n\nMost television display manufacturers \"overscan\" the pictures on their displays (CRTs and PDPs, LCDs etc.), so that the effective on-screen picture may be reduced from 720 × 576 (480) to 680 × 550 (450), for example. The size of the invisible area somewhat depends on the display device. HD televisions do this as well, to a similar extent.\n\nComputer displays including projectors generally do not overscan although many models (particularly CRT displays) allow it. CRT displays tend to be underscanned in stock configurations, to compensate for the increasing distortions at the corners.\n\nTelevisions are of the following resolutions:\n\n\nComputer monitors have traditionally possessed higher resolutions than most televisions.\n\n, 1024 × 768 eXtended Graphics Array was the most common display resolution. Many web sites and multimedia products were re-designed from the previous 800 × 600 format to the layouts optimized for 1024 × 768.\n\nThe availability of inexpensive LCD monitors has made the 5:4 aspect ratio resolution of 1280 × 1024 more popular for desktop usage during the first decade of the 21st century. Many computer users including CAD users, graphic artists and video game players ran their computers at 1600 × 1200 resolution (UXGA) or higher such as 2048 × 1536 QXGA if they had the necessary equipment. Other available resolutions included oversize aspects like 1400 × 1050 SXGA+ and wide aspects like 1280 × 800 WXGA, 1440 × 900 WXGA+, 1680 × 1050 WSXGA+, and 1920 × 1200 WUXGA; monitors built to the 720p and 1080p standard are also not unusual among home media and video game players, due to the perfect screen compatibility with movie and video game releases. A new more-than-HD resolution of 2560 × 1600 WQXGA was released in 30-inch LCD monitors in 2007.\n\n, 1366 × 768 was the most common display resolution.\n\nIn 2010, 27-inch LCD monitors with the 2560 × 1440-pixel resolution were released by multiple manufacturers including Apple, and in 2012, Apple introduced a 2880 × 1800 display on the MacBook Pro. Panels for professional environments, such as medical use and air traffic control, support resolutions of up to 4096 × 2160 pixels.\n\n\nWhen a computer display resolution is set higher than the physical screen resolution (\"native resolution\"), some video drivers make the virtual screen scrollable over the physical screen thus realizing a two dimensional virtual desktop with its viewport. Most LCD manufacturers do make note of the panel's native resolution as working in a non-native resolution on LCDs will result in a poorer image, due to dropping of pixels to make the image fit (when using DVI) or insufficient sampling of the analog signal (when using VGA connector). Few CRT manufacturers will quote the true native resolution, because CRTs are analog in nature and can vary their display from as low as 320 × 200 (emulation of older computers or game consoles) to as high as the internal board will allow, or the image becomes too detailed for the vacuum tube to recreate (\"i.e.\", analog blur). Thus, CRTs provide a variability in resolution that fixed resolution LCDs cannot provide.\n\nIn recent years the 16:9 aspect ratio has become more common in notebook displays. 1366 × 768 (HD) has become popular for most notebook sizes, while 1600 × 900 (HD+) and 1920 × 1080 (FHD) are available for larger notebooks.\n\nAs far as digital cinematography is concerned, video resolution standards depend first on the frames' aspect ratio in the film stock (which is usually scanned for digital intermediate post-production) and then on the actual points' count. Although there is not a unique set of standardized sizes, it is commonplace within the motion picture industry to refer to \"\"n\"K\" image \"quality\", where \"n\" is a (small, usually even) integer number which translates into a set of actual resolutions, depending on the film format. As a reference consider that, for a 4:3 (around 1.33:1) aspect ratio which a film frame (no matter what is its format) is expected to \"horizontally fit in\", \"n\" is the multiplier of 1024 such that the horizontal resolution is exactly \"1024•n\" points. For example, 2K reference resolution is 2048 × 1536 pixels, whereas 4K reference resolution is 4096 × 3072 pixels. Nevertheless, 2K may also refer to resolutions like 2048 × 1556 (full-aperture), 2048 × 1152 (HDTV, 16:9 aspect ratio) or 2048 × 872 pixels (Cinemascope, 2.35:1 aspect ratio). It is also worth noting that while a frame resolution may be, for example, 3:2 (720 × 480 NTSC), that is not what you will see on-screen (i.e. 4:3 or 16:9 depending on the orientation of the rectangular pixels).\n\nMany personal computers introduced in the late 1970s and the 1980s were designed to use television receivers as their display devices, making the resolutions dependent on the television standards in use, including PAL and NTSC. Picture sizes were usually limited to ensure the visibility of all the pixels in the major television standards and the broad range of television sets with varying amounts of over scan. The actual drawable picture area was, therefore, somewhat smaller than the whole screen, and was usually surrounded by a static-colored border (see image to right). Also, the interlace scanning was usually omitted in order to provide more stability to the picture, effectively halving the vertical resolution in progress. 160 × 200, 320 × 200 and 640 × 200 on NTSC were relatively common resolutions in the era (224, 240 or 256 scanlines were also common). In the IBM PC world, these resolutions came to be used by 16-color EGA video cards.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of using a classic television is that the computer display resolution is higher than the television could decode. Chroma resolution for NTSC/PAL televisions are bandwidth-limited to a maximum 1.5 megahertz, or approximately 160 pixels wide, which led to blurring of the color for 320- or 640-wide signals, and made text difficult to read (see second image to right). Many users upgraded to higher-quality televisions with S-Video or RGBI inputs that helped eliminate chroma blur and produce more legible displays. The earliest, lowest cost solution to the chroma problem was offered in the Atari 2600 Video Computer System and the Apple II+, both of which offered the option to disable the color and view a legacy black-and-white signal. On the Commodore 64, the GEOS mirrored the Mac OS method of using black-and-white to improve readability.\n\nThe 640 × 400i resolution (720 × 480i with borders disabled) was first introduced by home computers such as the Commodore Amiga and, later, Atari Falcon. These computers used interlace to boost the maximum vertical resolution. These modes were only suited to graphics or gaming, as the flickering interlace made reading text in word processor, database, or spreadsheet software difficult. (Modern game consoles solve this problem by pre-filtering the 480i video to a lower resolution. For example, Final Fantasy XII suffers from flicker when the filter is turned off, but stabilizes once filtering is restored. The computers of the 1980s lacked sufficient power to run similar filtering software.)\n\nThe advantage of a 720 × 480i overscanned computer was an easy interface with interlaced TV production, leading to the development of Newtek's Video Toaster. This device allowed Amigas to be used for CGI creation in various news departments (example: weather overlays), drama programs such as NBC's \"seaQuest\", The WB's \"Babylon 5\", and early computer-generated animation by Disney for \"The Little Mermaid\", \"Beauty and the Beast\", and \"Aladdin\".\n\nIn the PC world, the IBM PS/2 VGA (multi-color) on-board graphics chips used a non-interlaced (progressive) 640 × 480 × 16 color resolution that was easier to read and thus more useful for office work. It was the standard resolution from 1990 to around 1996. The standard resolution was 800 × 600 until around 2000. Microsoft Windows XP, released in 2001, was designed to run at 800 × 600 minimum, although it is possible to select the original 640 × 480 in the Advanced Settings window.\n\nPrograms designed to mimic older hardware such as Atari, Sega, or Nintendo game consoles (emulators) when attached to multiscan CRTs, routinely use much lower resolutions, such as 160 × 200 or 320 × 400 for greater authenticity, though other emulators have taken advantage of pixelation recognition on circle, square, triangle and other geometric features on a lesser resolution for a more scaled vector rendering.\n\nThe list of common display resolutions article lists the most commonly used display resolutions for computer graphics, television, films, and video conferencing.\n\n"}
{"id": "27152577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27152577", "title": "Emil Isac", "text": "Emil Isac\n\nEmil Isac (; May 27, 1886 – March 25, 1954) was an Austro-Hungarian-born Romanian poet, dramatist, short story writer and critic. Noted as one of the pioneers of Symbolism and modernist literature in his native region of Transylvania, he was in tandem one of the leading young voices of the Symbolist movement in the neighboring Kingdom of Romania. Moving from prose poems with cosmopolitan traits, fusing Neo-romantic subjects with modernist free verse, he later created a lyrical discourse in the line of Social Realism. Isac was likewise known for criticizing traditionalist and nationalist trends in local literature, but, by the end of World War I, opened his own poetry to various traditionalist influences.\n\nIsac was a participant in civic or political causes, defending the rights of ethnic Romanians in Austria–Hungary from a socialist position, and, during the 1918 union with Romania, served as a community representative. He was however interested in preserving good relations between his ethnic group and the Hungarians. An occasional contributor to Hungarian-language reviews, he reached out over political divides, maintaining close contacts with Hungarian intellectuals such as Endre Ady, Oszkár Jászi, János Thorma and Aladár Kuncz.\n\nDuring the final part of his career, which was spent in Communist Romania, Emil Isac was affiliated with \"Steaua\" magazine and enjoyed political endorsement. In this context, he took the controversial decision of adapting his style to Socialist Realism, producing a number of political poems which doubled as agitprop.\n\nA native of Cluj-Napoca (\"Kolozsvár\") city in Transylvania, the future writer was born to ethnic Romanian parents: his father, Aurel Isac, was a lawyer, later noted for representing the Romanian civil disobedience \"Memorandum\" movement, after it was prosecuted by the Hungarian authorities; his mother, Elisabeta-Eliza née Roşescu, was a schoolteacher. As the poet later recalled in a tongue-in-cheek memoir of his childhood: \"I was born in Cluj, when the Someş was boiling with blood and my father reaped the flowers of pain [...]. I came around when called upon by my mother—and the priest baptized me in \"Eau de Cologne\", or blood, or tears, or holy water—and my godfather wanted to give me the name Alfred, for he loved Musset, but my father gave me the name , since he loved Rousseau.\"\n\nFrom a young age, Isac was an avid reader. As he later recalled, he found an optimistic faith in science after being introduced to Jules Verne's popular novels. He began his education in German, attending a Transylvanian Evangelical Church school in his native city, and later (1895–1901) a Hungarian-language Catholic school run by the Piarists. Isac was eventually moved to Năsăud (\"Naszód\"), at a military academy for the Romanian border regiment in Austro-Hungarian service (1902–1904), but, in 1907, took his \"Matura\" at the Hungarian Lycée in Sibiu (\"Nagyszeben\"). In the meantime, he made his debut in literature. His first published piece was a 1902 essay on the life and work of Romantic poet Vasile Alecsandri, published in Hungarian by \"Ellenzék\" magazine.\n\nIt was followed a year later by his Hungarian-language translation of two poems, collected from Romanian folklore and printed by the local periodical \"Koloszvári Friss Ujság\" under the pen name \"Emisac\". Also in 1903, Isac made his second debut, in Romanian, with \"La umbra plopilor\" (\"In the Shadow of Poplar Trees\"), a poem published by the Transylvanian literary venue \"Familia\". He was later a member of \"Familia\"s editorial staff, where, in March 1905, he wrote Jules Verne's obituary. Over time, his other contributions were featured in such Transylvanian Romanian periodicals as \"Cele Trei Crişuri\", \"Gazeta de Transilvania\" and \"Tribuna\".\n\nEmil Isac's editorial debut came in 1908, with the lyric poetry collection \"Poezii. Impresii şi senzaţii moderne\" (\"Poems. Modern Impressions and Sensations\"). The work attracted attention from critics, in both the Romanian-speaking areas of the Austro-Hungarian realm and the bordering Kingdom of Romania: Sever Dan in Transylvania and Mihail Dragomirescu in Bucharest both reviewed it for the cultural press. Its rejection of convention was hotly contested by the tribune of Transylvanian traditionalism, \"Ţara Noastră\": it called Isac a \"bane\" for his generation and a \"political traitor\", referring to his lyrics as \"babblings\".\n\nIn 1910, Isac took a degree in law from the Franz Joseph University. It was during this episode that he met the modern Hungarian writer Aladár Kuncz, who was his lifelong friend. Isac's own affiliation with Symbolism was facilitated by a voyage to France, where he observed first-hand the impact of artistic innovation. Reportedly, in 1912, Isac also traveled to study in the German Empire, intending to get a masters' degree in Berlin.\n\nLike his father before him, Emil Isac became interested in advancing the cause of Romanians throughout Transleithania (the regions administered directly from Budapest). This nationalist militancy merged with his advocacy of left-wing causes, leading him to become a member of the Transylvanian Social Democratic Party. After 1911, he was in correspondence with the Romanian National Party activist Vasile Goldiş. The young poet was a frequent traveler into the Romanian Kingdom, and he contributed to periodicals of various cultural and political interests which were published there. His work was thus featured in leftist newspapers and reviews, among them \"Adevărul Literar şi Artistic\", \"Dimineaţa\", \"Facla\", \"România Muncitoare\", but was also hosted by mainstream or even traditionalist media (\"Sămănătorul\", \"Universul\"). Making his acquaintance with Romania's Symbolist trend, Isac also contributed to periodicals which either tolerated or promoted artistic innovation, among them \"Noua Revistă Română\", \"Rampa\", \"Seara\", \"Versuri şi Proză\" and \"Vieaţa Nouă\".\n\nIsac became a personal friend of \"Vieaţa Nouă\" editor, the Symbolist promoter and philologist Ovid Densusianu. The latter referred to his pupil as \"Transylvania's talented poet\", which perplexed the anti-Symbolist critic Ilarie Chendi; Chendi contrarly claimed that Isac was \"made famous by frivolous people\". Emil Isac's later memoirs describe in some detail Densusianu's dandy habits and generosity, which the academic kept as a standard even as he was facing material ruin, and note that such efforts accounted for Denusianu being ostensibly \"weighed down\", \"impoverished\", \"submerged in thoughts\".\n\nAlthough involved in such projects, Emil Isac spend the pre-World War I years building bridges with members of the ethnic Hungarian elite in Transylvania and beyond. He maintained personal contacts with opinion leaders, among them poets Endre Ady, Mihály Babits, Dezső Kosztolányi, and painter János Thorma. Following his interest in Hungarian culture, Isac was one of the Romanians who maintained connections with the influential Hungarian-language review \"Nyugat\", which was at the time equally interested in chronicling Romanian literature. Writing in 1913, Ignotus, \"Nyugat\" editor and leading cultural critic, defended the political participation of non-Hungarian communities, commending both Isac and the traditionalist Romanian poet Octavian Goga for their resistance to Magyarization.\n\nWhile Goga, defended by Endre Ady during his political imprisonment of 1912, soon disappointed the group with his antisemitic rhetoric and his uncompromising stance, Isac remained close to the liberal or left-wing Hungarian circles. After witnessing the end of Goga's friendship with Ady, he was himself involved in a conflict with the former's radical approach, arguing that people \"on both sides\" needed \"to evaluate, without prejudice, their own blemishes and virtues\". Around 1912, Isac was working with Kuncz on a trans-communal theatrical project: the staging of Ady's \"A műhelyben\" (\"In the Workshop\") by a theater in Bucharest, to coincide with the Budapest performance of plays by Isac and the prestigious comedy author Ion Luca Caragiale. The project was abandoned, probably because of Caragiale's sudden death in Berlin.\n\nIn April of that year, Emil Isac also joined the circle formed around Ion Minulescu and his rebelliously Symbolist magazine, the Bucharest-based \"Insula\". By the same time, the young poet was entering another polemic with the more traditionalist wing of Romania's intellectual movement, represented at the time by historian and literary theorist Nicolae Iorga, former editor of the nationalist tribune \"Sămănătorul\". In 1912, he became a contributor to the short-lived Symbolist review \"Simbolul\", issued in Bucharest by the high school students Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janco and Ion Vinea (all of whom were later avant-garde figures). It was there that Isac published satire specifically aimed at Iorga's group. Those articles where he specifically targeted Iorga's principles enlisted a negative response from \"Consânzeana\", the Orăştie-based review of Romanian Orthodox priest Ioan Moţa (it called Isac \"Don Quijote de la Cluj\", \"the Don Quixote of Cluj\").\n\nMeanwhile, Isac's articles continued to champion mutual respect between Hungarian and Romanian intellectuals: a letter defending Ady in his dispute with Goga saw print in Ady's \"Világ\" review (February 1913), and another one, to Ignotus, was published in \"Nyugat\" as \"Az új magyar irodalom\" (\"The New Hungarian Literature\"); the same year, \"Nyugat\" also received his \"Új románság\" (\"New Romanians\") essay, in which Isac claimed that the two communities had a common interest in resisting the threat of Pan-Slavism. A year later, at the buildup to World War I, \"Nyugat\" published Isac's review of Goga's political play \"Mr. the Notary\", his sympathetic obituary to the neutralist King Carol I of Romania, and his \"A román-magyar béke\" (\"The Romanian-Hungarian Peace\"), which optimistically argued that the policies of István Tisza could limit dangerous distrust between the two sides in question. The same journal published Isac's one-page-long sketch story, \"A szerecsen\" (\"The Moor\").\n\nEarly during the war, Isac was carrying on with his literary work in the Romanian Kingdom, which still pursued a neutrality policy before joining the Entente Powers in summer 1916 (\"see Romania during World War I\"). During that interval, he again outraged the traditionalist public, when his dramolet \"Maica cea tânără\" (\"The Young Nun\"), questioning the Romanian Orthodox view of monastery life, was staged by the National Theater Bucharest (1914). His second volume, comprising prose poems, was issued in and dedicated to his native region: \"Ardealule, Ardealule bătrân\" (\"Transylvania, Old Transylvania\"), published in 1916 by the Orthodox Diocese of Arad. Isac also contributed his texts to \"Cronica\", a literary and political magazine published in Bucharest by Symbolist poet Tudor Arghezi; this review was later criticized by the mainstream politicians as a venue for collaborationists and Germanophiles. Among the other magazines who received his contributions was the Symbolist tribune \"Absolutio\", published in Iaşi by the Arghezian disciple Isac Ludo.\n\nBy 1918, Isac was seeking to obtain an amicable solution to the ethnic conflicts rekindled by the war, in the context of Austria–Hungary's dissolution, the Aster Revolution, and the advent of a Hungarian Democratic Republic. As early as 1917, Isac signed an open letter, published by \"Világ\", in which he rallied with pacifist thinker Oszkár Jászi (who became Minister of Nationalities in the Aster Revolution), arguing: \"For us of the [other] nationalities your name in recent months has sounded like a reassuring chime of bells, your name has signified to us vigorous defense, and through your writings democratic Hungary has made its voice heard.\" Historian György Litván notes that this was the type of messages motivating Jászi to \"stubbornly\" believe that his Danubian Confederation projects could win support from all sides, even though other reactions were already showing their practical limitations and their unpopularity.\n\nIn the end, Isac opted to throw his support behind the unionist movement. He attended the 9th Social Democratic Congress, and was elected a representative to the Alba Iulia assembly. There, on December 1, the Romanian socialist clubs, together with the Romanian National Party and the various other civic forces, demanded the union with Romania (\"see Great Union Day\"). According to fellow socialist Tiron Albani, Isac first sparked disagreements within the unionist gathering, after endorsing proposals that the Romanian Kingdom become a republic in exchange for union. Isac's controversial address to his peers, as cited by Grapini, stresses: \"a quarter of an hour ago you have approved of the resolution [to uphold civil liberties]. Now you are revolted that a human idea is being expressed. Today, when three emperors have been ejected and their crowns hurled back at them! Would you be more consistent! [...] a king may well be good and wise, but he may also be a tyrant, and he'll still be king\". In the end, the socialist delegation renounced its republican aims, placated by a resolution to ensure land reform and workers' rights throughout the resulting nation.\n\nIn 1919, as the act of union was being assessed by foreign powers, Isac represented the Romanian lobby as a press attaché in Geneva, Switzerland. Back in Cluj, Isac entered Romanian government service as superintendent of Transylvanian and Banat theaters (an office he kept from 1920 to 1940). He helped set up the Cluj branch of the Romanian Writers' Society (of which he was already a member by that time). His cultural activity in Greater Romania was rewarded with two civil decorations: he was made a Knight of the Romanian Order of the Crown and received the \"Ordinul Cultural\" medal, First Class.\n\nAnother focus of Isac's political activity was mediating a Hungarian–Romanian reconciliation, both before and after the 1919 military conflict, while reaching out to both Hungarians in Hungary and the Hungarian community in Romania. As noted by literary historians John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope, Isac was one of the Romanian authors who could combine a nationalist outlook with respect for minority cultures: in his articles for the Bucharest-based \"Ideea Europeană\" magazine and the Hungarian \"Napkelet\" of Cluj, he demanded equal cultural rights for all of Greater Romania's communities. His call to the \"great masses\" of Romanians and Hungarians, read: \"There is only one possible politics in Romania: the politics of true democracy. By its very nature such politics safeguards the rights of everybody, [including] Hungarians, who lead today an isolated life in Transylvania. [...] it is the duty of Romanian writers to initiate divorce proceedings from the negative traditions\".\n\nIn his other political articles, Isac notably expressed his alarm at seeing the Regency regime take shape in post-Trianon Hungary, writing that the exiled Oszkár Jászi was preferable as national leader to the authoritarian Miklós Horthy. He gave a positive review to Jászi's renewed campaigning in favor of a Danubian Confederation to replace competing nation states, but argued that there was little prospect of \"today's generation\", in both Romania and Hungary, to endorse the project. Answering to this objection, Jászi himself suggested that Isac take into consideration the creation of a Danubian cultural Alliance, with \"civilized\" representatives from Hungary, Romania, the Czechoslovak Republic and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Isac, György Litván notes, remained evasive, and, even as Jászi was facing much criticism from partisans of Hungarian ethnic nationalism, as well as from Romanian advocates of centralism, refused to help Jászi and his associate Pál Szende tour the Transylvanian conference circuit.\n\nIsac's return to the forefront of literary debates was consecrated in 1919, when, in an interview for \"Rampa\", he discussed \"Transylvania's role\" in Romanian culture. In August of that year, modernist literary theorist and reviewer Eugen Lovinescu wrote the article \"Emil Isac redivivus!\" (\"Emil Isac Brought Back to Life!\"), published by his \"Sburătorul\" magazine. In the same context, Isac sparked debates by commenting negatively on \"Poemele luminii\", the debut volume of fellow Transylvanian poet Lucian Blaga (his reaction was notably received with irony by poet-critic Artur Enăşescu and his colleagues at \"Junimea de Nord\" magazine in Botoşani). Three years later, Isac's Symbolist colleague Davidescu reviewed his entire work in the critical essay \"Poezia d-lui Emil Isac\" (\"Mr. Emil Isac's Poetry\"), contributed for a November 1922 issue of \"Flacăra\" journal. For part of that decade, Isac was close to Cezar Petrescu's Cluj-based literary review \"Gândirea\", whose agenda was a distinct mix of traditionalism and modernism, and who later alienated its modernist contributors by switching to fascism. He was also an occasional contributor to Ion Vinea's avant-garde venue, \"Contimporanul\".\n\nIn parallel, the poet was pursuing his interest in visual arts, and especially involved in the professionalization of Transylvania's art scene. To this goal, he joined Aurel Popp, George Bacaloglu and János Thorma in setting up the \"Collegium Artificum Transilvanicorum\", an art salon where artists of all trades and ethnicities could exhibit their work (February 1921). From 1925 to 1931, he was also a Professor of Aesthetics at the newly founded Fine Arts School of Cluj, and as such a faculty colleague of several influential figures in 20th century Romanian art theory, painters (Catul Bogdan, Aurel Ciupe, Anastase Demian, Romulus Ladea, Eugen Pascu, Alexandru Popp) as well as intellectuals (historian Coriolan Petreanu, critics Liviu Rusu and Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică).\n\nAround 1926, he was co-opted as a contributor by the venue of ASTRA Society, \"Transilvania\": it published one of Isac's poems and the text of his public lecture \"Propaganda artistică\" (\"Art Propaganda\"). As superintendent of the theaters and cultural activist, Isac also participated, with journalist Ion Clopoţel, on a major cultural reunion of Hungarian, Transylvanian Saxon and Romanian authors (November 1928); other noted participants were Miklós Bánffy, Mária Berde, Egon Hajek, Sándor Makkai, Adolf Meschendörfer, Károly Molter and Heinrich Zillich.\n\nDuring the interwar period, Emil Isac published several new volumes of poetry and prose, beginning with \"Poeme în proză\" (\"Prose Poems\", Oradea, 1923), and followed by two books of articles and essays, both printed in 1925 under the auspices of the Arad Diocese: \"Cartea unui om\" (\"A Man's Book\") and \"Notiţele mele\" (\"My Little Notes\"). The writer also issued a print version of \"Maica cea tânără\" (Cluj, 1931), and two volumes of collected poems, published in 1936 by, respectively, Cartea Românească publishing house and the eponymous publishing company of \"Adevărul\" newspaper. These various works kept Isac in the focus of critical attention. Reviews were notably written by: Ovid Densusianu, Claudia Millian and Camil Petrescu (\"Poeme în proză\"); Romulus Dianu and Perpessicius (\"Cartea unui om\", \"Notiţele mele\"); Tudor Bugnariu, Alexandru Al. Philippide and Eugeniu Sperantia (the other poetry volumes). In 1928, Isac was also interviewed by short story author I. Valerian, their dialogues seeing print in \"Viaţa Literară\" magazine, with the general title \"Un precursor al poeziei moderniste. De vorbă cu d. Emil Isac\" (\"A Precursor of Modernist Poetry. In Conversation with Mr. Emil Isac\"). Five years later, the same venue hosted Isac's conversation with cultural journalist Octavian Şireagu: \"Cu d. Emil Isac despre critici şi modernişti\" (\"With Mr. Emil Isac on Critics and Modernists\"). Several other such interviews followed, including a 1936 \"Adevărul\" piece where he was engaged by George Macovescu, the leftist activist, in a conversation about \"poetry, theater [and] peace\". Isac's own leftist views led him to contribute articles for the pro-socialist newspaper \"Cuvântul Liber\".\n\nDuring World War II and after the cession of Northern Transylvania to Hungary, Isac left Cluj for the part of the country still controlled by Bucharest. He made his return to Cluj some time after the August 23, 1944 Coup which toppled the authoritarian Ion Antonescu regime, aligned Romania with the Allies, and initiated the recovery of Northern Transylvania (\"see Romania during World War II\"). Literary historians note that he subsequently became, with Lucian Blaga and Ion Agârbiceanu, one of the most important Romanian writers to continue residing in that city after 1945. In 1946, poet Miron Radu Paraschivescu, who had already published a review of Isac's lifelong contributions in \"Timpul\" newspaper (1942), supervised the publication of his integral edition, \"Opere\" (\"Works\"). The following year, Hungarian versions of some of his poems were included in the anthology \"Mai román lira\" (\"Modern Romanian Verse\"), published in Budapest.\n\nDuring the political transition ending with the establishment of a Romanian communist regime, Emil Isac adapted his literary and political stances to the new ideological requirements, sparking negative comments in later exegesis with his effective endorsement of a totalitarian state. His cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party and his endorsement of Romania's political alignment with the Soviet Union resulted in his collaboration on \"Veac Nou\", official newspaper of the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union. Of the Cluj writers, he and Agârbiceanu became associates of the communists, while Blaga resisted such advances and was censored. Both of them, however, were for a while equally unsuccessful in setting up new Romanian-language cultural reviews: their projects were rejected by the communist authorities, who would only allow the existence of a Hungarian venue (\"Utunk\") and literary supplements in local newspapers (such as \"Almanahul Literar\", which was published together with \"Lupta Ardealului\").\n\nAlthough not enlisted in the ruling Communist Party—or, as it styled itself at the time, the Workers' Party, PMR—Isac also received \"Ordinul Muncii\" medal, the regime's recognition of social or cultural importance. In 1948, he became a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. Nevertheless, Neubauer suggests, Isac and the entire Transylvanian generation had by then lost their cultural importance: \"Some of the survivors still had a minor career after the war, in Transylvania or beyond it, but the most creative and hopeful years of the generation died with the [world] war.\"\n\nIsac was affiliated with \"Almanahul Literar\" before 1949, when it was redesigned as \"Steaua\" monthly (for long still the only Romanian-language literary periodical published in Cluj). His contributions reflected the politicized editorial line, especially by endorsing the personality cult of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin: his poem \"Scrisoare către Stalin\" (\"A Letter to Stalin\") opened the very first issue of \"Steaua\", and another such piece, \"Slavă nemuritorului Stalin\" (\"Glory to the Immortal Stalin\"), was hosted by the review upon Stalin's 1953 death.\n\nIn 1951, Isac was part of \"Steaua\" jury presided upon by poet Anatol E. Baconsky, awarding the magazine's annual prize to a high school student by the name of Ion Motoarcă. They were thus the unwitting subjects of a prank, played on them by the anti-communist poet and Sibiu Literary Circle member Ştefan Augustin Doinaş: waging that he could write poetry better poetry than those authors promoted by the regime, and probably enticed by the prospect of financial gain, Doinaş had agreed to hide his parodic contributions under Motoarcă's signature.\n\nEmil Isac died in March 1954, in Cluj. Some of his final works were published later that year: the Workers' Youth organ \"Scînteia Tineretului\" featured three pages of his posthumous poetry. The PMR voice, \"Scînteia\", hosted an article signed by communist poet laureate Mihai Beniuc, and similar posthumous homage pieces were published by Ion Brad, Cezar Petrescu, Veronica Porumbacu and, at an Eastern Bloc level, Hungarian author Károly Molter (in both \"Igaz Szó\" and \"Literárni Noviny\"). In 1957, the same venue published his final text for the stage, \"Domnul Million\" (\"Mr. Million\").\n\nEmil Isac's contribution to the development of modernist literature in Romanian-speaking areas was pioneering: deemed \"the first 'modernist' Transylvanian poet\" by critic Gheorghe Grigurcu, he was also called \"a [Symbolist] exception on the other side of the Carpathians\" by literary historian Paul Cernat. Reviewing his own political battles, the poet identified such support for innovation with the rejection of isolationism: \"I write these words, these consoled, gentle, tired words, after a violent campaign. And I am tranquil when noting that I was right after all, in maintaining that, to us Romanians, modernism is the only force that may lead to a victory. [...] The world is not aware of us, because our nationalism has sealed us hermetically in front of all propitious influences.\"\n\nIsac's trademark contribution to the development of Romania's Symbolist movement was his work in the prose poem genre, with exotic reveries borrowing from a cosmopolitan model set in English literature by Oscar Wilde. In general, literary historian George Călinescu notes, these pieces are \"willingly grandiloquent and egolatrous, often ending with a pun\". According to Călinescu, they merged in style with Isac's various satirical articles, the latter of which make use of techniques similar to those employed by writer and humorist Tudor Arghezi, but display original \"Rococo\" touches. Isac's basic humorous technique, the critic notes, was one where \"the most humble occurencies are eerily detached\", such as in depicting a Japanese man's visit to Cluj: \"But what is it you're looking for, child of Dai-Nipon, with your typhoon-like soul, here in our home?\" Similarly, the \"Nyugat\" piece \"A szerecsen\" delves into racial stereotypes, discussing the perception of Black men as sex symbols. In one of his \"Vieaţa Nouă\" essays, published in 1911 to the irritation of Ilarie Chendi, Isac aimed to prove that Transylvanians were \"demagogues\"—this thesis quoted liberally from philosophers such as Desiderius Erasmus, Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nAnother product of this creative period was his main contribution to \"Simbolul\", the faux memoir piece \"Protopopii familiei mele\" (\"My Family's Protopopes\"). The piece was reviewed by literary historians as a relevant step in Symbolism's mutation into the avant-garde. Paul Cernat, who notes its similarity to the prose poetry of absurdist cult hero Urmuz, defines it as \"a very modern playful-ironic and imaginative-parodic piece\". The text is Isac's answer to political attacks, and indirectly evidences his solidarity with the Jewish-Romanian community. Cernat sees in it: \"[Isac's] answers to antisemitic insinuations made by the nationalist publications, intrigued by the [Jewish] resonance of his name.\" Swedish researcher Tom Sandqvist, who finds the implication of solidarity with the Romanian Jews \"quite remarkable\", also argues: \"The story is also explicitly aimed against Nicolae Iorga and his anti-Semitism, telling how Iorga—obviously—has written that the narrator Emil Isac's omitting to properly pay homage to the great historian and philosopher Nicolae Iorga is due to the simple fact that Isac is a Jew.\" Written as the short biography of a \"decadent joker\" in relation to his extended family, \"Protopopii familiei mele\" shows its protagonist being visited at his deathbed by some unusually long-living Orthodox clergymen, who present him with absurd gifts.\n\nLike many other Romanian Symbolists, from Eugeniu Ştefănescu-Est and Ion Minulescu to N. Davidescu, George Bacovia and D. Iacobescu, Isac made a point of using free verse to as a way of airing ideological differences, and, according to critic Vladimir Streinu, \"cultivated literary scandal either in macabre or immoral motifs, or in a meter that defied all norms\". Alternating free verse with more conventional forms (he was among the few affiliates of the movement to still appreciate the traditional metrical foot), his Symbolist poetry is defined by Călinescu as a compilation of elements borrowed from poets based in the Kingdom of Romania: Minulescu (in his descriptions of furnished interiors) and Bacovia (the \"heart rending\" ambiance and the references to musical instruments). According to the same author, Isac viewed his sources in the manner of a Renaissance humanist and \"Vlach\" author in his relation to Protestant Reformation. Together with the Minulescian or Bacovian elements, the Transylvanian author's poetry followed the other conventions of the Symbolist epoch, from depictions of the autumnal landscapes or everyday tragedies (the burial of an Anglican priest's daughter) to elements which, Călinescu notes, suggest a \"tendency of transfiguring the real\" (for instance, the ocean life trapped inside a jar, or a waiter's flight to Mars).\n\nOne particular trait of Isac's poetic universe is his preference for strong chromatic contrasts. Călinescu, who notes this \"pictorial aspect\" (and likens it to poster art), supports his interpretation with the fragment from one of Isac's poems:\nDiscussing the Symbolists' overall appreciation of \"synesthesic\" epithets, scholar Carmen Nicolescu writes about Isac's particular reference to the color white when suggesting suffocation:\n\"Maica cea tânără\", a one-act verse drama called \"neo-romantic dramolet\" by Călinescu, shows an Orthodox nun committing murder against the bride of her former lover. Călinescu primarily notes the play for illustrating in dramatic form Isac's generic poetic principles, in particular his use of visual elements such as color clashes.\n\nA second stage in Isac's career came with the reorienting toward certain traditionalist subjects, in particular by taking inspiration from his rival Octavian Goga, the leading voice of Transylvanian traditionalism. Like Goga and other voices in Transylvania, he wrote verse shaped by the influence of Mihai Eminescu, the national poet and mentor of all traditionalist sub-currents. According to John Neubauer and Marcel Cornis-Pope, Isac's interwar career exemplified one of the two schools in Transylvania's Romanian-language poetry: to the current of Emil Giugiuca and other poets inspired by George Coşbuc's elegiac tone, Isac and Aron Cotruş opposed a neo-romantic and \"prophetic\" attitude borrowed from Goga. While, in Cotruş's case, this came as an ethno-nationalist discourse about \"the ethnic and social battles of the Romanians\", Isac \"combined social realism with Symbolism, offering dramatic-grotesque descriptions of Transylvanian rural and city culture, and depictions of the poet's existential isolation.\"\n\nThe traditionalist elements in Isac's writings were inventoried by George Călinescu. He suggested that the poet merged Goga's \"grief\" with elements of social protest (\"pale workers gathering at the sound of a siren, orphaned children of the \"moţi\"\") and even imagery related to that of devotional Romanian Orthodox (\"Orthodoxist\") poets. Another significant trait of his modernist synthesis is, according to Grigurcu, the \"air of confrontation between peasant 'health' and the 'decadent' temptation\".\n\nThis aspect of Isac's career notably produced lyrics expressing his intense love for the place of his birth:\nThe final part of Isac's career was marked by the politicization of his writing, in line with Socialist Realism and its Romanian literary avatar. His poetry pieces for \"Veac Nou\" are seen by academic Letiţia Constantin as evidence that Isac had a satisfactory political background from the communist point of view. Constantin describes them as agitprop pieces, stylistically \"pastiches\" of Soviet poetry. The importance Isac had for the new literary mainstream, shaped in the 1950s by censorship and waves of political repression, was underlined by communist poet Dan Deşliu in a 1956 report for the Writers' Union of Romania: \"after World War I and especially in the period of our country's fascization, [...] the flame of poetry continued to burn, lighting the way of tomorrow. With different intensities, its rays are the creation of poets who have long since entered Romanian literary history, such as: G. Topîrceanu, A. Toma, Emil Isac, G. Bacovia or maestro Tudor Arghezi, whom we presently take joy in counting among the active members in our ranks\".\n\nThe contextual relevancy of Isac's lyrical tributes to Joseph Stalin was assessed by literary historians such as Diana Câmpean and Mariana Gorczyca, who researched the impact of communization on the various literary magazines of the 1950s and '60s. In Câmpean's view, \"Scrisoare către Stalin\" as one of the signs that \"Steaua\" was \"tributary to proletkult demands\", as a package for the other content, which was more focused on the \"actual\" and \"valuable\" elements in Romanian literature (from the celebration of its dead classics to the recovery of non-political voices such as Blaga). According to Gorczyca, Isac's 1949 poem, together with similar ones by Ion Brad, Victor Felea and Miron Radu Paraschivescu, illustrates the \"embarrassing obedience\" to a political line imposed on writers by the country's officials. To underline its circumstantial nature, she notes that the \"Steaua\" of the mid 1960s (that is, during De-Stalinization) replaced its cult of Stalin with that of Vladimir Lenin, and afterwards dropped most politicized content. In autumn 1953, as Anatol E. Baconsky was facing a political investigation for having opened \"Steaua\" to non-political content, official critic Mihu Dragomir suggested that \"maestro Emil Isac\"'s contributions were a good poetic standard to follow, urging Baconsky to again endorse it.\n\nSeveral literary historians and critics have described the impact of Emil Isac's contributions in the work of other authors, beginning with those elements which were transferred into Adrian Maniu's modernist poetry (in particular, Călinescu notes, the \"pictorial\" quality the two shared). Among the young Symbolists outside Transylvania, Isac also found a follower in the Moldavian-born poet Benjamin Fondane (Fundoianu), who mentioned his importance as a literary guide in several of his early articles for the cultural press. Outside this context, Isac was the target of two epigrams by Cincinat Pavelescu (a poet who attended Symbolist circles): connecting his visit to Berlin with Ion Luca Caragiale's death in the same city, they mockingly assert that Caragiale would rather die than have to greet the young poet.\n\nIsac's early commitment to radical and cosmopolitan aesthetics, generally perceived as alien by his more nationalist colleagues in Transylvania, left few traces in Isac's native region before World War I. However, through his eventual synthesis of modernism and traditionalism, Isac is credited with having created a school of Transylvanian poets, whose careers spanned the 20th century. This was in particular noted by Călinescu, who found that Isac's \"prosaic, abrupt\" use of poetic language had been assimilated, alongside echoes from Walt Whitman and Russian Symbolism, into the early works of Aron Cotruş. Likewise, researcher Carmina Tămăzlăcaru speaks of Cotruş's poems as being in the line of Goga and Isac, but modifying it through the adoption of Expressionism.\n\nAccording to Gheorghe Grigurcu, Isac's poetic language made possible the development of a \"cosmic perspective\" in Transylvanian poetry, adopted by the traditionalist-modernist \"Gândirea\" contributor Lucian Blaga, and later by \"Steaua\" poet Aurel Rău. The links between Isac and Blaga had earlier been noted by Călinescu, who suggested that the innovative elements in \"Maica cea tânără\" already announce the \"stylized iconography\" of Blaga's works for the stage, \"which is in effect a Transylvanian perspective on things\". Gigurcu also notes that Isac's influence in Maramureş was eventually reflected in the poems of Gheorghe Pârja, in what concerns their common view of the rural-urban confrontation.\n\nEmil Isac's work was published in several new editions during the decades after his death. Such volumes enlisted contributions from several authors and critics of the day: Ion Brad, Veronica Porumbacu, György Rába, Elemér Jancsó, Mircea Zaciu, Mircea Tomuş, Ion Oarcăsu, Leon Baconsky, Dumitru Micu, Constantin Ciopraga etc. His contributions were gathered into a definitive Hungarian-language translation, printed in Bucharest in 1962, while his correspondence with Hungarian intellectuals was issued as Hungarian-language magazines and separate volumes, in both Romania and Hungary. His various poems were included into several anthologies of Romanian poetry, or published individually, in Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Soviet Union (Russian SFSR, Armenian SSR), and the United Kingdom.\n\nIsac's name was assigned to an avenue in Cluj, and his family home, located on that road, was opened as a memorial museum in 1955. The poet was survived by his son, Dan Isac. A historian and writer, he joined the academic staff of Babeş-Bolyai University, and notably edited his father's correspondence with Vasile Goldiş. During the final, national communist, stage of the Romanian regime, Dan Isac was reportedly made a target of censorship for his alleged closeness to the Hungarian-Romanian community.\n\nIsac's legacy was touched by the fall of Romanian communism during the 1989 Revolution. His memorial home was effectively disestablished in 2001, following an administrative decision of the Cluj County Council, and the cultural items in its patrimony were transferred to the Octavian Goga County Library. However, in autumn 2004, Isac was one of the contributors whose work was paid homage to in \"Steaua\" magazine's 50th anniversary issue.\n\n"}

{"id": "6364389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6364389", "title": "Fold (higher-order function)", "text": "Fold (higher-order function)\n\nIn functional programming, fold (also termed reduce, accumulate, aggregate, compress, or inject) refers to a family of higher-order functions that analyze a recursive data structure and through use of a given combining operation, recombine the results of recursively processing its constituent parts, building up a return value. Typically, a fold is presented with a combining function, a top node of a data structure, and possibly some default values to be used under certain conditions. The fold then proceeds to combine elements of the data structure's hierarchy, using the function in a systematic way.\n\nFolds are in a sense dual to unfolds, which take a \"seed\" value and apply a function corecursively to decide how to progressively construct a corecursive data structure, whereas a fold recursively breaks that structure down, replacing it with the results of applying a combining function at each node on its terminal values and the recursive results (catamorphism, versus anamorphism of unfolds).\n\nFolds can be regarded as consistently replacing the structural components of a data structure with functions and values. Lists, for example, are built up in many functional languages from two primitives: any list is either an empty list, commonly called \"nil\"  (codice_1), or is constructed by prefixing an element in front of another list, creating what is called a \"cons\"  node ( codice_2 ), resulting from application of a codice_3 function, written down as codice_4 (colon) in Haskell. One can view a fold on lists as \"replacing\"  the \"nil\" at the end of the list with a specific value, and \"replacing\" each \"cons\" with a specific function. These replacements can be viewed as a diagram:\n\nThere's another way to perform the structural transformation in a consistent manner, with the order of the two links of each node flipped when fed into the combining function:\n\nThese pictures illustrate \"right\" and \"left\" fold of a list visually. They also highlight the fact that codice_5 is the identity function on lists (a \"shallow copy\" in Lisp parlance), as replacing \"cons\" with codice_3 and \"nil\" with codice_7 will not change the result. The left fold diagram suggests an easy way to reverse a list, codice_8. Note that the parameters to cons must be flipped, because the element to add is now the right hand parameter of the combining function. Another easy result to see from this vantage-point is to write the higher-order map function in terms of codice_9, by composing the function to act on the elements with codice_3, as:\n\nwhere the period (.) is an operator denoting function composition.\n\nThis way of looking at things provides a simple route to designing fold-like functions on other algebraic data types and structures, like various sorts of trees. One writes a function which recursively replaces the constructors of the datatype with provided functions, and any constant values of the type with provided values. Such a function is generally referred to as a catamorphism.\n\nThe folding of the list codice_11 with the addition operator would result in 15, the sum of the elements of the list codice_11. To a rough approximation, one can think of this fold as replacing the commas in the list with the + operation, giving codice_13.\n\nIn the example above, + is an associative operation, so the final result will be the same regardless of parenthesization, although the specific way in which it is calculated will be different. In the general case of non-associative binary functions, the order in which the elements are combined may influence the final result's value. On lists, there are two obvious ways to carry this out: either by combining the first element with the result of recursively combining the rest (called a right fold), or by combining the result of recursively combining all elements but the last one, with the last element (called a left fold). This corresponds to a binary \"operator\" being either right-associative or left-associative, in Haskell's or Prolog's terminology. With a right fold, the sum would be parenthesized as codice_14, whereas with a left fold it would be parenthesized as codice_15.\n\nIn practice, it is convenient and natural to have an initial value which in the case of a right fold is used when one reaches the end of the list, and in the case of a left fold is what is initially combined with the first element of the list. In the example above, the value 0 (the additive identity) would be chosen as an initial value, giving codice_16 for the right fold, and codice_17 for the left fold. For multiplication, an initial choice of 0 wouldn't work: codice_18. The identity element for multiplication is 1. This would give us the outcome codice_19. \n\nThe use of an initial value is necessary when the combining function \"f\"  is asymmetrical in its types, i.e., when the type of its result is different from the type of list's elements. Then an initial value must be used, with the same type as that of \"f\" 's result, for a \"linear\" chain of applications to be possible. Whether it will be left- or right-oriented will be determined by the types expected of its arguments by the combining function. If it is the second argument that must be of the same type as the result, then \"f\"  could be seen as a binary operation that \"associates on the right\", and vice versa.\n\nWhen the function is symmetrical in its types and the result type is the same as the list elements' type, the parentheses may be placed in arbitrary fashion thus creating a \"tree\" of nested sub-expressions, e.g., codice_20. If the binary operation \"f\"  is associative this value will be well-defined, i.e., same for any parenthesization, although the operational details of how it is calculated will be different. This can have significant impact on efficiency if \"f\"  is non-strict.\n\nWhereas linear folds are node-oriented and operate in a consistent manner for each node of a list, tree-like folds are whole-list oriented and operate in a consistent manner across \"groups\" of nodes.\n\nOne often wants to choose the identity element of the operation \"f\" as the initial value \"z\". When no initial value seems appropriate, for example, when one wants to fold the function which computes the maximum of its two parameters over a non-empty list to get the maximum element of the list, there are variants of codice_9 and codice_22 which use the last and first element of the list respectively as the initial value. In Haskell and several other languages, these are called codice_23 and codice_24, the 1 making reference to the automatic provision of an initial element, and the fact that the lists they are applied to must have at least one element.\n\nThese folds use type-symmetrical binary operation: the types of both its arguments, and its result, must be the same. Richard Bird in his 2010 book proposes \"a general fold function on non-empty lists\" codice_25 which transforms its last element, by applying an additional argument function to it, into a value of the result type before starting the folding itself, and is thus able to use type-asymmetrical binary operation like the regular codice_9 to produce a result of type different from the list's elements type.\n\nUsing Haskell as an example, codice_22 and codice_9 can be formulated in a few equations.\n\nIf the list is empty, the result is the initial value. If not, fold the tail of the list using as new initial value the result of applying f to the old initial value and the first element.\n\nIf the list is empty, the result is the initial value z. If not, apply f to the first element and the result of folding the rest.\n\nLists can be folded over in a tree-like fashion, both for finite and for indefinitely defined lists:\nIn the case of codice_29 function, to avoid its runaway evaluation on \"indefinitely\" defined lists the function codice_30 must \"not always\" demand its second argument's value, at least not all of it, and/or not immediately (see example below).\n\nIn the presence of lazy, or non-strict evaluation, codice_9 will immediately return the application of \"f\" to the head of the list and the recursive case of folding over the rest of the list. Thus, if \"f\" is able to produce some part of its result without reference to the recursive case on its \"right\" i.e., in its \"second\" argument, and the rest of the result is never demanded, then the recursion will stop (e.g., ). This allows right folds to operate on infinite lists. By contrast, codice_22 will immediately call itself with new parameters until it reaches the end of the list. This tail recursion can be efficiently compiled as a loop, but can't deal with infinite lists at all — it will recurse forever in an infinite loop.\n\nHaving reached the end of the list, an \"expression\" is in effect built by codice_22 of nested left-deepening codice_30-applications, which is then presented to the caller to be evaluated. Were the function codice_30 to refer to its second argument first here, and be able to produce some part of its result without reference to the recursive case (here, on its \"left\" i.e., in its \"first\" argument), then the recursion would stop. This means that while codice_9 recurses \"on the right\", it allows for a lazy combining function to inspect list's elements from the left; and conversely, while codice_22 recurses \"on the left\", it allows for a lazy combining function to inspect list's elements from the right, if it so chooses (e.g., ).\n\nReversing a list is also tail-recursive (it can be implemented using ). On \"finite\" lists, that means that left-fold and reverse can be composed to perform a right fold in a tail-recursive way (cf.  ), with a modification to the function codice_30 so it reverses the order of its arguments (i.e., ), tail-recursively building a representation of expression that right-fold would build. The extraneous intermediate list structure can be eliminated with the continuation-passing style technique, ; similarly, ( codice_39 is only needed in languages like Haskell with its flipped order of arguments to the combining function of codice_22 unlike e.g., in Scheme where the same order of arguments is used for combining functions to both codice_22 and ).\n\nAnother technical point is that, in the case of left folds using lazy evaluation, the new initial parameter is not being evaluated before the recursive call is made. This can lead to stack overflows when one reaches the end of the list and tries to evaluate the resulting potentially gigantic expression. For this reason, such languages often provide a stricter variant of left folding which forces the evaluation of the initial parameter before making the recursive call. In Haskell this is the codice_42 (note the apostrophe, pronounced 'prime') function in the codice_43 library (one needs to be aware of the fact though that forcing a value built with a lazy data constructor won't force its constituents automatically by itself). Combined with tail recursion, such folds approach the efficiency of loops, ensuring constant space operation, when lazy evaluation of the final result is impossible or undesirable.\n\nUsing a Haskell interpreter, the structural transformations which fold functions perform can be illustrated by constructing a string:\n\nInfinite tree-like folding is demonstrated e.g., in recursive primes production by unbounded sieve of Eratosthenes in Haskell:\n\nwhere the function codice_44 operates on ordered lists in a local manner to efficiently produce their set union, and codice_45 their set difference.\n\nFor finite lists, e.g., merge sort (and its duplicates-removing variety, codice_46) could be easily defined using tree-like folding as\n\nwith the function [[Haskell 98 features#Mergesort|codice_47]] a duplicates-preserving variant of codice_44.\n\nFunctions codice_49 and codice_50 could have been defined through folding as\n!

There are approximately 37,000 speakers (taking the most recent estimate and adding the estimated 3.2% a year growth rate for Benin). A large proportion of the population live beyond the homeland in other parts of Benin, as well as in neighboring Togo, Nigeria, and Ghana. There may be as many as 1,000 living in Ghana.\n\nThe language has its origin in Ghana. Approximately 200 to 300 years ago, a group of Guang speakers migrated from the south of Ghana to Sèmèrè along the ancient cola trade route which extended through Togo and Benin to Nigeria. The various origins of Foodo speakers are still retained in clan names.\" \n\nFoodo is one of the national languages of Benin. In the Beninese sociopolitical context 'national language' is interpreted to mean all African languages spoken within the borders of the country. \n\nThe Foodo have close historical and cultural links through Islam to the Tem (often known as Kotokoli), in and around the town of Sokode in Togo. Many Foodo are bilingual in Tem as a trade language.\n\nFoodo has 24 consonant phonemes. Consonants in parentheses are found only in loan words.\n\nLike other Guang languages, Foodo has nine phonemic vowels. Vowel length is contrastive, resulting in a total of 18 vowels.\n\nFoodo is a tonal language, meaning that pitch differences are used to distinguish one word from another. These contrasts may be lexical or grammatical.\n\nThere are two tones, High (H) and Low (L).\n\nFoodo also has automatic downstep, where a H following a L is always pronounced on a lower pitch than the preceding H within the same phonological phrase. Numerous tonal processes occur once words are placed in context.\n\nIn underlying forms, there are five possible syllable types: CV, CV:, CVV, CVC, V and VC. Except for some pronominal forms, both V and VC are limited to affixes. The only consonants which occur in the coda position are nasals. \n\nFoodo has vowel harmony. All vowels in the stem agree in regard to their ATR quality. Prefixes and most suffixes receive their ATR feature from the ATR quality of the stem. There is also some rounding vowel harmony in nouns, but this is more restrictive and often varies between speakers.\n\nThe Foodo orthography uses modified Roman script, adding various characters to represent sounds that do not occur in European languages.\n\nThe Foodo orthography marks an acute accent on the first syllable of the word if that syllable is H tone, and leaves all other syllables unmarked. e.g.á é ɛ́ í ɩ́ ó ɔ́ ú ʊ́\n\nFoodo has ten noun classes. Most nouns consist of a stem with a noun class prefix and a noun class suffix. But it is more helpful to speak of classification being based on agreement patterns rather than just on the form of a single affix. Nouns are grouped into different sets which share common agreement phenomena within the noun phrase and on concordant anaphoric pronouns outside the noun phrase. The tone on noun class prefixes behaves similarly to other Guang languages.\n\nFoodo is an SVO language. Adverbial phrases are generally clause final. The order of morphemes within a verbal word is: subject anaphoric clitic — negative marker — TAM — verb stem — directional]. \n"}

{"id": "7163194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7163194", "title": "History of Western typography", "text": "History of Western typography\n\nContemporary typographers view typography as a craft with a very long history tracing its origins back to the first punches and dies used to make seals and currency in ancient times. The basic elements of typography are at least as old as civilization and the earliest writing systems—a series of key developments that were eventually drawn together into one, systematic craft.\n\nTypography, type-founding and typeface design began as closely related crafts in mid-15th-century Europe with the introduction of movable type printing at the junction of the medieval era and the Renaissance. Handwritten letterforms of the mid-15th century embodied 3000 years of evolved letter design, and were the natural models for letterforms in systematized typography. The scribal letter known as \"textur\" or \"textualis\", produced by the strong gothic spirit of blackletter from the hands of German area scribes, served as the model for the first text types.\n\nJohannes Gutenberg employed the scribe Peter Schöffer to help design and cut the letterpunches for the first typeface—the D-K type of 202 characters used to print the first printed books in Europe. A second typeface of about 300 characters designed for the 42-line Bible c. 1455 was probably cut by the goldsmith Hans Dunne with the help of two others—Götz von Shlettstadt and Hans von Speyer.\n\nCultural tradition ensured that German typography and type design remained true to the gothic/blackletter spirit; but the parallel influence of the humanist and neo-classical typography in Italy (the second country where movable type printing was done) catalyzed textur into four additional sub-styles that were distinct, structurally rich and highly disciplined: Bastarda, fraktur, rotunda, and Schwabacher.\n\nThe rapid spread of movable type printing across Europe produced additional Gothic, half-Gothic and Gothic-to-Roman transitional types. Johann Bämler's Schwabacher, Augsburg appeared in 1474. The half-Gothic Rotunda type of Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 was cut to suit Venetian taste. In 1476 William Caxton, having learned his craft on the Continent, printed the first books in England with a so-called Bâtarde type (an early Schwabacher design), but soon abandoned it.\n\nThe early printers of Spain were Germans who began by printing in up-to-date roman types but soon gave these up and adopted Gothic typefaces based on the letterforms of Spanish manuscripts. Valencia in the Kingdom of Aragon was the location of the first press, established in 1473. From there printers moved to other cities to set up presses. Roman types were used by the printers of Salamanca for their editions of classical authors. Printing in Portuguese began at Lisbon in 1495 (the first book printed in Portugal was a Hebrew book printed in 1489).\n\nIn Italy the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by \"Venetian\" or \"old style\" Latin types, also called antiqua. The inscriptional capitals on Roman buildings and monuments were structured on a euclidean geometric scheme and the discrete component-based model of classical architecture. Their structurally perfect design, near-perfect execution in stone, balanced angled stressing, contrasting thick and thin strokes, and incised serifs became the typographic ideal for western civilization. The best-known example of Roman inscriptional capitals exists on the base of Trajan's Column, inscribed c. 113.\n\nIn their enthusiastic revival of classical culture, Italian scribes and humanist scholars of the early 15th century searched for ancient lower case letters to match the Roman inscriptional capitals. Practically all of the available manuscripts of classical writers had been rewritten during the Carolingian Renaissance, and with a lapse of three hundred years since the widespread use of this style, the humanist scribes mistook Carolingian minuscule as the authentic writing style of the ancients. Dubbing it \"lettera antica\", they began by copying the minuscule hand almost exactly, combining it with Roman capitals in the same manner as the manuscripts they were copying.\n\nUpon noticing the stylistic mismatch between these two very different letters, the scribes redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time moveable type reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as humanistic minuscule, which served as the basis for type style we know today as Venetian.\n\nThe classically endowed city of Rome attracted the first printers known to have set up shop outside Germany, Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim, closely followed by the brothers Johann and Wendelin of Speyer (de Spira), and the Frenchman Nicolas Jenson. The sequence of appearance and production dates for types used by these printers have yet to be established with certainty; all four are known to have printed with types ranging from textur Gothic to fully developed romans inspired by the earlier humanistic writing, and within a few years the center of printing in Italy shifted from Rome to Venice.\n\nSome time before 1472 in Venice, Johann and Wendelin issued material printed with a half-Gothic-half-roman type known as \"Gotico-antiqua\". This design paired simplified Gothic capitals with a rationalized humanistic minuscule letter set, itself combining Gothic minuscule forms with elements of Carolingian, in a one step forward, half step back blending of styles.\n\nAround the same time (1468) in Rome, Pannartz and Sweynheim were using another typeface that closely mimicked humanistic minuscule, known as \"Lactantius\". Unlike the rigid fractured forms of Speyer's half-Gothic, the Lactantius is characterized by smoothly rendered letters with a restrained organic finish. The Lactantius a departed from both the Carolingian and Gothic models; a vertical backstem and right-angled top replaced the diagonal Carolingian structure, and a continuous curved stroke replaced the fractured Gothic bowl element.\n\nFor details on the evolution of lower case letterforms from Latin capitals, see Latin alphabet.\n\nNicolas Jenson began printing in Venice with his original roman font from 1470. Jenson's design and the very similar roman types cut by Francesco Griffo c. 1499 and Erhard Ratdolt c. 1486 are acknowledged as the definitive and archetypal roman faces that set the pattern for the majority of western text faces that followed.\n\nThe Jenson roman was an explicitly typographic letter designed on its own terms that declined to imitate the appearance of hand-lettering. Its effect is one of a unified cohesive whole, a seamless fusion of style with structure, and the successful convergence of the long progression of preceding letter styles. Jenson adapted the structural unity and component-based modular integration of Roman capitals to humanistic minuscule forms by masterful abstract stylization. The carefully modelled serifs follow an artful logic of asymmetry. The ratio of extender lengths to letter bodies and the distance between lines results in balanced, harmonious body of type. Jenson also mirrors the ideal expressed in renaissance painting of carving up space (typographic \"white space\") with figures (letters) to articulate the relationship between the two and make the white space dynamic.\n\nThe name \"roman\" is customarily applied uncapitalized to distinguish early Jenson and Aldine-derived types from classical Roman letters of antiquity. Some parts of Europe call roman \"antiqua\" from its connection with the humanistic \"lettera antica\"; \"medieval\" and \"old-style\" are also employed to indicate roman types dating from the late 15th century, especially those used by Aldus Manutius (Italian: Manuzio). Roman faces based on those of Speyer and Jenson are also called Venetian.\n\nThe humanist spirit driving the Renaissance produced its own unique style of formal writing, known as \"cursiva humanistica\". This slanted and rapidly written letter evolved from humanistic minuscule and the remaining Gothic current cursive hands in Italy, served as the model for \"cursive\" or italic typefaces. As books printed with early roman types forced humanistic minuscule out of use, cursiva humanistica gained favor as a manuscript hand for the purpose of writing. The popularity of cursive writing itself may have created some demand for a type of this style. The more decisive catalyst was probably the printing of pocket editions of Latin classics by Aldus Manutius.\n\nThe \"Aldino\" italic type, commissioned by Manutius and cut by Francesco Griffo in 1499, was a closely spaced condensed type. Griffo's punches are a delicate translation of the Italian cursive hand, featuring letters of irregular slant angle and uneven height and vertical position, with some connected pairs (\"ligatures\"), and unslanted small roman capitals the height of the lower case t. The fame of Aldus Manutius and his editions made the Griffo italic widely copied and influential, although it was not the finest of the pioneer italics. The \"Aldino\" style quickly became known as \"italic\" from its Italian origin.\n\nAround 1527 the Vatican chancellery scribe Ludovico Arrighi designed a superior italic type and had the punches cut by Lauticio di Bartolomeo dei Rotelli. The more modular structure of Arrighi's italic and its few ligatures made it less a copy of the cursive hand than Griffo's. Its slightly taller roman capitals, a gentler slant angle, taller ascenders and wider separation of lines gave the elegant effect of refined handwriting.\n\nSurviving examples of 16th-century Italian books indicate the bulk of them were printed with italic types. By mid-century the popularity of italic types for sustained text setting began to decline until they were used only for in-line citations, block quotes, preliminary text, emphasis, and abbreviations. Italic types from the 20th century up to the present are much indebted to Arrighi and his influence on French designers.\n\nSwiss art historian Jakob Burckhardt described the classically inspired Renaissance \"modello\" of dual case roman and cursive italic types as \"The model and ideal for the whole western world\". Venetian pre-eminence in type design was brought to an end by the political and economic turmoil that concluded the Renaissance in Italy with the sack of Rome in 1527.\n\nSoon after 1500, roman typefaces began to gain popularity north of the Alps for printing of Latin literature. Johann Froben of Basel, Switzerland set up his press in 1491, and by about 1519 (when he printed Erasmus's famous edition of the Greek New Testament) he had established a set of standards for humanistic printing which were widely copied throughout the German-speaking world and also in Spain and, to a lesser extent in England. His principal type is wholly roman in the shape of the characters but retains an echo of gothic influence in the angled serifs and the way the thick and thin strokes are organized; it was coupled with mated sets of woodcut initials (often designed by distinguished artists) and with two larger sizes of uppercase letters for use in title pages and headings—Froben was the first to use such 'display faces' consistently, breaking away from the Italian tradition in which title pages and headings tended to be set in the same size as the main text. By using these large faces, Froben developed the title page as a fully organized artistic whole. Froben's italic face is based on that of Aldus but more even and uniform in effect. These Swiss books are the first to have been designed in every detail as printed artifacts rather than as adaptations of manuscript technique.\n\nAfter about 1550 this Swiss/German tradition was gradually overwhelmed by French influence. Towards the end of the 16th century, the Wechel family of Frankfurt, previously based in Paris, was producing fine books which used French typefaces in conjunction with heavy but resplendent woodcut ornaments to achieve a splendid page effect; but soon after 1600 there was a general, marked decline in the quality of both skill and materials, from which German printing did not recover until the 20th century.\n\nTypography was introduced to France by the German printers Martin Crantz, Michael Freyburger and Ulrich Gering, who set up a press in Paris in 1470, where they printed with an inferior copy of the Lactantius type. Gothic types dominated in France until the end of the 15th century, when they were gradually supplanted by roman designs. Jodocus Badius Ascensius (Josse Bade) in partnership with Henri Estienne established a press in Paris in 1503. Printing with undeveloped Roman and half-Gothic types, the French pair were too occupied meeting the demand for Humanistic and classical texts to design any original types of their own. French books nonetheless began to follow the format established by Italian printers, and Lyon and Paris became the new centers of activity. Eventually, the French government fixed a standard height for all type, to ensure that different batches could be used together.\n\nAfter their 1494 invasion of Italy the French were greatly influenced by Renaissance culture, and later set about converting French culture from Gothic to neo-classical. The required phonetic and orthographic changes to French language hindered the evolution of type design in France until the late 1520s. At the end of this period roman types introduced by Robert Estienne, Simon de Colines and Antoine Augereau began a phase of type design with a distinctly French character. Robert Estienne carried on the establishment of his father Henri Estienne, who had died in 1520. Simon de Colines had been the elder Estienne's assistant, married his widow, and set up his own press.\n\nThe de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman but did not copy it closely. Narrower forms and tighter letter fit; a with low angled bowl; elevated triangular stem serifs on i, j, m, n and r; flattened baseline serifs, delicately modeled ascender serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 was similar to the de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post-Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150 years.\n\nThe svelte French style reached its fullest refinement in the roman types attributed to the best-known figure of French typography—Claude Garamond (also Garamont). In 1541 Robert Estienne, printer to the king, helped Garamond obtain commissions to cut the sequence of Greek fonts for King Francis I of France, known as the \"grecs du roi\". A number of roman faces used in Garamond's publishing activities can be positively attributed to him as punch-cutter. From the dates of their appearance, and their similarity to romans used by Estienne, Christoffel Plantijn and the printer André Wechel, the types known as \"Canon de Garamond\" and \"Petit Canon de Garamond\" shown on a specimen sheet issued by the Egenolff-Berner foundry in 1592 are generally accepted as Claude Garamond's final roman types.\n\nRobert Granjon worked in the second half of the 16th century, mainly at Lyon, but was also recorded at Paris, Rome and Antwerp. He is still famous because of his Civilité types, imitating French gothic cursive calligraphy. His main contribution was an italic type known as \"Parangon de Granjon\". Italic type design had apparently become corrupted since the Arrighi and Aldine models. Granjon's italic had a greater slant angle, slanted roman capitals, and reduced weight and rigor. These qualities and its contrasting thick and thin strokes gave it a dazzling appearance that made it difficult to read. It was nevertheless the main influence for italic type design until the Arrighi model was revived in 1920.\n\nIn the 16th century, Western printers also developed Oriental types, such as François Savary de Brèves or Robert Granjon, usually with the objective of proselytizing the Catholic faith.\n\nBaroque and rococo aesthetic trends, use of the pointed-pen for writing, and steel engraving techniques effected a gradual shift in typographic style. Contrast between thick and thin strokes increased. Tilted stressing transformed into vertical stressing; full rounds were compressed. Blunt bracketed serifs grew sharp and delicate until they were fine straight lines. Detail became clean and precise.\n\nTransitional roman types combined the classical features of lettera antiqua with the vertical stressing and higher contrast between thick and thin strokes characteristic of the true modern romans to come.\n\nThe roman types used c. 1618 by the Dutch printing firm of Elzevir in Leyden reiterated the 16th-century French style with higher contrast, less rigor and a lighter page effect. After 1647 most Elzevir faces were cut by the highly regarded Christoffel van Dyck, whose precise renditions were regarded by some experts at the time as finer than Garamond's.\n\nFrom mid-16th century until the end of the 17th, interference with printing by the British Crown thwarted the development of type founding in England—most type used by 17th-century English printers was of Dutch origin. The lack of material inspired Bishop of Oxford Doctor John Fell to purchase punches & matrices from Holland c. 1670–1672 for use by the Oxford University Press. The so-named Fell types, presumed to be the work of Dutch punchcutter Dirck Voskens, mark a noticeable jump from previous designs, with considerably shorter extenders, higher stroke contrast, narrowing of round letters, and flattened serifs on the baseline and descenders. The design retained a retrogressive old-style irregularity, smooth modeling from vertical to horizontal, and angled stressing of rounds (except a vertically stressed o). Fell capitals were condensed, even-width, with wide flattened serifs; all characteristics of the definitive modern romans of the late 18th century. Fell italic types were distinguished by high contrast matching the Fell romans; wider ovals; a split-branching stroke from the stems of m n r and u; and long, flat serifs—prefiguring modern. They repeated the non-uniform slant of French models, and the capitals included swash J and Q forms.\n\nAn open-source digitisation of the Fell Types has been released by designer and engineer Igino Marini.\n\nThe first major figure in English typography is reckoned by type historians to have ended the monopoly of Dutch type founding almost single-handedly. The gun engraver-turned-punchcutter William Caslon spent 14 years creating the stable of typefaces on the specimen sheet issued in 1734. The complete canon included roman, italic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic \"etc.\" Caslon's Great Primer roman and English roman were retrogressive designs that very closely followed the Fell types and the roman of Miklós (Nicholas) Kis c. 1685 falsely attributed to Anton Janson. Like the Fells, Caslon's slightly bracketed serifs and old-style irregularity gave it a homely charm—its precise cut and perpendicularity place it firmly in the 18th century however. Caslon's italic structures follow the Fell italics, but at a condensed width and with conventional branching from stems.\n\nWilliam Caslon's prodigious output was influential worldwide. Caslon type and its imitations were used throughout the expanding British empire. It was the dominant type in the American colonies for the second half of the 18th century. Caslon marks the rise of England as the center of typographic activity.\n\nJoan Michaël Fleischman (1701–1768) was born in Nürnberg where he trained as a punchcutter. He found employment with Dutch type founders in Holland and settled there c. 1728. At the Enschedé foundry in Haarlem he cut punches for a large amount of material. Some time after 1743 he produced a distinguished roman design—related to the preceding transitional types but departing from them. It prefigured modern romans with sparse transaxial modeling joining the vertical stressing to hairline thins, and ball-ends. Fleischmann borrowed from the general mode of Phillipe Grandjean’s and Louis Simonneau’s \"Romain du Roi,\" commissioned by Louis XIV in 1692 for the Imprimerie Royale, but did not imitate that face. Fleischmann's capitals were a new variety; an even-width scheme, compressed rounds, all-vertical stressing, and triangular beak ends of E F L T and Z, all characteristics prefiguring the \"classical\" moderns of Bodoni and Didot. Fleischmann's italic bore some resemblance to Granjean's but had longer ascenders and followed the established Dutch structures for h v and w.\n\nFleischmann was held in great esteem by his contemporaries, his designs exerting a decisive influence in the last quarter of the 18th century. Renowned French punchcutter Pierre Simon Fournier (1712–1768), confessed to having copied Fleischmann's design, and was first to dub \"contrast\" types like the Fells, Caslon and Fleischmann \"modern\". Fournier's rococo-influenced designs—Fournier and Narcissus—and his Modèles des Caractères (1742) continued the romaine du roi style and adapted it for his own modern age. Like Baskerville, his italics were inspired by handwriting and the engraved lettering known as copperplate hand. Fournier also published a two volume \"Manuel Typographique\", in which he recorded much European typographic history, and introduced the first standardized system of type size measurement—the \"point\".\n\nThe roman and italic types of John Baskerville c. 1772 appeared later than Fleischman's but are considered transitional and partly retrogressive with a return to lower contrast, smooth transaxial modeling, finely modeled bracketed serifs, and long stems. The exquisite design and finish of Baskerville's roman however, combining elegance and strength, was modern. His roman design, and especially his italic, were rococo-influenced. His designs did not visibly quote any previous types. They were informed by his prior experience as a writing master and the influences of his time. The types of Joseph Fry, Alexander Wilson, and John Bell closely followed Baskerville, and through his correspondence with European type founders Baskerville's influence penetrated most of western Europe. Baskerville was a meticulous artist who controlled all aspects of his creation, devising more accurate presses, blacker inks and paper sealed with hot rollers to ensure crisp impressions. Of particular note, the lower storey of his lowercase g does not fully close. Derivatives of Baskerville are often identified thus. A modern revival of Baskerville, a font called Mrs Eaves, is named after Baskerville's wife who was the widow of Richard Eaves.\n\nTrue modern romans arrived with the types of the Italian Giambattista Bodoni and the French Didots. Completing trends begun by the Fell types, Fleischman, Fournier and Baskerville, the so-called \"classical\" modern romans eschewed chirographic and organic influences, their synthetic symmetric geometry answering to a rationalized and reformed classical model driven by the strict cartesian grid philosophy of René Descartes and the predictable clockwork universe of Isaac Newton.\n\nThe \"classical\" appellation of modern romans stems from their return to long ascenders and descenders set on widely spaced lines, and a corresponding light page effect reminiscent of old-style—occurring at a time of classical revival.\n\nBodoni was foremost in progressing from rococo to the new classical style. He produced an italic very close to Baskerville's, and a French cursive script type falling in between italic type and joined scripts. The roman types of Francois Ambroise Didot and son Firmin Didot closely resemble the work of Bodoni, and opinion is divided over whether the Didots or Bodoni originated the first modern romans. At any rate the Didots' mathematical precision and vanishing of rococo design reflected the \"enlightenment\" of post-revolution France under Napoleon. Francois Ambroise also designed \"maigre\" and \"gras\" types corresponding to later condensed and expanded font formats.\n\nThe Spanish designer Joaquín Ibarra's roman was influenced by Baskerville, Didot and Bodoni, but hewn nearer to old-style and used in the same classical manner, including spaced capitals. In England modern romans resembling Bodoni's were cut for the printer William Bulmer c. 1786 by the punchcutter William Martin, who had been apprenticed to Baskerville and influenced by him. Martin's italic mirrored the open-tail g and overall finesse of Baskerville's.\n\nIn Britain and the United States, modern romans (emerging around 1800 and totally dominant by the 1820s) took a somewhat more rounded, less geometrical form than the designs of Didot and Bodoni; an obvious difference is that in Anglo-American faces the upper-case C has only one serif (at the top) whereas in European designs it has two.\n\nThe 19th century brought fewer stylistic innovations. The most notable invention was the rise of typefaces with strengthened serifs. Forerunners were the so-called Egyptienne fonts, which were used already at the beginning of the 19th century. Their name likely comes from the enthusiasm of the Napoleonic era for the orient, which in turn was started by Napoleon's invasion in Egypt. In fact slab-serif fonts (\"e. g.\" Clarendon from 1845) were newspaper fonts, whose serifs were strengthened in order to prevent damage during the printing process. Stylistically the serif fonts of the mid-19th century appeared very robust and otherwise had more or less neo-classical design features, which changed during the course of time: By the application of the slab serif design feature and by appending serifs to more and more typefaces, an independent intermediate group of heterogeneous fonts emerged during the 20th century. Meanwhile, the slab serifs are listed as an independent group in most typeface classifications—besides both main groups serif and sans serif.\n\nSlab-serif and sanserif types were rarely used for continuous bodies of text; their realm was that of advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so-called 'old style' faces—a largely English-speaking phenomenon—came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs at the end of thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910.\n\nAbove all the 19th century was innovative regarding technical aspects. Automatic manufacturing processes changed the print as well as the graphical illustrations. The illustration of printed matters could be considerably standardised due to the lithography technique invented by Alois Senefelder. Finally, another invention was photography, whose establishment at the end of the 19th century led to the first halftoning and reproduction procedures. The step-by-step development of a modern mass society provided a growing demand of printed matters. Besides the traditional letterpress beginnings of a newspaper landscape as well as a broad market for publications, advertisements, and posters of all kinds appeared. The challenges had changed: since printing and typography had been a straightforward craft for centuries, it now had to face the challenges of an industry-ruled mass society.\n\nThe 90 years between 1890 and 1980 coined typography until now. The craft of printing became an industry, and the typography became a part of it as well. Both stylistically and technologically this epoch was really tumultuous. The significant developments were the following:\n\nSince impressionism the modern art styles were reflected in graphic design and typography too. Since 1890 the Art nouveau became popular. Its floral ornaments, the curved forms, as well as the emphasis on graphical realisation inspired the type designers of the start of the 20th century. A popular art nouveau font was the \"Eckmann\" designed by graphic artist Otto Eckmann. Furthermore, the influence of art nouveau was expressed in a lot of book illustrations and exlibris designs.\n\nAltogether the return to the roots of book art become stronger around the start of the 20th century. It was initiated by British typographer, socialist, and private press publisher William Morris as well as by the Arts and Crafts Movement, which refers to him. Essentially this movement initiated three things: a return to the antiqua-models of the Renaissance, clarity and simplicity of book illustrations, and straightforward technical processes during the production of printed matters. An immediate consequence of the Arts and Crafts Movement was the establishment of the private press movement, which more or less was committed to Morris' ideals, and whose remains partially are still present today. An established meeting point of this scene in Germany for example is the Mainzer Minipressen-Messe, which actually is held every two years.\n\nEspecially the New Book Art movement, which formed in the decade before World War I, was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. The young type designers of the pre-war era, among them Fritz Helmuth Ehmcke and Friedrich Wilhelm Kleukens, rejected both the late typographical classicism and the ornaments of the popular Art nouveau. The new ideal became a tidy and straightforward book typography, which dedicated itself to the ideas of the Renaissance. Walter Tiemann in Leipzig, Friedrich Hermann Ernst Schneidler in Stuttgart, and Rudolf Koch in Offenbach as instructors were the mentors of this kind of typography. They stayed influential in the field of book typesetting until a long time after the end of World War II.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3140619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3140619", "title": "Holystone", "text": "Holystone\n\nHolystone is a soft and brittle sandstone that was formerly used in the Royal Navy and US Navy for scrubbing and whitening the wooden decks of ships.\n\nA variety of origins have been proposed for the term, including that such stones were taken from broken monuments of St. Nicholas Church in Great Yarmouth or else the ruined church of St. Helens adjacent to the St Helens Road anchorage of the Isle of Wight where ships would often provision. The US Navy has it the term may have come from the fact that 'holystoning the deck' was originally done on one's knees, as in prayer. Smaller holystones were called \"prayer books\" and larger ones \"Bibles\". Holystoning eventually was not generally done on the knees but with a stick resting in a depression in the flat side of the stone and held under the arm and in the hands and moved back and forth with grain on each plank while standing or partially leaning over to put pressure on the stick-driven stone. Holystoning continued on teak-decked Iowa class battleships into the 1990s.\n\nHolystoning was a routine activity on Royal Navy vessels until the early 1800s. The practice reached its height in 1796 when Admiral St Vincent recommended to his captains that the decks of all ships in the fleet be holystoned \"every evening as well as morning during the summer months.\" For a ship of the line, the practice could take up to four hours.\n\nSt Vincent's successor, Admiral Keith, rescinded the order in 1801, finding that \"the custom of washing the decks of ships of war in all climates in every temperature of the air, and on stated days let the weather be what it may\" was so onerous as to be damaging the health and lives of the crews. The practice was subsequently limited to once every seven to fourteen days, interspersed with sweeping.\n\nHolystoning the deck was part of Queen Victoria's regulations for British-owned Emigration vessels in 1848, \"11. Duties of the sweepers to be to clean the ladders, hospitals, and round houses, to sweep the decks after every meal, and to dry-holystone and scrape them after breakfast.\"\n\nHolystoning continued as part of Navy routine throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but was ultimately regarded merely as a means to occupy an otherwise idle crew. Its lack of utility was evidenced in contemporary accounts including an 1875 British Medical Journal advice which warned against having patients \"set to useless tasks simply to keep them employed, such as sailors have to do in holystoning the decks.\"\n\nHolystoning was banned in the US Navy as it wore down the decks too rapidly and caused excessive expense, but the practice may have disappeared slowly. A 1952 graduate of the Naval Academy recalls of his Youngster (sophomore) cruise to England in the summer of 1949 aboard the :\n\nA photo on the US Navy's \"Navsource\" purports to show Navy Midshipmen holystoning the deck of the same ship in 1951.\n\nHolystoning is referenced in Richard Henry Dana, Jr.'s diary, the 1840 classic \"Two Years Before the Mast\", in what he calls the \"Philadelphia Catechism\":\n\nJohn Huston's 1956 film \"Moby Dick\", and most recently Peter Weir's 2003 film \"\", also show sailors scrubbing the deck with holystones.\n\n"}

After graduating from Cleveland Heights High School in 1949, Gleason earned a B.A. in history and literature from Radcliffe College, then an M.A. in linguistics, and a combined Ph.D. in linguistics and psychology, at Harvard;\nfrom 1958 to 1959 she was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. In graduate school she was advised by Roger Brown, a founder in the field of child language acquisition. In January 1959 she married Harvard mathematician Andrew Gleason; they had three daughters.\n\nMost of Gleason's professional career has been at Boston University, where she served as Psychology Department chair and director of the Graduate Program in Applied Linguistics; Lise Menn and Harold Goodglass were among her collaborators there.\n\nShe has been a visiting scholar at Harvard University, Stanford University, and at the Linguistics Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Although officially retired and no longer teaching, she to be involved in research.\n\nGleason is the author or coauthor of some 125 papers on language development in children, language attrition, aphasia, and gender and cultural aspects of language acquisition and use;\nand is editor/coeditor of two widely used textbooks, \"The Development of Language\" (first edition 1985, eighth edition 2012) and \"Psycholinguistics\" (1993).\nShe is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Psychological Association, and was president of the International Association for the Study of Child Language from 1990 to 1993, and of the Gypsy Lore Society 1996 to 1999.\nShe has also served on the editorial boards of numerous academic and professional journals, and was associate editor of \"Language\" from 1997 to 1999.\n\nGleason was profiled in \"Beyond the Glass Ceiling: Forty Women Whose Ideas Shape the Modern World\" (1996).\nA festschrift in her honor, \"Methods for Studying Language Production\", was published in 2000.\nIn 2016 she received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Washington & Jefferson College for her work as \"a pioneer in the field of psycholinguistics\",\nand in 2017 the Roger Brown Award (recognizing \"outstanding contribution to the international child language community\") from the International Association for the Study of Child Language.\n\nSince 2007 she has delivered the \"Welcome, welcome\" and \"Goodbye, goodbye\" speeches at the annual Ig Nobel Awards ceremonies.\n\nGleason devised the Wug Test as part of her earliest research (1958), which used nonsense words to gauge children's acquisition of morphological rulesfor example, the \"default\" rule that most English plurals are formed by adding an , or sounds, e.g., \" \"\nA child is shown simple pictures of an imaginary creature or activity,\nwith a nonsense name, and prompted to complete a statement about it:\nA critical attribute of the test is that the \"target\" word be a made-up (but plausible-sounding) pseudoword, so that the child will never have heard it before.\nA child who knows that the plural of \"witch\" is \"witches\" may have heard and memorized that pair, but a child responding that the plural of \"wug\" (which the child presumably has never heard) is \"wugs\" (/wʌgz/, using the /z/ allomorph since \"wug\" ends in a voiced consonant) has apparently inferred (perhaps unconsciously) the basic rule for forming plurals.\n\nThe Wug Test also includes questions involving verb conjugations, possessives, and other common derivational morphemes such as the agentive \"-er\" (e.g. \"A man who 'zibs' is a ________?\"),\nand requested explanations of common compound words e.g. \"Why is a birthday called a birthday?\"\nOther items included:\n(The expected answers were \"QUIRKY\" and \"SPOWED\".)\n\nGleason's major finding was that even very young children are able to connect suitable endingsto produce plurals, past tenses, possessives, and other formsto nonsense words they have never heard before, implying that they have already internalized systematic aspects of the linguistic system which no one has necessarily tried to teach them.\nHowever, she also identified an earlier stage at which children can produce such forms for real words, but not yet for nonsense wordsimplying that children start by memorizing singularplural pairs they hear spoken by others, then eventually extract rules and patterns from these examples which they apply to novel words.\n\nThe Wug Test was the first experimental proof that young children have extracted generalizable rules from the language around them, rather than simply memorizing words that they have heard, and it was almost immediately adapted for children speaking languages other than English, to bilingual children, and to children (and adults) with various impairments or from a variety of cultural backgrounds. Its conclusions are viewed as essential to the understanding of when and how children reach major language milestones, and its variations and progeny remain in use worldwide for studies on language acquisition. It is \"almost universal\" for textbooks in psycholinguistics and language acquisition to include assignments calling for the student to carry out a practical variation of the Wug Test paradigm.\n\nThe Wug Test's fundamental role in the development of psycholinguistics as a discipline has been mapped by studying references to Gleason's work in \"seminal journals\" in the field, many of which carried articles referencing it in their founding issues:\nAccording to Ratner and Menn, \"As an enduring concept in psycholinguistic research, the wug has become a generic, like [\"kleenex\"] or [\"xerox\"], a concept so basic to what we know and do that increasingly it appears in the popular literature without attribution to its origins... Perhaps no innovation other than the invention of the tape recorder has had such an indelible effect on the field of child language research.\"\n\nIt has been proposed that Wug Testlike instruments be used in diagnosis of learning disabilities, but in practice success in this direction has been limited.\n\nAnother of Gleason's early papers \"Fathers and Other Strangers: Men's Speech to Young Children\" (1975) explored differences between mothers' and fathers' spoken interaction with their children, primarily using data produced by two female and two male daycare teachers at a large university, and by three mothers and three fathers, mostly during family dinners.\nAmong other conclusions, this study found that:\n\nIn contrast, both male and female daycare teachers used language that was similar both quantitatively and qualitatively, with both focusing on dialogue based in the present and on the immediate needs of the children.\nDifferences included that the male teachers tended to address the children by name more often than did the female teachers, and that the male teachers issued more imperatives than did the female teachers.\n\nGleason's research eventually extended into the study of children's acquisition of routinesthat is, standardized chunks of language (or language-plus-gesture) that the culture expects of everyone, such as greetings, farewells, and expressions of thanks. Gleason was one of the first to study the acquisition of politeness, examining English-speaking children's use of routines such as \"thank you\", \"please\", and \"I'm sorry\". Researchers in this area have since studied both verbal and non-verbal routinization, and the development of politeness routines in a variety of cultures and languages.\n\nGleason's 1976 paper with Weintraub, \"The Acquisition of Routines in Child Language\",\nanalyzed performance on the culturally standardized Halloween Trick-or-treat routine in 115 children aged two to sixteen years.\nAlterations in ability and the function of parental contribution were analyzed concerning cognitive and social components.\nThey discovered that in the acquisition of routines\n(in contrast to acquisition of much of the rest of language) parents' major interest is for their children to achieve accurate performance, with little stress on children's understanding of what they are expected to say.\nGleason and Weintraub found that the parents rarely if ever explain to children the meaning of such routines as \"Bye bye\" or \"Trick or treat\"there was no concern with the child's thoughts or intentions as long as the routine was performed as expected at the appropriate times.\nThus, parents' role in the acquisition of routines is very different from their role in most of the rest of language development.\n\nGleason and Greif analyzed children's acquisition of three ubiquitous routines in \"Hi, Thanks, and Goodbye: More Routine Information\" (1980).\nSubjects were eleven boys and eleven girls and their parents.\nAt the conclusion of a parent–child play period, an assistant entered the playroom bearing a present, in order to evoke routines from the children.\nThe study's purpose was to analyze how parents communicate these routines to their children; major questions proposed included whether or not some routines were more obligatory than others, and whether mothers and fathers provide different models of politeness behavior for their children. The results suggest that children's \"spontaneous\" construction of the three routines was low, with \"Thank you\" the rarest.\nHowever, parents strongly encouraged their children to generate routines and, typically, the children complied.\nIn addition, parents were more likely to prompt the \"Thank you\" routine than the \"Hi\" and \"Goodbye\" routines.\nParents practiced the routines themselves, though mothers were more likely than fathers to speak \"Thank you\" and \"Goodbye\" to the assistant.\n\nGleason and Ely made an in-depth study of apologies in children's dialogue in their paper, \"I'm sorry I said that: apologies in young children's discourse\" (2006),\nwhich analyzed apology term usage (in parent–child dialogue) of five boys and four girls, aged one to six years.\nTheir research suggested that apologies appear later in children than do other politeness routines, and that as the children grew older they developed a progressively refined expertise with this routine, gradually requiring fewer direct prompts and producing more elaborate apologies instead of just saying \"I'm sorry\".\nThey also found that parents and other adults play an important role in fostering growth of apologetic abilities through the setting of examples, by encouraging the children to apologize, and by speaking specifically and purposefully to them about apologies.\n\nWith Ely, MacGibbon, and Zaretsky, Gleason also explored the discourse of middle-class parents and their children at the dinner table in, \"Attention to Language: Lessons Learned at the Dinner Table\" (2001),\nfinding that the everyday language of these parents involves a remarkable portion of attention to language.\nThe dinner-table conversation of twentytwo middle-class families, each with a child between two years and five and onehalf years old, were recorded,\nthen analyzed for the existence and activity of languagecentered terms, including words like \"ask\", \"tell\", \"say\", and \"speak\".\nMothers spoke more about language than did fathers, and fathers spoke more about it than did children:\nroughly eleven percent of mothers' sentences contained one or more languagecentered terms, and the corresponding proportions for fathers and children were seven percent and four percent.\nUses that were metalinguistic (for example, accounting for and remarking on speech) exceeded uses that were pragmatic (for example, managing how and when speech appears).\n\nThe more that mothers used language-centered terms, the more the children did as wellbut this was not true for fathers.\nThe results imply that in routine family conversations, parents supply children with considerable information on the way language is used to communicate information.\n\nGleason has carried out significant research involving the learning and maintenance of second languages by sequential bilinguals. She has studied the acquisition of a second language while retaining the first (additive bilingualism),\nexamining discourse behaviors of parents who follow the one person-one language principle by using different languages with their child\nShe has also studied language attrition, the loss of a known language through lack of use,\nand suggests that the order in which a language is learned is less important in predicting its retention than the thoroughness with which it is learned.\n\nAn unusual study carried out with Harris and Aycicegi, \"Taboo words and reprimands elicit greater autonomic reactivity in a first language than in a second language\" (2003), investigated the involuntary psychophysiological reactions of bilingual speakers to taboo words.\nThirtytwo TurkishEnglish bilinguals judged an array of words and phrases for \"pleasantness\" in Turkish (their first language), and in English (their second), while their skin conductance was monitored via fingertip electrodes.\nParticipants manifested greater autonomic arousal in response to taboo words and childhood reprimands in their first language than to those in their second language, confirming the commonplace claim that speakers of two languages are less uncomfortable speaking taboo words and phrases in their second language than in their native language.\n\nIn \"Maintaining Foreign Language Skills\", which discusses \"the personal, cultural, and instructional factors involved with keeping up foreign language skills\" (1988), Gleason and Pan consider both humans' remarkable capacity for language acquisition and their ability to lose it.\nIn addition to brain damage, strokes, trauma and other physical causes of language loss, individuals may lose language skills due to the absence of a linguistically supportive social environment in which to maintain such skills, such as when a speaker of a given language relocates to a place where that language is not spoken. Culture also factors in. More often than not, individuals speaking two or more languages come into contact with one another, for reasons ranging from emigration and interrelationships to alterations in political borders. The result of such contact is typically that the community of speakers undergoes a progressive shift in usage from one language to the other.\n\nGleason has also done significant research on aphasia,\na condition (usually due to brain injury) in which a person's ability to understand and/or to produce language, including their ability to find the words they need and their use of basic morphology and syntax, is impaired in a variety of ways.\n\nIn \"Some Linguistic Structures in the Speech of a Broca's Aphasic\" (1972) Gleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde discuss an experiment carried out with a man who, after a stroke, had been left with Broca's aphasia/agrammatism,\na specific form of aphasia typically impairing the production of morphology and syntax more than it impairs comprehension.\nThis experiment employed the Story Completion Test (often used to probe a subject's capacity for producing various common grammatical forms)\nas well as free conversation and repetition to elicit speech from the subject;\nthis speech was then analyzed to evaluate how well he used inflectional morphology\n(e.g. plural and past tense word endings) and basic syntax (the formation of, for example, simple declarative, imperative, and interrogative sentences).\n\nTo do this the investigator, in a few sentences, began a simple story about a pictured situation, then asked the subject to conclude the narrative.\nThe stories were so designed that a nonlanguageimpaired person's response would typically employ particular structures, for example the plural of a noun, the past tense of a verb, or a simple but complete yesno question (e.g. \"Did you take my shoes?\").\n\nGleason, Goodglass, Bernholtz, and Hyde concluded that the transition from verb to object was easier for this subject than was the transition from subject to verb, and\nthat auxiliary verbs and verb inflections were the parts of speech most likely to be omitted by the subject. There was considerable variation among consecutive repeat trials of the same test item, although responses on successive attempts usually came closer to those a normal speaker would have produced.\nThe study concluded that the subject's speech was not the product of a stable abnormal grammar, and could not be accounted for by assuming that he was simply omitting words to minimize his effort in producing themquestions\nof significant theoretical controversy at the time.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20562380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20562380", "title": "Kill off", "text": "Kill off\n\nThe killing off of a character is a device in fiction, whereby a character dies, but the story continues. The term, frequently applied to television, film and chronological series, often denotes an untimely or unexpected death motivated by factors beyond the storyline.\n\nIn productions featuring actors, the unwillingness or inability of an actor to continue with the production for financial or other reasons (including illness, death, or producers' unwillingness to retain an actor) may lead to that character being \"killed off\" or removed from the storyline.\n\nBecause of the episodic format of television shows, audience feedback and approval is often a factor in whether or not a character is killed off. Damon Lindelof, executive producer of \"Lost\", has been quoted as saying that despite the widespread hate for Nikki and Paulo, \"We had a plan when we introduced them, and we didn't get to fully execute that plan. But when the plan is executed, [they] will be iconic characters on the show.\" In an example of a character being killed off as a result of an actor leaving the show, Raymond Cruz's character Tuco Salamanca on \"Breaking Bad\" was killed off because he found the part too difficult to play. Characters may be killed off when the actors die. John Ritter's character in \"8 Simple Rules\" was written to have died off screen after Ritter himself died during taping of the show.\n\nThe Palestinian children's character Farfur (a Mickey Mouse lookalike) is an example of a character \"killed off\" for political reasons in 2007. After the program received criticism from some government ministers in both Palestine and Israel for espousing anti-Israeli sentiments, the Farfur character was killed off. Even his death, at the hands of an \"Israeli agent\", making Farfur a \"martyr\", was similarly politicised.\n\nPriceline.com apparently killed off its lead character, the \"Priceline Negotiator\" (portrayed by longtime company spokesman William Shatner), in an advertisement during Super Bowl XLVI. The killing off, however, turned out to be a hoax, as Shatner returned with his protégé (portrayed by Kaley Cuoco) in later commercials.\n\nBrian Griffin, the talking dog on \"Family Guy\", was killed off in the Season 12 episode, \"Life of Brian\" and was replaced with a new dog, Vinny, voiced by Tony Sirico. Fans of the show were devastated and started a petition in order to bring back Brian. However, Brian was brought back to life two episodes later, in the Christmas episode, \"Christmas Guy\", where Stewie Griffin travels back in time to prevent Brian from being struck by the car that killed him. Creator Seth MacFarlane said on Twitter shortly after the episode aired, \"And thus endeth our warm, fuzzy, holiday lesson: Never take those you love for granted, or they can be gone in a flash. I mean, you didn't think we'd kill off Brian did you? Jesus we'd have to be fucking high.\" It was later revealed in the season 14 episode \"Inside Family Guy\" that he was killed off so that he could work on a remake of \"Old Yeller\", according to Lois.\n\nMaude Flanders, a recurring character and the first wife of Ned Flanders on \"The Simpsons\", was killed off in the Season 11 episode, \"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\" where she is killed by a T-shirt cannon at the Springfield Speedway when Homer ducks at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. This kill off was decided by the show's producers after Maude's voice actress, Maggie Roswell, left The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons. Marcia Mitzman Gaven voiced Maude between 1999 and 2000 and many other of Roswell's characters during this period. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with producers to allow her to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost.\n\nWhen voice actor and Scientologist Isaac Hayes departed \"South Park\" over the show's creators criticism of Scientology in the episode Trapped in the Closet, his character (Chef) was killed off in the episode \"The Return of Chef\". For the episode, voice clips of Chef were taken from previous episodes and linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot.\n\nDeath is a frequently used dramatic device in comic book fiction, and in particular superhero fiction. Unlike stories in television or film, character deaths are rarely by unforeseen behind-the-scenes events, as there is no analogous situation to having actors portraying characters. Instead, characters are typically killed off as part of the story, or occasionally by editorial mandate to generate publicity for a title. Teasers may hint at characters' deaths for an extended period. A number of factors often mean that these changes are not permanent. Due to extremely long print runs, the popularity of these characters (with writers and fans) and occasionally rights issues for using the character in licensed adaptations, characters are often brought back to life by later writers. This can happen either as a depiction of their literal resurrection or by retcon, a revision which changes earlier continuity and establishes the character not to have died in the first place. This phenomenon is known as the comic book death. Killing off a main character such as Superman, Batman or Captain America can often lead to an uptick in publicity for a comic book, as well as high sales for the story in which they are inevitably brought back to life.\n\nSome writers have also criticized the trend for killing off supporting characters, particularly when female characters are killed off brutally to elicit a strong reaction in the male protagonist. This is known as the Women in Refrigerators trope.\nSpecifically, the Death of Gwen Stacy, long-time girlfriend of Spider-Man, caused great shock and long-lasting controversy among fans.\n\n"}

He was responsible for the EU language policy and was the first Romanian Commissioner and the first member of the Commission whose portfolio is exclusively multilingualism. His term of office began on 1 January 2007 and ended on 9 February 2010. With a background in engineering and economics, Orban has taken up various posts working for the accession of Romania to the European Union, most prominently as Deputy and later as Chief Negotiator for his country at the time of final negotiations with the European Union.\n\nSteering the multilingualism language policy of the EU, Orban focused on promoting foreign language learning through EU programmes such as the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. In addition, his remit also included the effective functioning of the EU's extensive interpretation, translation and publication services in the 23 official languages. To support the remit of his portfolio, Orban oversaw a staff of 3,400 in total (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the EU budget.\n\nThough unaffiliated to any political party, Orban adheres to liberalism. He supports Romania's closer European integration and a strong European Union, and were in favour of the relaunch of the frozen Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe without modifications to the original text.\n\nAs of 20 September 2011, he is the Romanian Minister of European Affairs, a new ministry in the Emil Boc Cabinet.\n\nOrban was born in Braşov, central Romania, to a Hungarian father and a Romanian mother. His brother, Ludovic Orban, a prominent politician of Romania's National Liberal Party, was Romania's Transport Minister. He is married and has a daughter, and his personal interests range across foreign policy, classical music, reading and cinema.\n\nOrban gained a bachelor's degree (1981–1986) in engineering at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Transylvania University of Braşov, and a bachelor's degree (1987–1992) in economics at the Faculty of Management, Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies. Alongside Romanian, he is also fluent in English and French and has passive knowledge of Italian.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1993, he worked as engineer for Tractor Manufacturing Company Miercurea Ciuc (1986–1989, Romanian: \"Întreprinderea de Tractoare Miercurea Ciuc\"), Enterprise for Special Industrial Constructions Bucharest (1989–1990, Romanian: \"Întreprinderea de Antrepriza Construcţii Speciale Industriale şi Montaj (I.A.C.S.I.M.) Bucureşti\") and Institute of Research for Machine Manufacturing Technology Bucharest (1990–1993, Romanian: \"Institutul de Cercetare Tehnologia Construcţiilor de Maşini (I.C.T.C.M.) Bucureşti\").\n\nFrom 1993 to 2001, Orban served as a Parliamentary Counsellor on European and International Affairs within the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament, where he was responsible for the European Integration Committee, as well as relations with the European Parliament. In 1995, the Association Agreement between the EU and Romania came into force and Orban also dealt with the Secretariat of the Joint Parliamentary Committee EU-Romania. Between May 2001 and December 2004, he served as Deputy Chief Negotiator and from December 2004 to December 2006, as Chief Negotiator with the EU and as Secretary of State of the Ministry of European Integration of Romania, directly responsible for coordinating Romania's preparation for accession to the EU, as well as drafting the Treaty of Accession. On 25 April 2005, together with the Romanian president Traian Băsescu, the Romanian prime minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu and the Romanian foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, Orban was one of the signatories for Romania on the country's Treaty of Accession in Luxembourg. After the signing of the Treaty, when Romania received the status of the observer in the Council of the European Union and in the Commission's committees, Orban was responsible for coordinating Romania's policies and positions in EU affairs. On 30 October 2006, Orban was nominated as Romania's candidate for the European Commission. From 1 January 2007, Orban became European Commissioner for Multilingualism for Romania in the Barroso commission. He wrote numerous newspaper articles and analyses and gave several speeches on European affairs.\n\nOrban has not joined a political party, but is of liberal political leaning. He participated as an independent in the European Parliament political group Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE).\n\nAs European Commissioner for Multilingualism in the Barroso Commission, Orban was responsible for the language policy of the European Union, i.e. promoting multilingualism for the citizens and the institutions of the European Union. He was the first to hold this portfolio. Multilingualism has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the European Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism, Ján Figeľ, the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism.\n\nPolitically, the portfolio is focused on promoting foreign languages learning, specifically, an individual's mother tongue plus two other languages, as means for the worker’s mobility and business competitiveness.\n\nThough awareness for linguistic diversity is a policy target, the language rights of speakers of regional, minority, lesser-used and migrant languages are not legally protected. In the European Union, language policy is the responsibility of member states and European Union does not have a \"common language policy.\" Based on the \"principle of subsidiarity\", European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field, promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages. The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area. However, a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote language learning, most prominently under the much wider Lifelong learning Programme 2007–2013. Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes, protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states.\n\nOrban was also responsible for the effective functioning of the European Union's extensive interpretation, translation and publication services in the 23 official languages of the Union. Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity. In many of these issues, responsibility was shared with other Commissioners, namely the European Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, Ján Figeľ. Orban was also responsible, alongside the President of the Commission, Barroso, and Figeľ to work on \"intercultural dialogue\", including the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.\n\nAdministratively, Orban was in charge of the Directorate-General (DG) for Translation, the DG for Interpretation and the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, as well as the Multilingualism policy unit (EAC-C-5) in the DG for Education and Culture. In total, Orban is responsible for overseeing 3,400 staff (approximately 15 per cent of the Brussels executive's workforce) and approximately 1 per cent of the EU budget.\n\nOrban was assisted by a cabinet of nine members; Patricia Bugnot (French) was Head of Cabinet and Jochen Richter (German) was Deputy Head. The cabinet did not include any natively anglophone member. Orban's salary was €18,233.38 (approx. US$23,631, c.2007) a month plus housing allowance.\n\nAccording to Article 45 of the protocol to the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania, the new members of the Commission representing the acceding member states were appointed by the Council of the European Union in common accord with the President of the Commission and after consultation with the European Parliament. Compared to former enlargements of the European Union, the Accession Treaty for Bulgaria and Romania, for the first time, contains an explicit acknowledgement of the Parliament’s role and constitutes the formal legal basis for the new Commissioners’ appointment procedure.\n\nOn 30 October 2006, in agreement with the President of the Commission, Barroso, the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania. Barroso assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism. Before Orban, Varujan Vosganian, a former Romanian National Liberal Party Minister of Economy and Commerce, had been nominated, but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under Ceauşescu and party financing by a tycoon. National Liberal Party foreign minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu refused a nomination.\n\nThe assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial. Barroso was severely criticized for creating a new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post. The portfolio was criticized for being too \"light\" for such a high-rank official, that there would be an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered. The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative (rather than political character) of the post. In addition, it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27-strong Commission; Romania's appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician, given the country's deficits in interior and justice policies, especially in terms of corruption, would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio. This criticism came from the Social Democratic Party (PSD), Romania's main opposition party, the Socialist Group (PES) in the European Parliament and the liberal \"Financial Times\" newspaper. Socialist Group leader, Martin Schulz, suggested a portfolio for the protection of ethnic minorities instead. The Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament asked Barroso to clarify the mandate of the Commissioner for Multilingualism as well as the mandate of the other members of the Commission with regards to the \"intercultural dialogue\". Barroso turned down the PES proposal and defended the post. He stated that Ján Figeľ, the Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, \"will remain responsible for the management of actions to directly promote the inter-cultural dialogue\".\n\nAfter a public hearing in Brussels at the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) of the European Parliament in participation with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) on27 November 2006, the Committee gave a positive assessment. On December 12, 2006, Orban received the formal approval of the European Parliament in Strasbourg with 595 votes in favour, 16 against and 29 abstentions. The Socialist Group voted for Orban, laying the blame for the portfolio's mandate on the President of the Commission rather than the Commissioner designate. On 1 January 2007 he was appointed by the Council and on 22 January 2007, in a ceremony in Luxembourg, Orban was sworn in before the European Court of Justice.\n\nOrban held the position of European Commissioner until 31 October 2009, when the remaining term of office for the Barroso Commission ends.\n\nIn his hearing at the European Parliament, Leonard Orban focused on defending the importance of his post in presenting the EU language policy, emphasising foreign language learning and describing the concrete initiatives he intended to implement.\n\nOrban said that he intended to spearhead the Commission's work on a portfolio that has become more important with every enlargement and assured the Members of the European Parliament that his portfolio was a substantial one, covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities. He also described how his portforlio would contribute to economic competitiveness, the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue.\n\nOrban told the Committee that the multilingual dimension of the EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes and should not be seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, \"Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness.\" In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, \"At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [... but] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism.\" According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, \"our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian.\" He added that, \"The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EU's main trading partners.\" Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, \"Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted,\" which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, \"When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States.\"\n\nOrban's remit included the development of the European Indicator of Language Competence, the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and \"Juvenes Translatores\", a translation contest between schools from all over Europe as part of the events marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome. In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 and other educational and cultural programmes, Orban promoted multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes, including the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the European Social Fund and immigration initiatives. He also intended to contribute to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, where multilingualism played a fundamental part. On planning further policy, Orban promised to, \"carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a Ministerial conference to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area.\"\n\nHis views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described in the Communication from the Commission \"A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism\" on 22 November 2005.\n\nOrban defended Romania's accession to the EU, believing that Romania can only gain from its entry and stressing the importance of a post-accession strategy for his country.\n\nOn the \"future of Europe\", Orban believes in a strong, cohesive European Union capable of being a major actor on the global scene. In addition, he stressed the need to increase the pace of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, a ten-year strategy designed to make the European Union the world's most competitive economy by 2010. Institutionally, he supported the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, voted down in referendums in France and Netherlands in 2005, believing that it should be ratified by the member states without further negotiations or without excluding some of its provisions.\n\n"}
{"id": "17967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17967", "title": "Liar paradox", "text": "Liar paradox\n\nIn philosophy and logic, the classical liar paradox or liar's paradox or antinomy of the liar is the statement of a liar that he or she is lying: for instance, declaring that \"I am lying\". If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is telling the truth, which means the liar is lying. In \"this sentence is a lie\" the paradox is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the \"liar paradox\" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar himself. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary truth value leads to a contradiction.\n\nIf \"this sentence is false\" is true, then the sentence is false, but if the sentence states that it is false, and it is false, then it must be true, and so on.\n\nThe Epimenides paradox (circa 600 BC) has been suggested as an example of the liar paradox, but they are not logically equivalent. The semi-mythical seer Epimenides, a Cretan, reportedly stated that \"All Cretans are liars.\" However, Epimenides' statement that all Cretans are liars can be resolved as false, given that he knows of at least one other Cretan who does not lie. It is precisely in order to avoid uncertainties deriving from the human factor and from fuzzy concepts that modern logicians proposed a \"strengthened\" liar such as the sentence \"this sentence is false\". \n\nThe paradox's name translates as \"pseudómenos lógos\" (ψευδόμενος λόγος) in Ancient Greek. One version of the liar paradox is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides of Miletus who lived in the 4th century BC. Eubulides reportedly asked, \"A man says that he is lying. Is what he says true or false?\"\n\nThe paradox was once discussed by St. Jerome in a sermon:\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) was well aware of a liar paradox which he formulated as \"everything I am saying is false\" (sarvam mithyā bravīmi). He analyzes this paradox together with the paradox of \"unsignifiability\" and explores the boundary between statements that are unproblematic in daily life and paradoxes.\n\nIn early Islamic tradition liar paradox was discussed for at least five centuries starting from late 9th century apparently without being influenced by any other tradition. Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī could have been the first logician to identify the liar paradox as self-referential.\n\nThe problem of the liar paradox is that it seems to show that common beliefs about truth and falsity actually lead to a contradiction. Sentences can be constructed that cannot consistently be assigned a truth value even though they are completely in accord with grammar and semantic rules.\n\nThe simplest version of the paradox is the sentence:\n\nIf (A) is true, then \"This statement is false\" is true. Therefore, (A) must be false. The hypothesis that (A) is true leads to the conclusion that (A) is false, a contradiction.\n\nIf (A) is false, then \"This statement is false\" is false. Therefore, (A) must be true. The hypothesis that (A) is false leads to the conclusion that (A) is true, another contradiction. Either way, (A) is both true and false, which is a paradox.\n\nHowever, that the liar sentence can be shown to be true if it is false and false if it is true has led some to conclude that it is \"neither true nor false\". This response to the paradox is, in effect, the rejection of the claim that every statement has to be either true or false, also known as the principle of bivalence, a concept related to the law of the excluded middle.\n\nThe proposal that the statement is neither true nor false has given rise to the following, strengthened version of the paradox:\n\nIf (B) is neither true nor false, then it must be not true. Since this is what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be true. Since initially (B) was not true and is now true, another paradox arises.\n\nAnother reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as Graham Priest has, that the statement is both true and false. Nevertheless, even Priest's analysis is susceptible to the following version of the liar:\n\nIf (C) is both true and false, then (C) is only false. But then, it is not true. Since initially (C) was true and is now not true, it is a paradox. However, it has been argued that by adopting a two-valued relational semantics (as opposed to functional semantics), the dialetheic approach can overcome this version of the Liar.\n\nThere are also multi-sentence versions of the liar paradox. The following is the two-sentence version:\n\nAssume (D1) is true. Then (D2) is true. This would mean that (D1) is false. Therefore, (D1) is both true and false.\n\nAssume (D1) is false. Then (D2) is false. This would mean that (D1) is true. Thus (D1) is both true and false. Either way, (D1) is both true and false - the same paradox as (A) above.\n\nThe multi-sentence version of the liar paradox generalizes to any circular sequence of such statements (wherein the last statement asserts the truth/falsity of the first statement), provided there are an odd number of statements asserting the falsity of their successor; the following is a three-sentence version, with each statement asserting the falsity of its successor:\n\nAssume (E1) is true. Then (E2) is false, which means (E3) is true, and hence (E1) is false, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAssume (E1) is false. Then (E2) is true, which means (E3) is false, and hence (E1) is true. Either way, (E1) is both true and false - the same paradox as with (A) and (D1).\n\nThere are many other variants, and many complements, possible. In normal sentence construction, the simplest version of the complement is the sentence:\n\nIf F is assumed to bear a truth value, then it presents the problem of determining the object of that value. But, a simpler version is possible, by assuming that the single word 'true' bears a truth value. The analogue to the paradox is to assume that the single word 'false' likewise bears a truth value, namely that it is false. This reveals that the paradox can be reduced to the mental act of assuming that the very idea of fallacy bears a truth value, namely that the very idea of fallacy is false: an act of misrepresentation. So, the symmetrical version of the paradox would be:\n\nAlfred Tarski diagnosed the paradox as arising only in languages that are \"semantically closed\", by which he meant a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate truth (or falsehood) of another sentence in the same language (or even of itself). To avoid self-contradiction, it is necessary when discussing truth values to envision levels of languages, each of which can predicate truth (or falsehood) only of languages at a lower level. So, when one sentence refers to the truth-value of another, it is semantically higher. The sentence referred to is part of the \"object language\", while the referring sentence is considered to be a part of a \"meta-language\" with respect to the object language. It is legitimate for sentences in \"languages\" higher on the semantic hierarchy to refer to sentences lower in the \"language\" hierarchy, but not the other way around. This prevents a system from becoming self-referential.\n\nHowever, this system is incomplete. One would like to be able to make statements such as \"For every statement in level \"α\" of the hierarchy, there is a statement at level \"α\"+1 which asserts that the first statement is false.\" This is a true, meaningful statement about the hierarchy that Tarski defines, but it refers to statements at every level of the hierarchy, so it must be above every level of the hierarchy, and is therefore not possible within the hierarchy (although bounded versions of the sentence are possible).\n\nArthur Prior asserts that there is nothing paradoxical about the liar paradox. His claim (which he attributes to Charles Sanders Peirce and John Buridan) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth. Thus, for example, the statement \"It is true that two plus two equals four\" contains no more information than the statement \"two plus two equals four\", because the phrase \"it is true that...\" is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase \"it is true that...\" is equivalent to \"this whole statement is true and ...\".\n\nThus the following two statements are equivalent:\n\nThe latter is a simple contradiction of the form \"A and not A\", and hence is false. There is therefore no paradox because the claim that this two-conjunct Liar is false does not lead to a contradiction. Eugene Mills and Neil Lefebvre and Melissa Schelein present similar answers.\n\nSaul Kripke argued that whether a sentence is paradoxical or not can depend upon contingent facts. If the only thing Smith says about Jones is\n\nand Jones says only these three things about Smith:\n\nIf Smith really is a big spender but is \"not\" soft on crime, then both Smith's remark about Jones and Jones's last remark about Smith are paradoxical.\n\nKripke proposes a solution in the following manner. If a statement's truth value is ultimately tied up in some evaluable fact about the world, that statement is \"grounded\". If not, that statement is \"ungrounded\". Ungrounded statements do not have a truth value. Liar statements and liar-like statements are ungrounded, and therefore have no truth value.\n\nJon Barwise and John Etchemendy propose that the liar sentence (which they interpret as synonymous with the Strengthened Liar) is ambiguous. They base this conclusion on a distinction they make between a \"denial\" and a \"negation\". If the liar means, \"It is not the case that this statement is true\", then it is denying itself. If it means, \"This statement is not true\", then it is negating itself. They go on to argue, based on situation semantics, that the \"denial liar\" can be true without contradiction while the \"negation liar\" can be false without contradiction. Their 1987 book makes heavy use of non-well-founded set theory.\n\nGraham Priest and other logicians, including J.C. Beall, and Bradley Armour-Garb have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as dialetheism. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized principle of explosion, which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism - the view that \"all\" propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle. Logics that reject it are called \"paraconsistent\".\n\nAndrew Irvine has argued in favour of a non-cognitivist solution to the paradox, suggesting that some apparently well-formed sentences will turn out to be neither true nor false and that \"formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient\" for resolving the paradox.\n\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari (late fifth century AD) dealt with paradoxes such as the liar in a section of one of the chapters of his magnum opus the Vākyapadīya. Although chronologically he precedes all modern treatments of the problem of the liar paradox, it has only very recently become possible to confront his views and analyses with those of modern logicians and philosophers because sufficiently reliable editions and translations of his work have only started becoming available since the second half of the 20th century. Bhartrhari's solution fits into his general approach to language, thought and reality, which has been characterized by some as \"relativistic\", \"non-committal\" or \"perspectivistic\". With regard to the liar paradox (\"sarvam mithyā bravīmi\" \"everything I am saying is false\") Bhartrhari identifies a hidden parameter which can change unproblematic situations in daily communication into a stubborn paradox. Bhartrhari's solution can be understood in terms of the solution proposed in 1992 by Julian Roberts: \"Paradoxes consume themselves. But we can keep apart the warring sides of the contradiction by the simple expedient of temporal contextualisation: what is 'true' with respect to one point in time need not be so in another ... The overall force of the 'Austinian' argument is not merely that 'things change', but that rationality is essentially temporal in that we need time in order to reconcile and manage what would otherwise be mutually destructive states.\" According to Robert's suggestion, it is the factor \"time\" which allows us to reconcile the separated \"parts of the world\" that play a crucial role in the solution of Barwise and Etchemendy. The capacity of time to prevent a direct confrontation of the two \"parts of the world\" is here external to the \"liar\". In the light of Bhartrhari's analysis, however, the extension in time which separates two perspectives on the world or two \"parts of the world\" — the part before and the part after the function accomplishes its task — is inherent in any \"function\": also the function to signify which underlies each statement, including the \"liar\". The unsolvable paradox — a situation in which we have either contradiction (\"virodha\") or infinite regress (\"anavasthā\") — arises, in case of the liar and other paradoxes such as the unsignifiability paradox (Bhartrhari's paradox), when abstraction is made from this function (\"vyāpāra\") and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (\"apara vyāpāra\") undoing the previous one.\n\nFor a better understanding of the liar paradox, it is useful to write it down in a more formal way. If \"this statement is false\" is denoted by A and its truth value is being sought, it is necessary to find a condition that restricts the choice of possible truth values of A. Because A is self-referential it is possible to give the condition by an equation.\n\nIf some statement, B, is assumed to be false, one writes, \"B = false\". The statement (C) that the statement B is false would be written as \"C = \"B = false\"\". Now, the liar paradox can be expressed as the statement A, that A is false:\n\n\"A = \"A = false\"\"\n\nThis is an equation from which the truth value of A = \"this statement is false\" could hopefully be obtained. In the boolean domain \"A = false\" is equivalent to \"not A\" and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both \"true\" and \"false\". Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; Arthur Prior claims that the equation should be \"A = 'A = false and A = true'\" and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, \"I hear what he says; he says what I don't hear\", where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox.\n\nGödel's incompleteness theorems are two fundamental theorems of mathematical logic which state inherent limitations of sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems for mathematics. The theorems were proven by Kurt Gödel in 1931, and are important in the philosophy of mathematics. Roughly speaking, in proving the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel used a modified version of the liar paradox, replacing \"this sentence is false\" with \"this sentence is not provable\", called the \"Gödel sentence G\". His proof showed that for any theory \"T\", \"G\" is true, but not provable in \"T\". The analysis of the truth and provability of \"G\" is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.\n\nTo prove the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel represented statements by numbers. Then the theory at hand, which is assumed to prove certain facts about numbers, also proves facts about its own statements. Questions about the provability of statements are represented as questions about the properties of numbers, which would be decidable by the theory if it were complete. In these terms, the Gödel sentence states that no natural number exists with a certain, strange property. A number with this property would encode a proof of the inconsistency of the theory. If there were such a number then the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to the consistency hypothesis. So, under the assumption that the theory is consistent, there is no such number.\n\nIt is not possible to replace \"not provable\" with \"false\" in a Gödel sentence because the predicate \"Q is the Gödel number of a false formula\" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as Tarski's undefinability theorem, was discovered independently by Gödel (when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem) and by Alfred Tarski.\n\nGeorge Boolos has since sketched an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses Berry's paradox rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula.\n\nThe liar paradox is occasionally used in fiction to shut down artificial intelligences, who are presented as being unable to process the sentence. In \"\" episode \"I, Mudd\", the liar paradox is used by Captain Kirk and Harry Mudd to confuse and ultimately disable an android holding them captive. In the 1973 \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Green Death\", the Doctor temporarily stumps the insane computer BOSS by asking it \"If I were to tell you that the next thing I say would be true, but the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?\" However BOSS eventually decides the question is irrelevant and summons security.\n\nIn the 2011 videogame \"Portal 2\", GLaDOS attempts to use the \"this sentence is false\" paradox to defeat the naïve artificial intelligence Wheatley, but, lacking the intelligence to realize the statement a paradox, he simply responds, \"Um, true. I'll go with true. There, that was easy.\" and is unaffected.\n\nIn the seventh episode of \"\" titled \"Access Denied\" the main character Jesse and his friends are captured by a supercomputer named PAMA. After PAMA controls two of Jesse's friends, Jesse learns that PAMA stalls when processing and uses a paradox to confuse him and escape with his last friend. One of the paradoxes the player can make him say is the liar paradox.\n\nIn Douglas Adams The hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, chapter 21 he describes a solitary old man inhabiting a small asteroid in the spatial coordinates where it should have been a whole planet dedicated to Biro (ballpoint pen) life forms. This old man repeatedly claimed that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.\n\n\n"}

His two most famous books, \"Jewish labor in U.S.A.\" and \"The Jew and communism\" are considered standard works.\n\nEpstein was born in Ruzhany, Grodno Guberniya, Imperial Russia (now in Belarus). His family was unsure of his exact birth date, but assigned him March 15, 1889, the second day of Purim. During his teenage years he became active in the Jewish territorialist movement. Beginning shortly before the 1905 revolution he was a cadre in the Zionist Socialist Workers Party in Białystok, Łódź, Warsaw, Kiev and Odessa. His activities included writing for party journals, organizing unions and Jewish cultural societies and, in Białystok manning an armed guard of the Jewish neighborhood during a pogrom. He served three intermittent periods in the Czarist prisons. Becoming dissatisfied with the ultimate aims of the territorialists he emigrated to America in 1913. He arrived at Ellis island on December 24, 1913.\n\nIn New York, Epstein settled in Brownsville, Brooklyn and became involved in the local Jewish radical scene. In 1915 became labor reporter for a new Yiddish daily \"The Day\". Soon he became labor editor, which was an ideal place to observe the burgeoning Jewish labor and radical movements. After \"The Day\" came out in favor of foreign intervention against the Bolsheviks Epstein left the paper and joined the staff of \"Zeit\", a Labor Zionist paper edited by David Pinsky. While working for \"Zeit\" he exposed financial improprieties involving Lucy Lang, the \"Forward\" and the United Hebrew Trades. As a result, the UHT forced his expulsion from its affiliate, the Yiddish Writers Union, which Epstein had helped to found in 1917. Despairing of mainstream union bureaucracy, he left the Socialist party in 1921, as part of the Workers Council of the United States. When this group merged with the communists to form the Workers Party of America Epstein was offered a place as labor editor on the communists' new Yiddish daily, \"Morgen Freiheit\".\n\nAfter a factional skirmish Epstein was made acting editor in 1923 and official editor in 1925. As editor he tried to steer the \"Freiheit\" into a more broad left direction and resisted pressures to make its content dogmatically communist. A member of the Lovestone faction within the party he resigned the editorship in spring 1929 during intense factional warfare within the party. In August 1929 both Epstein and Moissaye Joseph Olgin, the new \"Freiheit\" editor were censured by the party for taking a pro-Yishuv stand in reporting on the out break of violence in Palestine. Under party pressure the paper changed its analysis reporting the revolt as a national liberation movement against the British and their Zionist collaborators. That fall Epstein was relieved of all other party offices and was sent to the Soviet Union to \"improve his communist morale\".\n\nHe returned in 1931. No longer on the staff of \"Freiheit\", he became educational director of the TUUL Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union and editor of its weekly \"Needle Worker\". He was allowed to return to the \"Freiheit\" during the transition to the popular front period in the mid-1930s. In 1936 he was sent to Palestine, officially as a \"Freiheit\" correspondent, but actually as an emissary to the Palestine Communist Party. The out break of yet another revolt strained relations between the CPUSA and American Jewry. The Comintern was silent on what stance to take, so they decided to send a personal envoy to the sister party to co-ordinate strategy. Epstein learned that the party was being rapidly \"Arabized\" and was taking a more and militant stand against the Zionists and the Yishuv in general. While in Palestine Epstein learned of the out break of the Spanish Civil War. Without waiting for word from the party or \"Freiheit\" he sailed to Barcelona and became one of the first American journalists on the scene. He stayed in Spain for three months sending dispatches back to \"Freiheit\"from the front lines.\n\nMelech Epstein broke with the party in August, 1939 after the Nazi-Soviet pact. This was the final event which sealed his disillusionment with the party, though he had been having misgivings for a decade since the beginning of the Third Period and then the show trials in the late 1930s. He went off to Mexico where he visited Leon Trotsky and Diego Riviera. When he came back to America he briefly joined the staff of \"The Forward\", but was fired soon after because he wouldn't go before the Dies committee or write sensationalistic material about the Communist Party. In 1943 he was hired by the Jewish Labor Committee to go on fund raising tours for the underground Jewish resistance movement in Poland. Finally, in 1945 he became public relations director of the Cloakmakers Joint Board of ILGWU.\n\nIn the fall of 1947 he settled in Florida. There he wrote his two major books \"Jewish labor in U.S.A.\" and \"The Jew and communism\", independently published through a \"Trade Union Sponsoring Committee\" which was partly funded by ILGWU.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the most significant voices in late 20th-century Irish writing and has been called \"Munster's de facto poet laureate\".\n\nHartnett was born in Croom Hospital, County Clare. Although his parents' name was Harnett, he was registered in error as Hartnett on his birth certificate. In later life he declined to change this as his legal name was closer to the Irish Ó hAirtnéide. He grew up in the Maiden Street area of Newcastle West, Co. Limerick, spending much of his time with his grandmother Bridget Halpin, who resided in the townland of Camas, in the countryside nearby. Hartnett claimed that his grandmother, was one of the last native speakers to live in Co. Limerick, though she was originally from North Kerry. He claims that, although she spoke to him mainly in English, he would listen to her conversing with her friends in Irish, and as such, he was quite unaware of the imbalances between English and Irish, since he experienced the free interchange of both languages. When he began school, he claims that he was made aware of the tensions between both languages, and was surprised to discover that Irish was considered an endangered language, taught as a contrived, rule-laden code, with little of the literary attraction which it held for him. He was educated in the local national and secondary schools in Newcastle West. Hartnett emigrated to England the day after he finished his secondary education and went to work as a tea boy on a building site in London.\n\nHartnett had started writing by this time and his work came to the attention of the poet John Jordan, who was professor of English at University College Dublin. Jordan invited Hartnett to attend the university for a year. While back in Dublin, he co-edited the literary magazine \"Arena\" with James Liddy. He also worked as curator of Joyce's tower at Sandycove for a time. He returned briefly to London, where he met Rosemary Grantley on 16 May 1965, and they were married on 4 April 1966. His first book, \"Anatomy of a Cliché\", was published by Poetry Ireland in 1968 to critical acclaim and he returned to live permanently in Dublin that same year.\n\nHe worked as a night telephonist at the telephone exchange on Exchequer Street. He now entered a productive relationship with New Writers Press, run by Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce. They published his next three books. The first of these was a translation from the Irish, \"The Old Hag of Beare\" (1969), followed by \"Selected Poems\" (1970) and \"Tao\" (1972). This last book was a version of the Chinese \"Tao Te Ching\". His \"Gypsy Ballads\" (1973), a translation of the \"Romancero Gitano\" of Federico García Lorca was published by the Goldsmith Press.\n\nIn 1974 Hartnett decided to leave Dublin to return to his rural roots, as well as deepen his relationship with the Irish language. He went to live in Templeglantine, five miles from Newcastle West, and worked for a time as a lecturer in creative writing at Thomond College of Education, Limerick.\n\nIn his 1975 book \"A Farewell to English\" he declared his intention to write only in Irish in the future, describing English as 'the perfect language to sell pigs in'. A number of volumes in Irish followed: \"Adharca Broic\" (1978), \"An Phurgóid\" (1983) and \"Do Nuala: Foighne Chrainn\" (1984).\nA biography on this period of Michael Hartnett's life entitled 'A Rebel Act Michael Hartnett's Farewell To English' by Pat Walsh was published in 2012 by Mercier Press.\n\nIn 1984 he returned to Dublin to live in the suburb of Inchicore. The following year marked his return to English with the publication of \"Inchicore Haiku\", a book that deals with the turbulent events in his personal life over the previous few years. This was followed by a number of books in English including \"A Necklace of Wrens\" (1987), \"Poems to Younger Women\" (1989) and \"The Killing of Dreams\" (1992).\n\nHe also continued working in Irish, and produced a sequence of important volumes of translation of classic works into English. These included \"Ó Bruadair, Selected Poems of Dáibhí Ó Bruadair\" (1985) and \"Ó Rathaille The Poems of Aodhaghán Ó Rathaille\" (1999). His \"Collected Poems\" appeared in two volumes in 1984 and 1987 and \"New and Selected Poems\" in 1995. Hartnett died from Alcoholic Liver Syndrome. A new \"Collected Poems\" appeared in 2001.\n\nEvery April a literary and arts festival is held in Newcastle West in honour of Michael Hartnett. Events are organised throughout the town and a memorial lecture is given by a distinguished guest. Former speakers include Nuala O'Faolain, Paul Durcan, David Whyte and Fintan O'Toole. The annual Michael Hartnett Poetry Award of 6500 euro also forms part of the festival. Funded by the Limerick County Arts Office and the Arts Council of Ireland, it is intended to support and encourage poets in the furtherance of their writing endeavours. Previous winners include Sinéad Morrissey and Peter Sirr.\n\nDuring the 2011 Éigse, Paul Durcan unveiled a bronze life-sized statue of Michael Hartnett sculpted by Rory Breslin, in the Square, Newcastle West. Hartnett's son Niall spoke at the unveiling ceremony.\n\n\n\n"}

He has so far produced two short story collection and five novels in Punjabi. Most of his work has been transliterated in Gurumukhi script in Indian Punjab.\nBeside his Punjabi works, he is a well known Urdu and Punjabi poet.\n\nMir Tanha Yousufi started his literary voyage as an Urdu poet. Since 1972, when he was an undergraduate science student, he kept sending his ghazals and poems to various literary magazines and literary pages of national news papers.\n\nFrom 1986 onwards he continued contributing poems, ghazals and short stories to Urdu magazines including:\n“Fanoon (Lahore)” edited by late Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi,\n“Takhleeq (Lahore)” edited by Azhar Javed,\n\"Moaasir (Lahore)” edited by Ata-ul-Haq Qasimi,\n“Adabiyat (Pakistan Academy of Letters' quarterly magazine) and\n“Kitab (Literary magazine of Pakistan Book Foundation).\n\nHis first Urdu poetry collection “Luknat(Fumbling)\" was published in 1996. It contains modern as well as traditionally styled ghazals with a handful of poems (free versed as well as metered). The book was received with a critical acclaim and appreciation from the contemporary men of letters.\n\nSecond collection of Urdu poetry is ready to go to the press. The contents of this book would be styled similar to the \"Luknat\". A good portion of this next Urdu poetry collection has already been contributed to various magazines.\n\nAlthough Yousufi has a good number of Urdu short stories; both in post modern and plain traditional style, yet the matter is not sufficient to be presented in the form of a book. He does believe in quantity, yet he feel that quality is of prime importance which is a must for any creative piece of work.\nA few of his Urdu Afsanas have been published in magazines.\n\nPunjabi being his mother tongue; it was but natural to keep moving between Urdu poetry to Punjabi poetry. This drove him to write Punjabi prose as well, which he did with consistency and ended up with the publication of his first book in Punjabi. Some of these magazines are listed as:\n“Sver International” edited by Jamil Paul,\n“Rvel” and “Meeti” edited by Ilyas Ghumman,\n“Lehraan” edited by Akhter Hussain Akhter and\n\"Pancham\" edited by Saqib Maqsood.\n\nYousufi's first Punjabi short story collection “Sooraj Uggan Taa’en [Till the Sun Rises]\" was published in 1996. This book proved to be his introduction in Punjabi literary world.\n\nAnd here entered Ilyas Ghumman in his life. Ilyas Ghumman, an electrical engineer by profession, is a Lahore-based renowned Punjabi writer, worker and publisher. He has a world fame for organising events regarding the development and progress of Punjabi language, literature and culture. He asked Yousufi to try his pen for writing down some novelette/novel. This suggestion of Ghumman drove Mir Tanha Yousufi to produce his first Punjabi novel\n\n“Treh {Thirst}\" in 1998. Fluently written, clear in thoughts, rushing story lines and the purity of the language made this book a surprise for the Punjabi readers.\n\nSeeing the response on \"Treh\", Mir Tanha Yousufi was asked for more. Thus his second novel \"Ik Samandar Paar [Across One Sea]\", published in 2000, won the prestigious Punjabi literary award from \"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust\".\n\n“Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award\" is regarded as the most respectable of all awards in Punjabi. It is well known in Pakistani Punjabi writers' community what \"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award\" actually means. Some writers spent their life span to win it just for once!\n\nTaking further courage, he penned down his next novel \"Khiddoo [The Cotton Ball]\"; which won the award from \"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust\" for the second time, in the year 2002.\n\nDuring all these years of writing \"Treh\", \"Ik Samandar Paar\" and \"Khiddoo\", along with his continuous activities in other Urdu and Punjabi writings (both poetry and prose), he had been thinking to write down something real big, a saga in Punjabi language. A deep research work, knowledge of the history and geography of the backdrop locale of the novel, the study of the civilisation, culture and anthropology of area was needed. And thus, was written his Pakistan's \"National Literary Award, 2005\" or \"Syed Waris Shah Award, 2005\" winner Punjabi novel \"Kaalaa Chaanan [Black Light]\"; which spans over 728 pages and is the thickest novel in Punjabi published in Pakistan till 2005.\nWhen \"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award\" for 2005 was made public; \"Kaalaa Chaanan\" was declared a winner and by this achievement Mir Tanha Yousufi became a writer who had won \"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award\" three times in a row—a hat trick—a unique honour for any Pakistani Punjabi writer.\n\nTo cater the demand of Punjabi loving people, the short stories written after \"Sooraj Uggan Taen\" were collected. These stories had been published in various Punjabi magazines and kept making waves all these years due to style, language and intellect. The book was named \"Tae Faer [Then What?]\"and was published in 2005.\n\nThis book picked up \"Pakistan Writers' Guild Punjab's Best Prose Book in Punjabi printed in 2005.\nThe same book was judged for \"Razia Farrukh Kahani Award, 2005\" and was announced the Best Short Stories' Book of the year.\n\n2005 remains a milestone and memorable year for Mir Tanha Yousufi's writing career with 4 awards on two books.\n\nHis latest novel \"Annha Khooh [Abandoned Well]\" was published in 2008 and this novel too, got \"Masood Khaddar Posh Trust's Award\".\nThis makes Mir Tanha Yousufi a unique writer with 4 consecutive Masood Khaddar Posh Trust Awards.\n\nA lot of Yousufi's Punjabi poetry has been published in various Punjabi magazines in Pakistan. Being well known as a poet, his readers are waiting his over due collection of poetry.\n\n\n1: Transliteration of his Punjabi novels (which are published in Shahmukhi or Urdu Script in Pakistan) into Gurumukhi (the East Punjab Script of India) has already taken place. This, in a way, shows the popularity of his writings across the borders. \n2: He has been invited to visit various literary gatherings around the world, especially India and UK, but could not manage due to his uncertain work schedule as Geologist in the field. \n3: \"Ik Samadar Paar\" has been approved as \"extra study book\" for M.A. Punjabi Literature's exams at Guru Nanak Dev University, India. \n4: Many of his short stories have been published in India and other countries where Punjabi in read and spoken.\n5: A good number of his short stories have been included in many \"Best Short Stories of Punjabi\" selections, both in Pakistan and elsewhere. \n6: Some of his Punjabi short stories have been translated in Pakistan's national language, Urdu.\n\n\n"}

She was the founder of the Social-Democratic Party of Albania in 1943. Kokalari was the first female writer of Albania. After a short involvement in politics during World War II, she was persecuted by the communist regime in Albania, and not allowed to write anymore. She died in poverty and complete isolation.\n\nMusine Kokalari was born on February 10, 1917 in Adana in southern Turkey of a patriotic and politically active family of Gjirokastrian origin. She returned to Albania with her family in 1920. Musine was early to acquire a taste for books and learning since her brother Vesim operated a bookstore in Tirana in the mid 1930s. In January 1938, she left for Rome to study literature at the university there and graduated in 1941 with a thesis on Naim Frashëri. Her stay in the eternal city gave her an ephemeral glimpse into a fascinating world of intellectual creativity and her sole aim in life upon her return to Albania was to become a writer.\n\nIn 1943, she declared to a friend, \"I want to write, to write, only to write literature, and to have nothing to do with politics.\"\n\nShe had, at the age of twenty-four, indeed already published an initial 80-page collection of ten youthful prose tales in her native Gjirokastrian dialect: \"As my old mother tells me\" (), Tirana, 1941. This historic collection, strongly inspired by Tosk folklore and by the day-by-day struggles of women of Gjirokastër, is thought to be the first work of literature ever written and published by a woman in Albania. Their value consists of the very lively dialect of Gjirokastër and the prevailing mores of the region. Kokalari called the book, \"the mirror of a world gone by, the path of transition from girlhood with its melodies and the first years of marriage to the world of the grown woman, once again bound by the heavy chains of slavery to patriarchal fanaticism.\"\n\nThree years later, despite the vicissitudes of World War II, Kokalari now twenty-seven, was able to publish a longer collection of short stories and sketches entitled \"How life swayed\" (), Tirana, 1944, a total of 348-pages which established her—ever so briefly—as a writer of substance. A third volume of her folksy tales was entitled \"Around the Hearth\" (), Tirana, 1944.\n\nAs World War II came to an end, Kokalari herself opened a bookstore and was invited to become a member of the Albanian League of Writers and Artists, created on October 7, 1945 under the chairmanship of Sejfulla Malëshova. All the time she was haunted by the execution without trial of her two brothers, Mumtaz and Vejsim, on November 12, 1944 by the communists and candidly demanded justice and retribution. Having herself been closely associated in 1944 with the fledgling Albanian Social-Democratic party and its press organ \"Zëri i lirisë\" (\"The voice of freedom\"), she was arrested on January 17, 1946 in an age of terror concomitant with the arrest of Malëshova, and on July 2, 1946 was sentenced to twenty years in prison by the military court of Tirana as a \"saboteur and enemy of the people.\"\n\nRight before her arrest Kokalari had sent a letter to the Allied Forces, which were still based in the Albanian capital, Tirana. In her letter she called for free elections and freedom of expression. At the trial, Kokalari stated the following:\nI don't need to be a communist to love my country. I love my country even though I am not a communist. I love its progress. You boast that you have won the war, and now you are the winner you want to extinguish those who you call political opponents. I think differently from you but I love my country. You are punishing me for my ideals!\nIn 1964, after 18 years in the Prison of Burrel in the District of Mat region, isolated and under constant surveillance, she spent the following next 19 years of her life in internment in the town of Rrëshen, Northern Albania, where she had to work as a streetsweeper. She was never allowed to resume her writing.\n\nKokalari was one of the first 30 imprisoned writers to be listed in 1960 by the Committee of the Three (precursor of International PEN). In 1993 Kokalari was posthumously declared a \"Martyr of Democracy\" by the President of Albania and a school in Tirana now bears her name.\n\n\n\"This article contains information from Frosina.org and it is used with permission.\"\nMuch of this text appears in: Robert Elsie, \"Albanian literature: a short history\", Centre for Albanian Studies, London 2005, p. 157.\n"}

He is remembered by many as a great visionary who promoted human fraternity and multilingualism.\n\nHe received his bachelor's degree in Law, and his master's degree in Arts from the University College, Trivandrum, India. \"After his degree at the age of 21, he stumbled up on an advertisement for the post of a lecturer in a High School in the city of Mysore.\" He acquired the position. After a few years, Kasturi began to \"seriously contemplate on a career in Law.\"\n\nAround 1928 he served as a lecturer in Maharaja's College of Arts (affiliated to the Mysore University). He served as the Secretary of the Sri Ramakrishna Mission in Mysore for over seventeen years. During these years he came into contact with Sri Siddharudha Swami, Ramana Maharshi, Meher Baba, and Narayana Guru; and was initiated into Japam by Mahapurushji, the direct disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He met Sathya Sai Baba in the year 1948 in Bangalore. In his first meeting with Sathya Sai Baba, Sai Baba related, \"\"After retiring from the University, stay with Me. You can write My biography.\" \"Me?\" Kasturi replied. \"Yes, I shall tell you whom to consult for details – parents, brothers, kinsmen, neighbours, teachers, etc. I shall also help.\" It was July 1948.\" He began to write the life of Sathya Sai Baba and published it as \"Sathyam Sivam Sundaram\" Part I. He later became the editor of the magazine of the Sathya Sai Organization, called \"Sanathana Sarathi\".\n\nIn 1949, \"a University Order sent Mr. Kasturi to the Intermediate College, Davangere as its Principal.\"\nKasturi stayed on for five years and then retired. \"When he retired in 1954 with a full year's pension, Swami (Sai Baba) suggested that he go on a spiritual pilgrimage to North India taking his mother and wife along.\"\n\nIn 1956, Sathya Sai Baba suggested, and in spite of Kasturi's reluctance, \"convinced him to accept the offer of the post of Producer of Programmes for the newly established All India Radio Station, Bangalore.\"\n\nKasturi enjoyed the post immensely, and \"during a visit to Bangalore in 1958, (Sathya Sai Baba) spotted him (Kasturi) at the residence of Mr. Vittal Rao and said, \"Now, you have to work at Puttaparthi. A monthly magazine will start soon. Guess! How is it named?\" \n\"In the initial days of \"Sanathana Sarathi\", with no professional or skilled help of any kind, be it in writing and editing to printing, pasting and parceling, it was a tremendous responsibility for Professor Kasturi to ensure that the issue, flawless in every aspect, reached the readers on time.\"\n\nMrs. Geeta Ram, who watched and played with Professor Kasturi as a tiny girl in those days, recalls, \"The whole process of type-setting would be repeated so many times. After the sheets were printed, the ink would still be wet. They would then have to be spread all over the floor to dry, so the ink would not smear. Later, the pages were carefully collated, stapled together, packed and addressed in preparation for mailing – all done by hand. Although there were a few volunteers to help him, I remember Professor Kasturi doing all these jobs, month in and month out, for so many years. This was truly his labor of love for Swami (Sathya Sai Baba).\"\n\nKasturi authored the work \"Sathyam Sivam Sundaram\" (\"The Life of Sathya Sai Baba\"), which was translated into English as \"Truth, Goodness, Beauty\". The first part of book was published in 1960. As Kasturi states, it \"is the story of the Lord, come in human form,\". The first book covers the first thirty four years of the life of Sathya Sai Baba. Kasturi states that he wrote about the early years of Sathya Sai Baba's life based on information gathered from Pedda-Venkapa Raju (Sai Baba's Father), Seshama Raju (Sai Baba's brother) and teachers from the schools in Bukkapatnam and Uravakonda, where Sathyanarayana Raju (Sai Baba) was a student. The second part of the book was published in 1968 and closed the first volume of \"Sathyam Sivam Sundaram\". Kasturi states that \"ten eventful years had pass(ed)\" between the publications of parts three and four. The second volume (and complete \"Sathyam Sivam Sundaram\") was published around 1980.\n\n\"“He was no ordinary man, a scholar par excellence and a matchless writer,” says Anil Kumar\" of Kasturi. He also proved his talent as a writer in the Kannada language, especially as a humourist as his writing was packed with humour and contained many jokes. He wrote more than 1000 articles. According to some sources, he named Mysore Radio station \"Akashavani\" while working for Gopalan. Narayana Kasturi translated the famous Malayalam novel \"Chemmeen\" into Kannada. N Kasturi (sometimes referred to as Na. Kasturi) was a regular contributor to the \"Koravanji\".\n\n\"Koravanji\", which he began on Ugadi Day in 1942, enjoyed a circulation of nearly two lakh (two hundred thousand). Rashi himself wrote the column \"Koravavalokana\", and was responsible in bringing the latent talents of many young writers to light. Some well-known names include Kefa, Bulla, Aa. Ra. Se, Na. Kasturi, C.K.N. Raja, Girani Ramsami, and T. Sunandamma. Though the magazine ceased publication in 1967 due to financial constraints, many of its writers remained in the field. Magazines devoted to humour came to the market, but none seemed to match the success of \"Koravanji\".\n\n\"People may come and go, there may be many speakers and writers, any number in the past, numerous in the present and many more in the future, but none can equal Kasturi in the art of oration and narration. His poetic style, nectarine language, convincing candour, and his soft and tender, appealing and devoted voice… Professor Kasturi is a legend, a personality too extraordinary to imitate or emulate,” says Professor Anil Kumar.\"\n\nAccording to Lawrence A. Babb, virtually all existing accounts of Sathya Sai Baba's life were based on the hagiographic writings of Narayana Kasturi. In 2000, a highly detailed account of the first twenty four years of Sathya Sai Baba's life was published. The author stated he was \"eternally grateful to Professor N. Kasturi, the first official biographer of (Sai) Baba. At every stage, his magnum opus, \"Sathyam Sivam Sundaram\", has served as a pathway into the life of (Sai) Baba.\"\n\nKasturi's autobiography. entitled \"Loving God: Eighty-five Years under the Watchful Eye of the Lord\", was published in 1982 by Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications.\n\n"}

Cooper and his colleagues, including John M. Borst and Caryl Haskins, at Haskins Laboratories in the late 1940s and completed in 1950. There were several different versions of this hardware device. Only one currently survives. The machine converts pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech in the form of a spectrogram back into sound. Using this device, Alvin Liberman, Frank Cooper, and Pierre Delattre (later joined by Katherine Safford Harris, Leigh Lisker, and others) were able to discover acoustic cues for the perception of phonetic segments (consonants and vowels). This research was fundamental to the development of modern techniques of speech synthesis, reading machines for the blind, the study of speech perception and speech recognition, and the development of the motor theory of speech perception.\n\nTo create sound, the pattern playback machine uses an arc light source which is directed against a rotating disk with 50 concentric tracks whose transparencies vary systematically in order to produce 50 harmonics of a fundamental frequency. The light is further projected against a spectrogram whose reflectance corresponds to the sound pressure level of the partial of the signal, and is then directed towards a photovoltaic cell by which the light variation is converted into sound pressure variations.\n\nThe pattern playback was last used in an experimental study by Robert Remez in 1976. The pattern playback now resides in the Museum at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nThe technique of pattern playback also now refers, more generally, to algorithms or techniques for converting spectrograms, cochleagrams, and correlograms from pictures back into sounds.\n\nIn the 1970s, digital pattern playbacks began to supplant the earlier version. In early prototype was developed at Haskins Laboratories which combined a \"Ubiquitous Spectrum Analyzer\" for automatic spectral analysis, along with a VAX GT-40 display processor for graphic manipulation of the displayed spectrogram, a form of \"synthesis by art\", and subsequent re-synthesis using a 40 channel filter bank. This hybrid hardware/software digital pattern playback was eventually replaced at Haskins Laboratories by the HADES software system, designed by Philip Rubin, and implemented in Fortran on the VAX family of computers. A more modern version has been described by Arai and colleagues .\n\n\n"}

He is known for his detailed\nexegesis of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, and his outspoken conceptual critique of cognitive neuroscience.\n\nPeter Hacker studied philosophy, politics and economics at The Queen's College, Oxford from 1960–63. In 1963–65 he was senior Scholar at St Antony's College, Oxford, where he began graduate work under the supervision of Professor H. L. A. Hart. His D.Phil thesis \"Rules and Duties\" was completed in 1966 during a Junior Research Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford.\n\nSince 1966 Peter Hacker has been a fellow of St John's College, Oxford, and a member of the Oxford University philosophy faculty. His visiting positions at other universities include Makerere College, Uganda (1968); Swarthmore College, US (1973 and 1986); University of Michigan, (1974); Milton C. Scott visiting professor at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada (1985); Visiting Fellow in Humanities\nat University of Bologna, Italy (2009).\nFrom 1985 to 1987 he was a British Academy Research Reader in the Humanities. In 1991–94 he was a Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellow. Peter Hacker retired from Oxford in 2006, but he has been appointed an Emeritus Research Fellow of St John's College, Oxford and is presently Professor of Philosophy at the University of Kent.\n\nPeter Hacker is one of the most powerful contemporary exponents of the linguistic-therapeutic approach to philosophy pioneered by Ludwig Wittgenstein. In this approach, the words and concepts used by the language community are taken as given, and the role of philosophy is to resolve or dissolve philosophical problems by giving an overview of the uses of these words and the structural relationships between these concepts. Philosophical inquiry is therefore very different from scientific inquiry, and Hacker maintains accordingly that there is a sharp dividing line between the two: \"Philosophy is not a contribution to human knowledge, but to human understanding\" (quoted from \"An Orrery of Intentionality\"). This has led him into direct disagreement with \"neuro-philosophers\": neuroscientists or philosophers such as Antonio Damasio and Daniel Dennett who think that neuroscience can shed light on philosophical questions such as the nature of consciousness or the mind-body problem. Hacker maintains that these, like all philosophical problems, are not real problems at all, but mirages arising from conceptual confusion. It follows that scientific inquiry (learning more facts about humans or the world) does not help to resolve them.\nHis 2003 book \"Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience\", co-authored with neuroscientist Max Bennett, contains an exposition of these views, and critiques of the ideas of many contemporary neuroscientists and philosophers, including Francis Crick, Antonio Damasio, Daniel Dennett, John Searle, and others.\n\nHacker in general finds many received components of current philosophy of mind to be incoherent. He rejects mind-brain identity theories, as well as functionalism, eliminativism and other forms of reductionism. He advocates methodological pluralism, denying that standard explanations of human conduct are causal, and insisting on the irreducibility of explanation in terms of reasons and goals. He denies that psychological attributes can be intelligibly ascribed to the brain, insisting that they are ascribable only to the human being as a whole. He has endeavoured to show that the puzzles and 'mysteries' of consciousness dissolve under careful analysis of the various forms of intransitive and transitive consciousness, and that so-called qualia are no more than a philosopher's fiction. Together with M.R. Bennett, Hacker has stated that the eliminative materialist inevitably \"saws off the branch on which he is seated.\" In the name of reason, truth, and science, he destroys all reason, truth, and science.\n\nHacker has frequently collaborated with fellow Oxford philosopher G. P. Baker.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3910890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3910890", "title": "Projective identification", "text": "Projective identification\n\nProjective identification is a term introduced by Melanie Klein to describe the process whereby in a close relationship, as between mother and child, lovers, or therapist and patient, parts of the self may in unconscious fantasy be thought of as being forced into the other person.\n\nWhile based on Freud's concept of psychological projection, projective identification represents a step beyond. In R.D. Laing's words, \"The one person does not use the other merely as a hook to hang projections on. He/she strives to find in the other, or to induce the other to become, the very embodiment of projection\". Feelings which can not be consciously accessed are defensively projected into another person in order to evoke the thoughts or feelings projected.\n\nProjective identification may be used as a type of defense, a means of communicating, a primitive form of relationship, or a route to psychological change; used for ridding the self of unwanted parts or for controlling the other's body and mind.\n\nThough a difficult concept for the conscious mind to come to terms with, since its primitive nature makes its operation or interpretation seem more like magic or art than science, projective identification is nonetheless a powerful tool of interpersonal communication.\n\nThe recipient of the projection may suffer a loss of both identity and insight as they are caught up in and manipulated by the other person's fantasy. One therapist, for example, describes how \"I felt the progressive extrusion of his internalized mother into me, not as a theoretical construct but in actual experience. The intonation of my voice altered, became higher with the distinctly \"Ur-mutter\" quality.\" If the projection can be accepted and understood, however, much insight into the projector will be obtained.\n\nProjective identification differs from simple projection in that projective identification can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby a person, believing something false about another, influences or coerces that other person to carry out that precise projection. In extreme cases, the recipient may lose any sense of their real self and become reduced to the passive carrier of outside projections, as if possessed by them.\n\nThe objects (feelings, attitudes) extruded in projective identification are of various kinds – both good and bad, ideal and abjected.\n\nHope may be projected by a client into their therapist, when they can no longer consciously feel it themselves; equally, it may be a fear of (psychic) dying which is projected.\n\nAggression may be projected, leaving the projector's personality diminished and reduced; alternatively it may be desire, leaving the projector feeling asexual.\n\nThe good/ideal parts of the personality may be projected, leading to dependence upon the object of identification; equally it may be jealousy or envy that are projected, perhaps by the therapist into the client.\n\nProjective identification may take place with varying degrees of intensity.\n\nIn narcissism, extremely powerful projections may take place and obliterate the distinction between self and other.\n\nIn less disturbed personalities, projective identification is not only a way of getting rid of feelings but also of getting help with them.\n\nIn an emotionally balanced person, projective identification may act as a bridge to empathy and intuitive understanding.\n\nVarious types of projective identification have been distinguished over the years:\n\nA division has also been made between normal projective identification and pathological projective identification, where what is projected is splintered into minute pieces before the projection takes place.\n\nAs with transference and countertransference, projective identification can be a potential key to therapeutic understanding, especially where the therapist is able to tolerate and contain the unwanted, negative aspects of the patient's self over time.\n\nTransactional analysis emphasizes the need for the therapist's Adult to remain uncontaminated, if the experience of the client's projective identification is to be usefully understood.\n\nRelationship problems have been linked to the way there can be a division of emotional labour in a couple, by way of projective identification, with one partner carrying projected aspects of the other for them. Thus one partner may carry all the aggression or all the competence in the relationship, the other all the vulnerability.\n\nJungians describe the resultant dynamics as characterising a so-called \"wounded couple\" – projective identification ensuring that each carries the most ideal or the most primitive parts of their counterpart. The two partners may initially have been singled out for that very readiness to carry parts of each other's self; but the projected inner conflicts/division then come to be replicated in the partnership itself.\n\nConscious resistance to such projective identification may produce on the one side guilt for refusing to enact the projection, on the other bitter rage at the thwarting of the projection.\n\n\n\nR.

However, the movement never moved into apostasy and has its basis in the Islamic thought of equality of races and nations.\n\nIn the late 8th and early 9th centuries, there was a resurgence of Persian national identity. This came about after years of oppression by the Abbasid Caliphate. The movement left substantial records in the form of Persian literature and new forms of poetry. Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to Egyptians, Berbers and Arameans are attested.\n\nTwo centuries after the end of the Shu'ubiyyah movement in the east, another form of the movement came about in Islamic Spain and was controlled by Muladi (Iberian Muslims). It was fueled mainly by the Berbers, but included many European cultural groups as well including Galicians, Catalans (known by that time as Franks), Calabrians, and Basques. A notable example of \"Shu'ubi\" literature is the epistle (\"risala\") of the Andalusian poet Ibn Gharsiya (Garcia). According to the \"Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature\", however, this epistle was merely of minor importance, and its few exponents tended to repeat clichés adopted from the earlier Islamic East, e.g., Iran.\n\nIn 1966, Sami Hanna and G.H. Gardner wrote an article \"Al-Shu‘ubiyah Updated\" in the Middle East Journal. The Dutch university professor Leonard C. Biegel, in his 1972 book \"Minorities in the Middle East: Their significance as political factor in the Arab World\", coined from the article of Hanna and Gardner the term \"Neo-Shu'ubiyah\" to name the modern attempts of alternative non-Arab and often non-Muslim nationalisms in the Middle East, e.g. Assyrian nationalism, Kurdish nationalism, Pharaonism, Phoenicianism, Syrian nationalism.<ref>Leonard C.

Sprigging uses no soil with the plant, and is an alternative to seeding (planting seeds directly), plugging (transplanting plugs with intact soil and roots), and sodding (installing harvested sheets of sod).\n\nStolonizing is essentially broadcast sprigging, using cut stolons and rhizomes spread uniformly over an area mechanically or by hand, then covered with soil or pressed into the planting bed by various means.\n\nHydrosprigging, similar to hydroseeding, is the use of sprigs or cut stolons and rhizomes in a slurry of fertilizer, mulch, and binding agent, sprayed with a hose over a target area. This can be effective in areas sensitive to soil surface disturbance, such as eroding shorelines, hillsides or other slopes of varying steepness, or in diversion channels. The slurry can be sprayed over from a hose.\n"}
{"id": "1303474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1303474", "title": "Teeline Shorthand", "text": "Teeline Shorthand\n\nTeeline is a shorthand system developed in 1968 by James Hill, a teacher of Pitman Shorthand. It is accepted by the National Council for the Training of Journalists, which certifies the training of journalists in the United Kingdom. \n\nIt is mainly used within the Commonwealth, but can be adapted for use by Germanic languages such as German and Swedish. Its strength over other forms of shorthand is fast learning, and speeds of up to 150 words per minute are possible, with it being common for users to create their own word groupings, increasing their speed.\n\nTeeline shorthand is a streamlined way to transcribe the spoken word quickly by removing unnecessary letters from words and making the letters themselves faster to write. Vowels are often removed when they are not the first or last letter of a word, and silent letters are also ignored. Common prefixes, suffixes, and letter groupings (such as \"sh\" and \"ing\") are reduced to single symbols. The symbols themselves are derived from the old cursive forms of the letter and the unnecessary parts are again stripped leaving only the core of the letter left. Unlike phonetics based shorthands, such as Pitman, Teeline is a spelling based system.\n\nTeeline differs from many shorthand systems by basing itself on the alphabet as opposed to phonetics, making it simpler to learn but also carrying the speed limitations of the alphabet when compared to other systems. However, it is common to find some phonetics spellings used. For example, \"ph\" is often just written as an \"f\", so the word \"phase\" would be written as if it were spelt \"fase\". This coincides with the creator's intentions of streamlining it as much as possible. As with many shorthand systems, there are few strict rules on how to write it, so it is common for users to make personal adaptations for their own use. Certain letters also have specific meanings as well as their traditional alphabetic value, as shown in the table below.\n\n\"Note: there may also be some regional, dialectal, and linguistic additions to these as well.\"\nTeeline eliminates unnecessary letters, so that the remaining letters can be written in one swift, sweeping movement. People who use it daily will run words together: proficient users develop their own forms for common phrases, such as \"more and more people\" and \"in the end\".\n\nIt is possible to write most words using basic Teeline theory, which consists of the alphabet and vowel indicators, but learning advanced Teeline theory allows users to increase their speed to well in excess of 100 words per minute.\n\nExamples of Teeline theory include blending of letters (such as CM, CN and PL) and the R principle.\n\nDoubling is also commonly used in Teeline - this involves lengthening the outlines for D, T, L, M and W to indicate that an R comes after these outlines - for example, the \"D\" outline becomes \"DR\" when it is lengthened, and \"M\" becomes \"MR\".\n\nSpeed can be dramatically increased through the use of reduced suffixes and prefixes that occur frequently, such as \"under-\", \"multi-\" and \"trans-\", along with \"-nce\", \"nch\", \"-able\" and \"-ing\".\n\nAlastair Campbell used Teeline to write his diaries while serving as spokesman for UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has claimed to have 120wpm ability. Campbell's tutor later reported that he was first in his class, reaching 100wpm before others. But political pundit Roy Campbell-Greenslade has questioned the value of shorthand in the digital era, noting an instance where a reporter's scrawl could not be read by a court-appointed Teeline expert. British MP Meg Hillier has said she wields Teeline at 100wpm and is wary of any reporter who fires questions at her faster than she herself could jot down. Jon Harris of Cavendish Press says training programs that omit Teeline are short-changing their trainees. \"Shorthand makes for a more rounded reporter; yet without it some of these courses are just 'Del Boy' degrees,\" he told the UK Press Gazette.\n\nTeeline appears on the cover of the album \"The Gaelic Chronicles\" by The Budapest Cafe Orchestra. Fiddler Christian Garrick said he was astounded to find a reporter using shorthand during an interview and asked her to scrawl the words for the album cover.\n"}
{"id": "1475486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1475486", "title": "Terminology of homosexuality", "text": "Terminology of homosexuality\n\nTerms used to describe homosexuality have gone through many changes since the emergence of the first terms in the mid-19th century. In English, some terms in widespread use have been sodomite, Sapphic, Uranian, homophile, lesbian, gay, two-spirit, and same-sex attracted. Some of these words are specific to women, some to men, and some can be used of either. Gay people may also be identified under the umbrella terms queer and LGBT.\n\n\"Homosexual\" was coined in 1868. Academia continues to coin related terms, including \"androphilia\" and \"gynephilia\" which designate only the object of attraction, thus divorcing the terms from sexual orientation entirely. \n\nNumerous slang terms exist for homosexuals or homosexuality. Some communities have cants, a rich jargon used among a subgroup almost like a secret language, such as Polari in the U.K., and others.\n\nThe term homosexual can be used as an adjective to describe the sexual attractions and behaviors of people attracted to the same sex. Author and gay pioneer Quentin Crisp said that the term should be \"homosexualist,\" adding that no one says \"I am a sexual.\" Some gay people argue that the use of homosexual as a noun is offensive, arguing that they are people first and their homosexuality being merely an attribute of their humanity. Even if they do not consider the term offensive, some people in same-sex relationships may object to being described as homosexual because they identify as bisexual, pansexual, or another orientation.\n\nSome style guides recommend that the terms homosexual and homosexuality be avoided altogether, lest their use cause confusion or arouse controversy. In particular, the description of individuals as homosexual may be offensive, partially because of the negative clinical association of the word stemming from its use in describing same-sex attraction as a pathological state before homosexuality was removed from the American Psychiatric Association's list of mental disorders in 1973. The Associated Press and New York Times style guides restrict usage of the terms.\n\nSame-sex oriented people seldom apply such terms to themselves, and public officials and agencies often avoid them. For instance, the Safe Schools Coalition of Washington's \"Glossary for School Employees\" advises that \"gay\" is the \"preferred synonym for homosexual\", and goes on to suggest avoiding the term homosexual as it is \"clinical, distancing, and archaic\".\n\nHowever, the term homosexual and homosexuality is sometimes deemed appropriate in referring to behavior (although same-sex is the preferred adjective). Using homosexuality or homosexual to refer to behavior may be inaccurate but does not carry the same potentially offensive connotations that using homosexual to describe a person does. When referring to people, homosexual is considered derogatory and the terms gay and lesbian are preferred. Some have argued that homosexual places emphasis on sexuality over humanity, and is to be avoided when describing a person. Gay man or lesbian are the preferred nouns for referring to people, which stress cultural and social matters over sex.\nThe \"New Oxford American Dictionary\", says that \"gay\" is the preferred term.\n\nPeople with a same-sex sexual orientation generally prefer the terms gay, lesbian, or bisexual. The most common terms are gay (both men and women) and lesbian (women only). Other terms include same gender loving and same-sex-oriented\".\"\n\nAmong some sectors of gay sub-culture, same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure instead of romantic. Men on the down-low (or DL) may engage in covert sexual activity with other men while pursuing sexual and romantic relationships with women.\n\nThe choice of terms regarding sexual orientation may imply a certain political outlook, and different terms have been preferred at different times and in different places.\n\nHistorian and philosopher Michel Foucault argued that homosexual and heterosexual identities didn't emerge until the 19th century. Prior to that time, the terms described practices and not identity. Foucault cited Karl Westphal's famous 1870 article \"Contrary Sexual Feeling\" as the \"date of birth\" of the categorization of sexual orientation.\n\nIn his \"Symposium\", the ancient Greek philosopher Plato described (through the character of the profane comedian Aristophanes) three sexual orientations, and provided explanations for their existence using an invented creation myth. Aristophanes's fable is only one of many perspectives on love in the \"Symposium\", and should not be considered identical with Plato's own ideas. Most of the \"Symposium\"'s speeches are intended to be flawed in different ways, with the wise Socrates coming in at the end to correct their errors.\n\nAlthough this term refers to a specific sex act between women today, in the past it was commonly used to describe female-female sexual love in general, and women who had sex with women were called Tribads or Tribades. As author Rictor Norton explains:\n\nThe \"tribas\", lesbian, from Greek \"tribein\", to rub (i.e. rubbing the pudenda together, or clitoris upon pubic bone, etc.), appears in Greek and Latin satires from the late first century. The tribade was the most common (vulgar) lesbian in European texts for many centuries. ‘Tribade’ occurs in English texts from at least as early as 1601 to at least as late as the mid-nineteenth century before it became self-consciously old-fashioned—it was in current use for nearly three centuries.\n\n\"Fricatrice\", a synonym for \"tribade\" that also refers to rubbing but has a Latin rather than a Greek root, appeared in English as early as 1605 (in Ben Jonson's \"Volpone\"). Its usage suggests that it was more colloquial and more pejorative than \"tribade\". Variants include the Latinized \"confricatrice\" and English \"rubster\".\n\nThough \"sodomy\" has been used to refer to a range of homosexual and heterosexual \"unnatural acts\", the term sodomite usually refers to a homosexual male even though the real meaning is of unreproductive sex. The term is derived from the Biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah, and Christian churches have referred to the \"crimen sodomitae\" (crime of the Sodomites) for centuries. The modern association with homosexuality can be found as early as AD 96 in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus. In the early 5th century, Jerome, a priest, historian, and theologian used the forms Sodoman, in Sodomis, Sodomorum, Sodomæ, Sodomitæ. The modern German word \"Sodomie\" and the Norwegian \"sodomi\" refer to bestiality.\nSodomy in historical biblical reference may not pertain to the acts of homosexuality, but the acts of bestiality and female and male castration for the purpose of sexual slavery.\n\nLesbian writer Emma Donoghue found that the term lesbian (with its modern meaning) has been in use in the English language from at least the 17th century. The 1732 epic poem by William King, \"The Toast\", uses \"lesbian loves\" and \"tribadism\" interchangeably: \"she loved Women in the same Manner as Men love them; she was a Tribad\".\n\nNamed after the Greek poet Sappho who lived on Lesbos Island and wrote love poems to women, this term has been in use since at least the 18th century, with the connotation of lesbian. In 1773, a London magazine described sex between women as \"Sapphic passion\". The adjective form \"Sapphic\" is no longer commonly used in the English language, but has started to once again gain traction in the millennial LGBT community.\n\nToday, pederasty refers to male attraction towards adolescent boys, or the cultural institutions that support such relations, as in ancient Greece. However, in the 18th and 19th centuries, the term usually referred to male homosexuality in general. A pederast was also the active partner in anal sex, whether with a male or a female partner.\n\nThe word homosexual translates literally as \"of the same sex\", being a hybrid of the Greek prefix \"homo-\" meaning \"same\" (as distinguished from the Latin root \"homo\" meaning \"human\") and the Latin root \"sex\" meaning \"sex\".\n\nThe first known appearance of the term homosexual in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet \"143 des Preussischen Strafgesetzbuchs und seine Aufrechterhaltung als 152 des Entwurfs eines Strafgesetzbuchs für den Norddeutschen Bund\" (\"Paragraph 143 of the Prussian Penal Code and Its Maintenance as Paragraph 152 of the Draft of a Penal Code for the North German Confederation\"). The pamphlet was written by Karl-Maria Kertbeny, but published anonymously. It advocated the repeal of Prussia's sodomy laws. Kertbeny had previously used the word in a private letter written in 1868 to Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. Kertbeny used \"Homosexualität\" (in English, \"homosexuality\") in place of Ulrichs' \"Urningtum\"; \"Homosexualisten\" (\"male homosexualists\") instead of \"Urninge\", and \"Homosexualistinnen\" (\"female homosexualists\") instead of \"Urninden\".\n\nThe first known use of homosexual in English is in Charles Gilbert Chaddock's 1892 translation of Richard von Krafft-Ebing's \"Psychopathia Sexualis\", a study on sexual practices. The term was popularized by the 1906 Harden-Eulenburg Affair.\n\nThe word \"homosexual\" itself had different connotations 100 years ago than today.\n\nAlthough some early writers used the adjective \"homosexual\" to refer to any single-gender context (such as an all-girls school), today the term implies a sexual aspect. The term homosocial is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not of a romantic or sexual nature.\n\nThe colloquial abbreviation homo for homosexual is a coinage of the interbellum period, first recorded as a noun in 1929, and as an adjective in 1933.\n\nToday, it is often considered a derogatory epithet and mainstream media outlets restrict its usage.\n\n\nPopular in the 1950s and 1960s (and still in occasional use today, particularly in writing by Anglican clergy), the term homophile was an attempt to avoid the clinical implications of sexual pathology found with the word homosexual, emphasizing love (-phile) instead.\n\nIn Norway, the term is still widely used.\n\nNot all terms have been used to describe same-sex sexuality are synonyms for the modern term homosexuality. Anna Rüling, one of the first women to publicly defend gay rights, considered gay people a third gender, different from both men and women. Terms such as gynephilia and androphilia have tried to simplify the language of sexual orientation by making no claim about the individual's own gender identity. However, they are not commonly used.\n\nThere are established languages of slang (sometimes known as cants) such as Polari in Britain, Swardspeak in the Philippines, Bahasa Binan in Indonesia, and Kaliardá (Καλιαρντά) in Greece.\n\nA variety of LGBT slang terms have been used historically and contemporarily within the LGBT community.\n\nIn addition to the stigma surrounding homosexuality, terms have been influenced by taboos around sex in general, producing a number of euphemisms. A gay person may be described as \"that way\", \"a bit funny\", \"on the bus\", \"batting for the other team\", \"a friend of Dorothy\", or \"wearing comfortable shoes\" (for women), although such euphemisms are becoming less common as homosexuality becomes more visible.\n\nHarry Hay frequently stated that in the 1930s–1940s gay people referred to themselves as \"temperamental\".\n\nAlthough the word was originally synonymous with happy or cheerful, in the 20th century it gradually came to designate someone who is romantically or sexually attracted to someone of the same gender or sex.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9904516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9904516", "title": "Tin can wall", "text": "Tin can wall\n\nA tin can wall is a wall constructed from tin cans, which are not a common building source. The cans can be laid in concrete, stacked vertically on top of each other, and crushed or cut and flattened to be used as shingles. They can also be used for furniture. \n\nTin cans can form the actual fill-in structure (or walls) of a building, as is done with earthships.\nTin cans have not been around for a long time, and neither have their building methods. The two main structural methods for building with tin cans are by laying them horizontally in a concrete matrix and by stacking them vertically.\n\nTin can building in New Mexico originated in the early 1980s as a response to the massive amounts of trash being discarded and the wasteful nature of common building practices. Tin can construction was an attempt to utilize a readily available resource that was normally sent to landfills or recycling centers. This led to various experiments in tin can building, including space-filler between wooden frames in traditional house styles and creating domes and archways using cans and cement. Within time, more simplified and practical methods were developed, such as the earthship tin can wall. The main person behind these efforts was Mike Reynolds, also creator of the earthship building method.\n\nA “traditional” earthship tin can wall is made by horizontally stacking tin cans in a concrete matrix. The cans are laid side by side and in alternating rows, similar to bricks. This is done simply and efficiently, using batches of concrete between the cans. The consistency of the concrete must be relatively thick, so as to hold its form and the tin cans in place. A surprisingly large number of cans are required.\n\nThe method for stacking the cans involves creating a row of cans separated by hand-formed “lumps” of concrete. The layout of a row is can, concrete, can, etc. This is then repeated, except that the alternating pattern is reversed, so that every can is laid on top of a concrete “lump” below it. This continues until completed, or the weight of the wall and the hardness of the cement seem questionable in terms of solidity. At that point it would be wise to wait for the wall to harden, but the laying time for cans and concrete is such that by the time a builder makes it back to an area that was recently laid it has had time to set. It is a judgment call as to whether or not the builder should continue, but by the next day or even later in the same day building can resume.\n\nThe materials that go into a tin can wall are simple: mainly tin cans and concrete. Tin cans (now aluminum cans as real tin cans are not as readily available) can be acquired from any recycling center or a local bar. Brick mortar may also be used instead of cement.\n\nOnce the wall is completed, the cans and the concrete are covered with a layer of cement or adobe mud mixture. What is applied depends on the location of the wall; if it is located in an area where it will be exposed to water (such as in a bathroom or utility room) it will need to be coated with a concrete layer. If it is located in a living room or bedroom, it can be covered with adobe plaster. A tin can wall that has half of its structure outside (such as the wall of an entrance to a building) will be coated with cement on the outside and adobe on the inside. The shape of the cans (their pull-tabs, etc.) and the roughness of the cement will provide a lath-like surface for the cement or adobe to stick to.\n\nThis initial layer is “screeted” (scratched with a tool that creates a ridge-like pattern thereby making it easier to apply another coat) and a second layer is added. More layers may be added, but it is up to the builder’s judgment and dependent upon the material being applied. In the case of adobe mud, once the initial layer is applied and allowed to harden it will crack and will need additional coats. With cement fewer layers are needed. The basic rule is: the more coats/layers, the stronger and better-looking the wall will be. This can be overdone however. \n\nWhen a tin can wall has been sufficiently coated it will then be “finished” with a fine plaster (lime-based or other), stucco (if the wall is outside), or linseed oil (in the case of adobe). It can also be finished with a clay “slip”, or aliz, which is an earth-based coat that can have natural pigment and fine grains of mica mixed in to produce a beautiful shimmering and organic-looking surface.\n\nAn outside tin can insulating wall is a simple design. It is made out of two tin can walls with a layer of solid insulation in the middle. The insulation can vary in thickness, depending on climate and budget. It can be made out of various “green” or sustainable materials or average run-of-the-mill solid insulation. The exposed sides of the tin can walls (those not facing the insulation) are finished using methods aforementioned. The inside part of the wall can be coated with adobe while the outside is finished with concrete and stucco. \n\nA door frame can be built into the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame. The process involves initially having a door frame set in place (on the foundation) and stacking cans to either side of the frame until they reach the other walls of the building and the ceiling. The door frame is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially into the side of the frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of metal lath are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.\n\nThe same method is applied to windows. The only difference is all sides of window are fastened to the tin can wall, while the door frame is fastened to the foundation on one side (bottom) and the can wall on three sides. Metal lath and nails are all that is needed, along with a bubble level or similar device. Once the desired height is reached to install a window frame, the wall is leveled. If any cans stick above the level plane they can be flattened to the desired height. Nails and lath sticking out from under the window frame holds the bottom of it in place, and the sides and top of the frame are fastened in the same fashion as a door frame. \n\nTo make a smooth transition from door (or window frame) to tin can wall with plaster, sheets of metal lath are attached to the rim of the frame and folded over the gap between the frame and the can wall. A double-layered wooden frame is therefore required, to give a surface for the metal lath to be nailed to while leaving the inside frame untouched. However, this is not necessarily a necessity. \n\nElectrical wiring is simple, with the wires attached to the cans or fastened to the concrete before the initial coat. If a wire needs to go to the other side of a wall it can be punched directly through a can. Plumbing and pipework can use similar methods. The can wall can always be built around a pipe, or there can be a wooden frame made similar to a window or door to house the pipe.\n\nTin can walls are not considered load-bearing using this building method, although two-story circular dome structures have been built. The basic rule is that it can support considerable weight but should not be used to hold up much more than its own form and shape. It would not be wise to attach a heavy timber roof to a tin can wall without support beams or frames. The basic function for can walls is in-fill (filling in the space between support beams or the main structure) and the division of space. They work excellent to separate a living room from a bedroom, and are also used as insulating walls from the outside. \n\nAn earthship tin can wall is both an efficient and economical building method. They are mainly composed of aluminum and cement, and can withstand the test of time. They are made from few materials (the coating method can be more complex than building the wall itself). They use recycled materials and require little or no skill to build.\n\nThe other tin can wall method that will be briefly described is a system developed by a German artist named Michael Hönes. He has led community rebuilding efforts in Lesotho, Africa using tin cans to create housing and opportunities for Aids orphans and foster mothers. Known as the TCV (a.k.a. Tin-Can Villages) project, Hönes has created buildings using tin cans, masonite, paint, and wire. The roof is made out of corrugated metal shingles. In this method the cans are stacked vertically, one on top of the other in rows that are placed side by side and secured with wire. They are left exposed and are arranged in a decorative manner. The structures require no foundation, and are said to be able to withstand the Lesotho storms. \n\nA site for the first village in Maseru has been secured and the funding has been sourced. What is lacking is building permits (as of July 2004). The TCV organization, headed by Hönes, has been prefabricating tin can walls so that when the permits pass about one building a week can be constructed.\n\nSo far the TCV organization’s efforts have been concentrated on storehouses, offices, a large weaving workshop for the women of the Elelloang Basali Weavers group in Teyateyaneng, and a solar-powered restaurant that cooks with solar ovens. Michael Hönes also focuses on tin can furniture and has created a stove out of tin cans that uses one-third less wood than what the poor people of the area commonly use, thereby diminishing the firewood crisis in Lesotho.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1072379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1072379", "title": "Variorum", "text": "Variorum\n\nA variorum, short for \"(editio) cum notis variorum\", is a work that collates all known variants of a text. It is a work of textual criticism, whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication. The Bible and the works of William Shakespeare have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works.\n\nThe word \"variorum\" is Latin for 'of various [persons]' and derives from the phrase \"cum notis variorum\" ('with notes by various people') which was often used in the title-pages of Dutch books of the 17th century.\n\nAn older meaning of the word refers not to the text itself but to the assortment of illustrative notes printed with it: 'an edition of a text (usually Latin or Greek) which includes annotations by a variety of critics and commentators'. Variorum editions of this kind were a speciality of Dutch publishers of the 17th century, including the house of Elsevier. In these editions the text is usually taken, with little or no attempt at constructive modification, from a single widely accepted critical edition of the period; the interest lies in the notes, which often fill three-quarters of each page, and which typically embody the complete commentaries of two or three recognised specialists in the work of the author in question, together with selected passages from several other commentators. The notes will usually include textual variants, both documented and conjectural, together with examples of parallel usages and (for non-fiction texts) historical information. Usually some middle-ranking literary man was appointed as general editor; occasionally, however, a first-rate scholar would preside over the edition and include original work of his own within it, Nicolas Heinsius's edition of Claudian (Elsevier, 1661) being a good example.\n\nA variorum of the Bible has been produced at various times in history and of various scopes. Documenting each line of text with variants in wording, from known source documents, presented chronologically, helps translators of the Bible establish primacy and prevalence of various line readings.\n\nThere have also been noteworthy variorums of the works of William Shakespeare, including the readings of all quartos and folios; the textual decisions, or choices, of past editors; and a compilation of all critical notes. The first was that of Isaac Reed in 1803. Variorum editions help editors and scholars understand the historical evolution of the Shakespeare texts, as well as to decode dubious lines and decide upon most likely authorial intent.\n\nImmanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" is typically presented in variorum format, with both the 1781 and 1787 editions printed side-by-side in nearly all modern editions.\n\nCharles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" went through six editions with extensive changes. The text became a third larger, with numerous parts rewritten five times. A variorum was published in 1959.\n\nThere is also a variorum of \"Leaves of Grass\". Walt Whitman produced either six or nine editions during his lifetime.

{"id": "1013711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1013711", "title": "Vesre", "text": "Vesre\n\nVesre (reversing the order of syllables within a word) is one of the features of Rioplatense Spanish slang. Natives of Argentina and Uruguay use vesre sparingly in colloquial speaking, and never in formal circumstances. Tango lyrics make widespread use of lunfardo and vesre to highlight the intended underworld atmosphere, or for comic relief.\n\nVesre is mostly from Buenos Aires, and other cities in Argentina have their own customs. Rosario has its \"Rosarigasino\" method for obfuscating words, and Córdoba has an entirely different set of colloquial conventions. Yet, most Argentines and Uruguayans have been exposed to vesre through tango lyrics or the media.\n\nEven though vesre has spread to other countries, and can be heard in Peru, Chile and Ecuador, Spanish speakers outside the Río de la Plata area are usually less inclined to use it. Popular speech has created some instances; for example, natives of Barranquilla, Colombia often call their city \"Curramba\", in a stylized form of vesre.\n\nNOTE: When the syllables of the noun are switched, the original gender - masculine or feminine - is kept; e.g., \"un café -> un feca\"\n\nOccasionally, vesre is a stepping-stone towards further obfuscation, achieved by evolving into a longer word. For example:\n\n\nThe original and \"vesre\" versions of a word are not always synonyms; sometimes the reversal adds some extra nuance to the meaning. For instance, the word \"hotel\" bears the same meaning as in English (i.e. a normal tourist hotel), whereas \"telo\" implies that the establishment is actually a love hotel. Listen to examples\n\nThese reversed words are only spoken; rarely found in writing.\n\nIn English - Pig Latin; (Not exactly with the same morphological construction but similar in purpose and tone) \n\nColloquial French has a form of intentional metathesis known as verlan.\n\nGreek has Podaná with the same morphological construction.\n\nTagálog, a language of the Philippines, also has a similar construct known as \"binaliktad\", lit. \"inverted.\"\n\nSerbian has a form of slang called Šatrovački followed in the 1990s with a more ambiguous slang called utrovački.\n"}
