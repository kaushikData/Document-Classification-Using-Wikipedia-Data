{"id": "6767135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6767135", "title": "Bayesian poisoning", "text": "Bayesian poisoning\n\nBayesian poisoning is a technique used by e-mail spammers to attempt to degrade the effectiveness of spam filters that rely on Bayesian spam filtering. Bayesian filtering relies on Bayesian probability to determine whether an incoming mail is spam or is not spam. The spammer hopes that the addition of random (or even carefully selected) words that are unlikely to appear in a spam message will cause the spam filter to believe the message to be legitimate—a statistical type II error. \n\nSpammers also hope to cause the spam filter to have a higher false positive rate by turning previously innocent words into spammy words in the Bayesian database (statistical type I errors) because a user who trains their spam filter on a poisoned message will be indicating to the filter that the words added by the spammer are a good indication of spam.\n\nAt the Spam Conference held at MIT in 2004 John Graham-Cumming presented two possible attacks on POPFile's Bayesian engine. One was unsuccessful and the other worked, but was impractical. In doing this they identified two types of poisoning attack: passive (where words are added without any feedback to the spammer) and active (where the spammer gets feedback after the spam has been received).\n\nThe passive method of adding random words to a small spam was ineffective as a method of attack: only 0.04% of the modified spam messages were delivered. The active attack involved adding random words to a small spam and using a web bug to determine whether the spam was received. If it was, another Bayesian system was trained using the same poison words. After sending 10,000 spams to a single user he determined a small set of words that could be used to get a spam through.\n\nThe simple countermeasure of disabling remote images (web bugs) in emails eliminates this problem.\n\nAt the Conference on Email and Anti-Spam in 2004, Wittel and Wu presented a paper in which they showed that the passive addition of random words to spam was ineffective against CRM114, but effective against SpamBayes with 100 words added per spam.\n\nThey also showed that a smarter passive attack, adding common English words, was still ineffective against CRM114, but was even more effective against SpamBayes. They needed to add only 50 words to a spam to get it past SpamBayes.\n\nHowever, Wittel and Wu's testing has been criticized due to the minimal header information that was present in the emails they were using; most Bayesian spam filters make extensive use of header information and other message metadata in determining the likelihood that a message is spam. A discussion of the SpamBayes results and some counter evidence can be found in the SpamBayes mailing list archive.\n\nAll of these attacks are type II attacks: attacks that attempt to get spam delivered. A type I attack attempts to cause false positives by turning previously innocent words into spammy words in the Bayesian database.\n\nAlso in 2004 Stern, Mason and Shepherd wrote a technical report at Dalhousie University, in which they detailed a passive type II attack. They added common English words to spam messages used for training and testing a spam filter.\n\nIn two tests they showed that these common words decreased the spam filter's precision (the percentage of messages classified as spam that really are spam) from 84% to 67% and from 94% to 84%. Examining their data shows that the poisoned filter was biased towards believing messages were more likely to be spam than \"ham\" (good email), thus increasing the false positive rate.\n\nThey proposed two countermeasures: ignoring common words when performing classification, and smoothing probabilities based on the trustworthiness of a word. A word has a trustworthy probability if an attacker is unlikely to be able to guess whether it is part of an individual's vocabulary. Thus common words are untrustworthy and their probability would be smoothed to 0.5 (making them neutral).\n\nAt the 2005 Conference on Email and Anti-Spam Lowd and Meek presented a paper in which they demonstrated that passive attacks adding random or common words to spam were ineffective against a naïve Bayesian filter. (In fact, they showed, as John Graham-Cumming demonstrated back in 2004, that adding random words improves the spam filtering accuracy.)\n\nThey demonstrated that adding hammy words - words that are more likely to appear in ham (non-spam email content) than spam - was effective against a naïve Bayesian filter, and enabled spam to slip through. They went on to detail two active attacks (attacks that require feedback to the spammer) that were very effective against the spam filters. Of course, preventing any feedback to spammers (such as non-delivery reports, SMTP level errors or web bugs) defeats an active attack trivially.\n\nThey also showed that retraining the filter was effective at preventing all the attack types, even when the retraining data had been poisoned.\n\nThe published research shows that adding random words to spam messages is ineffective as a form of attack, but that active attacks are very effective and that adding carefully chosen words can work in some cases. To defend against these attacks it is vital that no feedback is received by spammers and that statistical filters are retrained regularly.\n\nThe research also shows that continuing to investigate attacks on statistical filters is worthwhile. Working attacks have been demonstrated and countermeasures are required to ensure that statistical filters remain accurate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "752529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=752529", "title": "Being and Time", "text": "Being and Time\n\nBeing and Time () is a 1927 book by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, in which the author seeks to analyse the concept of Being. Heidegger maintains that this has fundamental importance for philosophy and that, since the time of the Ancient Greeks, philosophy has avoided the question, turning instead to the analysis of particular beings. Heidegger attempts to revive ontology through a reawakening of the question of the meaning of being. He approaches this through a fundamental ontology that is a preliminary analysis of the being of the being to whom the question of being is important, i.e., \"Dasein\".\n\nHeidegger wrote that \"Being and Time\" was made possible by his study of Edmund Husserl's \"Logical Investigations\" (1900–1901), and it is dedicated to Husserl \"in friendship and admiration\". Although Heidegger did not complete the project outlined in the introduction, \"Being and Time\" remains his most important work. It was immediately recognized as an original and groundbreaking philosophical work, and later became a focus of debates and controversy, and a profound influence on 20th-century philosophy, particularly existentialism, hermeneutics, deconstruction, and the enactivist approach to cognition. \"Being and Time\" has been described as the most influential version of existential philosophy, and Heidegger's achievements in the work have been compared to those of Immanuel Kant in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807) and \"Science of Logic\" (1812–1816). The work influenced philosophical treatises such as Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943). \"Sein und Zeit\" was first translated into English in 1962.\n\nAccording to Heidegger's statement in \"Being and Time\", the work was made possible by his study of Husserl's \"Logical Investigations\" (1900-1901). \"Being and Time\" was originally intended to consist of two major parts, each part consisting of three divisions. Heidegger was forced to prepare the book for publication when he had completed only the first two divisions of part one. The remaining divisions planned for \"Being and Time\" (particularly the divisions on time and being, Immanuel Kant, and Aristotle) were never published, although in many respects they were addressed in one form or another in Heidegger's other works. In terms of structure, \"Being and Time\" remains as it was when it first appeared in print; it consists of the lengthy two-part introduction, followed by Division One, the \"Preparatory Fundamental Analysis of Dasein,\" and Division Two, \"Dasein and Temporality.\"\n\nHeidegger describes his project in the following way: \"our aim in the following treatise is to work out the question of the sense of \"being\" and to do so concretely.\" Heidegger claims that traditional ontology has prejudicially overlooked this question, dismissing it on the basis that being is the most universal and emptiest concept, that is indefinable or obvious.\n\nInstead Heidegger proposes to understand being itself, as distinguished from any specific entities (beings). \"'Being' is not something like a being.\" Being, Heidegger claims, is \"what determines beings as beings, that in terms of which beings are already understood.\" Heidegger is seeking to identify the criteria or conditions by which any specific entity can show up at all (see world disclosure).\n\nIf we grasp Being, we will clarify the meaning of being, or \"sense\" of being (\"Sinn des Seins\"), where by \"sense\" Heidegger means that \"in terms of which something becomes intelligible as something.\" Presented in relation to the quality of knowledge, according to Heidegger, this sense of being precedes any notions of how or in what manner any particular being or beings exist, and is thus pre-scientific. Thus, in Heidegger's view, the question of the meaning of being would be an explanation of the understanding preceding any other way of knowing, such as the use of logic, theory, specific regional ontology. At the same time, there is no access to being other than via beings themselves—hence pursuing the question of being inevitably means questioning a being with regard to its being. Heidegger argues that a true understanding of being (\"Seinsverständnis\") can only proceed by referring to particular beings, and that the best method of pursuing being must inevitably, he says, involve a kind of hermeneutic circle, that is (as he explains in his critique of prior work in the field of hermeneutics), it must rely upon repetitive yet progressive acts of interpretation. \"The methodological sense of phenomenological description is \"interpretation\".\"\n\nThus the question Heidegger asks in the introduction to \"Being and Time\" is: what is the being that will give access to the question of the meaning of Being? Heidegger's answer is that it can only be that being for whom the question of Being is important, the being for whom Being matters. As this answer already indicates, the being for whom Being is a question is not a \"what\", but a \"who\". Heidegger calls this being \"Dasein\" (an ordinary German word literally meaning \"being-there,\" i.e., \"existence\"), and the method pursued in \"Being and Time\" consists in the attempt to delimit the characteristics of \"Dasein\", in order thereby to approach the meaning of Being itself through an interpretation of the temporality of Dasein. \"Dasein\" is not \"man,\" but is nothing other than \"man\"—it is this distinction that enables Heidegger to claim that \"Being and Time\" is something other than philosophical anthropology.\n\nHeidegger's account of Dasein passes through a dissection of the experiences of \"Angst\" and mortality, and then through an analysis of the structure of \"care\" as such. From there he raises the problem of \"authenticity,\" that is, the potentiality or otherwise for mortal \"Dasein\" to exist \"fully\" enough that it might actually understand being. Heidegger is clear throughout the book that nothing makes certain that \"Dasein\" is capable of this understanding.\n\nFinally, this question of the authenticity of individual \"Dasein\" cannot be separated from the \"historicality\" of \"Dasein\". On the one hand, \"Dasein\", as mortal, is \"stretched along\" between birth and death, and thrown into its world, that is, thrown into its \"possibilities\", possibilities which \"Dasein\" is charged with the task of assuming. On the other hand, \"Dasein's\" access to this world and these possibilities is always via a history and a tradition—this is the question of \"world historicality,\" and among its consequences is Heidegger's argument that \"Dasein's\" potential for authenticity lies in the possibility of choosing a \"hero.\"\n\nThus, more generally, the outcome of the progression of Heidegger's argument is the thought that the being of \"Dasein\" is time. Nevertheless, Heidegger concludes his work with a set of enigmatic questions foreshadowing the necessity of a destruction (that is, a transformation) of the history of philosophy in relation to temporality—these were the questions to be taken up in the never completed continuation of his project:\n\nAlthough Heidegger describes his method in \"Being and Time\" as phenomenological, the question of its relation to the phenomenology of Husserl is complex. The fact that Heidegger believes that ontology includes an irreducible hermeneutic (interpretative) aspect, for example, might be thought to run counter to Husserl's claim that phenomenological description is capable of a form of scientific positivity. On the other hand, however, several aspects of the approach and method of \"Being and Time\" seem to relate more directly to Husserl's work.\n\nThe central Husserlian concept of the directedness of all thought—intentionality—for example, while scarcely mentioned in \"Being and Time\", has been identified by some with Heidegger's central notion of \"Sorge\" (\"cura\", care or concern). However, for Heidegger, \"theoretical\" knowledge represents only one kind of intentional behaviour, and he asserts that it is grounded in more fundamental modes of behaviour and forms of practical engagement with the surrounding world. Whereas a theoretical understanding of things grasps them according to \"presence,\" for example, this may conceal that our first experience of a being may be in terms of its being \"ready-to-hand.\" Thus, for instance, when someone reaches for a tool such as a hammer, their understanding of what a hammer \"is\" is not determined by a theoretical understanding of its presence, but by the fact that it is something we need at the moment we wish to do hammering. Only a \"later\" understanding might come to contemplate a hammer \"as\" an object.\n\nThe total understanding of being results from an explication of the implicit knowledge of being that inheres in \"Dasein\". Philosophy thus becomes a form of interpretation, but since there is no external reference point outside being from which to begin this interpretation, the question becomes to know in which way to proceed with this interpretation. This is the problem of the \"hermeneutic circle,\" and the necessity for the interpretation of the meaning of being to proceed in stages: this is why Heidegger's technique in \"Being and Time\" is sometimes referred to as hermeneutical phenomenology.\n\nAs part of his ontological project, Heidegger undertakes a reinterpretation of previous Western philosophy. He wants to explain why and how theoretical knowledge came to seem like the most fundamental relation to being. This explanation takes the form of a destructuring (\"Destruktion\") of the philosophical tradition, an interpretative strategy that reveals the fundamental experience of being at the base of previous philosophies that had become entrenched and hidden within the theoretical attitude of the metaphysics of presence. This use of the word \"Destruktion\" is meant to signify not a negative operation but rather a positive transformation or recovery.\n\nIn \"Being and Time\" Heidegger briefly undertakes a destructuring of the philosophy of René Descartes, but the second volume, which was intended to be a \"Destruktion\" of Western philosophy in all its stages, was never written. In later works Heidegger uses this approach to interpret the philosophies of Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and Plato, among others.\n\n\"Being and Time\" is the major achievement of Heidegger's early career, but he produced other important works from this period:\n\nAlthough Heidegger did not complete the project outlined in \"Being and Time\", later works explicitly addressed the themes and concepts of \"Being and Time\". Most important among the works which do so are the following:\n\n\"Being and Time\" has been seen as a product of the crisis of German culture following Germany's defeat in World War I, and has been compared in this respect to works such as Ernst Bloch's \"The Spirit of Utopia\" (1918), Oswald Spengler's \"The Decline of the West\" (1918), Franz Rosenzweig's \"The Star of Redemption\" (1921), Karl Barth's \"The Epistle to the Romans\" (1922), and Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" (1925). Upon its publication, it was recognized as a groundbreaking philosophical work, with reviewers crediting Heidegger with \"brilliance\" and \"genius\". The book, which has been described as the \"most influential version of existential philosophy\", quickly became \"the focus of debates and controversy\". Heidegger claimed in the 1930s that commentators had attempted to show similarities between his views and those of Hegel in order to undermine the idea that \"Being and Time\" was an original work. In response, Heidegger maintained that his thesis that the essence of being is time is the opposite of Hegel's view that being is the essence of time. Karl Jaspers, writing in the first volume of his work \"Philosophy\" (1932), credited Heidegger with making essential points about \"being in the world\" and also about \"existence and historicity\".\n\nHeidegger's work has been suggested as a possible influence on Herbert Marcuse's \"Hegel's Ontology and the Theory of Historicity\" (1932), though Marcuse later questioned the political implications of Heidegger's work. Jean-Paul Sartre, who wrote \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943) under the influence of Heidegger's work, has been said to have responded to \"Being and Time\" with \"a sense of shock\". Sartre's existentialism has been described as \"a version and variant of the idiom and propositions\" in \"Being and Time\". Because of Heidegger's revival of the question of being, \"Being and Time\" also influenced other philosophers of Sartre's generation, and it altered the course of French philosophy. Maurice Merleau-Ponty argued in \"Phenomenology of Perception\" (1945) that \"Being and Time\", \"springs from an indication given by Husserl and amounts to no more than an explicit account of the 'natürlicher Weltbegriff' or the 'Lebenswelt' which Husserl, towards the end of his life, identified as the central theme of phenomenology\". Heidegger influenced psychoanalysis through Jacques Lacan, who quotes from \"Being and Time\" in a 1953 text.\n\nThe publication of the English translation of the work by John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson in 1962, helped to shape the way in which Heidegger's work was discussed in English. Gilles Deleuze's \"Difference and Repetition\" (1968) was influenced by Heidegger's \"Being and Time\", though Deleuze replaces Heidegger's key terms of being and time with difference and repetition respectively. Frank Herbert's science fiction novel \"The Santaroga Barrier\" (1968) was loosely based on the ideas of \"Being and Time\". The philosopher Lucien Goldmann, writing in his posthumously published \"\" (1973), argued that the concept of reification as employed in \"Being and Time\" showed the strong influence of György Lukács' \"History and Class Consciousness\" (1923), though Goldmann's suggestion has been disputed. \"Being and Time\" influenced Alain Badiou's work \"Being and Event\" (1988). Roger Scruton writes that \"Being and Time\" is \"the most complex of the many works inspired, directly or indirectly, by Kant's theory of time as 'the form of inner sense'.\" He considers Heidegger's language \"metaphorical\" and almost incomprehensible. Scruton suggests that this necessarily follows from the nature of Heidegger's phenomenological method. He finds Heidegger's \"description of the world of phenomena\" to be \"fascinating, but maddeningly abstract\". He suggests that much of \"Being and Time\" is a \"description of a private spiritual journey\" rather than genuine philosophy, and notes that Heidegger's assertions are unsupported by argument.\n\nStephen Houlgate compares Heidegger's achievements in \"Being and Time\" to those of Kant in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781) and Hegel in \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807) and \"Science of Logic\" (1812-1816). Simon Critchley calls the work Heidegger's \"magnum opus\", and writes that it is impossible to understand developments in continental philosophy after Heidegger without understanding it. Dennis J. Schmidt praises the \"range and subtlety\" of \"Being and Time\", and describes its importance by quoting a comment the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe made in a different context, \"from here and today a new epoch of world history sets forth.\" Heidegger has become common background for the political movement concerned with protection of the environment, and his narrative of the history of Being frequently appears when capitalism, consumerism and technology are thoughtfully opposed. Michael E. Zimmerman writes that, \"Because he criticized technological modernity’s domineering attitude toward nature, and because he envisioned a postmodern era in which people would “let things be,” Heidegger has sometimes been read as an intellectual forerunner of today’s “deep ecology” movement.\n\n\"Being and Time\" also influenced the enactivist approach to cognition.\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n\n"}

His best known work is the autobiographical novel, \"Pather Panchali\" (\"The Song of the Road\"). He was posthumously awarded the Rabindra Puraskar in 1951, the most prestigious literary award in West Bengal, for his novel \"Ichhamati\".\n\nThe Bandyopadhyay family originated in the Panitar village near Basirhat, located in the North 24 Parganas district of modern-day West Bengal. Bandyopadhyay's great-grandfather, who was an Ayurvedic physician, eventually settled in Barakpur village, near Gopalnagar, Banagram (now Bangaon), North 24 Parganas. However, Bandyopadhyay was born in Muratipur village, near Kalyani in Nadia, at his maternal uncle's house. His father, Mahananda Bandyopadhyay, was a Sanskrit scholar and story-teller by profession. Bandyopadhyay was the eldest of the five children of Mahananda and his wife Mrinalini. His childhood home was at Barakpur village, near Gopalnagar.\n\nBandyopadhyay studied at Bongaon High School, one of the oldest institutions in British India, and was considered as a talented student. Following a first division placement in the Entrance and Intermediate Arts examinations, Bandyopadhyay completed his undergraduate degree in economics, history, and sanskrit at the Surendranath College (then Ripon College) in Kolkata. He was admitted to the master's degree (MA) and Law classes, but could not afford to enroll for the postgraduate course at the University of Calcutta, and joined as a teacher in a school in Jangipara, Hooghly.\n\nBandyopadhyay worked in a variety of jobs to support both himself and his family before becoming a writer. His first job was as a teacher, but he also served as a travelling publicist for Goraksini Sabha, and later as a secretary for Khelatchandra Ghosh, a role that included the management of his Bhagalpur estate. He became involved with Khelatchandra, a prominent name in music and charity, while tutoring his family. He also taught at the Khelatchandra Memorial School. Eventually, Bandyopadhyay returned to his native place. He started working as a teacher in the Gopalnagar School, which he continued alongside his literary work, until his death. He wrote and published \"Pather Panchali w\"hile staying at Ghatshila, a town in Jharkhand.\n\nBandyopadhyay's works are largely set in rural Bengal, with characters from that area. Several of his novels are set in Bongaon, including \"Pather Panchali\", \"Adarsha Hindu Hotel\", \"Ichamati,\" and \"Bipiner Sansar\". In 1921, Bandyopadhyay's first published short story, \"Upekshita\" appeared in \"Prabasi\", at the time one of Bengal's leading literary magazines. However, he did not receive any critical attention until 1928, when his first novel \"Pather Panchali\" (also known in English as \"Song of the Little Road\") was published (initially as a serial, then as a book in 1929). \"Pather Panchali\" brought Bandyopadhyay to prominence in Bengali literature, and the novel and its sequel \"Aparajito\", were subsequently translated into numerous languages. Additionally, these two were made into films by Satyajit Ray, and together with \"Apur Sansar\", formed the highly successful \"Apu Trilogy\". Ray referred aspiring scriptwriters to the works of Bandyopadhyay, and praised him by saying, \"His lines fit the characters so well, they are so revealing that even when the author provides no physical description, every character seems to present itself before us simply through the words it speaks\".\n\n\"Ichhamati\" reflects and documents a period of caste stratified culture, the life of rural society along the banks of the Ichamati River, in undivided Bengal. The novel captures indigo planters, plantation life, and caste society in Bengal during the early 20th century, in vivid detail. Relationships are sensitively portrayed in the narrative, with the author exploring the subtle nuances contained therein. Readers have praised the detailed descriptions of nature and the unselfconscious, but poetic portrayal of the flora and fauna on the banks of the Ichamati River. \"Ichamati\" has also been described as a deeply spiritual piece of writing, with Advaita Vedanta holding particular relevance to the contained dialogue.\n\nBandyopadhyay wrote 16 novels, and over two hundred short stories. His style as a Bengali novelist has often been compared to Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay. \"Pather Panchali\" is considered Bandyopadhyay's masterpiece, and is included in the ICSE syllabus for students choosing to study Bengali. Author Humayun Azad opined, that the novel form of \"Pather Panchali\" is superior to its cinematic rendition. Azad's view is not necessarily a commonly held one in the West, as the \"Apu Trilogy\" is considered among the finest films in the history of cinema. The unavailability of a complete English translation of the novel creates difficulty in comparing the two separate works for the English-speaking audience (the available translation by T. W. Clark and Tarapada Mukherji is a truncated version). However, in the Bengali-speaking world, the stature of the novel is uncontested.\n\nAmit Chaudhuri has translated a few excerpts from the novel for inclusion in the anthology, \"The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature\". In his introduction to these excerpts, Chaudhuri wrote, \"Unique for its tenderness and poetry ... \"Pather Panchali\" rejects both nineteenth-century realism and social realism (the social milieu described in it would have logically lent itself to the latter) for an inquiry into perception and memory.\" The complete text of \"Aparajito\" has been translated into English by Gopa Majumdar. The novel \"Aranyak\" has been translated into English in January 2017 by Suchismita Banerjee Rai, and it has been published by Mitra and Ghosh Publishers based in Kolkata.\n\nMartin Seymour-Smith, in his \"Guide to Modern World Literature\" (1973), describes Bandyopadhyay (he uses the form Banerji) as \"perhaps the best of all modern Indian novelists\", going on to write that, \"probably nothing in twentieth-century Indian literature, in prose or poetry, comes to the level of \"Pather Panchali\"\".\n\nBandyopadhyay spent his early days in abject poverty, and subsequently he supported his family financially, though the extent of his support is unknown. He had a stout build and walked miles in the woods every day, usually taking his notebook for the purpose of writing whilst surrounded by the wilderness.\n\nHis first wife Gouri Devi died of cholera, a year after their marriage. Her death and Bandopadhyay's consequent loneliness led to a theme of tragedy that became a recurrent motif in his early writings. At the age of 46, he married Rama Chattopadhyay. Their son, Taradas, was born in 1947.\n\nBandopadhyay died on 1 November 1950, in Ghatshila. The cause of death was identified as a heart attack.\n\nComplete list of novels:\n\nPartial list of short story collections:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "328012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328012", "title": "Bloody", "text": "Bloody\n\nBloody, as an adverb, is a commonly used expletive attributive (intensifier) in British English, Australian English, and a number of other Commonwealth nations. It has been used as an intensive since at least the 1670s. Considered \"respectable\" until about 1750, it was heavily tabooed during c. 1750–1920, considered equivalent to heavily obscene or profane speech. Public use continued to be seen as controversial until the 1960s, but since the later 20th century, the word has become a comparatively mild expletive or intensifier. In American English, the word is uncommon and is seen by American audiences as a stereotypical marker of British English, without any significant obscene or profane connotation.\n\nUse of the adjective \"bloody\" as a profane intensifier predates the 18th century. Its ultimate origin is unclear, and several hypotheses have been suggested.\n\nIt may be a direct loan of Dutch \"bloote\", used \"in the adverbial sense of entire, complete, pure, naked\", which was suggested by Ker (1837) to have been \"transformed into \"bloody\", in the consequently absurd phrases of \"bloody good\", \"bloody bad\", \"bloody thief\", \"bloody angry\", etc., where it simply implies completely, entirely, purely, very, truly, and has no relation to either blood or murder, except by corruption of the word.\"\n\nThe word \"blood\" in Dutch and German is used as part of minced oaths, in abbreviation of expressions referring to \"God's blood\", i.e. the Passion or the Eucharist. Ernest Weekley (1921) relates English usage to imitation of purely intensive use of Dutch \"bloed\" and German \"Blut\" in the early modern period.\n\nA popularly reported theory suggested euphemistic derivation from the phrase \"by Our Lady\". The contracted form \"by'r Lady\" is common in Shakespeare's plays around the turn of the 17th century, and Jonathan Swift about 100 years later writes both \"it grows by'r Lady cold\" and \"it was bloody hot walking to-day\" suggesting that \"bloody\" and \"by'r Lady\" had become exchangeable generic intensifiers.\nHowever, Eric Partridge (1933) describes the supposed derivation of \"bloody\" as a further contraction of \"by'r lady\" as \"phonetically implausible\". \n\nAccording to \"Rawson's dictionary of Euphemisms\" (1995), attempts to derive \"bloody\" from minced oaths for \"by our lady\" or \"God's blood\" are based on the attempt to explain the word's extraordinary shock power in the 18th to 19th centuries, but they disregard that the earliest records of the word as an intensifier in the 17th to early 18th century do not reflect any taboo or profanity. It seems more likely, according to Rawson, that the taboo against the word arose secondarily, perhaps because of an association with menstruation.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary prefers the theory that it arose from aristocratic rowdies known as \"bloods\", hence \"bloody drunk\" means \"drunk as a blood\".\n\nUntil at least the early 18th century, the word was used innocuously. \nIt is used as an intensifier without apparent implication of profanity by 18th-century authors such as Henry Fielding and Jonathan Swift (\"“It was bloody hot walking today”\" in 1713) and Samuel Richardson (\"“He is bloody passionate.”\" in 1742).\n\nAfter about 1750 the word assumed more profane connotations. Johnson (1755) already calls it \"very vulgar\", and the original Oxford English Dictionary article of 1888 comments the word is \"now constantly in the mouths of the lowest classes, but by respectable people considered 'a horrid word', on par with obscene or profane language.\"\n\nOn the opening night of George Bernard Shaw's comedy \"Pygmalion\" in 1914, Mrs Patrick Campbell, in the role of Eliza Doolittle, created a sensation with the line \"Walk! Not bloody likely!\" and this led to a fad for using \"Pygmalion\" itself as a pseudo-oath, as in \"Not Pygmalion likely\", and \"bloody\" was referred to as \"the Shavian adjective\" in polite society.\n\nThe character Geoffrey Fisher in Keith Waterhouse's play Billy Liar (1959) is notable for his continual use of the word 'bloody'. Waterhouse's stage directions make it clear that if this is considered offensive the word should be omitted entirely and not bowdlerised to \"ruddy\" or some other word.\n\nThe use of 'bloody' in adult UK broadcasting aroused controversy in the 1960s and 1970s, but it has since become mild expletive and is used more freely.\n\n\"Bloody\" has always been a very common part of Australian speech and has not been considered profane there for some time. The word was dubbed \"the Australian adjective\" by \"The Bulletin\" on 18 August 1894. One Australian performer, Kevin Bloody Wilson, has even made it his middle name. Also in Australia, the word \"bloody\" is frequently used as a verbal hyphen, or infix, correctly called tmesis as in \"fanbloodytastic\". In the 1940s an Australian divorce court judge held that \"the word \"bloody\" is so common in modern parlance that it is not regarded as swearing\". Meanwhile, Neville Chamberlain's government was fining Britons for using the word in public.\n\nThe word as an expletive is seldom used in the United States of America. In the US the term is usually used when the intention is to mimic an Englishman. \nBecause it is not perceived as profane in American English, \"bloody\" is generally not censored when used in American television and film, for example in the 1961 film \"The Guns of Navarone\" the actor Richard Harris at one point says: \"You can't even see the bloody cave, let alone the bloody guns. And anyway, we haven't got a bloody bomb big enough to smash that bloody rock...\" - but \"bloody\" was replaced with \"ruddy\" for British audiences of the time.\n\nThe term is used somewhat frequently in Canada, especially in the provinces of Ontario and Newfoundland. Younger Canadians generally do not consider the term to be offensive; however, older Canadians of British origin might.\n\nIn Singapore, the word \"bloody\" is commonly used as a mild expletive in Singapore's colloquial English. The roots of this expletive derives from the influence and informal language British officers used during the dealing and training of soldiers in the Singapore Volunteer Corps and the early days of the Singapore Armed Forces. When more Singaporeans were promoted officers within the Armed Forces, most new local officers applied similar training methods their former British officers had when they were cadets or trainees themselves. This includes some aspects of British Army lingo, like \"bloody (something)\". When the newly elected Singapore government implemented compulsory conscription, all 18 year old able bodied Singapore males had to undergo training within the Armed Forces. When National servicemen completed their service term, some brought the many expletives they picked up during their service into the civilian world and thus became a part of the common culture in the city state. The word 'bloody' also managed to spread to the north in neighbouring Malaysia, to where the influence of Singapore English has spread. The use of 'bloody' as a substitute for more explicit language increased with the popularity of British and Australian films and television shows aired on local television programmes. The term \"bloody\" in Singapore may not be considered explicit, but its usage is frowned upon in formal settings.\n\nThe term is frequently used among South Africans in their colloquial English and it is an intensifier. It is used in both explicit and non-explicit ways. It also spread to Afrikaans as \"bloedige\" and is popular amongst all citizens in the country. It is also used by minors and is not considered to be offensive.\n\nMany substitutions were devised to convey the essence of the oath, but with less offence; these included \"bleeding\", \"bleaking\", \"cruddy\", \"smuddy\", \"blinking\", \"blooming\", \"bally\", \"woundy\", \" flaming\" and \"ruddy\".\n\nPublications such as newspapers, police reports, and so on may print \"b__y\" instead of the full profanity. \nA spoken language equivalent is \"blankety\" or, less frequently, \"blanked\" or \"blanky\"; the spoken words are all variations of \"blank\", which, as a verbal representation of a dash, is used as a euphemism for a variety of \"bad\" words.\n\nUse of \"bloody\" as an adverbial or generic intensifier is to be distinguished from its fixed use in the expressions \"bloody murder\" and \"bloody hell\".\n\nIn \"bloody murder\", it has the original sense of an adjective used literally. \nThe King James Version of the Bible frequently uses \"bloody\" as an adjective in reference to bloodshed or violent crime, as in \"bloody crimes\" (Ezekiel 22:2), \"Woe to the bloody city\" (Ezekiel 24:6, Nahum 3:1). \"bloody men\" (26:9, Psalms 59:2, 139:19), etc. The expression of \"bloody murder\" goes back to at least Elizabethan English, as in Shakespeare's \"Titus Andronicus\" (c. 1591), \"bloody murder or detested rape\".\nThe expression \"scream bloody murder\" (in the figurative or desemanticised sense of \"to loudly object to something\" attested since c. 1860) is now considered American English, while in British English, the euphemistic \"blue murder\" had replaced \"bloody murder\" during the period of \"bloody\" being considered taboo.\n\nThe expression \"bloody hell\" is now used as a (slightly rude) general expression of surprise or as a general intensifier; e.g. \"bloody hell\" being used repeatedly in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" (2001, PG Rating).\n\nIn March 2006 Australia's national tourism commission launched an advertising campaign targeted at potential visitors in several English-speaking countries. The ad sparked controversy because of its ending (in which a cheerful, bikini-clad spokeswoman delivers the ad's call-to-action by saying \"...so where the bloody hell are you?\"). In the UK the BACC required that a modified version of the ad be shown in the United Kingdom, without the word \"bloody\", but in May 2006, the ASA ruled that the word \"bloody\" was not an inappropriate marketing tool and the original version of the ad was permitted to air.\n\nThe longer \"bloody hell-hounds\" appears to have been at least printable in early 19th century Britain. \"Bloody hell's flames\" as well as \"bloody hell\" is reported as a profanity supposedly used by Catholics against Protestants in 1845.\n\n"}
{"id": "1624953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1624953", "title": "Cabotage", "text": "Cabotage\n\nCabotage () is the transport of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country. It originally applied to shipping along coastal routes, port to port, but now applies to aviation, railways, and road transport as well.\n\nCabotage rights are the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries do not permit aviation cabotage, and there are strict sanctions against it, for reasons of economic protectionism, national security, or public safety. One notable exception is the European Union, whose Member States all grant cabotage rights to each other.\n\nCabotage originally meant simply coasting trade, from the French \"caboter\", to travel by the coast. Its ultimate origin is uncertain. The air transport meaning is attested in 1933.\n\nCabotage laws apply to merchant ships in most countries that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in congested territorial waters.\n\nFor the history of cabotage in UK law, see Navigation Acts.\n\nIn the United States, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (Jones Act) requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S.-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. The Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 states that no foreign vessels shall transport passengers between ports or places in the United States, either directly or by way of a foreign port.\n\nIndonesia implemented a cabotage policy in 2005 after previously allowing foreign-owned vessels to operate relatively freely within the country.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 1937) which is also known as the Cabotage Law restricts coastwise trade or the transport of passengers and goods within the country, to vessels with Philippine registry which has to secure a coastwise license from the Maritime Industry Authority. After the passage of Foreign Ships Co-Loading Act or the Republic Act No. 10668 in 2015, foreign vessels with cargo intended to be exported out the country may dock in multiple ports in the country before transiting to a foreign port.\n\nIn the EU, rights to cabotage in newly-admitted Member States (in particular, Greece, Spain and Portugal) were restricted; but this introductory provision was abandoned after criticism in the light of the Paros ferry disaster.\n\nThe Hague–Visby Rules, a convention which imposes duties on maritime carriers, apply only to \"carriage of goods by sea between ports in two different states\", and thus do not apply to cabotage shipping. However, section 1(3) of the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 declares that the Rules \"shall have effect ... where the port of shipment is a port in the United Kingdom, whether or not the carriage is between ports in two different States ...\".\n\nCabotage rights remain rare in passenger aviation. The Chicago Convention prohibits member states from granting cabotage on an exclusive basis, which has limited the availability of cabotage as a bargaining chip in bilateral aviation agreement negotiations. Cabotage is not granted under most open skies agreements.\n\nCarriers licensed under EU law are permitted to engage in cabotage in any EU member state, with some limitations. Ryanair, easyJet, Vueling, Wizz Air, and Aer Lingus have bases and operate domestic services outside their home countries.\n\nThe Closer Economic Relations agreement allows Australian air carriers to fly domestically and internationally from New Zealand and vice versa. An Australian carrier, Jetstar (a Qantas subsidiary), flies domestic routes within New Zealand. Air New Zealand offers one international destination from Australia outside New Zealand, flying between Sydney, Australia and Rarotonga of the Cook Islands. Previously, Qantas Jetconnect, Pacific Blue (a Virgin Australia subsidiary) and Ansett New Zealand were Australian-owned airlines based in New Zealand that operated domestic New Zealand services.\n\nAustralia also permits foreign-owned airlines incorporated under Australian law (such as Tiger Airways Australia and the domestic arm of Virgin Australia) to operate on domestic routes, although it prohibits such airlines from operating international routes as Australian flag carriers.\n\nChile has the most liberal cabotage rules in the world, enacted in 1979, which allow foreign airlines to operate domestic flights, conditional upon reciprocal treatment for Chilean carriers in the foreign airline's country. This unusual regime is partly due to Chile's geographical need for air service, and partly to incentivize liberalization in other countries amid the international expansion of its flag carrier LATAM Chile, which now has major operations in many other Latin American countries. Like Australia, Chile allows foreign companies to set up Chilean subsidiaries to offer domestic flights in Chile, regardless of reciprocity.\n\nBefore 1991, Lufthansa was prohibited from flying to West Berlin, so Pan Am, British Airways, and Air France operated the routes between West Germany and West Berlin. For a short time in the late 1980s, Trans World Airlines also flew between then-West Germany and West Berlin. During this time, Pan Am flew to Tegel, in Berlin, from Munich-Riem Airport (now closed) and Frankfurt. Air France flew from Düsseldorf. British Airways flew from Münster-Osnabrück, Hannover, and some other cities.\n\nIn 2003–2004, the United States Department of Transportation authorized Polynesian Airlines to provide temporary cabotage service in American Samoa after the existing US flag carrier ceased operations, one of very few instances where the US has granted cabotage rights in an emergency.\n\nIn October 2007, the United Kingdom granted Singapore carriers the right to fly domestic UK routes as part of an open skies agreement, which also allows British carriers to fly to any city from Singapore.\n\nReciprocal cabotage rights exist by treaty between New Zealand and Brunei and between the People's Republic of China and Albania.\n\nThe \"modified sixth freedom\" refers to the right to carry passengers between two points in country A through a hub in country B; for instance, a Boston-Toronto-Seattle itinerary. Such services are currently considered to constitute cabotage and are not permitted. In 2002, the United States fined Asiana Airlines for selling tickets from the mainland US to Guam and Saipan via Seoul.\n\nCertain airlines operate services within a foreign country without the right to carry local traffic. For instance, Qantas operates service between New York and Los Angeles solely for use by international connecting passengers. Such services are not generally considered to be cabotage.\n\n"}

{"id": "2384220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2384220", "title": "Cornish literature", "text": "Cornish literature\n\nCornish literature refers to written works in the Cornish language. The earliest surviving texts are in verse and date from the 14th century. There are virtually none from the 18th and 19th centuries but writing in revived forms of Cornish began in the early 20th century.\n\n\"The Prophecy of Ambrosius Merlin concerning the Seven Kings\" is a 12th-century poem written \"ca.\" 1144 by John of Cornwall in Latin, with some of the marginal notes in Cornish. John stated that the work was a translation based on an earlier document written in the Cornish language. The manuscript of the poem, on a codex currently held at the Vatican Library, is unique. It attracted little attention from the scholarly world until 1876, when Whitley Stokes undertook a brief analysis of the Cornish and Welsh vocabulary found in John's marginal commentary. These notes are among the earliest known writings in the Cornish language. In 2001 this important work was translated back into Cornish by Julyan Holmes.\n\n\"Pascon agan Arluth\" ('The Passion of our Lord'), a poem of 259 eight-line verses probably composed around 1375, is one of the earliest surviving works of Cornish literature. The most important work of literature surviving from the Middle Cornish period is the Cornish \"Ordinalia\", a 9000-line religious verse drama which had probably reached its present form by 1400. The \"Ordinalia\" consists of three mystery plays, \"Origo Mundi\", \"Passio Christi\" and \"Resurrexio Domini\", meant to be performed on successive days. Such plays were performed in a \"Plain an Gwarry\" (Playing place). In 1981, the Breton library Preder edited it in modern scripture under the name of \"Passyon agan arluth\".\n\nThe longest single surviving work of Cornish literature is \"Beunans Meriasek\" (The Life of Meriasek), a two-day verse drama dated 1504, but probably copied from an earlier manuscript.\n\nOther notable pieces of Cornish literature include the \"Creation of the World (with Noah's Flood)\" which is a miracle play similar to \"Origo Mundi\" but in a much later manuscript (1611); the \"Charter Fragment\", a short poem about marriage, believed to be the earliest connected text in the language; and \"Beunans Ke\", another saint's play only discovered in 2000, notable for including some Arthurian material.\n\nThe earliest surviving examples of Cornish prose are the Tregear Homilies, a series of 12 Catholic sermons written in English and translated by John Tregear around 1555-1557, to which a thirteenth homily \"The Sacrament of the Alter\" was added by another hand. Twelve of Edmund Bonner's \"Homelies to be read within his diocese of London of all Parsons, vycars and curates\" (1555; nine of these were by John Harpsfield) were translated into Cornish by John Tregear, and are now the largest single work of traditional Cornish prose.\n\nNicholas Boson (1624−1708) wrote three significant texts in Cornish, \"Nebbaz gerriau dro tho Carnoack\" (A Few Words about Cornish) between 1675 and 1708; \"Jowan Chy-an-Horth, py, An try foynt a skyans\" (John of Chyannor, or, The three points of wisdom), published by Edward Lhuyd in 1707, though written earlier; and \"The Dutchess of Cornwall's Progress\", partly in English, now known only in fragments. The first two are the only known surviving Cornish prose texts from the 17th century. Boson's work is collected, along with that of his son John Boson and his cousin Thomas Boson (1635–1719) in Oliver Padel's \"The Cornish writings of the Boson family\" (1975).\n\nFragments of Cornish writing continued to appear as the language was becoming extinct during the 18th century. However, in the late 19th century a few works by non-native speakers were produced; these efforts were followed by a more substantial revival in the 20th and 21st centuries. Of the early pieces the most significant is the so-called \"Cranken Rhyme\" produced by John Davey of Boswednack, one of the last people with some traditional knowledge of the language. The poem, published by John Hobson Matthews in 1892, may be the last piece of traditional Cornish literature. In 1865 German language enthusiast Georg Sauerwein composed two poems in the language. Later Hobson Matthews wrote several poems, such as the patriotic \"Can Wlascar Agam Mamvro\" (\"Patriotic Song of our Motherland\"), and Robert Morton Nance, a disciple of Henry Jenner, created a body of verse, for example \"Nyns yu Marow Myghtern Arthur\" (\"King Arthur is not Dead\"), which concerns the popular Cornish subject of King Arthur's legendary immortality. Both of these writers' works are characterised by a specifically revivalist mode.\n\nThese efforts were followed in the early 20th century by further works of revivalist literature by Cornish language enthusiasts. Works of this period were generally printed in limited publications by authors far removed from Cornwall and each other; their importance to the later revival movement was not fully recognized for decades. The literary output of the Cornish revival has largely been poetry. Notable writers of the time include Edward Chirgwin and A. S. D. Smith, whose epic poem \"Trystan hag Isolt\", a reworking of the Tristan and Iseult legend, is one of the most celebrated pieces of Cornish revival writing. Another significant early text is Peggy Pollard's 1941 play \"Beunans Alysaryn\", modelled on the 16th-century saints' plays.\n\nThis is an example of Cornish written by the hand of a native speaker . The text is also interesting from a sociolinguistic point of view in that Bodinar speaks about the contemporary state of the Cornish language in 1776.\n\nBelow it is written in Bodinar's original spelling, then in modern Cornish spelling (SWF), then a translation in English:\n\nThe later 20th century saw increasing interest in the Cornish language and its literature, and an expansion into other media. The dearth of Cornish readers has made the production of novels difficult, though three have been published. The earliest was Melville Bennetto's \"An Gurun Wosek a Geltya\" (\"The Bloody Crown of the Celtic Countries\") in 1984; subsequently Michael Palmer published \"Jory\" (1989) and \"Dyroans\" (1998). Tim Saunders and Nicholas Williams are among the contemporary poets writing in Cornish. Additionally, writers such as Nick Darke and Alan M. Kent have incorporated a Cornish background into English writing. Others have translated foreign works into Cornish. Jowann Richards (1926-2005) produced a Cornish translation of the \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" () in 1990. Beginning in the 2000s, translators set about translating the Bible in order to redress the handicap unique to Cornish, in that of all the modern Celtic languages, only Cornish had no Bible translation. The first complete edition of the New Testament in Cornish, Nicholas Williams's translation \"Testament Noweth agan Arluth ha Savyour Jesu Cryst\", was published at Easter 2002 by Spyrys a Gernow (); it uses Unified Cornish Revised orthography. The translation was made from the Greek text, and incorporated John Tregear's existing translations with slight revisions. In August 2004, Kesva an Taves Kernewek published its edition of the New Testament in Cornish (), translated by Keith Syed and Ray Edwards; it uses Kernewek Kemmyn orthography. It was launched in a ceremony in Truro Cathedral attended by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A translation of the Old Testament is currently in preparation.\n\n2009 saw the publication of a number of novels in Cornish. Nicholas Williams's translation of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" appeared as \"Alys in Pow an Anethow\" (), as did his translation of Craig Weatherhill's novel \"The Lyonesse Stone\", titled in Cornish \"Jowal Lethesow\" (). Kaspar Hocking's abridgement of Jules Verne's \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" was published as \"Adro dhe'n Bÿs in Peswar Ugans Dëdh\" (), and Eddie Foirbeis Climo's \"Kensa Lyver Redya\" () 'First Reading Book', a translation of Harriette Taylor Treadwell and Margaret Free's \"Primer\", was published as well.\n\nA list of many titles including translations and original stories for adults and children can be found on the Cornish language page.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46963", "title": "Cunt", "text": "Cunt\n\nCunt is a vulgar word for the vulva or vagina and is also used as a term of disparagement. Reflecting different national usages, \"cunt\" is described as \"an unpleasant or stupid person\" in the \"Compact Oxford English Dictionary\", whereas Merriam-Webster states that it is a \"usually disparaging and obscene\" term for a woman or an \"offensive way to refer to a woman\" in the United States. The \"Macquarie Dictionary\" of Australian English gives \"a contemptible person\". In Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, it can also be used as a neutral or, when used with a positive qualifier (e.g., \"good, funny, clever\"), a positive way of referring to a person.\n\nThe earliest known use of the word, according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", was as part of a placename of a London street, Gropecunt Lane, c. 1230. Use of the word as a term of abuse is relatively recent, dating from the late nineteenth century. The word appears not to have been taboo in the Middle Ages, but became taboo towards the end of the eighteenth century, and was then not generally admissible in print until the latter part of the twentieth century. The term has various derivative senses, including adjective and verb uses. Feminist writer and English professor Germaine Greer argues that \"cunt\" \"is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock.\"\n\nThe etymology of \"cunt\" is a matter of debate, but most sources consider the word to have derived from a Germanic word (Proto-Germanic \"*kuntō\", stem \"*kuntōn-\"), which appeared as ' in Old Norse. Scholars are uncertain of the origin of the Proto-Germanic form itself. There are cognates in most Germanic languages, such as the Swedish, Faroese and Nynorsk '; West Frisian and Middle Low German '; Middle Dutch '; Dutch ' (cunt) and ' (ass); Middle Low German '; Middle High German ' (\"); German ', and perhaps Old English '. The etymology of the Proto-Germanic term is disputed. It may have arisen by Grimm's law operating on the Proto-Indo-European root ' \" seen in gonads, genital, gamete, genetics, gene, or the Proto-Indo-European root ' \" (, seen in gynaecology). Relationships to similar-sounding words such as the Latin ' (\"), and its derivatives French ', Spanish ', and Portuguese ', or in Persian ' (), have not been conclusively demonstrated. Other Latin words related to \"cunnus\" are ' (\") and its derivative ' (\", (figurative) \"\"), leading to English words such as \"cuneiform\" (\"\"). In Middle English, \"cunt\" appeared with many spellings, such as ', ' and ', which did not always reflect the actual pronunciation of the word.\n\nThe word in its modern meaning is attested in Middle English. \"Proverbs of Hendyng\", a manuscript from some time before 1325, includes the advice:\n\nThe word \"cunt\" is generally regarded in English-speaking countries as unsuitable for normal public discourse. It has been described as \"the most heavily tabooed word of all English words\", although John Ayto, editor of the \"Oxford Dictionary of Slang\", says \"nigger\" is more taboo.\n\nSome American feminists of the 1970s sought to eliminate disparaging terms for women, including \"bitch\" and \"cunt\". In the context of pornography, Catharine MacKinnon argued that use of the word acts to reinforce a dehumanisation of women by reducing them to mere body parts; and in 1979 Andrea Dworkin described the word as reducing women to \"the one essential – 'cunt: our essence ... our offence'\".\n\nDespite criticisms, there is a movement among feminists that seeks to reclaim \"cunt\" not only as acceptable, but as an honorific, in much the same way that \"queer\" has been reappropriated by LGBT people and \"nigger\" has been by some African-Americans. Proponents include Inga Muscio in her book, \"\"; artist Tee Corinne in \"The Cunt Coloring Book\" (1975); and Eve Ensler in \"Reclaiming Cunt\" from \"The Vagina Monologues\".\n\nGermaine Greer, the feminist writer and professor of English who once published a magazine article entitled \"Lady, Love Your Cunt\" (anthologised in 1986), discussed the origins, usage and power of the word in the BBC series \"Balderdash and Piffle\", explaining how her views had developed over time. In the 1970s she had \"championed\" use of the word for the female genitalia, thinking it \"shouldn't be abusive\"; she rejected the \"proper\" word \"vagina\", a Latin name meaning \"sword-sheath\" originally applied by male anatomists to all muscle coverings (see synovial sheath) – not just because it refers only to the internal canal but also because of the implication that the female body is \"simply a receptacle for a weapon\". But in 2006, referring to its use as a term of abuse, she said that, though used in some quarters as a term of affection, it had become \"the most offensive insult one man could throw at another\" and suggested that the word was \"sacred\", and \"a word of immense power, to be used sparingly\".\n\n\"Cunt\" has been attested in its anatomical meaning since at least the 13th century. While Francis Grose's 1785 \"A Classical Dictionary of The Vulgar Tongue\" listed the word as \"C**T: a nasty name for a nasty thing\", it did not appear in any major English dictionary from 1795 to 1961, when it was included in \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" with the comment \"usu. considered obscene\". Its first appearance in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" was in 1972, which cites the word as having been in use from 1230 in what was supposedly a London street name of \"Gropecunte Lane\". It was, however, also used before 1230, having been brought over by the Anglo-Saxons, originally not an obscenity but rather an ordinary name for the vulva or vagina. Gropecunt Lane was originally a street of prostitution, a red light district. It was normal in the Middle Ages for streets to be named after the goods available for sale therein, hence the prevalence in cities having a medieval history of names such as \"Silver Street\" and \"Fish Street.\" In some locations, the former name has been bowdlerised, as in the City of York, to the more acceptable \"Grape Lane.\"\n\nThe word appears several times in Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" (c. 1390), in bawdy contexts, but since it is used openly, does not appear to have been considered obscene at that time. A notable use is from the \"Miller's Tale\": \"Pryvely he caught her by the queynte.\" The Wife of Bath also uses this term, \"For certeyn, olde dotard, by your leave/You shall have queynte right enough at eve ... What aileth you to grouche thus and groan?/Is it for ye would have my queynte alone?\" In modernised versions of these passages the word \"queynte\" is usually translated simply as \"cunt\". However, in Chaucer's usage there seems to be an overlap between the words \"cunt\" and \"quaint\" (possibly derived from the Latin for \"known\"). \"Quaint\" was probably pronounced in Middle English in much the same way as \"cunt\". It is sometimes unclear whether the two words were thought of as distinct from one another. Elsewhere in Chaucer's work the word \"queynte\" seems to be used with meaning comparable to the modern \"quaint\" (curious or old-fashioned, but nevertheless appealing). This ambiguity was still being exploited by the 17th century; Andrew Marvell's \"... then worms shall try / That long preserved virginity, / And your quaint honour turn to dust, / And into ashes all my lust\" in \"To His Coy Mistress\" depends on a pun on these two senses of \"quaint\".\n\nBy Shakespeare's day, the word seems to have become obscene. Although Shakespeare does not use the word explicitly (or with derogatory meaning) in his plays, he still uses wordplay to sneak it in obliquely. In Act III, Scene 2, of \"Hamlet\", as the castle's residents are settling in to watch the play-within-the-play, Hamlet asks his girlfriend Ophelia, \"Lady, shall I lie in your lap?\" Ophelia replies, \"No, my lord.\" Hamlet, feigning shock, says, \"Do you think I meant \"country matters\"?\" Then, to drive home the point that the accent is definitely on the first syllable of \"country\", Shakespeare has Hamlet say, \"That's a fair thought, to lie between maids' legs.\" In \"Twelfth Night\" (Act II, Scene V) the puritanical Malvolio believes he recognises his employer's handwriting in an anonymous letter, commenting \"There be her very Cs, her Us, and her Ts: and thus makes she her great Ps\", unwittingly punning on \"cunt\" and \"piss\", and while it has also been argued that the slang term \"cut\" is intended, Pauline Kiernan writes that Shakespeare ridicules \"prissy puritanical party-poopers\" by having \"a Puritan spell out the word 'cunt' on a public stage\". A related scene occurs in \"Henry V\": when Katherine is learning English, she is appalled at the \"gros, et impudique\" words \"foot\" and \"gown\", which her teacher has mispronounced as \"coun\". It is usually argued that Shakespeare intends to suggest that she has misheard \"foot\" as \"foutre\" (French, \"fuck\") and \"coun\" as \"con\" (French \"cunt\", also used to mean \"idiot\").\n\nSimilarly John Donne alludes to the obscene meaning of the word without being explicit in his poem \"The Good-Morrow\", referring to sucking on \"country pleasures.\" The 1675 Restoration comedy \"The Country Wife\" also features such word play, even in its title. \n\nBy the 17th century a softer form of the word, \"cunny\", came into use. A well-known use of this derivation can be found in the 25 October 1668 entry of the diary of Samuel Pepys. He was discovered having an affair with Deborah Willet: he wrote that his wife \"coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con [with] my hand sub [under] su [her] coats; and endeed I was with my main [hand] in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also...\"\n\n\"Cunny\" was probably derived from a pun on \"coney\", meaning \"rabbit\", rather as \"pussy\" is connected to the same term for a cat. (Philip Massinger (1583–1640): \"A pox upon your Christian cockatrices! They cry, like poulterers' wives, 'No money, no coney.'\") Because of this slang use as a synonym for a taboo term, the word \"coney\", when it was used in its original sense to refer to rabbits, came to be pronounced as (rhymes with \"phoney\"), instead of the original (rhymes with \"honey\"). Eventually the taboo association led to the word \"coney\" becoming deprecated entirely and replaced by the word \"rabbit\".\n\nRobert Burns (1759–1796) used the word in his \"\", a collection of bawdy verses which he kept to himself and were not publicly available until the mid-1960s. In \"Yon, Yon, Yon, Lassie\", this couplet appears: \"For ilka birss upon her cunt, Was worth a ryal ransom\".\n\nMerriam-Webster states it is a \"usually disparaging and obscene\" term for a woman, and that it is an \"offensive way to refer to a woman\" in the United States. As a broader derogatory term, it is comparable to \"prick\" and means \"a fool, a dolt, an unpleasant person – of either sex\". This sense is common in New Zealand, British and Australian English, where it is usually applied to men or as referring \"specifically\" to \"a despicable, contemptible or foolish\" \"man\". During the 1971 Oz trial for obscenity, prosecuting counsel asked writer George Melly \"Would you call your 10-year-old daughter a cunt?\" Melly replied \"No, because I don't think she is.\"\nIn the 1975 film \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", the central character McMurphy, when pressed to explain exactly why he does not like the tyrannical Nurse Ratched, says, \"Well, I don't want to break up the meeting or nothing, but she's something of a cunt, ain't she, Doc?\"\n\nIn American slang, the term can be used to refer to \"a fellow male homosexual one dislikes\".\n\nAustralian scholar Emma Alice Jane describes how the term as used on social media is an example of what she calls \"gendered vitriol,\" and an example of misogynistic e-bile.\n\nIt can also be used to refer to something very difficult or unpleasant (as in \"a cunt of a job\"), or (in British, Irish, New Zealand, and Australian English) with no negative connotations to refer to a (usually male) person. In this sense, it may be modified by a positive qualifier (funny, clever, etc.). For example, \"This is my mate Brian. He's a good cunt.\"\n\nIn the Survey of English Dialects the word was recorded in some areas as meaning \"the vulva of a cow\". This was pronounced as [kʌnt] in Devon, and [kʊnt] in the Isle of Man, Gloucestershire and Northumberland. Possibly related was the word \"cunny\" [kʌni], with the same meaning, at Wiltshire.\n\nThe word \"cunty\" is also known, although used rarely: a line from Hanif Kureishi's \"My Beautiful Laundrette\" is the definition of England by a Pakistani immigrant as \"eating hot buttered toast with cunty fingers\", suggestive of hypocrisy and a hidden sordidness or immorality behind the country's quaint façade. This term is attributed to British novelist Henry Green.\n\nIn the United States, \"cunty\" is sometimes used in cross-dressing drag ball culture for a drag queen that \"projects feminine beauty\" and was the title of a hit song by Aviance. A visitor to a New York drag show tells of the emcee praising a queen with \"cunty, cunty, cunty\" as she walks past.\n\nFrequency of use varies widely in the United States. According to research into American usage carried out in 2013 and 2014 by forensic linguist Jack Grieve of Aston University and others, including researchers from the University of South Carolina, based on a corpus of nearly 9 billion words in geotagged tweets, the word was most frequently used in New England and was least frequently used in the south-eastern states. In Maine, it was the most frequently used \"cuss word\" after \"asshole\".\n\nJames Joyce was one of the first of the major 20th-century novelists to put the word \"cunt\" into print. In the context of one of the central characters in \"Ulysses\" (1922), Leopold Bloom, Joyce refers to the Dead Sea and to \nJoyce uses the word figuratively rather than literally; but while Joyce used the word only once in \"Ulysses\", with four other wordplays ('cunty') on it, D H Lawrence used the word ten times in \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" (1928), in a more direct sense. Mellors, the gamekeeper and eponymous lover, tries delicately to explain the definition of the word to Lady Constance Chatterley: \"If your sister there comes ter me for a bit o' cunt an' tenderness, she knows what she's after.\" The novel was the subject of an unsuccessful UK prosecution in 1961 against its publishers, Penguin Books, on grounds of obscenity.\n\nSamuel Beckett was an associate of Joyce, and in his \"Malone Dies\" (1956), he writes: \"His young wife had abandoned all hope of bringing him to heel, by means of her cunt, that trump card of young wives.\" In 1998, Inga Muscio published \"\". In Ian McEwan's novel \"Atonement\" (2001), set in 1935, the word is used in the draft of a love letter mistakenly sent instead of a revised version, and although not spoken, is an important plot pivot.\n\nThe word is occasionally used in the titles of works of art, such as Peter Renosa's \"I am the Cunt of Western Civilization\". One of the first works of Gilbert & George was a self-portrait in 1969 entitled \"Gilbert the Shit and George the Cunt\".\n\nTheatre censorship was effectively abolished in the UK in 1968; prior to that all theatrical productions had to be vetted by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. English stand-up comedian Roy \"Chubby\" Brown claims that he was the first person to say the word on stage in the United Kingdom.\n\nBroadcast media are regulated for content, and media providers such as the BBC have guidelines as to how \"cunt\" and similar words should be treated. In a survey of 2000 commissioned by the British Broadcasting Standards Commission, Independent Television Commission, BBC and Advertising Standards Authority, \"cunt\" was regarded as the most offensive word which could be heard, above \"motherfucker\" and \"fuck\". Nevertheless, there have been occasions when, particularly in a live broadcast, the word has been aired outside editorial control:\n\nThe first scripted uses of the word on British television occurred in 1979, in the ITV drama \"No Mama No\". In \"Jerry Springer – The Opera\" (BBC, 2005), the suggestion that the Christ character might be gay was found more controversial than the chant describing the Devil as \"cunting, cunting, cunting, cunting cunt\".\n\nIn July 2007 BBC Three broadcast an hour-long documentary, entitled \"The 'C' Word\", about the origins, use and evolution of the word from the early 1900s to the present day. Presented by British comedian Will Smith, viewers were taken to a street in Oxford once called \"Gropecunt Lane\" and presented with examples of the acceptability of \"cunt\" as a word. (Note that \"the C-word\" is also a long-standing euphemism for cancer; Lisa Lynch's book led to a BBC1 drama, both with that title.)\n\nThe \"Attitudes to potentially offensive language and gestures on TV and radio\" report by Ofcom, based on research conducted by Ipsos MORI, categorised the usage of the word 'cunt' as a highly unacceptable pre-watershed, but generally acceptable post-watershed, along with 'fuck' and 'motherfucker'. Discriminatory words were generally considered as more offensive than the most offensive non-discriminatory words such as 'cunt' by the UK public, with discriminatory words being more regulated as a result.\n\nThe first scripted use on US television was on the \"Larry Sanders Show\" in 1992, and a notable use occurred in \"Sex and the City\". In the US, an episode of the NBC TV show \"30 Rock\", titled \"The C Word\", centred around a subordinate calling protagonist Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) a \"cunt\" and her subsequent efforts to regain her staff's favour. Characters in the popular TV series, \"The Sopranos,\" often used the term. Jane Fonda uttered the word on a live airing of the \"Today Show\", a network broadcast-TV news program, in 2008 when being interviewed about \"The Vagina Monologues\". In 2018, controversy erupted when Canadian comedian Samantha Bee used the term as a slur targeting Ivanka Trump, a White House official and the daughter of US President Donald Trump.\n\nOn 6 December 2010 on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, presenter James Naughtie referred to the British Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt as \"Jeremy Cunt\"; he later apologized for what the BBC called the inadvertent use of \"an offensive four-letter word\". In the programme following, about an hour later, Andrew Marr referred to the incident during \"Start the Week\" where it was said that \"we won't repeat the mistake\" whereupon Marr slipped up in the same way as Naughtie had.\n\nThe word appears in graffiti on a wall in the 1969 film \"Bronco Bullfrog\". The first spoken use of the word in mainstream cinema occurs in \"Carnal Knowledge\" (1971), in which Jonathan (Jack Nicholson) asks, \"Is this an ultimatum? Answer me, you ball-busting, castrating, son of a cunt bitch! Is this an ultimatum or not?\" In the same year, the word was used in the film \"Women in Revolt\", in which Holly Woodlawn shouts \"I love cunt\" whilst avoiding a violent boyfriend. Nicholson later used it again, in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975). Two early films by Martin Scorsese, \"Mean Streets\" (1973) and \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), use the word in the context of the virgin-whore dichotomy, with characters using it after they were rejected (in \"Mean Streets\") or after they have slept with the woman (in \"Taxi Driver\").\n\nIn notable instances, the word has been edited out. \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) was released in two versions, \"R\" (Restricted) and \"PG\" (Parental Guidance), the latter omitting or replacing dialogue such as Tony Manero (John Travolta)'s comment to Annette (Donna Pescow), \"It's a decision a girl's gotta make early in life, if she's gonna be a nice girl or a cunt\". This differential persists, and in \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991), Agent Starling (Jodie Foster) meets Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) for the first time and passes the cell of \"Multiple Miggs\", who says to Starling: \"I can smell your cunt.\" In versions of the film edited for television the word is dubbed with the word scent. The 2010 film \"Kick-Ass\" caused a controversy when the word was used by Hit-Girl because the actress playing the part, Chloë Grace Moretz, was 11 years old at the time of filming.\nIn Britain, use of the word \"cunt\" may result in an \"18\" rating from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), and this happened to Ken Loach's film \"Sweet Sixteen\", because of an estimated twenty uses of \"cunt\". Still, the BBFC's guidelines at \"15\" state that \"very strong language may be permitted, depending on the manner in which it is used, who is using the language, its frequency within the work as a whole and any special contextual justification.\" Also directed by Loach, \"My Name is Joe\" was given a 15 certificate despite more than one instance of the word. The 2010 Ian Dury biopic \"Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll\" was given a \"15\" rating despite containing seven uses of the word.\n\nIn their Derek and Clive dialogues, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, particularly Cook, arguably made the word more accessible in the UK; in the 1976 sketch \"This Bloke Came Up To Me\", \"cunt\" is used approximately thirty-five times. The word is also used extensively by British comedian Roy 'Chubby' Brown, which ensures that his stand-up act has never been fully shown on UK television.\n\nAustralian stand-up comedian Rodney Rude frequently refers to his audiences as \"cunts\" and makes frequent use of the word in his acts, which got him arrested in Queensland and Western Australia for breaching obscenity laws of those states in the mid-1980s. Australian comedic singer Kevin Bloody Wilson makes extensive use of the word, most notably in the songs \"Caring Understanding Nineties Type\" and \"You Can't Say \"Cunt\" in Canada\".\n\nThe word appears in American comic George Carlin's 1972 standup routine on the list of the seven dirty words that could not, at that time, be said on American broadcast television, a routine that led to a U. S. Supreme Court decision. While some of the original seven are now heard on US broadcast television from time to time, \"cunt\" remains generally taboo except on premium paid subscription cable channels like HBO or Showtime. Comedian Louis C.K. uses the term frequently in his stage act as well as on his television show \"Louie\" on FX network, which bleeps it out.\n\nIn 2018, Canadian comedian Samantha Bee, ignited a firestorm when she used the term disparagingly in a comedy routine on an American late night TV show, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.\n\nThe 1977 Ian Dury and The Blockheads album, \"New Boots and Panties\" used the word in the opening line of the track \"Plaistow Patricia\", thus: \"Arseholes, bastards, fucking cunts and pricks\", particularly notable as there is no musical lead-in to the lyrics.\n\nIn 1979, during a concert at New York's Bottom Line, Carlene Carter introduced a song about mate-swapping called \"Swap-Meat Rag\" by stating, \"If this song don't put the cunt back in country, I don't know what will.\" The comment was quoted widely in the press, and Carter spent much of the next decade trying to live the comment down. However use of the word in lyrics is not recorded before the Sid Vicious's 1978 version of \"My Way\", which marked the first known use of the word in a UK top 10 hit, as a line was changed to \"You cunt/I'm not a queer\". The following year, \"cunt\" was used more explicitly in the song \"Why D'Ya Do It?\" from Marianne Faithfull's album \"Broken English\": \n\nThe Happy Mondays song, \"Kuff Dam\" (i.e. \"Mad fuck\" in reverse), from their 1987 debut album, \"Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)\", includes the lyrics \"You see that Jesus is a cunt / And never helped you with a thing that you do, or you don't.\" Biblical scholar James Crossley, writing in the academic journal, \"Biblical Interpretation\", analyses the Happy Mondays' reference to \"Jesus is a cunt\" as a description of the \"useless assistance\" of a now \"inadequate Jesus\". A phrase from the same lyric, \"Jesus is a cunt\" was included on the notorious Cradle of Filth T-shirt which depicted a masturbating nun on the front and the slogan \"Jesus is a cunt\" in large letters on the back. The T-shirt was banned in New Zealand, in 2008.\n\nLiz Phair in \"Dance of Seven Veils\" on her 1993 album \"Exile in Guyville\", uses the word in the line \"I only ask because I'm a real cunt in spring\".\n\nThe word has been used by numerous non-mainstream bands, such as Australian band TISM, who released an extended play in 1993 \"Australia the Lucky Cunt\" (a reference to Australia's label the \"lucky country\"). They also released a single in 1998 entitled \"I Might Be a Cunt, but I'm Not a Fucking Cunt\", which was banned. The American grindcore band Anal Cunt, on being signed to a bigger label, shortened their name to AxCx.\n\nThe word appears once in Nicki Minaj's 2010 song \"Roman's Revenge.\" The song includes the lyric \"I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt.\"\n\nMore recently, in 2012, the word appears at least 10 times in Azealia Banks' song \"212\". She is also known to refer to her fans on Facebook as \"kuntz\". Banks has said she is \"tired\" of defending her profanity-laden lyrics from critics, saying they reflect her everyday speech and experiences.\n\nThe 2004 video game \"\" was the first major video game to use the word, along with being the first in the series to use the words \"nigga\", \"motherfucker\", and \"cocksucker\". It was used just once, by the British character Kent Paul (voiced by Danny Dyer), who refers to Maccer as a \"soppy cunt\" in the mission \"Don Peyote.\"\n\nThe 2004 title \"\" by SCEE used the word several times during the game.\n\nIn the 2008 title \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" (developed by Rockstar North and distributed by Take Two Interactive), the word, amongst many other expletives, was used by James Pegorino who, after finding out that his personal bodyguard had turned states, exclaimed \"The world is a cunt!\" while aiming a shotgun at the player.\n\nPopular singer, Rihanna, has been outspoken about her use of the word \"cunt\". She was photographed in 2011 wearing a necklace spelling the word. She later explained why she uses it in an interview with British \"Vogue\". The Barbados-born singer said she \"never knew\" that the word was offensive until she moved to the United States.\n\nVarious euphemisms, minced forms and in-jokes are used to imply the word without actually saying it, thereby escaping obvious censure and censorship.\n\nDeriving from a dirty joke: \"What's the difference between a circus and a strip club?\"- \"The circus has a bunch of cunning stunts...\" The phrase \"cunning stunt\" has been used in popular music. Its first documented appearance was by the English band Caravan, who released the album \"Cunning Stunts\" in July 1975; the title was later used by Metallica for a CD/Video compilation, and in 1992 the Cows released an album with the same title. In his 1980s BBC television programme, Kenny Everett played a vapid starlet, \"Cupid Stunt\".\n\nThere are numerous informal acronyms, including various apocryphal stories concerning academic establishments, such as the \"Cambridge University National Trust Society\".\n\nThere are many variants of the covering phrase \"See you next Tuesday\". Creative works with that phrase as a title include a play by Ronald Harwood, the second album by hip hop group FannyPack, a 2013 independent film by Drew Tobia, a song by deathcore band The Acacia Strain on their 2006 album \"The Dead Walk\", a song by Kesha from the 2010 EP \"Cannibal\", and an experimental deathcore band.\n\nA more recent acronym is \"Can't Use New Technology\" which is thought to originate from IT staff.\n\nThe name \"Mike Hunt\" is a frequent pun on \"my cunt\"; it has been used in a scene from the movie \"Porky's\", and for a character in the BBC radio comedy \"Radio Active\" in the 1980s. \"Has Anyone Seen Mike Hunt?\" were the words written on a \"pink neon sculpture\" representing the letter C, in a 2004 exhibition of the alphabet at the British Library in collaboration with the International Society of Typographic Designers.\n\nAs well as obvious references, there are also allusions. On \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\", Stephen Fry once defined \"countryside\" as the act of \"murdering Piers Morgan\".\n\nEven Parliaments are not immune from punning uses; as recalled by former Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam:\nand Mark Lamarr used a variation of this same gag on BBC TV's \"Never Mind the Buzzcocks\". \"Stuart Adamson was a Big Country member... and we do remember\".\n\nSeveral celebrities have had their names used as euphemisms, including footballer Roger Hunt, actor Gareth Hunt, singer James Blunt, politician Jeremy Hunt, and 1970s motor-racing driver James Hunt, whose name was once used to introduce the British radio show \"I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue\" as \"the show that is to panel games what James Hunt is to rhyming slang\".\n\nAn old canting form is \"berk\", short for \"Berkeley Hunt\" or \"Berkshire Hunt\", and in a Monty Python sketch, an idioglossiac man replaces the initial \"c\" of words with \"b\", producing \"silly bunt\". Scottish comedian Chic Murray claimed to have worked for a firm called \"Lunt, Hunt & Cunningham\".\n\nThe word \"cunt\" forms part of some technical terms used in seafaring and other industries.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It occurs because a system of liquid and gas at equilibrium will see a net conversion of liquid to gas as pressure lowers, for example, liquids reach their boiling point at lower temperatures when the pressure on them is lowered.\n\nIn the atmospheric pressure present at sea level, water boils at . At an altitude of , it boils at only , the normal body temperature of humans. This altitude is known as \"Armstrong’s Line.\" In practice bodily fluids do not boil off at this altitude. This is because the skin and outer organs have enough strength to withstand this pressure, thus pressure inside the body would be significantly higher—however, bubbles starting to form is still an issue.\n\nSymptoms of ebullism include bubbles in the membranes of the mouth and eyes, swelling of the skin, and bubbles in the blood. Blood circulation and breathing may be impaired or stopped. The brain tissue may be starved of oxygen because of blockage of arteries, and the lungs may swell and hemorrhage. Death results unless recompression is rapid enough to reduce the bubbles before tissue damage occurs.\n\nIn 1960, Joseph Kittinger experienced localised ebullism during a ascent in a helium-driven gondola. His right-hand glove failed to pressurise and his hand expanded to roughly twice its normal volume accompanied by disabling pain. His hand took about 3 hours to recover after his return to the ground.\n\nTo prevent ebullism, a pure oxygen (O) atmosphere was used in early space flights to eliminate nitrogen in the blood. There are major fire hazards associated with using pure O as a breathing gas, which was central to the death of three astronauts in a fire during a ground test with Apollo 1. Nonetheless NASA continued to use a [nominally] pure oxygen atmosphere throughout the Apollo Program but switched to air for the follow-on Space Transport System \"Space Shuttle\". Russian cosmonauts used pure oxygen before changing to a higher-pressure nitrox mixture, leading to incompatibility problems in 1975 on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Space suits are often pressurized to several psi lower than stations' capsules or shuttles and since they still use pure O, an acclimation period is common in the airlock to remove nitrogen and other gases from the bloodstream.\n\n"}

{"id": "622304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=622304", "title": "Ernesto Laclau", "text": "Ernesto Laclau\n\nErnesto Laclau (; 6 October 1935 – 13 April 2014) was an Argentine political theorist. He is often described as an 'inventor' of post-Marxist political theory. He is well known for his collaborations with his long-term partner, Chantal Mouffe.\n\nHe studied History in Buenos Aires, graduating from the Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires in 1964, and received a PhD from the University of Essex in 1977.\n\nSince 1986 he served as Professor of Political Theory at the University of Essex, where he founded and directed for many years the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, as well as the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Under his directorship, the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme has provided a research framework for the development of a distinct type of discourse analysis that draws on post-structuralist theory (especially the work of Saussure, and Derrida), post analytic thought (Wittgenstein, and Richard Rorty) and psychoanalysis (primarily the work of Lacan) to provide innovative analysis of concrete political phenomena, such as identities, discourses and hegemonies. This theoretical and analytical orientation is known today as the 'Essex School of discourse analysis'.\n\nOver his career Laclau lectured extensively in many universities in North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia, and South Africa. Most recently he has held positions at SUNY Buffalo and Northwestern University, both in the US.\n\nLaclau died of a heart attack in Seville in 2014.\n\nLaclau studied History at the University of Buenos Aires and was a member of the PSIN (Socialist Party of the National Left) until 1969, when the British historian Eric Hobsbawm supported his entrance to Oxford. He had close links with Jorge Abelardo Ramos, the founder of the PSIN, although he stated in 2005 that the latter had evolved in a direction he did not appreciate. In the same interview, he claimed that he came from a Yrigoyenista family, and that the Peronist politician Arturo Jauretche, a strong opponent of Justo's dictatorship during the Infamous Decade of the 1930s, was a close friend of his father.\n\nIn his later years, he had close ties with the Argentine Socialist Confederation (Spanish: \"Confederación Socialista Argentina\"), and in Argentina he is associated with Peronism.\n\nLaclau's early work was influenced by Althusserian Marxism and focused on issues debated within Neo-Marxist circles in the 1970s, such as the role of the state, the dynamics of capitalism, the importance of building popular movements, and the possibility of revolution. Laclau's most significant book is \"Hegemony and Socialist Strategy\", which he co-authored with Chantal Mouffe in 1985. The position outlined in this book is usually described as post-Marxist because it rejects (a) Marxist economic determinism and (b) the view that class struggle is the most important antagonism in society. In their 2001 introduction to the second edition Laclau and Mouffe commented on this label, stating that whilst \"'post\"-Marxist' they were also 'post-\"Marxist\"': their work, though a departure from traditional Western Marxism, retained similar concerns and ideas. A key innovation in \"Hegemony and Socialist Strategy\" was Laclau and Mouffe's argument that left-wing movements need to build alliances with a wide variety of different groups if they are to be successful and establish a left-wing 'hegemony'. In the final chapter of the book, the project of \"radical and plural democracy\" was advocated: a democracy in which subjects accept the importance of the values of liberty and equality, but fight over what the terms mean.\n\nIn \"Hegemony and Socialist Strategy\" Laclau and Mouffe also offered a constructivist account of 'discourse'. By drawing on the work of the later Wittgenstein, they argued that social entities only become meaningful through discursive articulation. As such, the meaning of something is never pre-given but is, instead, constructed through social practices. Laclau subsequently used this account of discourse to re-consider the nature of identity, arguing that all political identities are discursive - even if they are experienced by individuals as 'natural' (even to the point where one's identity is not recognised as an identity). For example, though an individual may think that they are just 'born male' this is, for Laclau, not the case: 'maleness' is a socially constructed category that has no innate meaning.\n\nIn his more recent works Laclau returned to a topic that was prevalent in his earliest writings: populism. In \"On Populist Reason\", Laclau considered the nature of populism in political discourse, the creation of a popular hegemonic bloc such as \"the people\", and the importance of affect in politics. Building on his earlier work, Laclau argued that the basis of populism lies in the creation of \"empty signifiers\": words and ideas that express a universal idea of justice, and symbolically structure the political environment. Against those who see populism as a threat to democracy, Laclau argued that it is an essential component of it.\n\nLaclau is known for his long standing dialogue with Lacanian 'arch-Marxist' Slavoj Žižek. This dates back to at least 1989, when Laclau wrote the introduction to Žižek's first book in English (\"The Sublime Object of Ideology\"). Žižek is widely recognized as responsible for Laclau's increased acceptance of Lacanian ideas, and his essay 'Beyond Discourse Analysis', which was published in Laclau's \"New Reflections on the Revolutions of Our Time\" (1990), provided a psychoanalytic critique of Laclau's work. In 2000 Laclau, Žižek, and Judith Butler published the trialogue \"Contingency, Hegemony, Universality\", in which each responded to the others' works in a three-essay cycle. Though Žižek and Laclau noted their similarities and mutual respect, significant political and theoretical differences emerged between all three interlocutors. Following several acrimonious publications in the early 2000s Laclau wrote in 2005's \"On Populist Reason\" that Žižek had an impractical and confused approach to politics, describing him as 'waiting for the martians'. Their disagreement escalated in the pages of \"Critical Inquiry\" in 2006 where, in a spate of essays, the two argued in an increasingly hostile manner about political action, Marxism and class struggle, Hegel, populism, and the Lacanian Real. More recently, in a 2014 interview with David Howarth, Laclau stated that his relationship with Žižek had deteriorated due to the latter adopting a 'frantic ultra-Leftist stance, wrapped in a Leninism of kindergarten'.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The language is attested through some 80 runic inscriptions, many of which are difficult to date and not all of which were necessarily carved by people born in Greenland.\n\nIt is difficult to identify specifically Greenlandic linguistic features in the limited runic material. Nevertheless, there are inscriptions showing the use of \"t\" for historical \"þ\" in words such as \"torir\" rather than \"þorir\" and \"tana\" rather than \"þana\". This linguistic innovation has parallels in West Norwegian in the late medieval period. On the other hand, Greenlandic appears to have retained some features which changed in other types of Scandinavian. This includes initial \"hl\" and \"hr\", otherwise only preserved in Icelandic, and the long vowel \"œ\", which merged with \"æ\" in Icelandic but was preserved in Norwegian.\n\nGreenlandic Norse is believed to have been in language contact with Greenlandic, the language of the indigenous Kalaallit, and to have left loanwords in that language. In particular, the Greenlandic word \"Kalaaleq\" (older \"Karaaleq\"), meaning \"Greenlander\", is believed to be derived from the word \"Skrælingr\", the Norse term for the people they encountered in North America. It has also been suggested that the word \"kona\", meaning \"woman\", is of Norse origin.\n\nThe available evidence does not establish the presence of language attrition; the language most likely disappeared with the ethnic group that spoke it.\n\nA main characteristic of Greenlandic Norse was that it was very conservative. The older forms of speaking, which had come from Iceland and Norway, were kept intact. In keeping with this conservatism, the Greenlanders likewise maintained the older runic characteristics, most of which had fallen out of use in other countries. Notwithstanding this, they created new designs for the ð-, b-, p- and r-runes.\n\nThe Kingittorsuaq Runestone dates from c. 1300, discovered near Upernavik, far north of the Norse settlements. It was presumably carved by Norse explorers.\nThe patronymic \"Tortarson\" (standardized Old Norse: \"Þórðarson\") shows the change from \"þ\" to \"t\" while the word \"hloþu\" (Old Icelandic \"hlóðu\", Old Norwegian \"lóðu\") shows the retention of initial \"hl\".\n\n\n\n"}

Today, the Maroon Spirit language is used by Jamaican Maroons (largely Coromantees) while possessed by the spirits of ancestors during Coromantee (Kromanti) ceremonies or when addressing those who are possessed.\n\nThe term \"Kromanti\" is used by participants in such ceremonies in order to refer to the language spoken by ancestors in the distant past, prior to the creolization of Jamaican Maroon Creole. This term is used to refer to a language which is \"clearly not a form of Jamaican Creole and displays very little English content\" (Bilby 1983: 38). While Kromanti is not a functioning language, those possessed by ancestral spirits are attributed the ability to speak it. More remote ancestors are compared with more recent ancestors on a gradient, such that increasing strength and ability in the use of the non-creolized Kromanti are attributed to increasingly remote ancestors (as opposed to the Jamaican Maroon Creole used to address these ancestors).\n\nThe language was brought along by the Maroon population from Trelawny town to Nova Scotia in 1796 where they were sent in exile.

Participants typically negotiate an outline of what activities will and will not take place. The participants describe what they desire, do not desire, will and will not tolerate, including the determination of limits. For example, it is common to set a safeword and to establish certain types of play as prohibited.\n\nThe BDSM usage of the terminology \"limits\" derives from the concept of \"off limits\", the idea of limiting a scene to a specific set of activities, and the limitations (in terms of interest, as well as physical and emotional tolerance) of the participants.\n\nBoth dominants and submissives can set limits. Limits can be agreed to verbally or they can be incorporated into a formal contract. Sometimes the participants engage in a formal conversation about limits and boundaries; this is referred to as negotiation. Other couples discuss their likes and dislikes in a similar manner to \"Vanilla\" relationships.\n\nSome partners choose not to set limits. This is commonly seen in total power exchange dynamics, consensual non-consent, and edgeplay. Whether or not this type of arrangement is considered \"safe, sane and consensual\" is a matter of some controversy in BDSM communities, those favoring the approach pointing that limits are either wishful thoughts which can never be reliably enforced, or sometimes, just deceptions in order to find acceptance by society.\n\nThe terminology varies slightly across different local communities and Internet forums. However, there are general usages recognized across most BDSM populations.\n\nA hard limit is something that must not be done. Violating a hard limit is often considered a just cause for ending a scene or even a relationship. Examples include “scat is a hard limit for me” or “I have a back injury, so striking on the back is a hard limit”.\n\nA soft limit is something that a person hesitates about or places strict conditions on, but for which they may still give informed consent. An action could be prohibited except under specific circumstances or an area of discomfort that someone wishes to avoid. Soft limits can also include actions that require a cautious approach or — while somewhat appealing — still generate an uncomfortable amount of apprehension in one or more partners.\n\nA requirement limit, or must-limit, is something without which one or more partners will not participate in the scene. Examples include “lots of hair pulling is a must-limit for me” or “if you’re going to flog me, I’ll need lots of aftercare.”\n\nA time limit is a set time period for which an activity or temporary relationship takes place. This is most common for scenes and casual play.\n\nSome couples practice time limitations for relationships. They can be used to set time limits on phases of relationships, such as training or consideration.\n\n\n\n"}

From the outside, it may seem to involve players from both teams clustering tightly around the ball competing for possession. Analogously, in a media scrum reporters cluster around a public figure competing for his or her attention.\n\nIn Canada, the scrum is a daily ritual in the hallway outside the House of Commons. Members of the Parliamentary Press Gallery surround politicians as they exit the chamber. The disorganization and pressure of the scrum makes it notorious for drawing remarks that are unplanned or controversial. Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish remarked, \"damn Americans, I hate those bastards\" during a scrum in the run-up to the Iraq War.\n\nBecause of these concerns, politicians have sometimes tried to avoid the scrum in favour of more formal venues. Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day declined to scrum, instead holding a daily press conference. Brian Mulroney restricted scrums during his time as Prime Minister of Canada by positioning himself on the stairway up to his office. This allowed him to tower over the media on the steps below him. The media so resented this practice that when Jean Chrétien held a \"staircase scrum\" soon after assuming office, their reaction was so negative that he promised never to do it again. By contrast, although Pierre Trudeau's relationship with the press was rocky, he was famously quick-witted and enjoyed deflecting — or returning — barbs from reporters. Many of his famous quotations, including \"there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\" and \"just watch me\", were made during scrums.\n"}

{"id": "3317736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3317736", "title": "Mint mark", "text": "Mint mark\n\nA mint mark is a letter, symbol or an inscription on a coin indicating the mint where the coin was produced.\n\nMint marks were first developed to locate a problem. If a coin was underweight, or overweight, the mint mark would immediately tell where the coin was minted, and the problem could be located and fixed. Another problem which could occur would be a dishonest mint official debasing the coin, or putting less precious metal in the coin than specified. The first mint marks, called \"Magistrate Marks\" were developed by the Greeks, and named the Magistrate in charge of producing that coin. Debasing a coin, or otherwise tampering with it, was a very serious crime, often punishable by death in many civilizations. For example, in 1649, the directors of the Spanish colonial American Mint at Potosi, in what is today Bolivia, were condemned to death for seriously debasing the coinage. The initials of the assayer as well as the mint mark were immediate identifiers when the coins were inspected.\n\nIn some cases the symbols found in the field of ancient Greek coins indicated mints, not magistrates. Mints in territories conquered by Alexander the Great struck coins with the types he used in Macedon but marked with a local symbol. For example, Rhodes struck coins with Alexander’s types marked with a rose, a local symbol previously used on its own coins.\n\nA reform of Diocletian made mint marks a regular feature of ancient Roman coinage. These mint marks were placed at the bottom of the reverse of the coin and contained three parts. The first part indicates that this was a coin with either SM for Sacra Moneta, M for Moneta, or P for Pecurnia. The second part was an abbreviation of the name of the mint such as ROM for Rome or LON for London. The final part indicated the workshop within the mint. The reform of Anastasius, which is the traditional dividing point between the coinage of the Roman and the Later Roman (a.k.a. Byzantine) empires, replaced the mint marks on gold coins by the inscription CONOB, meaning the pure standard of Constantinople, which was used by a variety of mints. Mint marks continued on copper coinage until the second half of the seventh century, however.\nMint names began to appear on French coins under Pepin and became mandatory under Charlemagne. In 1389, Charles IV adopted a system called Secret Points. This scheme placed a dot under the first letter of the legend on coins of Crémieu, under the second letter for Romans, up to the twenty-second letter for Bourges. In the fifteenth century letters or symbols placed at the end of the legend indicating the mint were used in addition to Secret Points. In 1540, Francis I discontinued Secret Points in favor of a system of letters; A for Paris, B for Rouen, …, Z for Lyon; in the field. He also made it the rule for mint-masters to place their personal marks on coins, as they had done with increasing frequency since the coinage of Louis XI. This was one of the few royal practices continued by the Republic of France. The mint letters continued until 1898 (briefly revived in 1914 and from 1942-58) and the mint-masters marks, supplemented by the mark of the Chief Engraver, are still used.\n\nSome Medieval English coins used mint names . When William III retired hammered coinage, branch mints which helped strike machine made coins to replace it put their initials below his bust. The Royal Mint established branches to coin sovereigns near the sources of gold. These issues show the initials of Sydney, Melbourne, Victoria, and Perth Australia as well as Canada, South Africa, and India. The privately owned Soho Mint obtained a contract to strike royal copper coins with steam presses and put its name on these coins and on coins it minted for other countries. When it closed, Ralph Heaton acquired its equipment, founded the Birmingham Mint, and put his H mint mark on coins of Canada, among others.\nThe Spanish Empire introduced mint marks to the New World when they authorized Mexico City to open a mint on 11 May 1535. The Spanish Empire established mints throughout its American territories, each with their own mint mark. After its revolution, Mexico continued to use its colonial Mo monogram mint mark shown on either side of the date in the Spanish Milled Dollar. The United States of America established mints in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dahlonega, Georgia in 1838 after the Georgia Gold Rush and put its first mint marks on the gold coins struck there. Like other countries, the United States has since placed mint marks not only on its own coins but also those of its territories, such as the Philippines, and other countries for which it has contracts to strike coins, such as Fiji.\n\nIn the 19th century, numismatists (coin collectors) did not generally collect coins according to mint mark; rather, they attempted to obtain date sets of coins. A turnaround began after 1893, when A. G. Heaton's \"A Treatise on Coinage of the United States Branch Mints\" was published. Heaton cited example after example of mint-marked coins that were much scarcer than Philadelphia products and that should bring high premiums. When the United States abandoned silver coinage in 1964, mint marks were removed from the new copper-nickel coins in the belief that it would reduce the removal of coins from circulation by collectors. The silver coins quickly disappeared from circulation, and it was feared that if collectors saved too many of the new coins, there would be a serious shortage of coinage. Mint marks were returned to United States coins in 1968.\n\nThe current mint marks on United States coinage are P, D,S,and W for the 4 currently operating US Mints. The letter P is used for the Philadelphia Mint, D for the Denver Mint, S for the San Francisco Mint, and W for the West Point Mint. Over time there have been 9 official United States Mints. The first US Mint was in Philadelphia which began coin production with large cents and the half cents of pure copper in early 1793. Other US Mints, prior to the twentieth century, were considered \"branch mints\". United States mint marks were originally used to distinguish coins not made in Philadelphia. The 8 mint marks used to distinguish coins not minted in Philadelphia (in the chronological order of their first coinage) are: D for the Dahlonega Mint (production of coins started on February 12, 1838), C for the Charlotte Mint (March 27, 1838), O for the New Orleans Mint (May 8, 1838), S for the San Francisco Mint (April 3,1854), CC for the Carson City Mint (February 11, 1870), D again (Dahlonega had closed in 1861 never to reopen) now for the Denver Mint (March 12 1906), M for Manilla (where an official US Mint began with the coinage of a one centavo coin on July 15, 1920) and lastly a W for the West Point Mint. The West Point Mint began coin production on July 29,1974 to ease the shortage of quarters and other minor coinage and bore no mint mark. Thus West Point coins could not be distinguished from those made at the Philadelphia Mint. The West Point mint mark, \"W\", was first used on the $10 gold coins commemorating the 1984 Olympic games in Los Angeles. Most Philadelphia Mint coins from earlier than 1980 were unmarked with the notable exception being wartime nickels (1942-1945). The P mint mark was first used on the Susan B. Anthony Dollars starting 1979. From 1980 until 2017, the Lincoln cent was the only coin that did not always have a mint mark, using a \"D\" when struck in Denver but lacking a \"P\" when ostensibly struck at the Philadelphia mint. This practice allowed the additional minting of coins at the San Francisco mint (\"S\") and West Point mint (\"W\") without the use of their respective mint marks to address circulating coinage needs without the concern of creating scarce varieties that would be plucked from circulation by collectors. In the single year of 2017 the Philadelphia \"P\" was added to the Lincoln cent to celebrate 225 years of Philadelphia Mint service. Generally 21st century coins with an \"S\" or \"W\" coins do not circulate, being mostly produced as bullion, commemorative, proof coinage or other \"collector coinage\" sold by the US Mint to either authorized bullion wholesalers or directly to collectors.\n\nAlthough the US and several other countries use the initial letter of the city for its mint marks, this practice is not universal. For instance, Germany used A for Berlin, D for Munich, E for Muldenhutten, F for Stuttgart, G for Karlsruhe and J for Hamburg. When Spain adopted decimal coinage in 1848, it used stars with different numbers of points as mint marks. Madrid used six pointed stars, Barcelona used eight pointed stars, and so on. After the revolution of 1868, small dates were placed in these stars. The small dates indicated the year the coin was struck, as opposed to the large date on the coin which was the year it was authorized.\n\nMany mints of the world commonly use a Privy mark, which is a symbol unique to each mint. The Royal Canadian Mint commonly uses a maple leaf privy mark. Segovia, Spain used an aqueduct, a local landmark, before it switched over to the star system in 1868. The private mint of the French Coinage Society Poissy Branch used a thunderbolt mint mark on coins of France, its colonies, Romania and other countries. \n\nMany Islamic coins bear an inscription telling which mint produced the coin. This inscription is often the name of the city where the coin was minted spelled out in Arabic script.\n\nSeveral euro coins have mint marks of their respective Mint. See Identifying marks on euro coins for more information.\n\n"}

An intuitive general natural-language interface is one of the active goals of the Semantic Web.\n\nText interfaces are \"natural\" to varying degrees. Many formal (un-natural) programming languages incorporate idioms of natural human language. Likewise, a traditional keyword search engine could be described as a \"shallow\" natural-language user interface.\n\nA natural-language search engine would in theory find targeted answers to user questions (as opposed to keyword search). For example, when confronted with a question of the form 'which U.S. state has the highest income tax?', conventional search engines ignore the question and instead search on the keywords 'state', 'income' and 'tax'. Natural-language search, on the other hand, attempts to use natural-language processing to understand the nature of the question and then to search and return a subset of the web that contains the answer to the question. If it works, results would have a higher relevance than results from a keyword search engine.\n\nPrototype Nl interfaces had already appeared in the late sixties and early seventies.\n\n\nNatural-language interfaces have in the past led users to anthropomorphize the computer, or at least to attribute more intelligence to machines than is warranted. On the part of the user, this has led to unrealistic expectations of the capabilities of the system. Such expectations will make it difficult to learn the restrictions of the system if users attribute too much capability to it, and will ultimately lead to disappointment when the system fails to perform as expected as was the case in the AI winter of the 1970s and 80s.\n\nA 1995 paper titled 'Natural Language Interfaces to Databases – An Introduction', describes some challenges:\n\nOther goals to consider more generally are the speed and efficiency of the interface, in all algorithms these two points are the main point that will determine if some methods are better than others and therefore have greater success in the market.

The significant differences between the extracted features - even from speakers who says the same word or phrase - must be successfully overcome.\n\nThe natural-language interface gives rise to technology used for many different applications.\n\nSome of the main uses are:\n\n\nBelow are named and defined some of the applications that use natural-language recognition, and so have integrated utilities listed above.\n\nUbiquity, an add-on for Mozilla Firefox, is a collection of quick and easy natural-language-derived commands that act as mashups of web services, thus allowing users to get information and relate it to current and other webpages.\n\nWolfram Alpha is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine would. It was announced in March 2009 by Stephen Wolfram, and was released to the public on May 15, 2009.\n\nSiri is an intelligent personal assistant application integrated with operating system iOS. The application uses natural language processing to answer questions and make recommendations.\n\nSiri's marketing claims include that it adapts to a user's individual preferences over time and personalizes results, and performs tasks such as making dinner reservations while trying to catch a cab.\n\n\n\n"}

The concept of possible worlds is common in contemporary philosophical discourse but has been disputed.\n\nThose theorists who use the concept of possible worlds consider the \"actual\" world to be one of the many possible worlds. For each distinct way the world could have been, there is said to be a distinct possible world; the actual world is the one we in fact live in. Among such theorists there is disagreement about the nature of possible worlds; their precise ontological status is disputed, and especially the difference, if any, in ontological status between the actual world and all the other possible worlds. One position on these matters is set forth in David Lewis's modal realism (see below). There is a close relation between propositions and possible worlds. We note that every proposition is either true or false at any given possible world; then the \"modal status\" of a proposition is understood in terms of the \"worlds in which it is true\" and \"worlds in which it is false\". The following are among the assertions we may now usefully make:\n\n\nThe idea of possible worlds is most commonly attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, who spoke of possible worlds as ideas in the mind of God and used the notion to argue that our actually created world must be \"the best of all possible worlds\". Arthur Schopenhauer argued that on the contrary our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were only a little worse it could not continue to exist.\n\nScholars have found implicit earlier traces of the idea of possible worlds in the works of René Descartes, a major influence on Leibniz, Al-Ghazali (\"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\"), Averroes (\"The Incoherence of the Incoherence\"), Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (\"Matalib al-'Aliya\") and John Duns Scotus. The modern philosophical use of the notion was pioneered by David Lewis and Saul Kripke.\n\nA semantics for modal logic was first introduced in the late-1950s work of Saul Kripke and his colleagues. A statement in modal logic that is \"possible\" is said to be true in at least one possible world; a statement that is \"necessary\" is said to be true in all possible worlds.\n\nFrom this groundwork, the theory of possible worlds became a central part of many philosophical developments, from the 1960s onwards – including, most famously, the analysis of counterfactual conditionals in terms of \"nearby possible worlds\" developed by David Lewis and Robert Stalnaker. On this analysis, when we discuss what \"would\" happen \"if\" some set of conditions \"were\" the case, the truth of our claims is determined by what is true at the nearest possible world (or the \"set\" of nearest possible worlds) where the conditions obtain. (A possible world W is said to be near to another possible world W in respect of R to the degree that the same things happen in W and W in respect of R; the more different something happens in two possible worlds in a certain respect, the \"further\" they are from one another in that respect.) Consider this conditional sentence: \"If George W. Bush hadn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore would have.\" The sentence would be taken to express a claim that could be reformulated as follows: \"In all nearest worlds to our actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president of the U.S. in 2001, Al Gore became president of the U.S. then instead.\" And on this interpretation of the sentence, if there is or are some nearest worlds to the actual world (nearest in relevant respects) where George W. Bush didn't become president but Al Gore didn't either, then the claim expressed by this counterfactual would be false.\n\nToday, possible worlds play a central role in many debates in philosophy, including especially debates over the Zombie Argument, and physicalism and supervenience in the philosophy of mind. Many debates in the philosophy of religion have been reawakened by the use of possible worlds. Intense debate has also emerged over the ontological status of possible worlds, provoked especially by David Lewis's defense of modal realism, the doctrine that talk about \"possible worlds\" is best explained in terms of innumerable, \"really existing\" worlds beyond the one we live in. The fundamental question here is: \"given\" that modal logic works, and that some possible-worlds semantics for modal logic is correct, \"what has to be true\" of the world, and just what \"are\" these possible worlds that we range over in our interpretation of modal statements? Lewis argued that what we range over are real, concrete \"worlds\" that exist just as unequivocally as our actual world exists, but that are distinguished from the actual world simply by standing in no spatial, temporal, or causal relations with the actual world. (On Lewis's account, the only \"special\" property that the \"actual\" world has is a relational one: that \"we\" are in it. This doctrine is called \"the indexicality of actuality\": \"actual\" is a merely indexical term, like \"now\" and \"here\".) Others, such as Robert Adams and William Lycan, reject Lewis's picture as metaphysically extravagant, and suggest in its place an interpretation of possible worlds as consistent, maximally complete sets of descriptions of or propositions about the world, so that a \"possible world\" is conceived of as a complete \"description\" of \"a way the world could be\" – rather than a \"world that is that way\". (Lewis describes their position, and similar positions such as those advocated by Alvin Plantinga and Peter Forrest, as \"\"ersatz\" modal realism\", arguing that such theories try to get the benefits of possible worlds semantics for modal logic \"on the cheap\", but that they ultimately fail to provide an adequate explanation.) Saul Kripke, in \"Naming and Necessity\", took explicit issue with Lewis's use of possible worlds semantics, and defended a \"stipulative\" account of possible worlds as purely \"formal\" (logical) entities rather than either really existent worlds or as some set of propositions or descriptions.\n\nPossible worlds theory in literary studies uses concepts from possible-world logic and applies them to worlds that are created by fictional texts, fictional universe. In particular, possible-world theory provides a useful vocabulary and conceptual framework with which to describe such worlds. However, a literary world is a specific type of possible world, quite distinct from the possible worlds in logic. This is because a literary text houses its own system of modality, consisting of actual worlds (actual events) and possible worlds (possible events). In fiction, the principle of simultaneity, it extends to cover the dimensional aspect, when it is contemplated that two or more physical objects, realities, perceptions and objects non-physical, can coexist in the same space-time. Thus, a literary universe is granted autonomy in much the same way as the actual universe.\n\nLiterary critics, such as Marie-Laure Ryan, Lubomír Doležel, and Thomas Pavel, have used possible-worlds theory to address notions of literary truth, the nature of fictionality, and the relationship between fictional worlds and reality. Taxonomies of fictional possibilities have also been proposed where the likelihood of a fictional world is assessed. Possible-world theory is also used within narratology to divide a specific text into its constituent worlds, possible and actual. In this approach, the modal structure of the fictional text is analysed in relation to its narrative and thematic concerns. Rein Raud has extended this approach onto \"cultural\" worlds, comparing possible worlds to the particular constructions of reality of different cultures. However, the metaphor of the \"cultural possible worlds\" relates to the framework of cultural relativism and, depending on the ontological status ascribed to possible worlds, warrants different, often controversial claims ranging from ethnocentrism to cultural imperialism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4558584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4558584", "title": "Precast concrete", "text": "Precast concrete\n\nPrecast concrete is a construction product produced by casting concrete in a reusable mold or \"form\" which is then cured in a controlled environment, transported to the construction site and lifted into place (\"tilt up\"). In contrast, standard concrete is poured into site-specific forms and cured on site. Precast stone is distinguished from precast concrete using a fine aggregate in the mixture, so the final product approaches the appearance of naturally occurring rock or stone. More recently expanded polystyrene is being used as the cores to precast wall panels. This is lightweight and has better thermal insulation.\n\nPrecast is used within exterior and interior walls. By producing precast concrete in a controlled environment (typically referred to as a precast plant), the precast concrete is afforded the opportunity to properly cure and be closely monitored by plant employees. Using a precast concrete system offers many potential advantages over onsite casting. Precast concrete production can performed on ground level, which helps with safety throughout a project. There is greater control over material quality and workmanship in a precast plant compared to a construction site. The forms used in a precast plant can be reused hundreds to thousands of times before they have to be replaced, often making it cheaper than onsite casting when looking at the cost per unit of formwork.\n\nMany state and federal transportation projects in the United States require precast concrete suppliers to be certified by either the Architectural Precast Association (APA), National Precast Concrete Association (NPCA) or Precast Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).\n\nThere are many different types of precast concrete forming systems for architectural applications, differing in size, function, and cost. Precast architectural panels are also used to clad all or part of a building facades or free-standing walls used for landscaping, soundproofing, and security walls, and some can be prestressed concrete structural elements. Stormwater drainage, water and sewage pipes, and tunnels make use of precast concrete units.\n\nThe New South Wales Government Railways made extensive use of precast concrete construction for its stations and similar buildings. Between 1917 and 1932, they erected 145 such buildings. Beyond cladding panels and structural elements, entire buildings can be assembled from precast concrete. Precast assembly enables fast completion of commercial shops and offices with minimal labor. For example, the Jim Bridger Building in Williston, North Dakota, was precast in Minnesota with air, electrical, water, and fiber utilities preinstalled into the building panels. The panels were transported over 800 miles to the Bakken oilfields, and the commercial building was assembled by three workers in minimal time. The building houses over 40,000 square feet of shops and offices. Virtually the entire building was fabricated in Minnesota.\n\nTo complete the look of the four precast wall panel types — sandwich, plastered sandwich, inner layer and cladding panels — many surface finishes are available. Standard cement is white or grey, though different colors can be added with pigments or paints. The color and size of aggregate can also affect the appearance and texture of concrete surfaces. The shape and surface of the precast concrete molds have an effect on the look: The mold can be made of timber, steel, plastic, rubber or fiberglass, each material giving a unique finish.\n\nAncient Roman builders made use of concrete and soon poured the material into moulds to build their complex network of aqueducts, culverts, and tunnels. Modern uses for pre-cast technology include a variety of architectural and structural applications — including individual parts, or even entire building systems.\n\nIn the modern world, precast panelled buildings were pioneered in Liverpool, England, in 1905. The process was invented by city engineer John Alexander Brodie, a creative genius who also invented the idea of the football goal net. The tram stables at Walton in Liverpool followed in 1906. The idea was not taken up extensively in Britain. However, it was adopted all over the world, particularly in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia.\n\nIn the US, precast concrete has evolved as two sub-industries, each represented by a major association. The precast concrete products industry focuses on utility, underground and other non-prestressed products, and is represented primarily by the National Precast Concrete Association (NPCA). The precast concrete structures industry focuses on prestressed concrete elements and on other precast concrete elements used in above-ground structures such as buildings, parking structures, and bridges. This industry is represented primarily by of the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).\n\nReinforcing concrete with steel improves strength and durability. On its own, concrete has good compressive strength, but lacks tension and shear strength and can be subject to cracking when bearing loads for long periods of time. Steel offers high tension and shear strength to make up for what concrete lacks. Steel behaves similarly to concrete in changing environments, which means it will shrink and expand with concrete, helping avoid cracking.\n\nRebar is the most common form of concrete reinforcement. It is typically made from steel, manufactured with ribbing to bond with concrete as it cures. Rebar is versatile enough to be bent or assembled to support the shape of any concrete structure. Carbon steel is the most common rebar material. However, stainless steel, galvanized steel, and epoxy coatings can prevent corrosion.\n\nThe following is a sampling of the numerous products that utilize precast/prestressed concrete. While this is not a complete list, the majority of precast/prestressed products typically fall under one or\n\nPrecast concrete products can withstand the most extreme weather conditions and will hold up for many decades of constant usage. Products include bunker silos, cattle feed bunks, cattle grid, agricultural fencing, H-bunks, J-bunks, livestock slats, livestock watering trough, feed troughs, concrete panels, slurry channels, and more. Prestressed concrete panels are widely used in the UK for a variety of applications including agricultural buildings, grain stores, silage clamps, slurry stores, livestock walling and general retaining walls. Panels can be used horizontally and placed either inside the webbings of RSJs (I-beam) or in front of them. Alternatively panels can be cast into a concrete foundation and used as a cantilever retaining wall.\n\nPrecast concrete building components and site amenities are used architecturally as fireplace mantels, cladding, trim products, accessories and curtain walls. Structural applications of precast concrete include foundations, beams, floors, walls and other structural components. It is essential that each structural component be designed and tested to withstand both the tensile and compressive loads that the member will be subjected to over its lifespan. Also in building homes, they used EPS now in building precast concrete as this is much better in terms of the materials and the insulation. \n\nMulti-storey car parks are commonly constructed using precast concrete. The constructions involve putting together precast parking parts which are multi-storey structural wall panels, interior and exterior columns, structural floors, girders, wall panels, stairs, and slabs. These parts can be large; for example, double-tee structural floor modules need to be lifted into place with the help of precast concrete lifting anchor systems.\n\nPrecast concrete provides manufacturers with the ability to produce a wide range of engineered earth retaining systems. Products include: commercial retaining walls, residential walls, sea walls, mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) panels, modular block systems, segmental retaining walls, etc. Retaining walls have five different types which include: gravity retaining wall, semigravity retaining wall, cantilever retaining wall, counterfort retaining wall, and buttress retaining wall.\n\nSanitary and stormwater management products are structures designed for underground installation that have been specifically engineered for the treatment and removal of pollutants from sanitary and stormwater run-off. These precast concrete products include stormwater detention vaults, catch basins, and manholes.\n\nFor communications, electrical, gas or steam systems, precast concrete utility structures protect the vital connections and controls for utility distribution. Precast concrete is nontoxic and environmentally safe. Products include: hand holes, hollowcore products, light pole bases, meter boxes, panel vaults, pull boxes, telecommunications structures, transformer pads, transformer vaults, trenches, utility buildings, utility vaults, utility poles, controlled environment vaults (CEVs), and other utility structures.\n\nPrecast water and wastewater products hold or contain water, oil or other liquids for the purpose of further processing into non-contaminating liquids and soil products. Products include: aeration systems, distribution boxes, dosing tanks, dry wells, grease interceptors, leaching pits, sand-oil/oil-water interceptors, septic tanks, water/sewage storage tanks, wetwells, fire cisterns, and other water and wastewater products.\n\nPrecast concrete transportation products are used in the construction, safety, and site protection of road, airport, and railroad transportation systems. Products include: box culverts, 3-sided culverts, bridge systems, railroad crossings, railroad ties, sound walls/barriers, Jersey barriers, tunnel segments, concrete barriers, TVCBs, central reservation barriers, bollards, and other transportation products. Precast concrete can also be used to make underpasses, surface-passes, and pedestrian subways. Precast concrete is also used for the rail ways of some rubber-tyred metros.\n\nModular paving is available in a rainbow of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures. These versatile precast concrete pieces can be designed to mimic brick, stone or wood.\n\nUnderground vaults or mausoleums require watertight structures that withstand natural forces for extended periods of time.\n\nStorage of hazardous material, whether short-term or long-term, is an increasingly important environmental issue, calling for containers that not only seal in the materials, but are strong enough to stand up to natural disasters or terrorist attacks.\nFloating docks, underwater infrastructure, decking, railings, and a host of amenities are among the uses of precast along the waterfront. When designed with heavy weight in mind, precast products counteract the buoyant forces of water significantly better than most materials.\n\nPrestressing is a technique of introducing stresses into a structural member during fabrication and/or construction to improve its strength and performance. This technique is often employed in concrete beams, columns, spandrels, single and double tees, wall panels, segmental bridge units, bulb-tee girders, I-beam girders, and others. Many projects find that prestressed concrete provides the lowest overall cost, considering production and lifetime maintenance.\n\nThe precast concrete double-wall panel has been in use in Europe for decades. The original double-wall design consisted of two wythes of reinforced concrete separated by an interior void, held together with embedded steel trusses. With recent concerns about energy use, it is recognized that using steel trusses creates a \"thermal bridge\" that degrades thermal performance. Also, since steel does not have the same thermal expansion coefficient as concrete, as the wall heats and cools any steel that is not embedded in the concrete can create thermal stresses that cause cracking and spalling.\n\nTo achieve better thermal performance, insulation was added in the void, and in many applications today the steel trusses have been replaced by composite (fibreglass, plastic, etc.) connection systems. These systems, which are specially developed for this purpose, also eliminate the differential thermal expansion problem. The best thermal performance is achieved when the insulation is continuous throughout the wall section, i.e., the wythes are thermally separated completely to the ends of the panel. Using continuous insulation and modern composite connection systems, R-values up to R-28.2 can be achieved.\n\nThe overall thickness of sandwich wall panels in commercial applications is typically 8 inches, but their designs are often customized to the application. In a typical 8-inch wall panel the concrete wythes are each 2-3/8 inches thick), sandwiching 3-1/4 inches of high R-value insulating foam. The interior and exterior wythes of concrete are held together (through the insulation) with some form of connecting system that is able to provide the needed structural integrity. Sandwich wall panels can be fabricated to the length and width desired, within practical limits dictated by the fabrication system, the stresses of lifting and handling, and shipping constraints. Panels of 9-foot clear height are common, but heights up to 12 feet can be found.\nThe fabrication process for precast concrete sandwich wall panels allows them to be produced with finished surfaces on both sides. Such finishes can be very smooth, with the surfaces painted, stained, or left natural; for interior surfaces, the finish is comparable to drywall in smoothness and can be finished using the same prime and paint procedure as is common for conventional drywall construction. If desired, the concrete can be given an architectural finish, where the concrete itself is colored and/or textured. Colors and textures can provide the appearance of brick, stone, wood, or other patterns through the use of reusable formliners, or, in the most sophisticated applications, actual brick, stone, glass, or other materials can be cast into the concrete surface.\n\nWindow and door openings are cast into the walls at the manufacturing plant as part of the fabrication process. In many applications, electrical and telecommunications conduit and boxes are cast directly into the panels in the specified locations. In some applications, utilities, plumbing and even heating components have been cast into the panels to reduce on-site construction time. The carpenters, electricians and plumbers do need to make some slight adjustments when first becoming familiar with some of the unique aspects of the wall panels. However, they still perform most of their job duties in the manner to which they are accustomed.\n\nPrecast concrete sandwich wall panels have been used on virtually every type of building, including schools, office buildings, apartment buildings, townhouses, condominiums, hotels, motels, dormitories, and single-family homes. Although typically considered part of a building's enclosure or \"envelope,\" they can be designed to also serve as part of the building's structural system, eliminating the need for beams and columns on the building perimeter. Besides their energy efficiency and aesthetic versatility, they also provide excellent noise attenuation, outstanding durability (resistant to rot, mold, etc.), and rapid construction.\n\nIn addition to the good insulation properties, sandwich panels require fewer work phases to complete. Compared to double-walls, for example, which have to be insulated and filled with concrete on site, sandwich panels require much less labor and scaffolding.\n\nThe precast concrete industry is largely dominated by Government initiated projects for infrastructural development. However, these are also being extensively used for residential (low and high rise) and commercial constructions because of their various favourable attributes. The efficiency, durability, ease, cost effectiveness, and sustainable properties of these products have brought a revolutionary shift in the time consumed in construction of any structure.Construction industry is a huge energy consuming industry, and precast concrete products are and will continue to be more energy efficient than its counterparts. The wide range of designs, colours, and structural options that these products provide is also making it a favourable choice for its consumers.\n\n"}

{"id": "28977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28977", "title": "Salute", "text": "Salute\n\nA salute is a gesture or other action used to display respect. Salutes are primarily associated with armed forces, but other organizations and civilians also use salutes.\n\nIn military traditions of various times and places, there have been numerous methods of performing salutes, using hand gestures, cannon or rifle shots, hoisting of flags, removal of headgear, or other means of showing respect or deference. In the Commonwealth of Nations, only commissioned officers are saluted, and the salute is to the commission they carry from their respective commanders-in-chief representing the Monarch, not the officers themselves.\n\nThe British Army's salute is almost identical to the French salute, with the palm facing outward. The customary salute in the Polish Armed Forces is the two-fingers salute, a variation of the British military salute with only two fingers extended. In the Russian military, the right hand, palm down, is brought to the right temple, almost, but not quite, touching; the head has to be covered. In the Hellenic Army salute the palm is facing down and the fingers point to the coat of arms.\n\nIn the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, United States Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, Colombian Army and Ecuadorian Army, as well as in all branches of the French Armed Forces, British Armed Forces (with the exception of the Blues and Royals), Canadian Forces, Danish Armed Forces, Hellenic Armed Forces, Italian Armed Forces, Norwegian Armed Forces, Polish Armed Forces, Irish Defence Forces, Australian Defence Force, South African National Defence Force, Swedish Defence Forces, Turkish Armed Forces and Russian and all former Soviet republic forces, hand salutes are only given when a cover (protection for the head, usually a hat) is worn.\n\nWhen the presence of enemy snipers is suspected, military salutes are generally forbidden, since the enemy may use them to recognize officers as valuable targets.\n\nSome soldiers may salute with the left hand when the right hand is encumbered in some way (though it is rare), for example, a soldier with a rifle at Right Shoulder Arms; if movement of a weapon would be encumbered when making the armed salute; if the performance of duty requires the right hand for use or operation of equipment such as riding a motorcycle; if it is not possible to use the hand due to injury or amputation; when escorting a woman and it is not possible to walk on her right side. A right-handed boatswain Mate piping an Officer aboard may salute with his/her left hand.\n\nAccording to some modern military manuals, the modern Western salute originated in France when knights greeted each other to show friendly intentions by raising their visors to show their faces, using a salute. Others also note that the raising of one's visor was a way to identify oneself saying \"This is who I am, and I am not afraid.\" Medieval visors were, to this end, equipped with a protruding spike that allowed the visor to be raised using a saluting motion.\n\nThe US Army Quartermaster School provides another explanation of the origin of the hand salute: that it was a long-established military courtesy for subordinates to remove their headgear in the presence of superiors. As late as the American Revolution, a British Army soldier saluted by removing his hat. With the advent of increasingly cumbersome headgear in the 18th and 19th centuries, however, the act of removing one's hat was gradually converted into the simpler gesture of grasping or touching the visor and issuing a courteous salutation.\n\nAs early as 1745, a British order book stated that: \"The men are ordered not to pull off their hats when they pass an officer, or to speak to them, but only to clap up their hands to their hats and bow as they pass.\" Over time, it became conventionalized into something resembling our modern hand salute. In the Austrian Army the practice of making a hand salute replaced that of removing the headdress in 1790, although officers wearing cocked hats continued to remove them when greeting superiors until 1868.\n\nThe naval salute, with the palm downwards is said to have evolved because the palms of naval ratings, particularly deckhands, were often dirty through working with lines and was deemed insulting to present a dirty palm to an officer; thus the palm was turned downwards. During the Napoleonic Wars, British crews saluted officers by touching a clenched fist to the brow as though grasping a hat-brim between fingers and thumb.\n\nWhen carrying a sword (which is still done on ceremonial occasions), European military forces and their cultural descendants use a two-step gesture. The sword is first raised, in the right hand, to the level of and close to the front of the neck. The blade is inclined forward and up 30 degrees from the vertical; the true edge is to the left. Then the sword is slashed downward to a position with the point close to the ground in front of the right foot. The blade is inclined down and forward with the true edge to the left. This gesture originated in the Crusades. The hilt of a sword formed a cross with the blade, so if a crucifix was not available, a Crusader could kiss the hilt of his sword when praying, before entering battle, for oaths and vows, and so on. The lowering of the point to the ground is a traditional act of submission.\n\nIn fencing, the fencers salute each other before putting their masks on to begin a bout. There are several methods of doing this, but the most common is to bring the sword in front of the face so that the blade is pointing up in front of the nose. The fencers also salute the referee and the audience.\n\nWhen armed with a rifle, two methods are available when saluting. The usual method is called \"present arms\"; the rifle is brought to the vertical, muzzle up, in front of center of the chest with the trigger away from the body. The hands hold the stock close to the positions they would have if the rifle were being fired, though the trigger is not touched. Less formal salutes include the \"order arms salute\" and the \"shoulder arms salutes.\" These are most often given by a sentry to a low-ranking superior who does not rate the full \"present arms\" salute. In the \"order arms salute,\" the rifle rests on its butt by the sentry's right foot, held near the muzzle by the sentry's right hand, and does not move. The sentry brings his flattened left hand across his body and touches the rifle near its muzzle. When the rifle is being carried on the shoulder, a similar gesture is used in which the flattened free hand is brought across the body to touch the rifle near the rear of the receiver.\n\nA different type of salute with a rifle is a ritual firing performed during military funerals, known as a three-volley salute. In this ceremonial act, an odd number of rifleman fire three blank cartridges in unison into the air over the casket. This originates from an old European tradition wherein a battle was halted to remove the dead and wounded, then three shots were fired to signal readiness to reengage.\n\nThe custom of firing cannon salutes originated in the Royal Navy. When a cannon was fired, it partially disarmed the ship, so needlessly firing a cannon showed respect and trust. As a matter of courtesy a warship would fire her guns harmlessly out to sea, to show that she had no hostile intent. At first, ships were required to fire seven guns, and forts, with their more numerous guns and a larger supply of gunpowder, to fire 21 times. Later, as the quality of gunpowder improved, the British increased the number of shots required from ships to match the forts.\n\nThe system of odd numbered rounds originated from Samuel Pepys, Secretary to the Navy in the Restoration, as a way of economising on the use of powder, the rule until that time having been that all guns had to be fired. Odd numbers were chosen, as even numbers indicated a death.\n\nAs naval customs evolved, the 21-gun salute came to be reserved for heads of state, with fewer rounds used to salute lower-ranking officials. Today, In the US Armed Forces, heads of government and cabinet ministers (e.g., the Vice President, U.S. cabinet members, and service secretaries), and military officers with five-star rank receive 19 rounds; four-stars receive 17 rounds; three-stars receive 15; two-stars receive 13; and a one-star general or admiral receives 11. These same standards are currently adhered to by ground-based saluting batteries.\n\nMultiples of 21-gun salutes may be fired for particularly important celebrations. In monarchies this is often done at births of members of the royal family of the country and other official celebrations associated with the royal family.\n\nA specialty platoon of the 3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard), the Presidential Salute Battery is based at Fort Myer, Virginia. The Guns Platoon (as it is known for short) has the task of rendering military honors in the National Capital Region, including armed forces full-honors funerals; state funerals; presidential inaugurations; full-honors wreath ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery; state arrivals at the White House and Pentagon, and retirement ceremonies for general-grade officers in the Military District of Washington, which are normally conducted at Fort Myer.\n\nThe Presidential Salute Battery also participates in A Capitol Fourth, the Washington Independence Day celebration; the guns accompany the National Symphony Orchestra in performing the \"1812 Overture\".\n\nThe platoon maintains its battery of ten ceremonially-modified World War II-vintage M-5 anti-tank guns at the Old Guard regimental motor pool.\n\nA ceremonial or celebratory form of aerial salute is the flypast (known as a \"flyover\" in the United States), which often follows major parades such as the annual Trooping the Colour in the United Kingdom or the French \"défilé du 14 juillet\". It is seen in other countries as well, notably Singapore and Canada. In Singapore, the Republic of Singapore Air Force usually conducts aerial salutes during the annual National Day Parade and major state events, such as during the funeral of Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nGun salute by aircraft, primarily displayed during funerals, began with simple flypasts during World War I and have evolved into the missing man formation, where either a formation of aircraft is conspicuously missing an element, or where a single plane abruptly leaves a formation\n\nA casual salute by an aircraft, somewhat akin to waving to a friend, is the custom of \"waggling\" the wings by partially rolling the aircraft first to one side, and then the other.\n\nIn both countries, the right-hand salute is generally identical to, and drawn from the traditions of, the British armed forces. The salute of the Australian or New Zealand Army is best described as the right arm taking the path of the longest way up and then the shortest way down. Similar in many ways, the salute of the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force takes the longest way up and the shortest way down. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy, however, take the shortest way up, palm down, and the shortest way down. The action of the arm rotating up is slower than the action of the conclusion of the salute which is the arm being quickly \"snapped\" down to the saluter's side. Junior members are required to salute first and the senior member is obliged to return the compliment. Protocol dictates that the Monarch, members of the Royal Family, the Governor-General and State Governors are to be saluted at all times by all ranks. Except where a Drill Manual (or parade) protocol dictates otherwise, the duration of the salute is timed at three beats of the quick-time march (approximately 1.5 seconds), timed from the moment the senior member first returns it. In situations where cover (or \"headdress\", as it is called in the Australian Army) is not being worn, the salute is given verbally; the junior party (or at least the senior member thereof) will first come to attention, then offer the salute \"Good morning/afternoon Your Majesty/Your Royal Highness/Prime Minister/Your Grace/Sir/Ma'am\", etc., as the case may be. It is this, rather than the act of standing to attention, which indicates that a salute is being offered. If either party consists of two or more members, all will come to attention, but only the most senior member of the party will offer (or return) the physical or verbal salute. The party which is wearing headdress must always offer, or respond with, a full salute. At the Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) no salutes of any kind are given, under any circumstances; it is always sensible to assume that there are snipers in the area. In this case, parties personally known to each other are addressed familiarly by their first or given names, regardless of rank; senior officers are addressed as one might address a stranger, courteously, but without any naming or mark of respect.\n\nSince 1917, the British Army's salute has been given with the right hand palm facing forwards with the fingers almost touching the cap or beret. Before 1917, for Other Ranks (i.e. not officers) the salute was given with whichever hand was furthest from the person being saluted, whether that was the right or the left. Officers always saluted with the right hand (as the left, in theory, would always be required to hold the scabbard of their sword) The salute is given to acknowledge the Queen's commission. A salute may not be given unless a soldier is wearing his regimental headdress, for example a beret, caubeen, Tam o' Shanter, Glengarry, field service cap or peaked cap. This does not apply to members of The Blues and Royals (RHG/1stD) The Household Cavalry who, after The Battle of Warburg were allowed to salute without headdress. If a soldier or officer is not wearing headdress then he or she must come to attention instead of giving/returning the salute. The subordinate salutes first and maintains the salute until the superior has responded in kind.\n\nThere is a widespread though erroneous belief that it is statutory for \"all ranks to salute a bearer of the Victoria Cross\". There is no official requirement that appears in the official Warrant of the VC, nor in Queen's Regulations and Orders, but tradition dictates that this occurs and as such the Chiefs of Staff will salute a Private awarded either a VC or George Cross.\n\nThe custom of saluting commissioned officers relates wholly to the commission given by Her Majesty the Queen to that officer, not the person. Therefore, when a subordinate airman salutes an officer, he is indirectly acknowledging Her Majesty as Head of State. A salute returned by the officer is on behalf of the Queen.\n\nThe RAF salute is similar to the British Army, the hand is brought upwards in a circular motion out from the body, it is stopped 1 inch (20 mm) to the rear of the right of the right eye, the elbow and wrist are kept inline with the shoulder. The hand is then brought straight down back to the position of attention, this movement is completed to the timing \"UP TWO-THREE/DOWN\"\n\nThe Naval salute differs in that the palm of the hand faces down towards the shoulder. This dates back to the days of sailing ships, when tar and pitch were used to seal a ship's timbers from seawater. To protect their hands, officers wore white gloves and it was considered most undignified to present a dirty palm in the salute, so the hand was turned through 90 degrees. A common story is that Queen Victoria, having been saluted by an individual with a dirty palm, decreed that in future sailors of the fleet would salute palm down, with the palm facing the ground.\n\nThe Royal Marines follow the British Army and salute with the right hand palm facing forward.\n\nIn the British Empire (originally in the maritime and hinterland sphere of influence of the East India Company, HEIC, later transformed into crown territories), mainly in British India, the numbers of guns fired as a \"gun salute\" to the ruler of a so-called princely state became a politically highly significant indicator of his status, not governed by objective rules, but awarded (and in various cases increased) by the British paramount power, roughly reflecting his state's socio-economic, political and/or military weight, but also as a prestigious reward for loyalty to the Raj, in classes (always odd numbers) from three to twenty-one (seven lacking), for the \"vassal\" indigenous rulers (normally hereditary with a throne, sometimes raised as a personal distinction for an individual ruling prince). Two sovereign monarchies officially outside the Empire were granted a higher honor: thirty-one guns for the royal houses of Afghanistan (under British and Russian influence), and Siam (which was then ruled by the Rattanakosin Kingdom).\n\nIn addition, the right to style himself \"Highness\" (Majesty, which since its Roman origin expresses the sovereign authority of the state, was denied to all \"vassals\"), a title of great importance in international relations, was formally restricted to rulers of relatively high salute ranks (originally only those with eleven guns or more, later also those with nine guns).\n\nMuch as the British salute, described above, the Canadian military salutes to demonstrate a mark of respect and courtesy for the commissioned ranks. When in uniform and not wearing headdress one does not salute. Instead, compliments shall be paid by standing at attention. If on the march, arms shall be swung and the head turned to the left or right as required.\n\nOn Remembrance Day, 2009, The Prince of Wales attended the national ceremony in Ottawa with Governor General Michaëlle Jean—both wearing Canadian military dress. CBC live television coverage of the event noted that, when Prince Charles saluted, he performed the Canadian form of the salute with a cupped hand (the British \"naval salute\"—appropriate, as he did his military service as an officer in the Royal Navy), adopted by all elements of the Canadian Forces after unification in 1968, rather than the British (Army) form with the palm facing forward.\n\nIn the Danish military, there are two types of military salutes. The first type is employed by the Royal Danish Navy, Royal Danish Air Force, and Guard Hussar Regiment Mounted Squadron, and is the same as the one used by the U.S.. The second is employed by the Royal Danish Army, and goes as follows: Raise the right arm forward, as to have upper arm 90 degrees from the body. Move the right hand to the temple, and have it parallel to the ground.\n\nThe French military salutes to demonstrate a mark of respect, fraternity and courtesy for all soldiers ; subordinates salute superiors and every salute is given back. Salutes are not performed if a member is not wearing a headdress or if he is holding a weapon. The French salute, as the original template, is performed with a flat hand, palm facing forwards; the upper arm is horizontal and the tips of the fingers come near the corner of the eyes. It perfectly mirrors the gesture made when knights greeted each other to show friendly intentions by raising their visors to show their faces. A crisp tension may be given when the salute is broken.\n\nIn the German Bundeswehr, the salute is performed with a flat hand, with the thumb resting on the index finger. The hand is slightly tilted to the front so that the thumb can not be seen. The upper arm is horizontal and the fingers point to the temple but do not touch it or the headgear. Every soldier saluting another uniformed soldier is entitled to be saluted in return. Soldiers below the rank of Feldwebel are not permitted to speak while saluting. Since the creation of the Bundeswehr, soldiers are required to salute with and without headgear. Originally, in the Reichswehr it was not permitted to perform the salute when the soldier is not wearing uniform headgear. In the Wehrmacht, the traditional military salute was required when wearing headgear, but the Nazi salute was performed when not wearing headgear. East German National People's Army followed the Reichswehr protocol.\n\nIn India, the three forces have different salutes with the Indian Army and the Indian Navy following the British tradition. In the Indian army, the salute is performed by keeping the open palm forward, with fingers and thumb together and middle finger almost touching the hatband or right eyebrow. This is often accompanied by the regimental salutation, e.g.:\"Sat Sri Akal\" in the Sikh Regiment. The Navy salute has the palm facing towards the ground at a 90-degree angle. The Indian Air Force salute involves the right arm being sharply raised from the front by the shortest possible way, with the plane of the palm at 45-degree angle to the forehead.\n\nIn Indonesia, the salute is similar to the British Royal Navy. The salute is a gesture that every person must know and is commonly used for the flag raising ceremony. It is a very common gesture amongst every part of the country, starting from school to military, police, firefighters, and even scouts (using five fingers, contrary to other countries). In the military, this gesture is known as Present Arms or in Indonesian: \"Hormat Senjata, Gerak\" (with weapons) or \"Hormat, Gerak\" (without weapons).\n\nIn the Israel Defense Forces, saluting is normally reserved for special ceremonies. Unlike in the US Army, saluting is not a constant part of day to day barracks life.\n\nIn Pakistan, the salute is generally identical to that of British armed forces. Salute is given with the right hand palm facing forward and fingers slightly touching the right side of the forehead, but not on the forehead. The salute must be performed by the lower rank officials to the higher rank officials under all conditions except when the higher rank official is not in uniform or if the lower rank official is the driver and the vehicle is in motion. The salute is sometimes also performed by left hand if the right hand of the person is completely occupied.\n\nMilitary personnel of the People's Liberation Army salute according to Chinese standards and similar to the Royal Navy salute.\n\nIn Polish military forces, military men use two fingers to salute, and when they wear headdress (including helmet) because soldiers are supposed to salute to the Coat of Arms on the military headdress, out of respect to the national symbols (This is called the Two-finger salute). There are some exceptions in Polish regulations when salute is not demonstrated, for instance after proclaiming alert in military unit area. As above, salute is marking respect for higher rank or command. Untrained recruits are obliged to salute as without headdress, i.e. to stand at attention (or—during walking—to march at attention).\n\nSalutes are similar to those of the Royal Navy. The official instruction for stationary salute states: \"The right hand is quickly raised straight up to the headgear. The fingers straight but not stiff next to each other, the little finger edge facing forward. One or two finger tips lightly resting against the right part of the head gear (visor), so that the hand does not obstruct the eye. The wrist straight, the elbow angled forward and slightly lower than the shoulder.\" Salutes to persons are normally not made when further away than 30 m. Hand salutes are performed only when carrying head gear, if bare headed (normally only indoors) a swift turning of the head towards the person that is being saluted is made instead. The same applies if the right hand is carrying any item that cannot easily be transferred to the left hand. During inspections and when on guard duty, the salute is made by coming to attention. Drivers of moving vehicles never salute. In formations, only the commander salutes.\n\nSwiss soldiers are required to salute any higher-ranking military personnel whenever they encounter them. When the soldier announces to a higher-ranking person he has to state the superior's rank, his rank and his name. When a military formation encounters a superior, it has to state the name of the formation. The salute is given like that of the British navy with the palm pointing towards the shoulder, the tips of the fingers pointing towards the temple.\n\nWithin the Turkish military hand salutes are only given when a cover (protection for the head, usually a hat) is worn.\n\nIf head is not covered or when the personnel is carrying a rifle on the shoulder the \"head salute\" is performed by nodding the head forward slightly while maintaining erect posture.\n\nThe salute (hand or head) must be performed first by the lower ranking personnel to the higher ranking personnel, and higher official is expected to return the salute, under all conditions except:\n\nDespite of the rank, casket of a martyr personnel while in transport or on stand has to be saluted by all ranks of personnel.\n\nWithin United States' military, the salute is a courteous exchange of greetings, with the junior member always saluting first. When returning or rendering an individual salute, the head and eyes are turned toward the Colors or person saluted. Military personnel in uniform are required to salute when they meet and recognize persons entitled to a salute, except when it is inappropriate or impractical (in public conveyances such as planes and buses, in public places such as inside theaters, or when driving a vehicle).\n\nIt is believed that the U.S. military's salute was influenced by British military, although differs slightly, in that the palm of the hand faces down towards the shoulder. This difference may date back to the days of sailing ships, when tar and pitch were used to seal the timber from seawater. During such times, it was considered undignified to present a dirty palm in the salute, so the hand was turned through 90 degrees.\n\nSpecifically, a proper salute goes as follows: Raise the right hand sharply, fingers and thumb extended and joined, palm facing down, and place the tip of the right forefinger on the rim of the visor, slightly to the right of the eye. The outer edge of the hand is barely canted downward so that neither the back of the hand nor the palm is clearly visible from the front. The hand and wrist are straight, the elbow inclined slightly forward, and the upper arm is horizontal.\n\nThe United States Army and United States Air Force give salutes both covered and uncovered, but saluting indoors is forbidden except when formally reporting to a superior officer or during an indoor ceremony. It should be noted that when outdoors, a cover is to be worn at all times when wearing Battle Dress Uniforms/Army Combat Uniforms, but is not required when wearing physical training (PT) gear.\n\nThe Zogist salute is a military salute that was instituted by Zog I of Albania. It is a gesture whereby the right hand is placed over the heart, with the palm facing downwards. It was first widely used by Zog's personal police force and was later adopted by the Royal Albanian Army.\n\nIn Mexico, a salute similar to the Zogist one is rendered by Mexican civilians during the playing of the Mexican national anthem.\n\nState Defense Forces (SDF; also known as state military, state guards, state militias, or state military reserves) in the United States are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government. State defense forces are authorized by state and federal law and are under the command of the governor of each state.\n\nState defense forces soldiers are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. They are also subject to their state military laws and regulations and render the same customs and courtesies as active duty, Reserve and National Guard personnel.\n\nMost police forces salute similar to the Canadian Forces standard, with the exception of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, which follow the British Army standard of saluting with the full palm facing forward, touching the brim of the hat, if worn.\n\nSimilar salutes are used by honour guards for non-police services (e.g. Toronto Fire Services, Toronto Transit Commission) during funerals or ceremonial events.\n\nAll uniform branches of the Hong Kong (Police, Police Auxiliary, Police Pipeband, Fire (including Ambulance service members), Immigration, Customs, Correctional Services, Government Flying Service, Civil Aid Service) salute according to British Army traditions. Personnel stationed with the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong salute using the Chinese military standards and similar to those used by the Royal Navy.\n\nNon-government organizations like Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps, Hong Kong Adventure Corps, the Boys' Brigade, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps and St. John Ambulance all follow the same military salutes due to their ties with the British Armed Forces.\n\nIn the United States, civilian military auxiliaries such as the Civil Air Patrol are required to salute all commissioned and warrant officers of higher rank and return the salute of those with lower ranks of the U.S. Uniformed Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, U.S. Public Health Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps) senior in rank to them, as well as all friendly foreign officers, though military members are not required to reciprocate (they may salute voluntarily if they choose). CAP officers are required to salute one another though this is not uniformly observed throughout the CAP. Cadets are required to salute all senior members and military/uniformed services personnel.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary requires its members to salute all commissioned and warrant officers of higher rank and return the salute of those with lower ranks; since Auxiliarists hold \"office\" rather than \"grade\" (indicated by modified military insignia), all Auxiliarists are required to perform this courtesy. Saluting between Auxiliarists is not usually the custom, but is not out of protocol to do so. When operating in direct support of the USCG, or when on military installations in general, Auxiliarists usually wear \"member\" insignia unless specified otherwise by the officer/NCO in charge.\n\nIn most countries, civilians have their own form of salutes.\n\nThe same salute of the United States was instituted in Albania as the \"Zog salute\" by King Zog I.\n\nIn Iran a salute similar to the United States is given. In ancient times a salute would be given by raising a flat hand in front of the chest with the thumb facing the saluters face.\n\nIn Latin America, except in Mexico, a salute similar to the United States flag salute is used, with the hand over the heart.\n\nIn the Philippines, civilians salute to the national flag during flag raising and upon hearing the Philippine National Anthem by standing at attention and doing the same hand-to-heart salute as their American, Italian, Nigerian, and South African counterparts. People wearing hats or caps must bare their heads and hold the headwear over their heart. Members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Coast Guard and sometimes airline pilots and civilian ship crews, meanwhile do the traditional military salutes if they are in uniform on duty; off-duty personnel do the hand-to-heart salutes. During the Martial Law years from 1972–1981 up to the 1986 EDSA Revolution, the \"clenched fist\" salute was done during the singing and playing of the National Anthem by some groups.\n\nBoy Scouts and Girl Scouts meanwhile have their own form of salutes.\n\nIn Indonesia, civilians may either place their right hand to their left-breast (heart) or salute the flag as per a military salute, which may be that of the \"PETA\" Revolutionaries, or as per modern military drill. All persons present regardless of nationality are expected to stand silently and respectfully during its raising and lowering. It is a severe criminal offense in Indonesia to dishonour the national flag (known in Indonesian as \"Sang Saka Merah Putih\", \"The Red and White\") and its ceremonies, or the national anthem, \"Indonesia Raya\".\n\nThailand also has the same rule like Indonesia wherein all persons present regardless of nationality are expected to stand at attention and respectfully during the flag raising and lowering and upon hearing the Thai National Anthem every 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. or hearing the Sansoen Phra Barami. The Lèse majesté in Thailand says that it is a serious criminal offense to dishonor the flag of Thailand or National/Royal Anthem.\n\nThe Roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palm down and fingers extended straight and touching. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. A well known symbol of Nazism, it is commonly perceived to be based on a classical Roman custom. but no known Roman work of art displays this salute, and no known Roman text describes it.\n\nBeginning with Jacques-Louis David's painting \"The Oath of the Horatii\" (1784), an association of the gesture with Roman republican and imperial culture emerged through 18th-century French art. The association with ancient Roman traditions was further developed in France during the Napoleonic era and again in popular culture through late 19th- and early 20th-century plays and films. These include the epic \"Cabiria\" (1914), whose screenplay was attributed to Italian nationalist Gabriele d'Annunzio. In a case of life imitating art, d'Annunzio appropriated the salute as a neo-imperial ritual when he led the occupation of Fiume in 1919. It was soon adopted by the Italian Fascist party, whose use of the salute inspired the Nazi party salute. However, the armed forces (\"Wehrmacht\") of the Third Reich used a German form of the military salute until, in the wake of the July 20 plot on Hitler's life in 1944, the Nazi salute or \"Hitlergruss\" was imposed on them.\n\nThe Bellamy salute was a similar gesture and was the civilian salute of the United States from 1892 to 1942. The United States, considering itself the new Roman Empire, adopted the salute in 1892 in an effort to create a historical link with the Romans.\n\nIn Germany showing the Roman salute is today prohibited by law. Those rendering similar salutes, for example raising the left instead of the right hand, or raising only three fingers, are liable to prosecution. The punishment derives from § 86a of the German Criminal Code and can be up to three years imprisonment or a fine (in minor cases).\n\nAccording to SOPs (standard operating procedures) of most airlines, the ground crew that handles departure of an aircraft from a gate (such handling normally includes: disconnecting of required for engine start pneumatic generators or aircraft power and ventilation utilities, aircraft push-back, icing inspection, etc.) is required to salute the captain before the aircraft is released for taxi. Captain normally returns the salute. Since a large percentage of airline pilots are ex-military pilots, this practice was transferred to the airline industry from the military. Exactly the same saluting practice is appropriate to most military aircraft operations, including Air Force, Navy and Army.\n\nIn Islam raising the index finger signifies the Tawhīd (تَوْحِيد), which denotes the indivisible oneness of God. It is used to express the unity of God (\"there is no god but God\"). The gesture has recently become widespread among supporters of Islamism, particularly members of ISIS, though its use does not necessarily signal extremism.\n\nIn Arabic, the index or fore finger is called musabbiḥa (مُسَبِّحة), mostly used with the definite article: al-musabbiḥa (الْمُسَبِّحة). Sometimes also as-sabbāḥa (السَّبّاحة) is used. The Arabic verb سَبَّحَ, which shares the same root as the Arabic word for index finger, means to praise or glorify God by saying: \"Subḥāna Allāh\" (سُبْحانَ الله).\n\nThe raised clenched fist, symbolizing unity in struggle, was popularized in the 19th century by the socialist, communist and anarchist movements, and is still used today.\n\nIn the United States, the raised fist was associated with the Black Power movement, symbolized in the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute; a clenched-fist salute is also proper in many African nations, including South Africa. However, the two salutes are somewhat different: in the Black Power salute, the arm is held straight, while in the salute of leftist movements the arm is bent slightly at the elbow.\n\nMany different gestures are used throughout the world as simple greetings. In Western cultures the handshake is very common, though it has numerous subtle variations in the strength of grip, the vigour of the shake, the dominant position of one hand over the other, and whether or not the left hand is used.\n\nHistorically, when men normally wore hats out of doors, male greetings to people they knew, and sometimes those they did not, involved touching, raising slightly (\"tipping\"), or removing their hat in a variety of gestures, see hat tip. This basic gesture remained normal in very many situations from the Middle Ages until men typically ceased wearing hats in the mid-20th century. Hat-raising began with an element of recognition of superiority, where only the socially inferior party might perform it, but gradually lost this element; King Louis XIV of France made a point of at least touching his hat to all women he encountered. However the gesture was never used by women, for whom their head-covering included considerations of modesty. When a man was not wearing a hat he might touch his hair to the side of the front of his head to replicate a hat tipping gesture. This was typically performed by lower class men to social superiors, such as peasants to the land-owner, and is known as \"tugging the forelock\", which still sometimes occurs as a metaphor for submissive behaviour.\n\nIn Europe, the formal style of upper-class greeting used by a man to a woman in the Early Modern Period was to hold the woman's presented hand (usually the right) with his right hand and kiss it while bowing, see hand-kissing and kissing hands. This style has not been widespread for a century or more. In cases of a low degree of intimacy, the hand is held but not kissed. The ultra-formal style, with the man's right knee on the floor, is now only used in marriage proposals, as a romantic gesture.\n\nThe Arabic term \"salaam\" (literally \"peace\", from the spoken greeting that accompanies the gesture), refers to the practice of placing the right palm on the heart, before and after a handshake.\n\nA Chinese greeting, Bao Quan Li (抱拳礼 or \"fist wrapping rite\"), features the right fist placed in the palm of the left hand and both shaken back and forth two or three times; it may be accompanied by a head nod or bow. The gesture may be used on meeting and parting, and when offering thanks or apologies.\n\nIn India, it is common to see the Namaste greeting (or \"Sat Sri Akal\" for Sikhs) where the palms of the hands are pressed together and held near the heart with the head gently bowed.\n\nAdab, meaning respect and politeness, is a hand gesture used as a Muslim greeting of south Asian Muslims, especially of Urdu-speaking communities of Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabadi Muslims, Bengali Muslims and Muhajir people of Pakistan. The gesture involves raising the right hand towards the face with palm inwards such that it is in front of the eyes and the finger tips are almost touching the forehead, as the upper torso is bent forward. It is typical for the person to say \"\"adab arz hai\", or just \"adab\". It is often answered with the same or the word \"Tasleem\"\" is said as an answer or sometimes it is answered with a facial gesture of acceptance.\n\nIn Indonesia, a nation with a huge variety of cultures and religions, many greetings are expressed, from the formalized greeting of the highly stratified and hierarchical Javanese to the more egalitarian and practical greetings of outer islands. Javanese, Batak and other ethnicities currently or formerly involved in the armed forces will salute a Government-employed superior, and follow with a deep bow from the waist or short nod of the head and a passing, loose handshake. Hand position is highly important; the superior's hand must be higher than the inferior's.\nMuslim men will clasp both hands, palms together at the chest and utter the correct Islamic \"slametan\" (greeting) phrase, which may be followed by cheek-to-cheek contact, a quick hug or loose handshake. Pious Muslim women rotate their hands from a vertical to perpendicular prayer-like position in order to barely touch the finger tips of the male greeter and may opt out of the cheek-to-cheek contact.\nIf the male is an \"Abdi Dalem\" royal servant, courtier or particularly \"peko-peko\" (taken directly from Japanese to mean obsequious) or even a highly formal individual, he will retreat backwards with head downcast, the left arm crossed against the chest and the right arm hanging down, never showing his side or back to his superior. His head must always be lower than that of his superior.\nYounger Muslim males and females will clasp their elder's or superior's outstretched hand to the forehead as a sign of respect and obeisance.\nIf a manual worker or a person with obviously dirty hands salutes or greets an elder or superior, he will show deference to his superior and avoid contact by bowing, touching the right forehead in a very quick salute or a distant \"slamet\" gesture.\n\nThe traditional Javanese \"Sungkem\" involves clasping the palms of both hands together, aligning the thumbs with the nose, turning the head downwards and bowing deeply, bending from the knees. In a royal presence, the one performing \"sungkem\" would kneel at the base of the throne.\n\nA gesture called a \"wai\" is used in Thailand, where the hands are placed together palm to palm, approximately at nose level, while bowing. The \"wai\" is similar in form to the gesture referred to by the Japanese term \"gassho\" by Buddhists. In Thailand, the men and women would usually press two palms together and bow a little while saying \"Sawadee ka\" (female speaker) or \"Sawadee krap\" (male speaker).\n\nSome cultures use hugs and kisses (regardless of the sex of the greeters), but those gestures show an existing degree of intimacy and are not used between total strangers. All of these gestures are being supplemented or completely displaced by the handshake in areas with large amounts of business contact with the West.\n\nThese bows indicate respect and acknowledgment of social rank, but do not necessarily imply obeisance.\n\nAn \"obeisance\" is a gesture not only of respect but also of submission. Such gestures are rarer in cultures that do not have strong class structures; citizens of the Western World, for example, often react with hostility to the idea of bowing to an authority figure. The distinction between a formally polite greeting and an obeisance is often hard to make; for example, \"proskynesis\" (from the words πρός \"pros\" (towards) and κυνέω \"kyneo\" (to kiss)) is described by the Greek researcher Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who lived in the 5th century BC in his \"Histories\" 1.134:\n\nAfter his conquest of Persia, Alexander the Great introduced Persian etiquette into his own court, including the practice of proskynesis. Visitors, depending on their ranks, would have to prostrate themselves, bow to, kneel in front of, or kiss the king. His Greek countrymen objected to this practice, as they considered these rituals only suitable to the gods.\n\nIn countries with recognized social classes, bowing to nobility and royalty is customary. Standing bows of obeisance all involve bending forward from the waist with the eyes downcast, though variations in the placement of the arms and feet are seen. In western European cultures, women do not bow, they \"curtsey\" (a contraction of \"courtesy\" that became its own word), a movement in which one foot is moved back and the entire body lowered to a crouch while the head is bowed.\n\nThe European formal greeting used from men to women can be transformed into an obeisance gesture by holding the suzerain's hand with both hands. This kind of respect is due to kings, princes, sovereigns (in their kingdoms), archbishops (in their metropolitan province) or the Pope (everywhere). In ultra-formal ceremonies (a coronation, oath of allegiance or episcopal inauguration) the right knee shall touch the ground.\n\nIn South Asia traditions, obeisance also involves prostrating oneself before a king.\n\nMany religious believers kneel in prayer, and some (Roman Catholics, and Anglicans) \"genuflect\", bending one knee to touch the ground, at various points during religious services; the Orthodox Christian equivalent is a deep bow from the waist, and as an especially solemn obeisance the Orthodox make prostrations, bending down on both knees and touching the forehead to the floor. Roman Catholics also employ prostrations on Good Friday and at ordinations. During Islamic prayer, a kneeling bow called \"sajdah\" is used, with forehead, nose, hands, knees, and toes all touching the ground. Jews bow from the waist many times during prayer. Four times during the Yom Kippur service, and once on each day of Rosh Hashanah, many Jews will kneel and then prostrate. With the Salvation Army, when becoming a soldier, at a christening or other official event, underneath the flag, a salute is often used. This involves holding the hand, palm forwards, with all the fingers held in a clenched fist position. The index finger is left raised pointing towards God, and the hand is often held at chest height, in a similar position to that of Girl Guides.\n\nHand salutes similar to those used in the military are rendered by the Drum Major of a marching band or drum corps just prior to beginning their performance (after the show announcer asks if the group is ready), following completion of the performance and at other appropriate times. In all cases the salute is rendered to the audience.\n\nThe classic \"corps style\" salute is often known as the \"punch\" type, where the saluting party will first punch their right arm straight forward from their body, arm parallel to the ground, hand in a fist, followed by the more traditional salute position with the right hand, left arm akimbo. Dropping the salute typically entails snapping the saluting hand to the side and clenching the fist, then dropping both arms to the sides.\n\nIn the US, a Drum Major carrying a large baton or mace will often salute by bringing the right hand, holding the mace with the head upward, to the left shoulder.\n\nThere are occasional, more flamboyant variations, such as the windmill action of the saluting arm given by the Madison Scouts drum major, or the running of the saluting hand around the brim of the hat worn by the Cavaliers drum major.\n\nUnited Kingdom and Commonwealth Canada, civilians do not salute the flag, although some may stand at attention when a national anthem is played or the national flag raised or lowered. In the United Kingdom, certain civilian individuals, such as officers of HM Revenue and Customs, salute the quarterdeck of Royal Navy vessels on boarding.\nIn many countries, gestures such as tipping one's hat when passing another on the street can be considered appropriate civilian salutes. A more formal hat tip-and-lift is common in Britain, especially by doormen in hotels.\n\nIn Ireland, citizens stand at attention when the national anthem \"Amhrán na bhFiann\" is played. They either sing or remain completely silent during the playing of the anthem. This practice usually takes place before Gaelic Games begin. It is also observed at bars and pubs if live music is played. When the performer(s) are finished playing it is traditional to perform the national anthem but less common in recent years.\n\nIn many countries, gestures such as tipping one's hat when passing another on the street can be considered appropriate civilian salutes. A more formal hat tip-and-lift is common in Britain, especially by doormen in hotels.\n\nIn the United States, civilians may salute the U.S. flag by placing their right hand over their heart or by standing at attention during the playing of the national anthem or while reciting the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance, or when the flag is passing by, as in a parade. Men and boys remove their hats and other headgear during the salute; religious headdress (and military headdress worn by veterans in uniform, who are otherwise civilians) are exempt. The nature of the headgear determines whether it is held in the left or right hand, tucked under the left arm, etc. However, if it is held in the right hand, the headgear is not held over the heart but the hand is placed in the same position it would be if it were not holding anything.\n\nThe Defense Authorization Act of 2009, signed by President Bush, contained a provision that gave veterans and active-duty service members not in uniform the right to salute during the playing of the national anthem. Previous legislation authorized saluting when not in uniform during the raising, lowering and passing of the flag. However, because a salute is a form of communication protected by the Free Speech clause of the First Amendment, legislative authorization is not required for any civilian—veteran or non-veteran—to salute the U.S. flag. Civilians in some other countries, like Italy, South Africa, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, South Korea, Croatia, Poland, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria also render the same civilian salute as their U.S. counterparts when hearing their respective national anthems.\n\nMany artefacts of popular culture have created military salutes for fictional purposes, more often than not with a cynical or sarcastic purpose.\n\nIn his 1953 comic book album \"Le Dictateur et le Champignon\", which is part of the \"Spirou et Fantasio\" series, Belgian artist Franquin creates a silly salute, used in a fictional Latin American country named Palombia. When saluting, subordinates of General Zantas must raise their hands over their heads, with the palm facing forward, then point to the top of their heads with their thumbs. Franquin repeats this idea in his 1957 comic book album \"Z comme Zorglub\", another episode of the \"Spirou et Fantasio\" series. Here, almighty science wizard Zorglub's conscripted soldiers salute their leader by pointing to their heads with their index fingers to cynically underline how much of a genius they consider him to be.\n\nIn the Marvel Comics universe members of the organisation Hydra salute in a similar way to a fascist salute but instead raise both hands with fists clenched. This is also accompanied by chanting \"Hail Hydra\".\n\nIn the 1987 parodic science fiction film \"Spaceballs\", directed by Mel Brooks, all subordinates of Supreme leader President Skroob salute him by first bending their forearms over their opposed hands as though they are about to give him the arm of honor salute, but at the last moment, use their raised hands to wave him good bye, rather than showing him the middle finger.\n\nIn the manga \"Attack on Titan\" the members of the armed forces (and sometimes civilians in a show of respect towards military) salute by bending their arms and placing their clenched fist over their hearts. The gesture, known as \"offering hearts\" is meant to demonstrate that the soldiers are willing to give their bodies and lives to protect humanity and to ensure its survival.\n\nIn the BBC TV science fiction comedy \"Red Dwarf\", Arnold J. Rimmer continually performs an elaborate special salute that he has invented for the Space Corps, in spite of the fact that he is not a member of the Corps. It consists of extending the hand out in front of the body, palm down and rotating it about the wrist five times (to represent the five rings of the Space Corps) followed by bringing the hand close to the head with the palm facing out.\n\n\n"}

The original motivation for semantic spaces stems from two core challenges of natural language: Vocabulary mismatch (the fact that the same meaning can be expressed in many ways) and ambiguity of natural language (the fact that the same term can have several meanings).\n\nThe application of semantic spaces in natural language processing (NLP) aims at overcoming limitations of rule-based or model-based approaches operating on the keyword level. The main drawback with these approaches is their brittleness, and the large manual effort required to create either rule-based NLP systems or training corpora for model learning. Rule-based and machine learning based models are fixed on the keyword level and break down if the vocabulary differs from that defined in the rules or from the training material used for the statistical models.\n\nResearch in semantic spaces dates back more than 20 years. In 1996, two papers were published that raised a lot of attention around the general idea of creating semantic spaces: latent semantic analysis and Hyperspace Analogue to Language. However, their adoption was limited by the large computational effort required to construct and use those semantic spaces. A breakthrough with regard to the accuracy of modelling associative relations between words (e.g. \"spider-web\", \"lighter-cigarette\", as opposed to synonymous relations such as \"whale-dolphin\", \"astronaut-driver\") was achieved by explicit semantic analysis (ESA) in 2007. ESA was a novel (non-machine learning) based approach that represented words in the form of vectors with 100,000 dimensions (where each dimension represents an Article in Wikipedia). However practical applications of the approach are limited due to the large number of required dimensions in the vectors.\n\nMore recently, advances in neural networking techniques in combination with other new approaches (tensors) led to a host of new recent developments: Word2vec from Google, GloVe from Stanford University, and fastText from Facebook AI Research (FAIR) labs.\n\n"}

{"id": "9791769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9791769", "title": "Ughele language", "text": "Ughele language\n\nUghele is an Oceanic language spoken by about 1200 people on Rendova Island, located in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands.\n\nThere is no internal dialect differentiation.\n\n\" The following information is gathered from Benedicte Haraldstad Frostad. \"A Grammar of Ughele: A Language of The Solomon Islands\". 2012. \" Pages 35–48\n\nUghele contains a five vowel inventory that is typical of most Oceanic languages.\nThese are differentiated by changes in the place of articulation and the degree of stricture required to produce the sound.\nLip rounding only accounts for the differentiation of two segments.\nThese are the close-mid back vowel /o/ and the close back vowel /u/.\n\nThis inventory consists of three front vowels: /i/, /e/, /a/; two back /o/, /u/ and no central phonemes.\n\nThere is no variation in vowel length.\n\n\" /veke/ \" and \" /veko/ \" - 'flying fox’ and ‘bald’\n\" /ɣami/ \" and \" /ɣamu/ \" - ‘we/us’ and ‘you’\n\n\" /patu/ \" and \" /petu/ \" - ‘stone’ and ‘mangrove’\n\" /tina/ \" and \" /tini/ \" - ‘thousand ‘ and ‘body’\n\" /neka/ \" and \" /nika/ \" - ‘slippery cabbage’ and ‘fire’\n\" /kopi/ \" and \" /kupi/ \" - ‘lake’ and ‘to pick’\n\nUghele has 18 consonants and no consonant clusters, unless spoken accidentally.\n\nUghele contains bilabial, alveolar and velar stops. These are \" /b + p/ \", \" /d + t/ \" and \" /g + k/ \" respectively.\nAs well as voiced and unvoiced pairs for all plosives. -\n\" /ba/ \" and \" /pa/ \"\n\" /made/ \" and \" /mate/ \" (four and die/dead)\n\" /poga/ \" and \" /poka/ \" (to make pudding/pudding and nail)\nAll voiced stops are pre-nasalised, however the degree of this varies between speakers. Pronunciation of this runs from barely audible nasalisation to almost fully nasalised segments. E.g. \" /b/ → /b̃/, /d/ → /d̃/, /g/ → /g̃/ \"\n\n\nThere is only one found in Ughele, this is in the lexeme \" /arozo/ \" (rope)\n\n\nThis post-alveolar affricate is sometimes realised as a palatal nasal stop \" /ɲ/ \", although this is relatively rare in spoken language and therefore is speaker-dependent. \n\" /d͡ʒ/ → /ɲ/ ~ /d͡ʒ/ \"\nThus \" ‘ngajiri’ \" (angry) may be pronounced \" /ŋad͡ʒiri/ \" or \" /ŋapiri/ \"\nUghele contains one alveolar lateral approximant \" /l/ \" and one labial velar \" /w/. \"\nHowever \" /w/ \" only occurs in a small set of loanwords from English and Roviana (another Solomon Island language originally developed for trade)\nWindow - \" /wida/ \"\n\nVoiced alveolar plosive \" /mada/ \" ‘to let’, and fricative, \" /maza/ \" ‘flesh’\nUnvoiced alveolar plosive \" /tabu/ \" ‘holy’, and fricative \" /sabu/ \" ‘hunt’\nVoiced velar plosive \"' /gu/ \" ‘1st/p possessive’, and fricative \" /ɣu/ \" ‘just’\n\nPrior to the efforts of Frostard et al. Ughele had no documented history or written language standard. After these efforts Ughele is now written in Latin script as shown in these notes.\n\nUghele, like many other Oceanic languages, possesses a complex pronominal system that includes personal, relative and interrogative pronouns (Frostad, 2012, p. 81-88).\n\nPersonal pronouns\n\nPersonal pronouns predominate in terms of quantity; there are six types of pronoun forms: independent pronouns, preverbal subject partial clitics, postverbal subject pronouns, object clitics, preposed possessive pronouns and attributive suffixes (Frostad, 2012, p. 81-88). Personal pronouns are marked for number and clusivity. In each of these types, distinctions are made between singular and plural forms, as well as 1st. 2nd and 3rd person (Frostad, 2012, p. 81). Inclusive and exclusive forms for 1st person plural are separated; the inclusive form extends to include the addressee whereas the addressee is then excluded from the extension of the exclusive form (Frostad, 2012, p. 81). There are partial formal similarities, and in some cases a complete overlap of forms between the types (Frostad, 2012, p. 81). The table below is an overview of the various types of personal pronouns.\n\nTable 1: Ughele personal pronouns (Frostad, 2012, p. 81). \nPersonal pronouns in Ughele can occupy various positions throughout the clause, with some types being more restricted in their use than others.\n\nIndependent pronouns may act as the head of a noun phrase, taking on the forms of subject, direct object, or indirect object as a complement to prepositions (Frostad, 2012, p. 81). They may also appear in possessive constructions.\n\nAbove is an example of the 3rd person plural pronoun \"rie\" and 1st person plural exclusive pronoun \"ghita\" in noun phrases headed by pronouns. The numeral modifier \"ka ru\" follows the pronoun head, whereas it would typically precede a noun head (Frostad, 2012, p. 82).\n\nUghele has object marking clitics and two different sets of subject markers, and these occur in specific fixed positions relative to the verb (Frostad, 2012, 169).\n\nObject clitics are pronominal forms, which only occur with verb stems and only mark direct object (Frostad, 2012, 85).\n\nTransitive verbs rarely occur without object marking clitics (Frostad, 2012, p. 169), and are either attached directly to the verb stem (2), or follow the transitive suffix, either \"–i\" (3) or \"–ni\" (4).\n\n1st person singular exclusive object clitic \"–(a)u\" attached to verb stem:\n3rd person singular object clitic \"–a\" attached to transitive suffix \"–i:\"\n3rd person singular object clitic \"–a \" attached to transitive suffix \"–ni:\"\nObject clitics may be the only referent to the object in the clause (5) or they may occur with a coreferential noun phrase (6) (Frostad, 2012, p. 85).\n\n2nd person singular \"–(a)gho\":\n\n2nd person singular object clitic \"–(a)gho\" with coreferential noun phrase 2nd person singular independent pronoun\n\n\"–ghoi\":\n\nPreverbal subject marking pronouns in Ughele can appear in the form of partial clitics. These clitics precede the verb complex, but only in very specific constructions (Frostad, p. 82). They cliticize to two particles, the homophonous imperative mood marker \"ma\" (7), and conjunction \"ma\" ‘then’ (8), and they occur as independent forms indicating pivots in complex clauses (9) (Frostad, 2012, p. 171). This aspect of Ughele’s grammar bears resemblance to that of three of its nearest neighbouring languages, Hoava, Roviana and Marovo, with that of Marovo being the most similar (Frostad, 2012, p. 171).\n\n1st person plural inclusive preverbal subject clitic –\"da\" attached to mood marker \"ma\":\n2nd person singular preverbal subject clitic \"–mu\" attached to conjunction \"ma\":\n\n3rd person plural preverbal subject independent form \"di\":\n\nIn Ughele, postverbal subject pronouns overlap completely with preposed possessive pronouns (Frostad, 2012, p. 84). Postverbal subject pronouns mark various types of foci, where the pronouns would refer to the focused constituent (Frostad, 2012, p. 85). Below is an example of the 3rd person plural postverbal subject pronoun used in a sentence.\n\nPreposed possessive pronouns make up one of the three indirect possessive marking strategies in Ughele (Frostad, p. 86). It may occur in constructions which has a noun phrase expressing the possessor (11) or not, as in (12).\n\nAttributive suffixes are what are often labeled as possessive suffixes in most other Oceanic languages (Frostad, 2012, p. 87), but in Ughele, they also have other functions (Frostad, 2012, p. 87).\n\nIn direct possessive constructions, attributive suffixes may either agree with the possessor noun (13) or be the only expression of the possessor (14).\n\nAttributive suffixes are also used to derive nominal attributive modifiers from adjectival verbs, indicating the number and person of the referent of the head noun (15) (Frostad, 2012, p. 87). \n1.
