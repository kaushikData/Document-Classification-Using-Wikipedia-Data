It is spoken in the village of Alipur, Karnataka, a Shia Muslim enclave with a high degree of congenital deafness. There are between 150 and 250 deaf people in Alipur, and there are approximately 10,000 hearing people speaking the language on a population of 26,000 (in 2015). The language has no official statute and deaf children receives no formal education. This fact plus the increasing influence of the Indian Sign Language threaten the survival of Alipur Sign Language (or APSL). Sibaji Panda was the first person to officially document the language in 2012.\n\nDuring his study, Panda found out that the proportion of deaf population in Alipur was of approximately 0.75%, against 0.41% on national average (data from the 2011 census).\n\nThe deaf community of Alipur helped Panda in his researches, particularly Mir Fazil Raza, a 49 year old former gram panchayat chief, who helped set up the Alipur Unity Society. Mr. Faza helped with translation from English to the sign language, conducted survey with the help of other members of the community, and served as an informator for the documentation of the language.\n\nEndogamous marriages in the village have led to this large population of deaf, but a deaf man cannot marry a deaf woman. Since there is no public records in the village, it is difficult to established the veracity of this information.\n\nThe sign language is used by many hearing person, with level of fluency that greatly varies.\n\nThe language has a variety of ways to express numbers, using additions and subtractions to express complex numbers. Mouth movements can be added to express bigger numbers.\n\nThe majority of the village inhabitants are Muslim in a region with a Hindu majority. The Shia population descent from Iranian migrants and are proud of their culture and history.\n\nThe younger generation is less interested in using the village sign language. Mobility and technology gives them access to the Internet and they travel to Bengaloru where they learn Indian Sign Language and American Sign Language. The lack of formal education is nevertheless a barrier for them to be able to use script-based applications (like text messaging) and there aren't many employment opportunities.\n\nA better understanding of the situation of the language could be beneficial for the population. There is hope to re-open the school for special need children.\n"}

He worked for the cause of Darrangi culture and was conferred with the title \"Darrang Ratna\".\n\nAtul Chandra Barua was born on 29 May 1916 to Bhogram Barua and Pramila Barua in the village Maroigaon (Dubahati) in Darrang district, Assam.\n\nIn the year 1924, he was the student from Maroigaon Primary school who topped the Darrang Scholarship exam when he was studying only in class three. He received Khagendra Narayan award when he topped Assam Scholarship Exam and he was studying in Sixth standard of Patharighat High school. He passed his matriculation exam from Mangaldoi Govt. School by holding 1st division and got letter marks in two subjects in the year 1936. In the year 1940, he passed B.A. exam from Cotton College. For further education he went to Calcutta University to acquire M.A. degree. He passed M.A. in 2nd class 1st place in the year 1944.\n\nAtul Chandra Barua married Hiran Prabha Barua in the year 1947.\n\nAfter completing his studies started imparting education to the students in various institutions like Sipajhar High School, Mangaldai High School Patharighat ME School, Kamrup Academy High School (now a senior secondary school), St Mary's College and St Edmund's College in Shillong in Meghalaya (then in Assam) etc. at various times. He also rendered his services in the Assam Secretariat in Shillong from 1943 to 1947. In independent India appearing in the Assam Civil Service Examination held in 1949 for the first lime, he stood second in rank to bag a post of sub-deputy collector. He was appointed Assistant Deputy Commissioner of Rangia from 1953 to 1958. In 1958, he was appointed P.A. of Commissioner in Shillong i.e. capital of Assam at that time. He was transferred to Tezpur for the post of S.D.O.in 1969 and he work their till 1971. He was also appointed Managing Director of Apex Marketing Society in the year 1971. He worked as M.D. for two years. He was again appointed as Assistant Deputy Commissioner. He worked as A.D.C. for two years. He was retired after that tenure of A.D.C.in the year 1974.\n\nIn the session of 1979 of Asam Sahitya Sabha Atul Chandra Barua served as the 46th President in Session 1979-80 held in Sualkuchi.\n\nIn bringing fructification the dream project of the Singhapurush Radha Govinda Baruah the Nehru Stadium, Atul Chandra Barua played a pivotal role in the matter of allotment of the plot of Land for the purpose. He was also the moving force behind the establishment of the Ambikagiri Sishu Udyan at Nabagiri Road in Chandmari. \nBesides these Atul Chandra Barua also established the socio-literary organization Mukul Sangha in Shillong which is still standing erect with profound stature in society since its inception in 1945. In 1950, he formed the Jironi Mel its founder secretary; amongst many other organizations. The Guwahati Alochoua Chakra established by him in 1955 is now a very prominent one and holds meetings on a regular basis proffering opportunities to the budding and veteran writers to mingle together to derive mutual benefits. \nIn spite of being an extremely busy person with administrative responsibilities of important nature, Atul Chandra Barua could find time enough to write and publish more than 30 books, besides editing about 15 literary and socially relevant journals and magazines including two vernacular dictionaries, of which Chalanta Abhidhan was an achievement of a great order, which was also jointly edited by stalwarts like Dr Maheswar Neog, Kirtinath Hazarika, etc. The first book named ‘Sarad Chandra Goswamir Samu Jiboni’ which was published in the year1946. Some others were ‘Purani Puthir Sadu’(1951), ‘Sahitya Ruprekha’(1957), ‘Ulat-Palat’(1957), ‘Nabi Katha’(1963), Ojapali, its Different type and Functions (1982).\nA lover of his birthplace to the core of his heart, Atul Chandra Barua undertook extensive and intensive research in the field of the culture of Darrang which is termed as 'Darrangi Kala Kristi' and for his yeoman service; he was conferred with the title 'Darrang Ratna'. He dedicated his post-retirement life for the cause of Darrangi culture until he breathed his last. \nAn able administrator Atul Chandra Barua could visualize the future of Guwahati city even during the 50s and 60s. He was an advocate for maintenance and preservation of the water-bodies and open spaces in Guwahati, although he could not achieve that cherished desire for reasons galore. Activities that worked opposite to his wishes had become the order of the day, as a consequence of which the agonies of artificial floods have to be faced by the Guwahati denizens as a perennially celebrated festival. Had the same counsel of this visionary been put into action Guwahati today would have been a different place to live in. \nAlthough the great literary organization Asam Sahitya Sabha has been smeared with black soot by a few black sheep, its stature cannot be diminished by the misdeeds perpetrated by these people. Atul Chandra Barua was elected the president of the Sabha in 1979 at a time when Assam was facing a difficult phase. In the session of 1979 of Asam Sahitya Sabha Atul Chandra Barua served as the 46th President in Session 1979-80 held in Sualkuchi, Atul Chandra Barua as its president played a very significant role to steer the organization for being a savior or Assamese society by protecting and preserving the art, culture, literature and language to stand alone as a unique part of India. Under his able and visionary leadership the Assam Sahitya Sabha also became a great force to be reckoned with in moving the historic six-year-long Assam Agitation spearheaded by the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) to reach the destination successfully. \nDuring his presidency and afterwards too, Atul Chandra Barua maintained good rapport with the society and various factions of the greater Assamese culture to forge unity amongst all the people of Assam irrespective of caste, culture, creed, religion, ethnicity etc. \nThe selflessness of Atul Chandra Barua's personality was the most venerable one and for this aspect only. Prafulla Chandra Barua wrote a cheque in the name of Atul Chandra Barua as donation for the construction of the Lakhiram Barua Sadan in Guwahati. Moreover; his contribution in garnering financial aid for construction of the Radha Nath Handiqui Bhawan at Jorhat is also remembered by everyone. \nThe relentless and silent deeds of Atul Chandra Barua for the all-round development of Assam would remain ingrained in public mind for years to come. It is, however, necessary to make the young and the posterior generation aware of the contributions of such a person to inspire them to become conscious citizens to be engaged ill the nation-building process. \nThis is the birth centenary year of this beacon. Atul Chandra Barua's life is one to be emulated and we all are in a way duty-bound to be engaged for the well-being of the society following his footsteps.\n\n\nAtul Chandra Barua died on 25 December 2001.\n\n"}

It has been seen on many artifacts of modern office machinery as well, most notably photocopiers.\n\nThe Jargon File provides the following etymology:\n\nThis term derives from the last word of the famous blackletter-Gothic sign in mangled mock German that once graced many computer rooms in the English-speaking world. One version read:\n\nThis silliness dates back to least as far as 1955 at IBM and had already gone international by the early 1960s, when it was reported at the University of London's ATLAS computing site.\nThere are several variants of it in circulation, some of which actually do end with the word \"blinkenlights\".\n\nAlthough the sign might initially appear to be in German and uses an approximation of German grammar, it is composed largely of words that are either near-homonyms of English words or (in the cases of the longer words) actual English words that are rendered in a faux-German spelling. As such, the sign is generally comprehensible by many English speakers regardless of whether they have any fluency in German. Much of the humor in these signs was their intentionally incorrect language.\n\nMichael J. Preston recites the gem as being posted above photocopiers in offices as a warning not to mess with the machine in the first print reference from 1974. The sign is also reported to have been seen on an electron microscope at the Cavendish Laboratory in the 1950s. Such pseudo-German parodies were common in Allied machine shops during and following World War II, and an example photocopy is shown in the \"Jargon File\".\n\nThe \"Jargon File\" also mentions that German hackers have developed their own versions of the blinkenlights poster, in fractured English:\n\nThe bits and digits in the earliest mechanical and vacuum tube-based computers were typically large, small in number, making it easy to see and often hear activity. Then, for decades, computers incorporated arrays of indicator lamps in their control panels, indicating the values carried on the address, data, and other internal buses, and in various registers. These could be used for diagnosing or \"single-stepping\" a halted machine, but even with the machine operating normally, a skilled operator could interpret the high-speed blur of the lamps to tell which section of a large program was executing, whether the program was caught in an endless loop, and so on.\n\nWith rising processor clock rates, increased memory sizes, and improved interactive debugging tools, such panel lights gradually lost their usefulness, though today most devices have indicators showing power on/off status, hard disk activity, network activity, and other indicators of \"signs of life\".\n\nThe original IBM PC could have a diagnostics card plugged into it that used LEDs to show what part of the memory it was using, and show the memory address and data code on 7-segment displays whenever the card was manually locked or automatically triggered.\n\nThe Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel computer designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving Conway's Game of Life patterns.\n\nThe CPU load monitors on the front of BeBoxes were also called “blinkenlights”.\n\nSeveral computer components, such as the Ballistix Tactical Tracer memory modules from Crucial Technology and the NVidia Titan GTX, have user-controllable lights that can be configured to show useful information, such as the memory capacity used and the temperature of the components.\n\nThis word gave its name to several projects, including screen savers, hardware gadgets, and other nostalgic things. Some notable enterprises include Project Blinkenlights and the Blinkenlights Archaeological Institute.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "183431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183431", "title": "Chord progression", "text": "Chord progression\n\nA chord progression or harmonic progression is a succession of musical chords, which are two or more notes, typically sounded simultaneously. Chord progressions are the foundation of harmony in Western musical tradition from the common practice era of Classical music to the 21st century. Chord progressions are the foundation of Western popular music styles (e.g., pop music, rock music) and traditional music (e.g., blues and jazz). In these genres, chord progressions are the defining feature on which melody and rhythm are built.\n\nIn tonal music, chord progressions have the function of establishing or contradicting a tonality, the technical name for what is commonly understood as the \"key\" of a song or piece. Chord progressions are usually expressed by Roman numerals in Classical music theory; for example, the common chord progression I vi/ii V7. In many styles of popular and traditional music, chord progressions are expressed using the name and \"quality\" of the chords. For example, the previously mentioned chord progression, in the key of C Major, would be written as C Major A minor/D minor G7 in a fake book or lead sheet. In the first chord, C Major, the \"C\" indicates that the chord is built on the root note \"C\"; the word \"Major\" indicates that a major chord is built on this \"C\" note. \n\nIn rock and blues, musicians also often refer to chord progressions using Roman numerals, as this facilitates transposing a song to a new key. For example, rock and blues musicians often think of the 12 bar blues as consisting of I, IV and V chords. Thus a simple version of the 12-bar blues might be expressed as I/I/I/I IV/IV/I/I/V/IV/I/I. By thinking of this blues progression in Roman numerals, a backup band or rhythm section could be instructed by a bandleader to do the chord progression in any key. For example, if the bandleader asked the band to play this chord progression in the key of C Major, the chords would be C/C/C/C F/F/C/C G/F/C/C. If the bandleader wanted to play the song in the key of G Major, the chords would be G/G/G/G C/C/G/G D/C/G/G, and so on.\n\nThe complexity of a chord progression varies from genre to genre and over different historical periods. Some pop and rock songs from the 1980s to the 2010s have fairly simple chord progressions. Funk emphasizes the groove and rhythm as the key element, so entire funk songs may be based on one chord. Some jazz-funk songs are based on a two-, three- or four-chord vamp. Some punk and hardcore punk songs use only a few chords. On the other hand, bebop jazz songs may have 32 bar song forms with one or two chord changes every bar.\n\nA chord may be built upon any note of a musical scale, therefore a seven-note scale allows seven basic chords (for that scale's key), each degree of the scale becoming the root of its own chord. A chord built upon the note E is an E chord of some type (major/minor/diminished, etc.) The harmonic \"function\" of any particular chord depends on the context of the particular chord progression in which it is found. (\"See\" Diatonic function)\n\nThe diatonic (scale-based, not including notes other than the seven notes of the given scale) harmonization of any major scale results in three major triads. They are based on the first, fourth, and fifth scale degrees (the tonic, called the I chord in Roman numeral analysis; the subdominant, the ii or IV chord in Roman numeral analysis; and dominant, the V or V7 chord – \"see three-chord song\"). These three triads include, and therefore can harmonize, every note of that scale. Many simple traditional music, folk music and rock and roll songs use only these three chord types (e.g., Wild Thing, which uses I, IV and V chords).\n\nThe same scale also provides three relative minor chords, one related to each of the three major chords. These are based upon the sixth, second and third degrees of the major scale and stand in the same relationship to one another (in the relative minor key) as do the three majors, so that they may be viewed as the first (i), fourth (iv) and fifth (v) degrees of the relative minor key. For example, if we are in the key of C Major, its relative minor key is the key of A minor. In the key of A minor, the i, iv and v chords would be A minor, D minor and E minor. In practice, the dominant chord's third is often sharpened (raised) by one semitone to give a major chord; as well, this V chord may have a dominant seventh added, making it a V7 chord. The chords in this alteration would be A minor, d minor and E major (or E7).\n\nSeparate from these six common chords there is one degree of the scale, the seventh, that results in a diminished chord. Thus in the key of C Major, the seventh note of the scale, B, would be the root note of a diminished triad (the notes B, D and F).\n\nIn addition, extra chromatic notes may be added to any chord. Chromatic notes are notes that are not in the key. Returning to our example of a song in C Major, this is a key with no sharps or flats. The key of C Major is the \"white notes\" on a piano. Any of the chords in the key of C Major can have one or more notes in their triad sharpened or flattened, which would require the use, in C Major, of the \"black keys\". Perhaps the most basic chromatic alteration in simple folk songs is the use of the sharpened fourth scale degree. In a song in C Major, the diatonic fourth scale degree is F. Sharpening this fourth degree by one semitone gives F#. Thus with the F#, the ii chord (normally the notes D, F and A) becomes the notes D, F#, A (a D Major chord; the technical term for this chord is a secondary dominant) these notes are also selected from the original scale the harmony remains diatonic. If new chromatic intervals are introduced then a change of scale or modulation occurs, which may bring the sense of a change of tonal center (commonly called moving to a new key). This in turn may lead to a resolution back to the original key, so that the entire sequence of chords helps create an extended musical form and a sense of movement and interest for the listener.\n\nAlthough all this allows for a large number of possible progressions (depending upon the length of the progression), in practice, progressions are often limited to a few bars' length and certain progressions are favored above others: there is a certain amount of fashion in this and a chord progression (e.g., the 12 bar blues progression) may even define an entire genre.\n\nIn western classical notation, chords built on the scale are numbered with Roman numerals. A D chord will be figured I in the key of D, for example, but V in the key of G. Minor chords are signified by lower case Roman, so that D minor in the key of C would be written ii. Other forms of chord notation have been devised, from figured bass to the chord chart. These usually allow or even require a certain amount of improvisation.\n\nDiatonic scales such as the major and minor scales lend themselves particularly well to the construction of common chords because they contain a large number of perfect fifths. Such scales predominate in those regions where harmony is an essential part of music, as, for example, in the common practice period of western classical music. In considering Arab and Indian music, where diatonic scales are used, there are also available a number of non-diatonic scales, the music has no chord changes, remaining always upon the key-chord, an attribute which has also been observed in hard rock, hip hop, funk, disco, jazz, etc.\n\nAlternation between two chords may be thought of as the most basic chord progression. Many well-known pieces are built harmonically upon the mere repetition of two chords of the same scale. For example, many of the more straightforward melodies in classical music consist entirely or mostly of alternation between the tonic (I) and the dominant (V, sometimes with an added seventh), as do folk songs such as \"Polly Wolly Doodle\" and popular songs such as \"Achy Breaky Heart\". The Isley Brothers' \"Shout\" uses I - vi throughout.\n\nThree-chord tunes, though, are more common, since a melody may then dwell on any note of the scale. They are often presented as successions of four chords, in order to produce a binary harmonic rhythm, but two of the four chords are then the same. Often the chords may be selected to fit a pre-conceived melody, but just as often it is the progression itself that gives rise to the melody.\n\n\nSimilar progressions abound in African popular music. They may be varied by the addition of sevenths (or other scale degrees) to any chord or by substitution of the relative minor of the IV chord to give, for example, I - ii - V. This sequence, using the chord based on the second scale degree, is also used cadentially in a common chord progression of jazz harmony, the so-called ii-V-I turnaround, on which are based the more ornate Coltrane changes.\n\nSuch progressions provide the entire harmonic foundation of much African and American popular music, and they occur sectionally in many pieces of classical music (such as the opening bars of Beethoven's \"Pastoral\" Symphony). Any of these progressions may be transposed into any key so that, for instance, the progression I - IV - V in the key of A will be played A - D - E, while in the key of C the chords will be C - F - G.\n\nWhere such a simple sequence does not represent the entire harmonic structure of a piece, it may readily be extended for greater variety. Frequently an opening phrase of the type I - IV - V - V, which ends on an unresolved dominant, may be \"answered\" by a similar version that resolves back onto the home chord, giving a structure of double the length:\n\nAdditionally, such a passage may be alternated with a different progression to give a simple binary or ternary form such as that of the popular thirty-two-bar form (see musical form).\n\nThe twelve bar blues and its many variants use an elongated, three-line form of the I - IV - V progression that has also generated countless hit records, including the most significant output of rock and rollers such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard. In its most elementary form (there are many variants) the chords progress as follows:\nAgain, blues progressions have formed the entire harmonic basis of many recorded songs but may also be confined to a single section of a more elaborate form, as frequently with The Beatles in such songs as \"You Can't Do That\", \"I Feel Fine\", and \"She's A Woman\". They have also been subjected to densely chromatic elaboration, as in the Bird blues.\n\nSteedman (1984) proposed that a set of recursive rewrite rules generate all well-formed transformations of jazz, both basic blues chord changes and slightly modified sequences (such as the \"rhythm changes\"). Important transformations include:\n\nAnother common way of extending the I - IV - V sequence is by adding the chord of the sixth scale degree, giving the sequence I - vi - IV - V or I - vi - ii - V, sometimes called the 50s progression or doo-wop progression.\nIn fact this sequence had been in use from the earliest days of classical music (used often by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart), but after generating popular hits such as Rodgers and Hart's \"Blue Moon\" (1934), Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' 1936 \"The Way You Look Tonight\", and Hoagy Carmichael's \"Heart and Soul\" (1938), it became associated with the black American vocal groups of the 1940s, The Ink Spots and The Mills Brothers (\"Till Then\"), and thus later became the entire basis of the 1950s doo-wop genre, a typical example being The Monotones' \"The Book of Love\".\n\nTaken up into the pop mainstream, for example with Felice and Boudleaux Bryant's \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\", a hit for The Everly Brothers, in the 1960s it continued to generate records as otherwise disparate as The Paris Sisters' \"I Love How You Love Me\" (written by Mann and Kolber) and Boris Pickett's \"Monster Mash\". \n\nIt continued to be used sectionally, as in the last part of The Beatles' \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\", and also to form the harmonic basis of further new songs for decades (\"Every Breath You Take\" by The Police and Madonna's \"True Blue\").\nIntroducing the ii chord into these progressions emphasises their appeal as constituting elementary forms of circle progression. These, named for the circle of fifths, consist of \"adjacent roots in ascending fourth or descending fifth relationship\"—for instance, the sequence vi - ii - V - I ascends with each successive chord to one a fourth above the previous. Such a motion, based upon close harmonic relations, offers \"undoubtedly the most common and the strongest of all harmonic progressions\". The succession of cadences gives an impression of inevitable return to the key-note of the piece.\nShort cyclical progressions may be derived by selecting a sequence of chords from the series completing a circle from the tonic through all seven diatonic chords:\n\nThis type of progression was much used by classical composers, who introduced increasingly subtle inflections. Particularly, substitution of major for minor chords giving, for example, I - VI - II - V allowed a more sophisticated chromaticism as well as the possibility of modulation. These harmonic conventions were taken up by American popular entertainers, giving rise to many variations on those harmonic staples of early jazz that have been dubbed the ragtime progression and the stomp progression. All such progressions may be found used sectionally, as for example in the much-used \"rhythm changes\" of George Gershwin's \"I Got Rhythm\".\n\nAs well as the cyclical underpinning of chords, the ear tends to respond well to a linear thread; chords following the scale upwards or downwards. These are often referred to as step progressions because they follow the steps of the scale, making the scale itself a bassline. In the 17th century, descending bass lines found favour for \"divisions on the ground\", so that Pachelbel's canon, the Bach orchestral suites (the famous \"Air on a G String\"), and Handel's organ concerti all contain very similar harmonizations of the descending major scale. When this was reintroduced into mid-20th century pop music, it brought with it many baroque trappings (The Beatles' \"For No One\", Procol Harum's \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\", and The Steve Miller Band's \"Dear Mary\" and \"Baby's House\").\n\nAt its simplest, this descending sequence may simply introduce an extra chord, either III or V, into the I - VI - IV - V type of sequence described above. This chord allows the harmonization of the seventh step, and so of the bass line I - VII - VI... This strategy underlies Percy Sledge's \"When A Man Loves A Woman\" and Bob Marley's \"No Woman, No Cry\". The baroque examples descend for an octave, while \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" manages a stately two octaves, before \"turning around\" through the dominant chord to recommence upon the key note.\n\nAscending major progressions are not as common but many exist: the verse of \"Like a Rolling Stone\" ascends by steps to the fifth, I-ii-iii-IV-V (or I-ii-I/iii-IV-V) before descending again to the key-note, IV - iii - ii - I (or IV-I/iii-ii-I)—the latter being another common type of harmonization of a descending major scale. The Four Pennies' hit \"Juliet\" and The Beatles' \"Here, There and Everywhere\" both use similar ascending progressions.\n\nThe descending chromatic scale has also formed the basis of many progressions, from the \"\" of Bach's Mass in B minor, through Beethoven's \"Thirty-two Piano Variations\", to songs such as Bob Dylan's \"Simple Twist of Fate\", George Harrison's \"Something\", and Lucio Battisti's \"Paradiso\", a hit for Amen Corner when translated as \"(If Paradise Is) Half as Nice\".\n\nThe finale measures of the first movement of Ravel's Piano Concerto in G feature the harmonization of a descending hybrid scale (phrygo-major). In this special case, Ravel used a parallel series of major triads to brilliant effect.:(G F E D C B A G)\n\nSimilar strategies to all the above work equally well in minor modes: there have been one-, two- and three-minor-chord songs, minor blues.\nA notable example of a descending minor chord progression is the four-chord Andalusian cadence,\ni - VII - VI - V.\n\nFolk and blues tunes frequently use the Mixolydian scale, which has a flat seventh degree, altering the position of the three major chords to I-VII-IV. For example, if the major scale of C, which gives the three chords C, F and G on the first, fourth and fifth degrees, is played with G as the tonic, then the same chords will now appear on the first, fourth and seventh degrees. These \"Mixolydian\" harmonies also appeared in the pop music of the 1960s, notably with The Beatles' album \"Help!\" and The Rolling Stones' \"Beggar's Banquet\".\n\nThe minor-third step from a minor keynote up to the relative major encouraged ascending scale progressions, particularly based on an ascending pentatonic scale. Typical of the type is the sequence i - III -IV (or iv) - VI.\n\nAccording to Tom Sutcliffe:\n\nThis came about partly from the similarity of the blues scale to modal scales and partly from the characteristics of the guitar and the use of parallel major chords on the pentatonic minor scale. With barre chords on guitar, the same chord shape can be moved up and down the neck without changing the fingering. This phenomenon is also linked to the rise in the use of power chords in heavy metal music. Power chords contain just a fifth, or a fifth with the root doubled. Without a third, power chords enable more flexibility in the chord progression.\n\nEarly European art music developed through embellishment of a single line of melody and classical theory still emphasises the correct \"horizontal\" progress of single-note parts, sometimes known as voice leading. Generally, to the melody in the upper part is added first a bass line and then two inner lines to complete the chords in four-part harmony suitable for a choir or string section, terminating with cadences, avoiding some chord inversions and favouring others, maintaining an orderly and melodic conjunct, contrary and oblique motion of each part relative to the others in order to achieve unity of texture by avoidance of inappropriate intervals, parallel fifths and octaves etc. Much practice is given to the art of harmonic transition and development that is essential to classical music's use of harmony as a means of achieving unity in a large-scale form. While (as noted above) classical music has its cliche progressions, they are seldom named and discussed: perhaps only Schoenberg among the authors of popular text-books of harmony has made some attempt to do so.\n\n\n\n"}

Chumashan, Yukian, and southern Baja languages are spoken in areas with long-established populations of a distinct physical type. The population in the core Chumashan area has been stable for the past 10,000 years. However, the attested range of Chumashan is recent (within a couple thousand years). There is internal evidence that Obispeño replaced a Hokan language and that Island Chumash mixed with a language very different from Chumashan; the islands were not in contact with the mainland until the introduction of plank canoes in the first millennium AD.\n\nAll of the Chumashan languages are now extinct, although they are well documented in the unpublished fieldnotes of linguist John Peabody Harrington. Especially well documented are Barbareño, Ineseño, and Ventureño. The last native speaker of a Chumashan language was Barbareño speaker Mary Yee, who died in 1965.\n\nSix Chumashan languages are attested, all now extinct. However, most of them are in the process of revitalization, with language programs and classes. Contemporary Chumash people now prefer to refer to their languages by native names rather than the older names based on the local missions.\n\nI. Northern Chumash\nII. Southern Chumash\n\nObispeño was the most divergent Chumashan language. The Central Chumash languages include Purisimeño, Ineseño, Barbareño and Ventureño. There was a dialect continuum across this area, but the form of the language spoken in the vicinity of each mission was distinct enough to qualify as a different language.\n\nThere is very little documentation of Purisimeño. Ineseño, Barbareño and Ventureño each had several dialects, although documentation usually focused on just one. Island Chumash had different dialects on Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island, but all speakers were relocated to the mainland in the early 19th century. John Peabody Harrington conducted fieldwork on all the above Chumashan languages, but obtained the least data on Island Chumash, Purisimeño, and Obispeño. There is no linguistic data on Cuyama, though ethnographic data suggests that it was likely Chumash (Interior Chumash).\n\nThe languages are named after the local Franciscan Spanish missions in California where Chumashan speakers were relocated and aggregated between the 1770s and 1830s:\n\nRoland Dixon and Alfred L. Kroeber suggested that the Chumashan languages might be related to the neighboring Salinan in a \"Iskoman\" grouping. Edward Sapir accepted this speculation and included Iskoman in his classification of Hokan. More recently it has been noted that Salinan and Chumashan shared only one word, which the Chumashan languages probably borrowed from Salinan (the word meant 'white clam shell' and was used as currency). As a result, the inclusion of Chumashan into Hokan is now disfavored by most specialists, and the consensus is that Chumashan has no identified linguistic relatives.\n\nThe Chumashan languages are well known for their consonant harmony (regressive sibilant harmony). Mithun presents a scholarly synopsis of Chumashan linguistic structures.\n\nThe Central Chumash languages all have a symmetrical six-vowel system. The distinctive high central vowel is written various ways, including \"barred I,\" \"schwa\" and \"I umlaut.\" Contemporary students/users of the languages favor or .\n\nStriking features of this system include\n\n\nThe Central Chumash languages have a complex inventory of consonants. All of the consonants except /h/ can be glottalized; all of the consonants except /h/, /x/ and the liquids can be aspirated.\n\n\n"}

I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.\" This has frequently been distorted by opponents to say that Gore claimed, \"I invented the Internet.\" Partisans have so often used this distorted quotation to discredit him that Internet pioneer Vint Cerf (and others who participated in \"actually\" inventing the Internet) have made a point of noting Gore's support and the error of the discreditors.

Thicker vocal folds in dramatic voices usually (but not always) mean less agility than lighter voices but a sustained, fuller sound. Usually this voice has a lower tessitura than other sopranos, and a darker timbre. They are often used for heroic, often long-suffering, tragic women of opera. Dramatic sopranos have a range from approximately low A (A) to \"high C\" (C). Some dramatic sopranos, known as Wagnerian sopranos, have an exceptionally big voice that can assert itself over a large orchestra (of more than 80 or even 100 pieces). These voices are substantial, often denser in tone, extremely powerful and, ideally, evenly balanced throughout the vocal registers. Wagnerian sopranos usually play mythic heroines.

{"id": "2692699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2692699", "title": "Galley slave", "text": "Galley slave\n\nA galley slave is a slave rowing in a galley, either a convicted criminal sentenced to work at the oar (\"French\": galérien), or a kind of human chattel, often a prisoner of war, assigned to his duty of rowing.\n\nAncient navies generally preferred to rely on free men to man their galleys. Slaves were usually not put at the oars except in times of pressing manpower demands or extreme emergency, and in some of these cases they would earn their freedom by this. There is no evidence that ancient navies ever made use of condemned criminals as oarsmen, despite the popular image from novels such as \"\".\n\nIn Classical Athens, a leading naval power of Classical Greece, rowing was regarded as an honorable profession of which men should possess some practical knowledge, and sailors were viewed as instrumental in safeguarding the state. According to Aristotle, the common people on the rowing benches won the Battle of Salamis, thereby strengthening the Athenian democracy.\n\nThe special characteristics of the Trireme, with each of its 170 oars being handled by a single oarsman, demanded the commitment of skilled freemen; rowing required coordination and training on which success in combat and the lives of all aboard depended. Also, practical difficulties such as the prevention of desertion or revolt when bivouacking (triremes used to be hauled on land at night) made free labour more secure and more economical than slaves.\n\nIn the 5th and 4th centuries BC, Athens generally followed a naval policy of enrolling citizens from the lower classes (Thetes), metics (foreigners resident in Athens) and hired foreigners. Although it has been argued that slaves formed part of the rowing crew in the Sicilian Expedition, a typical Athenian trireme crew during the Peloponnesian War consisted of 80 citizens, 60 metics and 60 foreign hands. \n\nHowever, when put under military pressure by the Spartans in the final stages of the conflict, Athens, in an all-out effort, mobilized all men of military age, including all slaves. After the victorious Battle of Arginusae the freed slaves were even given Athenian citizenship, in a move interpreted as an attempt to keep them motivated rowing for Athens. On two other occasions during the war, captured enemy galley slaves were given freedom by the victors.\n\nIn Sicily, the tyrant Dionysios (ca. 432–367 BC) once set all slaves of Syracuse free to man his galleys, employing thus freedmen, but otherwise relied on citizens and foreigners as oarsmen.\n\nSlaves accompanying officers and hoplite marines as personal attendants into war are assumed by modern scholars to have also assisted in the rowing when need arose, but there is no definite proof on this point, and they should not be regarded as regular members of the crew. When travelling over the sea on personal matters, it was common that both master and slave pulled the oar.\n\nIn Roman times, reliance on rowers of free status continued. Slaves were usually not put at the oars, except in times of pressing manpower demands or extreme emergency. \n\nThus, in the drawn-out Second Punic War with Carthage, both navies are known to have resorted to slave labour. In the aftermath of Cannae, a levy of slaves was equipped and trained by private Roman individuals for Titus Otacilius’ squadron in Sicily (214 BC). After the capture of New Carthage five years later, local slaves were impressed by Scipio in his fleet on the promise of freedom after the war to those who showed good will as rowers. At the end of the war, Carthage, alarmed over the impending invasion by Scipio, bought five thousand slaves to row its fleet (205 BC). It has been suggested that the introduction of polyremes at the time, particularly of the quinquereme, facilitated the use of little-trained labour, as these warships only needed a skilled man for the position nearest the loom, while the remaining rowers at the oar followed his lead.\n\nNonetheless, the Romans seemed to avoid the use of slave rowers in their subsequent wars with the Hellenistic east. Livy records that naval levies in the War against Antiochos consisted of freedmen and colonists (191 BC), while in the Third Macedonian War (171 BC–168 BC) Rome’s fleet was manned by freedmen with Roman citizenship and allies. In the final showdown of the civil war between Octavian and Sextus Pompey, the adversaries enlisted among others slaves, but set them free before putting them to the oars, indicating that the prospect of freedom was judged instrumental in keeping the rowers motivated. In Imperial times, provincials who were free men became the mainstay of the Roman rowing force.\n\nOnly in the Late Middle Ages did slaves begin to be increasingly employed as rowers. It also became the custom among the Mediterranean powers to sentence condemned criminals to row in the war-galleys of the state (initially only in time of war). Traces of this practice appear in France as early as 1532, but the first legislative enactment comes in the \"Ordonnance d'Orléans\" of 1561. In 1564 Charles IX of France forbade the sentencing of prisoners to the galleys for fewer than ten years. A brand of the letters \"GAL\" identified the condemned galley-slaves.\n\nNaval forces from both Christian and Muslim countries often turned prisoners of war into galley-slaves. Thus, at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, 12,000 Christian galley slaves were freed from the Ottoman Turks.\n\nThe Knights Hospitallers made use of galley slaves and debtors () to row their galleys during their rule over the Maltese Islands.\n\nIn 1622, Saint Vincent de Paul, as a former slave himself (in Tunis), became chaplain to the galleys, and ministered to the galley slaves.\n\nIn 1687 the governor of New France, Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville, seized, chained, and shipped 50 Iroquois chiefs from Fort Frontenac to Marseille, France, to be used as galley slaves.\n\nKing Louis XIV of France, who wanted a bigger fleet, ordered that the courts should sentence men to the galleys as often as possible, even in times of peace; he even sought to transform the death penalty to sentencing to the galleys for life (and unofficially did so - a letter exists to all French judges, that they should, if possible, sentence men to life in the galleys instead of death).\n\nBy the end of the reign of Louis XIV in 1715 the use of the galley for war purposes had practically ceased, but the French Navy did not incorporate the corps of the galleys until 1748. From the reign of Henry IV, Toulon functioned as a naval military port, Marseille having become a merchant port, and served as the headquarters of the galleys and of the convict rowers (\"galériens\"). After the incorporation of the galleys, the system sent the majority of these latter to Toulon, the others to Rochefort and to Brest, where they worked in the arsenal. \n\nConvict rowers also went to a large number of other French and non-French cities: Nice, Le Havre, Nîmes, Lorient, Cherbourg, Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, La Spezia, Antwerp and Civitavecchia; but Toulon, Brest and Rochefort predominated. At Toulon the convicts remained (in chains) on the galleys, which were moored as hulks in the harbour. Their shore prisons had the name \"bagnes\" (\"baths\"), a name given to such penal establishments first by the Italians (\"bagno\"), and allegedly deriving from the prison at Constantinople situated close by or attached to the great baths there. \n\nAll French convicts continued to use the name \"galérien\" even after galleys went out of use; only after the French Revolution did the new authorities officially change the hated name — with all it signified — to \"forçat\" (\"forced\"). The use of the term \"galérien\" nevertheless continued until 1873, when the last \"bagne\" in France (as opposed to the bagnes relocated to French Guiana), the bagne of Toulon, closed definitively. In Spain, the word \"galeote\" continued in use as late as the early 19th century for a criminal condemned to penal servitude. In Italian the word \"galera\" is still in use for a prison.\n\nA vivid account of the life of galley-slaves in France appears in Jean Marteilhes's \"Memoirs of a Protestant\", translated by Oliver Goldsmith, which describes the experiences of one of the Huguenots who suffered after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.\n\nMadame de Sevigne, a revered French author, wrote from Paris on April 10, 1671 (Letter VII): \"I went to walk at Vincennes, en Troche* and by the way met with a string of galley-slaves ; \nthey were going to Marseilles, and will be there in about a \nmonth. Nothing could have been surer than this mode of \nconveyance, but another thought came into my head, which \nwas to go with them myself. There was one Duval among \nthem, who appeared to be a conversible man. You will see \nthem when they come in, and I suppose you would have \nbeen agreeably surprised to have seen me in the midst of \nthe crowd of women that accompany them.\" \n\nGalley-slaves lived in unsavoury conditions, so even though some sentences prescribed a restricted number of years, most rowers would eventually die, even if they survived the conditions, shipwreck and slaughter or torture at the hands of enemies or of pirates. Additionally, nobody ensured that prisoners were freed after completing their sentences. As a result, imprisonment for 10 years could in reality mean imprisonment for life because nobody except the prisoner would either notice or care.\n\nThe Barbary pirates of the 16th to 19th centuries used galley slaves, often captured Europeans from Italy or Spain. The Ottoman Sultan in Istanbul used galley slaves also.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, from the mid-18th to the late-19th centuries, the \"lanong\" and \"garay\" warships of the Iranun and Banguingui pirates were crewed entirely with male galley slaves captured from previous raids. Conditions were brutal and it was not uncommon for galley slaves to die on voyages from exhaustion. Slaves were kept bound to their stations and were fed poorly. Slaves who mistimed their strokes were caned by overseers. Most of the slaves were Tagalogs, Visayans, and \"Malays\" (including Bugis, Mandarese, Iban, and Makassar). There were also occasional European and Chinese captives.\n\nA short account of his 10 years as a galley-slave is given by the character Farrabesche in \"The Village Rector\" by Honoré de Balzac. He is sentenced to the galleys as a result of his life as a \"chauffeur\" (in this case the word refers to a brigand who threatened landowners by roasting them).\n\nIn one of his ill-fated adventures, Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote frees a row of prisoners sent to the galleys, including Ginés de Pasamonte. The prisoners, however, beat him. (Cervantes himself had been captured in 1575 and served as a galley slave in Algiers for five years before he was ransomed.)\n\nIn The Sea Hawk, a 1919 novel of historical fiction by Rafael Sabatini, as well as the 1924 film based on the novel, the protagonist, Sir Oliver Tressilian, is sold into galley slavery by a relative. In the 1940 film of the same name (but with an entirely different plot), the protagonist, Sir Geoffery Thorpe, played by Errol Flynn, is captured by Spanish military personnel and receives a life sentence as a galley slave. The sets in the 1940 film appear historically accurate.\n\nLew Wallace's is sent to the galleys as a murderer but manages to survive a shipwreck and save the fleet leader, who frees and adopts him. Both films based on the novel depict the historically inaccurate Roman galley slaves.\n\nIn the 1943 novel The Long Ships the protagonist Orm Tostesson is captured while raiding in Andalusia and serves as a galley slave for a number of years. \n\nThe 1947 French film \"Monsieur Vincent\" shows Saint Vincent de Paul taking the place of a weakened slave at his oar.\n\nSteven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa novel \"Arms of Nemesis\" contains an appalling description of the conditions under which galley slaves lived and worked, assuming that they existed.\n\nC. S. Forester wrote of an encounter with Spanish galleys in \"Mr. Midshipman Hornblower\" when the becalmed British fleet is attacked off Gibraltar by galleys. The author writes of the stench emanating from these galleys due to each carrying two hundred condemned prisoners chained permanently to the rowing benches.\n\nPatrick O'Brian wrote of encounters with galleys in the Mediterranean in \"Master and Commander\" emphasising the galley's speed and manoeuvrability compared to sailing ships when there was little wind. \n\nIn Victor Hugo's \"Les Miserables\", Jean Valjean was a galley prisoner, and was in danger of returning to the galleys. Police inspector Javert's father was also a galley prisoner.\n\nRobert E. Howard transplanted the institute of galley slavery to his mythical Hyborian Age, depicting Conan the Barbarian as organizing a rebellion of galley slaves who kill the crew, take over the ship and make him their captain in one novel (Conan the Conqueror).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39762593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39762593", "title": "Granulation (jewellery)", "text": "Granulation (jewellery)\n\nGranulation is a jewellery manufacturing technique whereby a surface is covered in spherules or granules of precious metal. The technique is thought to have its origins in Sumer about 5,000 years ago. In the first millennium B.C. the technique was used by Etruscans living in present-day Italy. Greek craftsmen also employed the technique, but it was the work coming from Etruria which became famous, in part due to the mysteries surrounding the process. \n\nThere are three basic techniques that may be used to attach granules to a metal surface: hard soldering, fusing and colloidal soldering. The metals used in granulation are usually gold and/or silver alloys of high purity - alloys below 18 kt. gold and sterling silver being unsuitable. With each technique the process begins with the making of the granules themselves. The granules are usually made from the same material as the base to which they will be affixed. Very narrow fringes may be cut along the edge of a thin sheet of metal, a further cut producing small squares or rectangles of metal. After being melted into globules, these may be sorted into various sizes by the use of appropriate meshes. Another option is to use thin wire coiled around a mandrel, the coil then being cut into small rings - this creates even-sized granules when melted. \n\nHard soldering metal items together exploits the capillary action of solder with a lower melting point flowing between the items to be bonded. Soldering is routinely used by bench jewellers and is an ancient technique, but is applied with great difficulty to small metal grains. Extremely small pieces of solder are positioned close to the point of contact between the granule and the metal, and then heated to melting point. The necessity of repeating this process many hundreds of times renders the technique impractical and expensive, complicated by the possibility of dislodging granules already attached. An improvement to this method is filing the solder to powder size and mixing it with the flux. The work area is painted with tragacanth and the granules are bedded on this using a fine brush. Having dried, the work is sprinkled with the flux-solder powder and heated to melting point. Surplus solder will lodge in the gaps between the granules, an effect which cannot be avoided.\n\nFusing joins metals composed of the same alloy by the use of heat alone. A sheet of metal of thickness near the diameter of the granules ensures an even heat distribution. The granules are positioned using a diluted flux and fine brush, after which the sheet is fired in a reducing oven. At melting temperature the granules and sheet metal fuse, leaving no flux or solder. This technique was used by the Etruscans in the first millennium B.C. Modern techniques achieve fusing by using electric current and the process is known as fusion welding. The electric current passes through each granule, generating sufficient heat to weld the granules to the base. This method may be used on finished items, even those with set stones. \n\nColloidal or eutectic soldering was used by the Etruscans, and employs a colloidal mixture of tragacanth gum and copper salts. The mixture lowers the melting points of both granules and base, and causes the copper to diffuse into both at the point of contact, creating a strong metallic bond. The colloidal solder is painted onto the surface of the base, and the granules arranged on the wet solder using a fine brush, after which the piece is left to dry. It is then fired in a reducing kiln causing the tragacanth to burn off and release the copper salt.

They are also referred to as the Hanoid languages by Lama (2012) and as the Akoid languages by Bradley (2007).\n\nApproximately 1.5 million people speak these languages, mainly in China, Laos, Burma (Myanmar), and Vietnam; more than 90% of the speakers of these languages live in China. Various ethnicities that use Hani languages are grouped into a single class recognized nationality named \"Hani\" after the largest subgroup. In China, the languages of this group—which include Hani proper, Akha, and Hao-Bai (Honi and Baihong)—are considered dialects (). Western scholars, however, have traditionally classified them as separate languages.\n\nIn China, Akha and other related languages are considered to be derivatives of Hani. They are not mutually intelligible, which means that speakers of one language do not necessarily understand speakers of the other language. In 2007, according to Ethnologue, there were almost 1.5 million speakers of all Hani varieties. Slightly more than half (760,000) of these speakers can speak Hani properly (considering age etc.).\nLama (2012) groups the principal varieties of the Hani languages identified by Bradley (2007) as follows: Yunnan locations and speaker populations are from \"Haniyu Jianzhi\" 哈尼语简志 according to information from 1986. \n\nDavid Bradley (2007) considers the Hani-Akha (Ha-Ya) and Haoni-Baihong (Hao-Bai) languages to be part of an \"Akoid\" subgroup.\n\nIn China, all of the Bi-Ka languages () are considered to form a single Hani dialect cluster ( \"fangyan\"), and the speakers are officially classified as ethnic Hani (\"Haniyu Jianzhi\" 哈尼语简志 1986). Recognized dialects include Biyue 碧约 (autonym: \"bi31 jɔ31\"), Kaduo 卡多, and Enu 峨努. In Yunnan, China, they are spoken in Mojiang, Jiangcheng, Jingdong, and other counties, with a total of 370,000 speakers. The representative dialect is that of Caiyuan 菜园, Mojiang County.\n\nOther Hani varieties include Luomian 罗缅, Guozuo 果作, Gehuo 格活, and Guohe 郭合 (Tang 2011).\n\nThe \"Yunnan Provincial Gazetteer\" (云南省志：少数民族语言文字志, p. 113) classifies the Hani languages as follows. Additional dialects and datapoints from Zhang (1998) and Tang (2011) are also included.\n\n\nIn China, Hani languages are spoken mostly in areas east of the Mekong River in the south-central Yunnan province, concentrated in the Pu'er and Honghe prefectures as well as in parts of other surrounding prefectures. Hani is also spoken in Lai Châu Province of northwestern Vietnam, northern Laos, and Shan State of northeastern Burma.\n\nEdmondson (2002) reports that the Hani of Vietnam is distributed in 2 provinces of northwestern Vietnam. The earliest Hani pioneers to Vietnam probably numbered around 5 to 6 families, and arrived in Mường Tè District from Jinping County and Lüchun County in Yunnan about 325 years ago. The Hani of Phong Thổ District and Bát Xát District arrived later, about 175 years ago from Yunnan. The Hani of Vietnam claim to be able to communicate in the Hani language with ethnic Hani from different areas of Vietnam despite significant geographical barriers. Edmondson (2002), however, reported different Hani speech varieties in various parts of northwestern Vietnam, which differ mostly lexically.\n\n\nTang Mingsheng (2011, ed.) contains word lists and ethnographies of Hani subgroups. There are 12 books in the \"Regional Culture Investigation of International Hani/Aka\" (国际哈尼/阿卡区域文化调查) series edited by Tang.\n\n\n"}

ICU is widely portable to many operating systems and environments. It gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C, C++, and Java software. The ICU project is sponsored, supported, and used by IBM and many other companies.\n\nICU provides the following services: Unicode text handling, full character properties, and character set conversions; Unicode regular expressions; full Unicode sets; character, word, and line boundaries; language sensitive collation and searching; normalization, upper and lowercase conversion, and script transliterations; comprehensive locale data and resource bundle architecture via the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR); multi-calendar and time zones; and rule-based formatting and parsing of dates, times, numbers, currencies, and messages. ICU provided complex text layout service for Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, and Thai historically, but that was deprecated in version 54, and was completely removed in version 58 in favor of HarfBuzz.\n\nICU provides more extensive internationalization facilities than the standard libraries for C and C++. ICU 62 supports Unicode 11.0, and older versions supports Unicode 10.0, but not for older platforms such as Windows XP, Windows Vista, AIX, Solaris, or z/OS.\n\nICU has historically used UTF-16, and still does only for Java; while for C/C++ UTF-8 is supported, including the correct handling of \"illegal UTF-8\".\n\nAfter Taligent became part of IBM in early 1996, Sun Microsystems decided that the new Java language should have better support for internationalization. Since Taligent had experience with such technologies and were close geographically, their Text and International group were asked to contribute the international classes to the Java Development Kit as part of the JDK 1.1 internationalization APIs. A large portion of this code still exists in the and packages. Further internationalization features were added with each later release of Java.\n\nThe Java internationalization classes were then ported to C++ and C as part of a library known as ICU4C (\"ICU for C\"). The ICU project also provides ICU4J (\"ICU for Java\"), which adds features not present in the standard Java libraries. ICU4C and ICU4J are very similar, though not identical; for example, ICU4C includes a Regular Expression API, while ICU4J does not. Both frameworks have been enhanced over time to support new facilities and new features of Unicode and Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR).\n\nICU was released as an open source project in 1999 under the name IBM Classes for Unicode. It was later renamed to International Components For Unicode. In May, 2016, the ICU project joined the Unicode consortium as technical committee \"ICU-TC\", and the library sources are now distributed under the Unicode license.\n\n\n"}

He and Solomon Mikhoels traveled to the United States in 1943 in a well-documented fund-raising trip.\n\nIn 1948, after the assassination of the JAC Chairman Solomon Mikhoels, Feffer, along with other JAC members, was arrested and accused of treason. Feffer had been an informer for the NKVD (predecessor of the KGB) since 1943. Feffer reportedly cooperated with the investigation, providing false information that would lead to the arrest and indictment of over a hundred people, but at the trial, he made openly nationalistic statements and expressed pride in his Jewish identity. Feffer had also allegedly been one of the \"most loyal and conformist Yiddish poets\", who had helped to enforce strict ideological control over other Yiddish writers, and had a history of denouncing colleagues for their \"nationalistic hysteria\". However, in 1952, Feffer, along with other defendants, was tried at a closed JAC trial, and executed on August 12, 1952, at Lubyanka prison.\n\nFeffer was rehabilitated posthumously in 1955, after Stalin's death.\n\nThe American concert singer and actor Paul Robeson met Feffer on July 8, 1943, in New York during a Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee event chaired by Albert Einstein, one of the largest pro-Soviet rallies ever held in the United States. After the rally, Paul Robeson and his wife Eslanda Robeson, befriended Feffer and Mikhoels.\n\nSix years later, in June 1949, during the 150th anniversary celebration of the birth of Alexander Pushkin, Robeson visited the Soviet Union to sing in concert. According to David Horowitz,\n\nDuring his concert in Tchaikovsky Hall on June 14 - which was broadcast across the entire country - Robeson publicly paid tribute to Feffer and the late Mikhoels, singing the Vilna Partisan song \"Zog Nit Keynmol\" in both Russian and Yiddish. Recordings of the concert survived, but Robeson's spoken words are lost.\n\nFeffer was a prolific poet who wrote almost exclusively in Yiddish, and his poems were widely translated into Russian and Ukrainian. He is considered one of the greatest Soviet poets in the Yiddish language and his poems were widely admired inside and outside Russia.\n\nHis epic poem (\"The Shadows of the Warsaw Ghetto\" is a tribute to the 750 Jews who rebelled against the Nazi liquidation of the ghetto and gave their lives fighting tyranny during World War II.\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to Spanish, Quechua and Aymara, there are many Amazonian languages such as Urarina, Aguaruna and Peruvian Sign Language.\n\nIn Peru, the most common language is Spanish, which is spoken by the majority of Peruvians (85.92% of the total population). Spanish is predominant in the media and in government.\n\n\nThe only aboriginal Andean languages in use in the highlands today are those of the Aymara families (the latter including Jaqaru/Kawki). The Amazon region, however, is home to a wide range of family languages.\n\nThere are currently fourteen defined language families in Peruvian territory, in addition to many more isolated and unclassified languages, such as Urarina.\n\nIt is known that the number of languages that were used in Peru easily surpasses 300; some observers speak of 700. Yet from the time of European conquest, epidemics and periods of forced work (in addition to the influence of the hegemonic Spanish language), fewer than 150 can be counted today. The following is an incomplete list of languages spoken today, and a number that became extinct in the twentieth century or that are endangered.\n\nThe aboriginal languages of Peru are spoken mainly in the central Andes and in the Amazon forests. A considerable number of languages were once spoken on the northern coast and in the northern Andes, but other than some in the northern highlands (Cajamarca, Inkawasi-Cañaris and Chachapoyas), all others have died out - Mochica is thought to have gone extinct in the 1950s.\n\nIn the Peruvian Amazon over forty languages, which are usually grouped into 14 families and diversifying about 120 recognizable local varieties are spoken.\n\nIn addition to the above, in Peru there is a large community of immigrants, some of whom maintain their native languages. These include the Japanese and the Chinese (Cantonese dialect), and in smaller numbers, the Germans (central Andes), Italian, the Arabic speakers, and the Urdu speakers. The last two are products of the recent wave of immigrants from Palestine and Pakistan.

This language is most closely related to Northern Sotho (\"Sesotho sa Leboa\"), Tswana (\"Setswana\"), Kgalagari (\"SheKgalagari\") and Sotho (\"Sesotho\"/Southern Sotho). Lozi and its dialects are spoken and understood by approximately six percent of the population of Zambia. \"Silozi\" is the endonym (the name of the language used by its native speakers) as defined by the United Nations. \"Lozi\" is the exonym.\n\nThe Lozi language developed from a mixture of two languages: Luyana and Kololo. The Luyana people originally migrated south from the Kingdom of Luba and Kingdom of Lunda in the Katanga area of the Congo River basin, either late in the 17th century or early in the 18th century. The language they spoke, therefore, was closely related to Luba and Lunda. They settled on the floodplains of the upper Zambezi in what is now western Zambia and developed a kingdom, Barotseland, and also gave their name to the Barotse Floodplain or \"Bulozi\".\n\nThe Kololo were a Sotho people who used to live in what is now Lesotho. The Kololo were forced to flee from Shaka Zulu's Mfecane during the 1830s. Using tactics they had copied from the Zulu armies, the Kololo conquered the Luyana on the Zambezi floodplains and imposed their rule and language. However, by 1864 the indigenous population revolted and overthrew the Kololo. By that time, the Luyana language had been largely forgotten; the new hybrid language is called Lozi or Silozi and is closer to Sesotho than to any other neighbouring languages in Zambia.\n\nLozi is also spoken in Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia (Zambezi Region).\n\nLozi uses the Latin script, which was introduced by missionaries.

{"id": "158169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158169", "title": "Malaysian English", "text": "Malaysian English\n\nMalaysian English (MyE), formally known as Malaysian Standard English (MySE), is a form of English used and spoken in Malaysia. While Malaysian English can encompass a range of English spoken in Malaysia, some consider to be it distinct from the colloquial form commonly called Manglish. According to the English Proficiency Index, the average level of English in Malaysia is B1 on the CEFR scale. Due to the lack of use of English and the lack of English medium schools (which were phased out after the 1969 race riots) to accommodate English speakers, the language has been in decline since the 1970s.\n\nMalaysian English may be categorized into three levels: the acrolect, mesolect and basilect. The acrolect is used by those with near-native level of proficiency in English, and only a relatively small percentage of Malaysians are fluent in it. The acrolect is internationally intelligible, and it is used for official purposes or formal occasions and written communications. It conforms to standard British English, but some words that are specific to Malaysia may be used.\n\nThe mesolect is a localised form of English that is used by competent speakers of English or as an informal medium of communication between different ethnic groups of Malaysia. It may use some colloquial terms, and its grammar and syntax may show some deviations from standard English.\n\nThe basilect is used very informally by those with limited proficiency and vocabulary in English, and it has features of an extended pidgin or creole with syntax that deviates substantially from Standard English. The basilect may be hard to understand internationally, and it is often referred to as Manglish.\n\nAs with other similar situations, a continuum exists between these three varieties, and speakers may code-switch between them, depending on context. Most professionals and other English-educated Malaysians speak mesolect English informally between themselves, but they may also use a basilect depending on the circumstances. All three varieties may be seen as part of Malaysian English, but some prefer to see Malaysia English as a form distinct from the basilect Manglish, which tends to ignore English grammar, while others may see the basilect as the \"real\" Malaysian English. There is also no consensus on what Standard Malaysian English would be. Some regard the mesolect as substandard and a local dialect.\n\nManglish refers to the colloquial, informal spoken form of pidgin English in Malaysia that some considered to be distinct from more \"correct\" forms of Malaysian English. It exists in a wide variety of forms and primarily as a spoken form of English. It is the most common form of spoken English on the street, but it is discouraged in schools, where only Malaysian Standard English is taught. Its lexis is strongly influenced by local languages, with many non-English nouns and verbs commonly used, and it is significantly different grammatically from Standard English. There are colloquialisms in English that are not common outside of Malaysia, which are also used colloquially as substitutes in other languages in Malaysia. In Manglish, Malay or Chinese grammatical structure may be used with English words, which is often done quite spontaneously, sometimes for comic effect.\n\nSince Malaysian English originates from British English when the British Empire ruled what is now Malaysia, it shares many of the features of British English. However, it also has components of American English, Malay, Chinese, Indian languages, and other languages in its vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.\n\nMalaysia English shows a tendency towards simplification in its pronunciation and grammar, a feature also found in other new Englishes. For example, in pronunciation, diphthongs tend to become monophthongs in Malaysian English, stops may be used instead of dental fricatives and the final consonant clusters often become simplified. There are 6 short monophthongs in Malaysian English, compared to 7 in British English, and long and short vowels tend to have the same length (for example, \"beat\" and \"bit\" are homophones in Malaysian English). There are, however, slight differences in pronunciation in the states in the central and southern parts of the Malay Peninsula from those in the north and the east of Malaysia. There are also some variations in its vocabulary.\n\n\nThe grammar in Malaysian English may become simplified in the mesolectal and basilectal varieties. For example, articles and past-tense markers may sometimes be omitted, question structures may be simplified, and the distinction between countable and mass nouns may be blurred. In the basilectal variety, omission of the object pronoun or the subject pronoun is common. The modal auxiliary system is also often reduced, and sometimes, a verb may be absent. The colloquial form often has Malay or Chinese grammatical structure.\n\nParticles are commonly used in colloquial Malaysian English, a notable one being an enclitic \"lah\" used at the end of a sentence.\n\nIn the acrolect, which is internationally comprehensible, non-English terms are still used, typically words for which there is no direct equivalence in English or those that express local reality; for example, \"bumiputera\", \"kampong\", as well as titles such as Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Tunku. Words from the Chinese or Indian languages may also be used, such as \"ang pow\" or \"dhoti\". In the mesolect, local words and phrases for which there are English equivalents may also used like \"tidak apa\" or \"ulu\". In the basilect, the use of local terms may be extensive even if most words used are English, and local expressions or exclamations such as \"alamak\" often form part of the speech.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Malaysian English was similar to British English but spoken with a Malaysian accent. However, in the postcolonial era (since 1957), the influx of American TV programmes has influenced the usage of Malaysian English. There is no official language board, council or organization to ensure the correct and standard usage of Malaysian English because after independence, Malay replaced English as the official language. The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate continues, however, to set and mark the GCE O-Level English Language \"1119\" paper, which is a compulsory subject for the Malaysian Certificate of Education (the English Language paper set by the Malaysian Ministry of Education is the same as the English Language \"1119\" paper for GCE O-Level).\n\nTo a large extent, Malaysian English is descended from British English, largely because of the country's colonisation by Britain from the 18th century. However, influence from American mass media, particularly in the form of television programmes and films has made most Malaysians to be familiar with many American English words. For instance, both \"lift/elevator\" and \"lorry/truck\" are understood, but the British form is preferred. Only in some very limited cases the American English form more widespread: \"chips\" instead of \"crisps\", \"fries\" instead of \"chips\" and \"diaper\" instead of \"nappy\".\n\nSome words and phrases used in Malaysia have different meanings than in British or American English.\n\nMalaysian English has its own vocabulary, which comes from a variety of influences. Typically, for words or phrases that are based on other English words, the Malaysian English speaker may be unaware that the word or phrase is not used in British or American English. Such words are also present in the vocabulary of some continuums of Singapore Standard English.\n\nMany words of Malay origin have made it into the standard form of Malaysian English used in the media, literature and formal speech. For example, Menteri Besar (Malay for Chief Minister) even has a plural form in English - Menteri\"s\" Besar.\n\nSyntactical differences are few although in colloquial speech 'shall' and 'ought' are wanting, 'must' is marginal for obligation and 'may' is rare. Many syntactical features of Malaysian English are found in other forms of English such as British English and North American English:\n\n\nOfficially, Malaysian English uses the same pronunciation system as British English. However, most Malaysians speak with a distinctive accent that has recently evolved to become more American by the influx of American TV programmes, the large number of Malaysians pursuing higher education in the United States, and by the large number of English-speaking Malaysians in cities employed in American companies. For example, that increased the emphasis on \"r\" in words such as \"refer\" and \"world\".\n\nEven though Malaysian English is not the official language of Malaysia, it is still used among Malaysians in business. About 80% of urban businesses in Malaysia conduct their transactions in English (both Malaysian English and Manglish). However, American English has quite a strong foothold in international businesses in Malaysia. Malaysian English is also widely used in advertising sectors, especially commercial advertisements aired in private TV stations, primarily Media Prima TV stations. Plus, Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian people have tendencies to speak in English instead of Malay when they are interviewed on television. In terms of education, private universities and colleges in Malaysia mostly use Malaysian English for their identities. Most of Malaysian companies and organizations have adopt their legal name in English instead of Malay to keeping up with modernization in recent years.\n\nIn music industry, singers such as Siti Nurhaliza, Yuna and Reshmonu also performs songs in English. There are several English newspapers in Malaysia namely The Star, The Sun, New Straits Times and Malay Mail. There are also many English radio stations such as Hitz.fm, Mix FM, LiteFM, Fly fm, Traxx FM and Red FM. However, Malaysia does not have any television station which broadcasts purely in English. The Government National Language policy requires local TV stations to air at least 25% Malaysian-made programmes (either Malay or English). Some privately owned TV stations (such as TV3, NTV7, 8TV and Astro Hitz.TV) do air some English Malaysian-made programmes. A few Malaysian-made TV programmes in Malay carry English subtitles and vice versa.\n\n\n"}

Melodramas are typically set in the private sphere of the home, and focus on morality and family issues, love, and marriage, often with challenges from an outside source, such as a \"temptress”, an aristocratic villain.\n\nIn scholarly and historical musical contexts, \"melodramas\" are Victorian dramas in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action. The term is now also applied to stage performances without incidental music, novels, movies, and television and radio broadcasts. In modern contexts, the term \"melodrama\" is generally pejorative, as it suggests that the work in question lacks subtlety, character development, or both. By extension, language or behaviour which resembles melodrama is often called \"melodramatic\"; this use is nearly always pejorative.\n\nThe term originated from the early 19th-century French word \"mélodrame.\" It is derived from Greek \"μέλος, melos\", \"song, strain\" (compare \"melody,\" from \"μελωδία melōdia\", \"singing, song\"), and French \"drame\", drama (from Late Latin \"drāma\", eventually deriving from classical Greek \"δράμα, drama\", theatrical plot, usually of a Greek tragedy). Melodrama originated in the 5th century BC.\n\nThe relationship of melodrama to realism is complex. The protagonists of melodramatic works may either be ordinary (and hence realistically drawn) people who are caught up in extraordinary events, or highly exaggerated and unrealistic characters. Peter Brooks writes that melodrama, in its high emotions and dramatic rhetoric, represents a \"victory over repression.\" According to Singer, late Victorian and Edwardian melodrama combined a conscious focus on realism in stage sets and props with \"anti-realism\" in character and plot. Melodrama in this period strove for \"credible accuracy in the depiction of incredible, extraordinary\" scenes. Novelist Wilkie Collins is noted for his attention to accuracy in detail (e.g. of legal matters) in his works, no matter how sensational the plot.\n\nMelodramas put most of their attention on the victim and a struggle between good and evil choices, such as a man being encouraged to leave his family by an \"evil temptress\". Other stock characters are the \"fallen woman\", the single mother, the orphan and the male who is struggling with the impacts of the modern world. The melodrama examines family and social issues in the context of a private home, with its intended audience being the female spectator; secondarily, the male viewer is able to enjoy the onscreen tensions in the home being resolved. Melodrama generally looks back at ideal, nostalgic eras, emphasizing \"forbidden longings\". \n\nMelodramas are rooted in medieval morality plays. The melodrama approach was revived in the 18th and 19th-century French romantic drama and the sentimental novels that were popular in both England and France. These dramas and novels focused on moral codes in regards to family life, love, and marriage, and they can be seen as a reflection of the issues brought up by the French Revolution, the industrial revolution and the shift to modernization. Many melodramas were about a middle-class young woman who experienced unwanted sexual advances from an aristocratic miscreant, with the sexual assault being a metaphor for class conflict. The melodrama reflected post-industrial revolution anxieties of the middle class, who were afraid of both aristocratic power brokers and the impoverished working class \"mob\". \n\nBeginning in the 18th century, melodrama was a technique of combining spoken recitation with short pieces of accompanying music. In such works, music and spoken dialogue typically alternated, although the music was sometimes also used to accompany pantomime. The earliest known examples are scenes in J. E. Eberlin's Latin school play \"Sigismundus\" (1753). The first full melodrama was Jean-Jacques Rousseau's \"Pygmalion\", the text of which was written in 1762 but was first staged in Lyon in 1770. The overture and an Andante were composed by Rousseau, but the bulk of the music was composed by Horace Coignet. A different musical setting of Rousseau's \"Pygmalion\" by Anton Schweitzer was performed in Weimar in 1772, and Goethe wrote of it approvingly in \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\". \"Pygmalion\" is a monodrama, written for one actor. Some 30 other monodramas were produced in Germany in the fourth quarter of the 18th century. When two actors have involved the term duodrama may be used. Georg Benda was particularly successful with his duodramas \"Ariadne auf Naxos\" (1775) and \"Medea\" (1778). The sensational success of Benda's melodramas led Mozart to use two long melodramatic monologues in his opera \"Zaide\" (1780). Other later, and better-known examples of the melodramatic style in operas are the grave-digging scene in Beethoven's \"Fidelio\" (1805) and the incantation scene in Weber's \"Der Freischütz\" (1821).\n\nAfter the English Restoration of Charles II in 1660, most British theatres were prohibited from performing \"serious\" drama, but were permitted to show comedy or plays with music. Charles II issued letters patent to permit only two London theatre companies to perform \"serious\" drama. These were the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and Lisle's Tennis Court in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the latter of which moved to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden in 1720 (now the Royal Opera House). The two patent theatres closed in the summer months. To fill the gap, the Theatre Royal, Haymarket became a third patent theatre in London in 1766. Further letters patent were eventually granted to one theatre in each of several other English towns and cities. To get around the restriction, other theatres presented dramas that were underscored with music and, borrowing the French term, called it melodrama. The Theatres Act 1843 finally allowed all the theatres to play drama.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the influence of opera led to musical overtures and incidental music for many plays. In 1820, Franz Schubert wrote a melodrama, \"Die Zauberharfe\" (\"The Magic Harp\"), setting music behind the play written by G. von Hofmann. It was unsuccessful, like all Schubert's theatre ventures, but the melodrama genre was at the time a popular one. In an age of underpaid musicians, many 19th-century plays in London had an orchestra in the pit. In 1826, Felix Mendelssohn wrote his well-known overture to Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and later supplied the play with incidental music.\n\nIn Verdi's \"La Traviata\", Violetta receives a letter from Alfredo's father where he writes that Alfredo now knows why she parted from him and that he forgives her (\"Teneste la promessa...\"). In her speaking voice, she intones the words of what is written, while the orchestra recapitulates the music of their first love from Act I: this is technically melodrama. In a few moments Violetta bursts into a passionate despairing aria (\"Addio, del passato\"): this is opera again.\n\nIn a similar manner, Victorians often added \"incidental music\" under the dialogue to a pre-existing play, although this style of composition was already practiced in the days of Ludwig van Beethoven (\"Egmont\") and Franz Schubert (\"Rosamunde\"). (This type of often-lavish production is now mostly limited to film (see film score) due to the cost of hiring an orchestra. Modern recording technology is producing a certain revival of the practice in theatre, but not on the former scale.) A particularly complete version of this form, Sullivan's incidental music to Tennyson's \"The Foresters\", is available online, complete with several melodramas, for instance, No. 12 found here. A few operettas exhibit melodrama in the sense of music played under spoken dialogue, for instance, Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Ruddigore\" (itself a parody of melodramas in the modern sense) has a short \"melodrame\" (reduced to dialogue alone in many productions) in the second act; Jacques Offenbach's \"Orpheus in the Underworld\" opens with a melodrama delivered by the character of \"Public Opinion\"; and other pieces from operetta and musicals may be considered melodramas, such as the \"Recit and Minuet\" in Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Sorcerer\". As an example from the American musical, several long speeches in Lerner and Loewe's \"Brigadoon\" are delivered over an accompaniment of evocative music. The technique is also frequently used in Spanish zarzuela, both in the 19th and 20th centuries, and continued also to be used as a \"special effect\" in opera, for instance Richard Strauss's \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\".\n\nIn Paris, the 19th century saw a flourishing of melodrama in the many theatres that were located on the popular Boulevard du Crime, especially in the Gaîté. All this came to an end, however, when most of these theatres were demolished during the rebuilding of Paris by Baron Haussmann in 1862.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the term melodrama had nearly exclusively narrowed down to a specific genre of salon entertainment: more or less rhythmically spoken words (often poetry) – not sung, sometimes more or less enacted, at least with some dramatic structure or plot – synchronised to an accompaniment of music (usually piano). It was looked down on as a genre for authors and composers of lesser stature (probably also the reason why virtually no realisations of the genre are still remembered). Probably also the time when the connotation of cheap overacting first became associated with the term. As a cross-over genre mixing narration and chamber music, it was eclipsed nearly overnight by a single composition: Schoenberg's \"Pierrot Lunaire\" (1912), where Sprechgesang was used instead of rhythmically spoken words, and which took a freer and more imaginative course regarding the plot prerogative.\n\nWithin the context of the Czech National Revival, the melodrama took on a specifically nationalist meaning for Czech artists, beginning roughly in the 1870s and continuing through the First Czechoslovak Republic of the interwar period. This new understanding of the melodrama stemmed primarily from such nineteenth-century scholars and critics as Otakar Hostinský, who considered the genre to be a uniquely \"Czech\" contribution to music history (based on the national origins of Georg Benda, whose melodramas had nevertheless been in German). Such sentiments provoked a large number of Czech composers to produce melodramas based on Czech romantic poetry such as the \"Kytice\" of Karel Jaromír Erben. \n\nThe romantic composer Zdeněk Fibich in particular championed the genre as a means of setting Czech declamation correctly: his melodramas \"Štědrý den\" (1874) and \"Vodník\" (1883) use rhythmic durations to specify the alignment of spoken word and accompaniment. Fibich's main achievement was \"Hippodamie\" (1888–1891), a trilogy of full-evening staged melodramas on the texts of Jaroslav Vrchlický with multiple actors and orchestra, composed in an advanced Wagnerian musical style. Josef Suk's main contributions at the turn of the century include melodramas for two stage plays by Julius Zeyer: \"Radúz a Mahulena\" (1898) and \"Pod Jabloní\" (1901), both of which had a long performance history.\n\nFollowing the examples of Fibich and Suk, many other Czech composers set melodramas as stand-alone works based on poetry of the National Revival, among them Karel Kovařovic, Otakar Ostrčil, Ladislav Vycpálek, Otakar Jeremiáš, Emil Axman, and Jan Zelinka. Vítězslav Novák included portions of melodrama in his 1923 opera \"Lucerna\", and Jaroslav Ježek composed key scenes for the stage plays of the Osvobozené divadlo as melodrama (most notably the opening prologue of the anti-Fascist farce \"Osel a stín\" (1933), delivered by the character of Dionysus in bolero rhythm). The practice of Czech melodramas tapered off after the Nazi Protectorate.\n\nThe Victorian stage melodrama featured six stock characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an aged parent, a sidekick and a servant of the aged parent engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes at the end to ensure the triumph of good over evil. Two central features were the coup de théàtre, or reversal of fortune, and the claptrap: a back-to-the-wall oration by the hero which \"forces\" the audience to applaud.\n\nEnglish melodrama evolved from the tradition of populist drama established during the Middle Ages by mystery and morality plays, under influences from Italian commedia dell'arte as well as German \"Sturm und Drang\" drama and Parisian melodrama of the post-Revolutionary period. A notable French melodramatist was Pixérécourt whose \"La Femme à deux maris\" was very popular.\n\nThe first English play to be called a melodrama or 'melodrame' was \"A Tale of Mystery\" (1802) by Thomas Holcroft. This was an example of the Gothic genre, a previous theatrical example of which was \"The Castle Spectre\" (1797) by Matthew Gregory Lewis. Other Gothic melodramas include \"The Miller and his Men\" (1813) by Isaac Pocock, \"The Woodsman's Hut\" (1814) by Samuel Arnold and \"The Broken Sword\" (1816) by William Dimond.\n\nSupplanting the Gothic, the next popular subgenre was the nautical melodrama, pioneered by Douglas Jerrold in his \"Black-Eyed Susan\" (1829). Other nautical melodramas included Jerrold's \"The Mutiny at the Nore\" (1830) and \"The Red Rover\" (1829) by Edward Fitzball (Rowell 1953). Melodramas based on urban situations became popular in the mid-nineteenth century, including \"The Streets of London\" (1864) by Dion Boucicault; and \"Lost in London\" (1867) by Watts Phillips, while prison melodrama, temperance melodrama, and imperialist melodrama also appeared – the latter typically featuring the three categories of the 'good' native, the brave but wicked native, and the treacherous native.\n\nThe sensation novels of the 1860s and 1870s not only provided fertile material for melodramatic adaptations, but are melodramatic in their own right. A notable example of this genre is \"Lady Audley's Secret\" by Elizabeth Braddon adapted, in two different versions, by George Roberts and C.H. Hazlewood. The novels of Wilkie Collins have the characteristics of melodrama, his best-known work \"The Woman in White\" being regarded by some modern critics as \"the most brilliant melodrama of the period\".\n\nThe villain is often the central character in melodrama and crime was a favourite theme. This included dramatizations of the murderous careers of Burke and Hare, Sweeney Todd (first featured in \"The String of Pearls\" (1847) by George Dibdin Pitt), the murder of Maria Marten in the Red Barn and the bizarre exploits of Spring Heeled Jack. The misfortunes of a discharged prisoner is the theme of the sensational \"The Ticket-of-Leave Man\" (1863) by Tom Taylor.\n\nEarly silent films, such as \"The Perils of Pauline\" had similar themes. Later, after silent films were superseded by the 'talkies', stage actor Tod Slaughter, at the age of 50, transferred to the screen the Victorian melodramas in which he had played a villain in his earlier theatrical career. These films, which include \"Maria Marten or Murder in the Red Barn\" (1935), \"\" (1936) and \"The Ticket of Leave Man\" (1937) are a unique record of a bygone art-form.\n\n\nClassic melodrama is less common than it used to be on television and in movies in the Western world. However, it is still widely popular in other regions, particularly in Asia and in Hispanic countries. Melodrama is one of the main genres (along with romance, comedy and fantasy) used in Latin American television dramas (telenovelas), particularly in Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil, and in Asian television dramas, particularly in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China, Pakistan, Thailand, India, Turkey and (in a fusion of the Hispanic and Asian cultures) the Philippines. Expatriate communities in the diaspora of these countries give viewership a global market.\n\nMelodrama films are a subgenre of drama films characterised by a plot that appeals to the heightened emotions of the audience. They generally depend on stereotyped character development, interaction, and highly emotional themes. Melodramatic films tend to use plots that often deal with crises of human emotion, failed romance or friendship, strained familial situations, tragedy, illness, neuroses, or emotional and physical hardship. Victims, couples, virtuous and heroic characters or suffering protagonists (usually heroines) in melodramas are presented with tremendous social pressures, threats, repression, fears, improbable events or difficulties with friends, community, work, lovers, or family. The melodramatic format allows the character to work through their difficulties or surmount the problems with resolute endurance, sacrificial acts, and steadfast bravery.\n\nFilm critics sometimes use the term pejoratively to connote an unrealistic, pathos-filled, campy tale of romance or domestic situations with stereotypical characters (often including a central female character) that would directly appeal to feminine audiences.\" Melodramas focus on family issues and the themes of duty and love. As melodramas emphasize the family unit, women are typically depicted in a subordinate, traditional role, and the woman is shown as facing self-sacrifice and repression. In melodramas, men are shown in the domestic, stereotypically female home environment; as such, to resolve the challenges presented by the story, the male must learn to negotiate this \"female\" space. Since men who are learning to operate in the domestic sphere appear \"less male...and more feminized\", this makes melodramas appealing to female viewers. Melodramas place their attention on a victim character. \n\nSince melodramas are set in the home and in a small town, it can be challenging for the filmmaker to create a sense of action given that it all takes place in one claustrophobic sphere; one way to add in more locations is through flashbacks to the past.The sense of being trapped often causes challenges for children, teen and female characters. The sense of being trapped leads to obsessions with unobtainable objects or other people, and to inner aggressiveness or \"aggressiveness by proxy\". Feminists have noted four categories of themes: those with a female patient, a maternal figures, an \"impossible love\", and the paranoid melodrama. \n\nMost film melodramas from the 1930s and 1940s, known as \"weepies\" or \"tearjerkers\", were adaptations of women's fiction, such as romance novels and historical romances. Melodramas focus on women's subjectivity and perspective and female desire; however, due to the Hay's Code, this desire could not be explicitly shown on screen from the 1930s to the late 1960s, so female desire is de-eroticized. \n\nDuring the 1940s the British Gainsborough melodramas were successful with audiences. A director of 1950s melodrama films was Douglas Sirk who worked with Rock Hudson on \"Written on the Wind\" and \"All That Heaven Allows\", both staples of the genre. Melodramas like the 1990s TV \"Moment of Truth\" movies targeted audiences of American women by portraying the effects of alcoholism, domestic violence, rape and the like. Typical of the genre is Anjelica Huston's 1999 film \"Agnes Browne\". In the 1970s, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who was very much influenced by Sirk, contributed to the genre by engaging with class in \"The Merchant of Four Seasons\" (1971) and \"Mother Küsters Goes to Heaven\" (1975), with sexual orientation in \"The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant\" (1972) and with racism, xenophobia and ageism in \"Fear Eats the Soul\" (1974). More recently, Todd Haynes has renewed the genre with his 2002 film \"Far from Heaven\" and his 2015 film \"Carol\".\n"}

July 4, 1897 as Hans Raj), was a Punjabi poet, songwriter, and novelist. His literary works in support of India's independence movement led the British to arrest him. He published novels that won him literary acclaim.\n\nNanak Singh was born to a poor Punjabi Hindu family in the Jhelum district of Pakistan as 'Hans Raj'. He later changed his name to Nanak Singh after adopting Sikhism. Although he did not receive a formal education, he started writing at an early age by writing verses on historical events. Later, Singh started to write devotional songs, encouraging Sikhs to join the Gurdwara Reform Movement. In 1918, he published his first book \"Sat guru Meh ma\", which contained hymns in praise of the Sikh Gurus. It is considered his first commercially successful literary work.\n\nOn April 13, 1919 British troops shot and killed 379 peaceful rally participants in what became known as the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre on Baisakhi (Punjabi New Year) day in Amritsar. Singh was present with two friends who were killed in the massacre. This incident impelled Singh to write \"Khomeini Visayans\" – \"Bloody Baisakhi (Punjabi New Year)\", an epic poem that mocked colonial rule. The British Government became concerned about his provocative publication and banned the book.\n\nSingh participated in India’s independence struggle by joining the Akali movement. He became the editor of Alkali papers. This was noticed by the British Government. Singh was charged with participation in unlawful political activities and was sent to Borstal Jail, Lahore. He described the savagery and oppression of the British on peaceful Sikhs during the Guru ka Bagh Mocha demonstration in his second poetry collection, \"Zakhmi Dil\". It was published in January 1923, and was banned within two weeks of publication.\n\nSingh wrote several novels during his time in jail, including over 40,000 pages in longhand Gurmukhi (Punjabi) script. \n\nHe was publicly recognized with many awards, including Punjab's highest literary award in 1960. His great historical novel, \"Ik Mian Do Talwaran\" (\"One Sheath and Two Swords\", 1959), won him India’s highest literary honor, the \"Sahitya Akademi Award\", in 1962.\n\nIn 1945 he wrote his popular novel \"Pavitara Papi\", which won him acclaim. It was translated into Hindi and other Indian languages, and into English by his grandson Navdeep Singh Suri. In 1968 the book was adapted into the successful motion picture, \"(Pavitra Paapi)\", by his admirer Balraj Sahani.\nQuoting the \"Tribune\", \"Nanak Singh was the best selling novelist in India for thirty to forty years. He wrote over 50 books including novels and collection of short stories. He made significant contributions to various literary genres. For him character was the determination of incident and incident the illustration of character. His greatest contribution to Punjabi fiction is its secularization. He depicted excerpts from contemporary life, cloaked with a veil of romantic idealism.\" \n\nIn his novel \"Chitta Lahu\" (White Blood), Singh writes, \"It seems to imply that in the lifeblood of our society, red corpuscles have disappeared.\" In 2011, Singh's grandson, Dilraj Singh Suri, translated \"Chitta Lahu\" into English (titled \"White Blood\"). Natasha Tolstoy, the granddaughter of novelist Leo Tolstoy, translated Singh's novel \"Chitta Lahu\" into Russian. She visited Nanak Singh in Amritsar to present to him the first copy of the translated novel.\n\nBooks By Nanak Singh ( Novel, Stories, Play, Translated Novel)\n\nHis centenary was celebrated in 1997. In honor of Singh, India’s Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral released a postal stamp with his image in 1998.\n"}

Sethu once said: \"His calibre to depict commoners was astonishing. With this magic, he could have written great works. However, he chose to celebrate life and did not care to write great works unlike many of his contemporaries. His lifestyle can be cited as the reason for this hindrance.\" Though he was born in a Muslim family, he never wanted to lead a religious life but wanted to live like a human being. He always described himself as a Hindu by culture, despite being born a Muslim. He liked alcohol and pork and never hesitated to admit it publicly.\nIn the 2001 Kerala assembly elections, Punathil unsuccessfully contested for Bharatiya Janata Party from Beypore constituency. He pitted against industrialist-turned-politician V. K. C. Mammed Koya of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and veteran politician M C Mayin Haji of the Indian Union Muslim League. He finished third, securing 10,934 votes. Kunjabdullah’s decision to contest on BJP ticket was a surprise for many. He later said in an interview: \"They were the first to offer me a ticket. If the Congress or the CPM had offered me a ticket first, I would have accepted it. It is my commitment to the people and not any kind of affinity towards any particular party, that inspires me.\"\n\nSuffering from various ailments during his final years, he died at Baby Memorial Hospital in Calicut on 27 October 2017, aged 77.\n\nKunjabdulla was inspired by S. K. Pottekkatt and Thakazhi. He sent his first short story \"Bhagyakuri\" (1958) to \"Mathrubhumi Illustrated Weekly\" while he was still at school, hoping to get published in the children's section. However its associate editor M. T. Vasudevan Nair chose to publish it in the general category. Kunjabdulla has called MT his only guru, both in life and writing.\n\n\"Smarakasilakal\" (Memorial Stones), published in 1977, is set in a region near Vatakara where he grew up. The novel tells the story of Khan Bahadur Pookkoya Thangal, the head of a feudal family, and the patriarchal structure at work within the family.\n\nThrough the novel \"Marunnu\" (Medicine), which narrates the story on the life of MBBS students and of a medical college, Kunjabdulla introduced to Malayalam literature the world of hospitals and doctors. \"Paralokam\" also picked up on themes of death, another novel richly informed by his own life experiences as a doctor. He was a prolific writer of short stories as well. His story \"Kshethravilakkukal\" (Temple Lights) was chosen by M. Krishnan Nair in a collection of best short stories in the language. Kunjabdulla co-authored the novel \"Navagrahangulude Thadavara\" with Sethu. They discussed it together, wrote separately and then edited it together. According to Sethu, it was a work with a difference, though born ahead of the times.\n\nThe writer in Kunjabdulla had a great affinity towards Karakkad village in Vatakara where he was born. Many of his stories were reflections of his village and the characters like Vandikkaran Kunjhan, Bappu Kanaran, Moosa Musaliyar and Sankarakurup were real life people in his village. The years he spent at Aligarh also left deep impressions on Kunjabdullah. He was known as \"Aligadhinte Kathakaran\" as he introduced Aligarh in Malayalam literature. As an MBBS student, he spent 9 years in Aligarh Muslim University (1962-1970) and during his stay at Room No. 31 at VM Hal of AMU, he would write short stories on Aligarh and publish them in Malayalam journals. His experiences in the Uttar Pradesh city helped him write some of his most widely read short stories. \"Aligadhile Tadavukaran\" (The Prisoner in Aligarh), \"Marunnu\" (Medicine), \"Aligadh Kathakal\" (Aligarh Stories) are some of the famous books on Aligarh that he wrote. \"Cycle Savairi\" (Cycle Riding), \"Jeevachavangal\" (Living Cadavers) \"MoulanaInam Khureshi\", \"Kathi\" (Knife), \"Velichaththinte Maranam\" (Death of Light) and \"Smasanathilekku Nayikkunna Njan\" (Leading by me Towards the Graveyard) are some of the most known short stories on his Aligarh days.\n\nLike Pookunjeebi in \"Smarakasilakal\" many of his female characters were strong personalities. Instead of depicting women in moodily love, he celebrated lust, passion of love and beauty through his women characters. The women characters in \"Kure Sthreekal\", \"Pranaya Kathakal\" and \"Ente Kamukimarum Mattu Kathakalum\" represented life as it is and the underlying tone was the lust.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an obligation of record, entered into before a court or magistrate duly authorized, whereby the party bound acknowledges (recognizes) that they owe a personal debt to the state. A recognizance is subject to a \"defeasance\"; that is, the obligation will be avoided if person bound does some particular act, such as appearing in court on a particular day, or keeping the peace. The concept of a recognizance exists in Scotland, Hong Kong, Canada and the United States. People who are released on their own recognizance are subject to appearing before a judge on a certain day in the near future.\n\nRecognizances are most often encountered regarding bail in criminal cases. In the United States, by filing a bail bond with the court, the defendant will usually be released from imprisonment pending a trial or appeal. If the defendant is released without bail having been set, the defendants are released \"on their own recognizance\". Release on recognizance is sometimes abbreviated as \"RoR\", \"OR\" (\"Own Recognizance\", particularly in the United States), or \"PR\" (\"Personal Recognizance\").\n\n"}

{"id": "40454263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40454263", "title": "Sexual jihad", "text": "Sexual jihad\n\nSexual jihad (, jihad al-nikah) refers to the purported practice in which Sunni women sympathetic to Salafi jihadism travel to warzones such as Syria and voluntarily offer themselves to be \"married\" to jihadist militants, often repeatedly and in temporary marriages, serving sexual comfort roles to help boost the fighters' morale.\n\nPublicity first arose in 2013, and the veracity of the practice became the subject of greater debate in September 2013 after the Interior Minister of the 98% Muslim nation of Tunisia made a public statement identifying it as a significant issue. Critics dismissed claims of \"sexual jihad\" as unfounded and political propaganda, aforementioned denial of this \"real phenomenon\" has been rejected by several media outlets as cover up and sexual jihad was declared as valid part of Wahhabi ideology by several religious clerics in their interviews to media.\n\nThe term originated from a fatwa titled \"Jihad ul Nikaah\" and attributed to Saudi Wahhabi cleric Sheikh Mohamad al-Arefe around 2013, that called for Sunni women supporters to come forward for sex jihad and boost the mujaheddin fighting the Bashar al Assad regime in Syria. Sources close to Sheikh Mohammad al-Arefe denied issuing the fatwa. Sheikh al-Arefe himself has denied allegations that he issued such a fatwa, dismissing it on his Twitter account as a \"fabrication\", and stressing that anyone who circulates or believes it is insane.\n\nAllegations of this practice are related to the Tunisian government's war effort against Al Qaida-linked terrorism in the mountainous Jebel ech Chambi region bordering Algeria. The Tunisian coalition government alleges that the practice began with Tunisian girls sympathetic to the Islamic jihad movement there, and then spread with Tunisian girls volunteering comfort to Syrian jihadis.\n\nIn April 2013, the Grand Mufti of Tunisia, Othman Battikh, claimed that Tunisian girls were visiting Syria to take part in a sexual jihad. In July 2013, President Moncef Marzouki replaced him as Mufti with Battikh alleging that he was replaced as punishment for speaking out. The Tunisian allegation is that this practice is based on the concept that \"the Law of Necessity allows forbidden things in exceptional circumstances.\" On the basis of the fatwa, it was reported in Tunisian media that young Tunisian Sunni Muslim girls traveled to Syria to comfort jihadis. At least thirteen Tunisian girls were reported to have traveled to the rebel-held north Syria for sex jihad.\n\nIn July 2013, on a Facebook page claiming to be connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, a commentator promoted \"sexual jihad\". The page has been deemed a \"hoax,\" and a senior Muslim Brotherhood supported called the page a \"smear campaign\".\n\nOn September 19, 2013, Lofti bin Jeddou, the Interior Minister of Tunisia, stated in the National Constituent Assembly that Sunni Tunisian women traveling to Syria for sex jihad were having sex with 20, 30 and even up to 100 rebels, and that some of the women had returned home pregnant. On October 6, 2013, a Tunisian official downplayed this prior claim, saying at most 15 Tunisian women traveled to Syria, though some were forced to have sex with several Islamist militants.\n\nThe Tunisian Jihadist Abu Qusay, who was interviewed by Tunisian TV after his return from Syria, confirmed that stories about \"Jihad al-Nikah\" or what is also referred to as \"sexual Jihad\" are not just a rumors but are real, as he himself had experienced it firsthand. He also confirmed the nationalities of the girls who travel to Syria to partake in this kind of Jihad. But some sources cast doubt on his story, and said he was never in Syria.\n\nAccording to several media outlets, after this supposed fatwa ISIL fighters told families to \"hand over [their] daughters for sex\". Despite Sheikh Mohamad al-Arefe's denial, the \"Daily Mirror\" reported that \"leaflets in the captured cities of Mosul and Tikrit claim the women—virgins or not—must join jihad (...) and cleanse themselves by sleeping with militants. Those that refuse to do so are violating God's will, it is claimed, and will be beaten or killed. ISIL fighters have been taking women captive in Syria since last year [2013] when a Saudi-based cleric issued a fatwa (...) telling them to.\" It has also been suggested that Sunni women from Australia, the United Kingdom and Malaysia have voluntarily joined ISIL as comfort women.\n\nIn June 2014, it was reported by the Egyptian Daily newspaper \"Al-Masry Al-Youm\" that a Kuwaiti television show \"Kuwait wa al-Nas\" had reported that activists on social media were circulating reports that the Islamist group ISIL (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) put up posters calling on the people of Mosul to bring them their unmarried girls to participate in \"jihad al-nikah\" or sex jihad. The statement was not independently verified by either \"Al-Masry Al-Youm\" or by \"Kuwait wa al-Nas\".\n\nIn December 2014, the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights announced that one member of ISIL had killed at least 150 females, including pregnant women, in Fallujah who refused to participate in sexual jihad. No images have surfaced of the massacre, and no one has been able to independently verify it.\n\nIn August 2015, a Kurdistan Democratic Party spokesman claimed that ISIL had executed 19 women who refused to participate in sexual jihad. Media also came out with reports that ISIS has been putting posters in areas captured by them in Iraq to call up on the people of Iraq to bring them their unmarried girls to participate in \"jihad al-nikah\", or sex jihad. \n\nOn October 7, 2013, the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" reported that \"sex jihad\" to Syria was \"an elaborate disinformation campaign by the Assad regime to distract international attention from its own crimes.\" Hilmi M. Zawati, an international criminal law and human rights jurist, argues that the fatwa was fabricated and widely disseminated by the Syrian regime and its allies with the aim of tarnishing and stigmatizing the jihadist rebels among the conservative community in Syria. This has been refuted by Algemeiner Journal as cover up, as many sex jihad victims cases have been reported in multiple media reports and several sex jihad volunteers have come forward to give interviews. \n\nThe Middle East Media Research Institute argued that denials of this \"real phenomenon\" by blaming it on Syrian propaganda was a result of secularist and Islamist tensions in Tunisia, and that it was declared as valid part of Wahhabi ideology by several religious clerics in their interview to Tunisia's most widely circulated independent daily, \"Al-Shurouq\". == See also ==\n"}

Dance exhibitions and variety shows designed to attract tourists replaced prostitution as the chief business of the area. Many of the dance crazes that swept America during the 1900s and 1910s originated in this section of San Francisco. The Thalia, the largest and most popular dance hall on the Pacific coast, was the birthplace of the Texas Tommy. (\"Tommy\" was a slang term for prostitute.)\n\nAround 1910, the Texas Tommy was a hit at a lowlife hot spot called Purcell's, a Negro cabaret, but it became respectable when it was danced at the upscale Fairmont Hotel, the most popular venue for ballroom dancing in San Francisco. Who invented the Texas Tommy is obscure. Most likely the signature moves of the dance were being performed by patrons at Purcell's, and some innovative visitor adapted them for the ballroom floor. Some historians say that Johnny Peters, an African American, developed the Texas Tommy some time before 1910. In any event, after sheet music for \"The Texas Tommy Swing\" was published on 1 February 1911, the Fairmont's house band frequently played the song for its patrons. It was not long before the Texas Tommy was danced on Broadway, in \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1911\", performed by Vera Maxwell, Harry Watson Jr., and the ensemble. It was also included as a number in \"Darktown Follies\", an all-black musical produced Off-Broadway in 1913. Peters and Ethel Williams, who were masters of the dance, executed it on stage, as they had done regularly at the Fairmont.\n\nSome social dance historians have argued that the Texas Tommy was the first swing dance. The argument is that it was the first social dance using the basic 8-count rhythm of swing dance to include a breakaway step from the closed position of other couple dances of the time. Ethel Williams, who helped to popularize the dance in New York in 1913, described it as a \"kick and a hop three times on each foot followed by a slide.\" The basic steps are followed by a breakaway, an open position that allowed for acrobatics, antics, improvisations, and showing off. Working from an old film of the dance, she also described it as having a basic pattern of \"a loose step, hop-kick, step, hop-kick, run, run, run, run\" and identified a \"useful variation\" of four step-kicks that \"agrees with the open and improvisational manner that the Texas Tommy was described to have in many of the written references.\"\n\nOne reviewer of the Texas Tommy number in \"Ziegfeld Follies of 1911\" described the dance in these words: \"The Texas Tommy dancers are perhaps more acrobatic than eccentric . . . the whirl which spins his partner towards the footlights with such momentum that without aid she must assuredly fly across them must be nicely adjusted so that in neither force nor direction shall she escape the restraining grasp of his hand outstretched just at the right moment to arrest her.\" A more modern writer put it in simpler terms, saying that it was \"a whirling couple dance with a momentum that nearly catapulted the female partner across the orchestra pit.\" Texas Tommy was later used to name a typical swingout dance move that was a characteristic of the Lindy Hop in the 1930s.\n\nThe \"Texas Tommy Swing\" was composed by Sid Brown, with lyrics by Val Harris, and was published by the World's Fair Publishing Company in San Francisco in January or February 1911. The sheet music cover was designed in the form of the front page of a newspaper, with the headline reading \"The Dance That Makes the Whole World Stare.\" The faux newspaper included reprints of three articles from the \"San Francisco Examiner\", headlined \"Pavlowa Endorsed Texas Tommy Swing,\" \"Mrs. Oelriches Liked Texas Tommy Swing,\" and \"The Story of the Dance,\" which is transcribed here:\nA breath from the cotton fields - the grizzly bear, the loving hug, the walk-back and the turkey-trot all blend in Texas Tommy Swing.\n\nThe Texas Tommy Swing invades the north and east like a dainty zephyr from the perfumed cotton fields of the sunny South. The rhythm of the Grizzy Bear, the inspiration of the Loving Hug, the grace of the Walk-Back and the abandon of the Turkey-Trot all belend in the harmony of the Texas Tommy Swing, which was really the parent of all the others.\n\nThe dance originated more than forty years ago among the negroes of the old Southern plantations. Every little movement has a meaning all its own to the heart truly in tune with nature. The graceful harmonies of the song and dance reflect the joyous spirit of the negro race, the care-free actions of the Dinahs and the Sams who gathered outside the cabin doors on moonlit nights and to the twang of the banjo or the scrape of the fiddle, vented the rhapsodies of mind and body in a purely natural way.\n\nHere and there a raucous discord like the squaking voice of a chicken in distress breaks in upon the frivolous melody of the theme or a plaintive note brings a reminder of the tear always so close to the laugh in the negro nature.\n\nSouthern darkies brought the dance and a suggestion of the melody to San Francisco several years ago, and there upon the Barbary Coast it was rounded into perfect harmony. It took the place by storm. Eastern people interested in dancing took it up. Stage favorites seized upon its absorbing rhapsodies.\n\nSociety men and women accepted and adopted it. Pavlowa, the Czar's favorite dancer, went into raptures over it and incorporated it in her repertoire. Leaders of the four hundred all over the country regard it as one of the sights of San Francisco and endorse it to their friends on their return.\n\nIn tangible and concrete form this inspiring, historic and dramatic song and dance is now presented to the public for the first time, in Texas Tommy Swing.\n"}
{"id": "9243084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9243084", "title": "The Farmer and the Viper", "text": "The Farmer and the Viper\n\nThe Farmer and the Viper is one of Aesop's Fables, numbered 176 in the Perry Index. It has the moral that kindness to the evil will be met by betrayal and is the source of the idiom 'to nourish a viper in one's bosom'. The fable is not to be confused with The Snake and the Farmer, which looks back to a situation when friendship was possible between the two.\n\nThe story concerns a farmer who finds a viper freezing in the snow. Taking pity on it, he picks it up and places it within his coat. The viper, revived by the warmth, bites his rescuer, who dies realizing that it is his own fault. The story is recorded in both Greek and Latin sources. In the former, the farmer dies reproaching himself \"for pitying a scoundrel,\" while in the version by Phaedrus the snake says that he bit his benefactor \"to teach the lesson not to expect a reward from the wicked.\" The latter sentiment is made the moral in Medieval versions of the fable. Odo of Cheriton's snake answers the farmer's demand for an explanation with a counter-question, \"Did you not know that there is enmity and natural antipathy between your kind and mine? Did you not know that a serpent in the bosom, a mouse in a bag and fire in a barn give their hosts an ill reward?\" In modern times the fable has been applied in the religious sphere to teach that if one participates in unrighteous activities one is not immune to harm.\n\nAesop's fable was so widespread in Classical times that allusions to it became proverbial. One of the very earliest is in a poem by the 6th century BCE Greek poet Theognis of Megara, who refers to a friend who has betrayed him as the 'chill and wily snake that I cherished in my bosom'. In the work of Cicero it appears as \"In sinu viperam habere\" (to have a snake in the breast) and in Erasmus' 16th century collection of proverbial phrases, the \"Adagia\", as \"Colubrum in sinu fovere\" (to nourish a serpent in one's bosom). The usual English form is 'to nourish a snake (or viper) in one's bosom', a phrase used by Geoffrey Chaucer (\"Merchant's Tale\", line 1786), William Shakespeare (\"Richard II\" 3.2.129–31,) John Milton (\"Samson Agonistes\", line 763) and John Dryden (\"All for Love\" 4.1.464–66), among the foremost.\n\nIn one of the fable's alternative versions, the farmer takes the snake home to revive it and is bitten there. Eustache Deschamps told it this way in a moral ballade dating from the end of the 14th century in which the repeated refrain is \"Evil for good is often the return.\" William Caxton amplified this version by having the snake threaten the farmer's wife and then strangle the farmer when he tried to intervene. In still another variation, the farmer kills the snake with an axe when it threatens his wife and children. La Fontaine tells it thus as \"Le villageois et le serpent\" (VI.13).\n\nThe Russian fabulist Ivan Krylov, who often used La Fontaine's fables for a variation of his own, adapted the story to address contemporary circumstances in his \"The Peasant & The Snake\". Written at a time when many Russian families were employing French prisoners from Napoleon I's invasion of 1812 to educate their children, he expressed his distrust of the defeated enemy. In his fable the snake seeks sanctuary in a peasant home and pleads to be taken in as a servant. The peasant replies that he cannot take the risk of endangering his family and kills the snake. \nIn Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story \"Egotism or The Bosom-Serpent\" (1843), the proverbial phrase as used in Milton's Samson Agonistes was given a new psychological twist. Sampson was alluding to cherishing the proverbial 'snake in the bosom', in this case the woman who had betrayed him. In Hawthorne's story a husband separated from his wife, but still dwelling upon her, becomes inturned and mentally unstable. The obsession that is killing him (and may even have taken physical form) vanishes once the couple are reconciled. \n\nKhushwant Singh's short story \"The Mark of Vishnu\" (1950) adapts the situation of the fable to an Eastern background. A Brahmin priest, assured in the belief that a cobra has a godly nature and will never harm others if treated courteously, is nevertheless killed by the snake when trying to heal and feed it.\n\nOscar Brown Jr. adapted the fable in the form of a poem he called \"The Snake\" and then in 1963 set it to music. The song was recorded in several popular versions in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n"}

It is spoken by two peoples, the and the . They do not intermarry, but their speech is 75% lexically similar.\n\nThe language family that Wanano belongs to is the Tucanoan family, located in northwest Amazonia (Stenzel 2004, 20). The Tukanoan family can be sub-categorized into two groups: Western Tukanoan Languages and Eastern Tucanoan Languages, Wanano belonging to the Eastern Tucanoan family (Stenzel 2004, 20). The Eastern Tukanoan group is much larger than the Western Tukanoan family with 16 languages and around 28,000 speakers, while the Western Tucanoan family has 4 languages with around 3,000 speakers (Stenzel 2004, 20).\n\nWanano/Piratapuyo belongs to the Northern branch of the Eastern Tucanoan languages, along with Tucano.\n\nThe Wanano people live in northwestern Amazonia, on the Vaupés River. The diaspora of the Wanano people is spread between Brazil and Colombia, the total population is estimated at 1560 (Stenzel 2004, 23), however the population in Brazil is estimated at 447 (Moore 2008, 41). The number of speakers is quite high, it is still the first language of most of the population. It is seen as a healthy indigenous language. (Stenzel 2004, 38).\n\nThe Jesuits were the first ones to make their way into the area that is inhabited by the Wanano people today. In the late 1700s they established their base in São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Missionary expeditions along with resettlement continued throughout the 1900s. Boarding schools were set up in larger settlements like São Gabriel and students were sent to study there (Stenzel 2004, 28). People from these missionaries would go into villages and encourage the indigenous peoples to abandon their beliefs and practice Christianity, along with speak Portuguese.\n\nThe first documentation of Wanano people came from naturalist Alfred Wallace during his 1852 expedition along the Vaupés River. (Stenzel 2004, 29). Later in 1904, a German ethnologist Theodor Kock-Grünberg conducted research in the Wanano region. He observed their interactions with other indigenous groups, including ceremonies that included dance and burial practices. (Stenzel 2004, 29). Something that has been noted by Stenzel in her research that is an important detail to include is the Wanano people are very multilingual (Stenzel 2004, 31).\n\nThe first known work on the Wanano language was a grammatical outline recorded by a Salesian missionary named Antônio Giacone in 1967 (Stenzel 2004, 14). Since then a lot of work has been conducted by Nathan and Carolyn Waltz who have worked with the SIL organization in Colombia from 1963 to 1996 (Stenzel 2004, 14). They have published a pedagogical grammar (Waltz 1976), papers on the aspects of Wanano phonology (Waltz and Waltz 1967, Waltz 1982, Waltz 2002), a volume containing a study of Wanano kinship terms, a grammatical sketch of the language and a long interlinearized text (Waltz and Waltz 1997) and the grammatical overview of Wanano found in the Caro y Cuervo collection (Waltz and Waltz 2000) (Stenzel 2004, 15). In 2007, Nathan Waltz published a Wanano – Spanish dictionary (Waltz 2007). More research has been done on the Wanano language by Dr. Kristine Stenzel who has been conducting research in the Upper Rio Negro area since 2000. She has published a book on the grammar of Kotiria (Wanano) that discusses the morphology and syntax of the language (Stenzel 2015). Along with this book she has written many articles about different aspects of the Wanano language and people (Stenzel 2005a, 2005b, 2006, 2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, 2009a, 2009b, 2009c, 2010, 2012, 2014) (Stenzel 2015).\n\nWanano was described in a language documentation project funded by Programa de Documentação de Línguas e Culturas Indígenas (ProDocLin) at the Museu do Índio. The project was coordinated by Dr. Kristine Stenzel and was a teaching workshop of Kotiria pedagogical grammar (Saltarelli 2014).\n\nDr. Kristine Stenzel has also written articles regarding anthropological aspects of the Wanano people (2010, 2013) (Stenzel 2015) as well in her 2004 dissertation where she discusses cultural aspects such as marriage and multilingualism (Stenzel 2004). Anthropologist Janet Chernela has also studied the Wanano society and published a book called “The Wanano Indians of the Brazilian Amazon” which takes a deeper look into Wanano society (Chernela 1996).\n\nNasalization is carried on vowels. Voiced plosives and may surface as the nasal consonants , , , and in the environment of nasal vowels.\n\nSyllables may be marked with either a high or low stress accent. Nasalization is suprasegmental and moves from left to right through a word.\n\nWanano is a nominative accusative language with an SOV sentence structure that contains the following grammatical categories: nouns, verbs, particles, pronouns, and interrogatives. These are outlined in Stenzel’s Reference Grammar of Wanano (2004). Under nouns Stenzel goes into further detail regarding the animates: human vs non-human animates and inanimates: mass nouns vs count nouns (xi). Stenzel discusses the pronouns which will be examined further below. For verbs Wanano have suffix morphemes that indicate evidentiality, as well as imperative, interrogative and irregular morphemes. While there are adverbial morphemes in Wanano, there are no adjectives.\n\nPronouns in Wanano are categorized by personal, possessive, interrogative and demonstrative. A like English, gender is seen in 3rd person pronouns only. The pronouns are categorized into deictic for 1st and 2nd person and anaphoric for 3rd person.\n\n(Stenzel, 2004, 161).\n\nti-ro yoa-ro-pʉ wa'a-ra\n\nANPH-SG be.long-PART-LOC go-VIS.PERF.NON.1\n\nHe went far away.\n\nyʉ phʉ-kʉ\n\n1SG parent-MASC\n\nmy father\n\n(Stenzel, 2004, 201) doa hi-hari ti-ko-ro\n\nwho INT.IMPERF ANPH-FEM-SG\n\nWho is she?\n\n(Stenzel, 2004,155-156).\n\nExamples\n\na’ri-ro\n\nDEM:PROX-SG\n\nThis man\n\nsi-ro\n\nDEM:PROX-SG\n\nThat man\n\n~o-i\n\nDEIC:PROX-LOC\n\nHere so'o-pʉ\n\nDEIC:DIST-LOC\n\nThere (distal)\n\nto-pʉ\n\nREM-LOC\n\nThere (remote)\n\npa-iro\n\nother-NOM:SG\n\nanother one \n\nGender coding of nouns is a morphological aspect discussed in the grammar of Wanano. Nouns with human referents are obligatorily marked for gender, most noun roots with human referents are masculine, otherwise feminine if marked by morpho-phonological means (Stenzel, 2004, 128). The gender coding suffix -ko that appears at the end of the noun is feminine while -kʉ is masculine, for example phʉ-ko-ro (mother) and phʉ-kʉ-ro (father) (Stenzel, 2004, 130). Sometimes these endings can be reduced to o for feminine and ʉ for masculine. Examples of this are ~ducho-ro (grandmother) and ~duchʉ-ro (grandfather) (Stenzel, 2004, 129).\n\nA mass noun is a noun that has no plural form, not meaning singular but that it is an uncountable referent. For example, you cannot count water however you can weigh it to measure its mass. By adding the morpheme –ro to the root of a mass noun or verb in Wanano, it changes into a count noun (Stenzel, 2004, 139). Some examples of this are ko (water) is turned into to ko-ro (rainstorm) with the addition of –ro. Tha (grass) is turned into tha-ro (field). (Stenzel, 2004, 139).\n\nWanano is a nominative-accusative case system, this means that the subject of the transitive and intransitive verbs are marked the same way.\n\nIntransitive verbs are verbs that require a single nominal argument. Below are some examples.\n\n1)\n\nyʉˈʉ hi-ha ko-iro\n\n1SG COP-VIS.IMPERF.1 relative-NOM:SG\n\nI am your / a relative\n\n2) dubi-a daˈra waˈa-ra wese-pʉ\n\nwoman-PL work go-VIS.IMPERF.NON.1 garden-LOC\n\nWomen go to work in the garden.\n\n3)\n\nto badu-ro pase-pʉ waˈa-a\n\n3SG.

For example, in example 1, 1SG yʉˈʉ is the same as in example 8. In example 9, the 3SG to is the same as in example 3. As well as in example 6 ANPH-SG ti is the same as in example 5.\n\nTransitive motion verbs frequently occur with adjunct expressions coded only by the locative -pʉ and there are certain motion verbs in Wanano which can be syntactically transitive. In other words, they take a second, oblique argument coded by -pʉ-re. (Stenzel, 2004, 234)\n\nExamples.\n\n1) ̴ayo ̴o-pʉ-re yʉˈʉ khoˈa-wiˈi-kʉ-ka\n\nso/then DEIC:PROX-LOC-OBJ 1SG return-COMPL-NON.3.MASC-PREDICT.\n\nThat’s how I’ll get back here.\n\n2) kuˈtu--̴ka-pʉ-re phiˈa-sʉ-ˈa\n\nclearing-DIM-LOC-OBJ MOV.out.into-COMPL-ASSERT.PERF\n\n(He) went out into a little clearing.\n\nWanano is typologically nominative-accusative, and that it codes the grammatical rather than the semantic roles of core arguments. (Stenzel, 2004, 255)\n\nThe most common plural morpheme used in Wanano is -a/ ̴da. The alternation between the two is still unclear however there is a tendency for ̴da to be used for animates with human referents, for example pho’da (children), while –a is used for other animates (Stenzel, 2004, 131). When pluralizing male or females the morphemes - ̴sʉba (male) and ̴sa ̴dubia (female) are used. Some examples of this are: dubi-a ̴bʉ-a\n\nfemale-PL male-PL\n\nfemales or women males or men yucho ̴sa ̴dubi-a ̴yuchʉ- ̴sʉba\n\ngrandmother 1EXC.POSS women-PL grandfather-PL\n\ngrandmothers grandfathers dabo ̴sa ̴dubi-a ̴badʉ- ̴sʉba\n\nwife 1EXC.POSS women-pl husband-PL\n\nWives husbands.\n\nFor pluralizing animals, since they are non-human the morpheme –a is used. There are some exceptions where –ya is used. Some examples of this are: phido-ro ̴phido-a\n\nsnake snake-PL\n\nbora-ro boraro-a\n\ncurupira curupira-PL\n\ndie-ro die-ya\n\ndog dogs\n\n(Stenzel, 2004, 134).\n\nIf you take the word for dogs, for example, die-ya, and you want to say female dogs, you add the word for women ( ̴dubia).\n\nDieya- ̴dubia\n\nFemale dogs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20783125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20783125", "title": "Yes–no question", "text": "Yes–no question\n\nIn linguistics, a yes–no question, formally known as a polar question or a general question, is a question whose expected answer is either \"yes\" or \"no\". Formally, they present an exclusive disjunction, a pair of alternatives of which only one is acceptable. In English, such questions can be formed in both positive and negative forms (e.g. \"Will you be here tomorrow?\" and \"Won't you be here tomorrow?\").\n\nYes–no questions are in contrast with non-polar wh-questions, with the five Ws, which do not necessarily present a range of alternative answers, or necessarily restrict that range to two alternatives. (Questions beginning with \"which\", for example, often presuppose a set of several alternatives, from which one is to be drawn.)\n\nYes–no questions are formed in various ways in various languages. In English, a special word order (verb–subject–object) is used to form yes–no questions. In the Greenlandic language, yes–no questions are formed with a special verb morphology. In Latin, yes–no questions are indicated by the addition of a special grammatical particle or an enclitic. In some languages, such as in Modern Greek, Portuguese, and the Jakaltek language, the \"only\" way to distinguish a yes–no question from a simple declarative statement is the rising question intonation used when saying the question. (Such questions are labelled declarative questions and are also available as an option in those languages that have other ways of asking yes–no questions.)\n\nIn Latin, the enclitic particle \"-ne\" (sometimes just \"-n\" in Old Latin) can be added to the emphatic word to turn a declarative statement into a yes–no question. It usually forms a neutral yes–no question, implying neither answer (except where the context makes it clear what the answer must be). For example:\n\nIn Esperanto, the word \"ĉu\" added to the beginning of a statement makes it a polar question.\n\nYes–no questions are also formed in Latin with \"nonne\" to imply that the interrogator thinks the answer to be the affirmative and with \"num\" to imply that the interrogator thinks the answer to be the negative. For examples:\n\nIn Chinese, yes–no questions typically take an A-not-A form. The resulting response is usually an echo response.\n\nIn many Germanic languages, yes-no questions are formed using subject inversion.\nIn Dutch:\n\nThere is an ambiguity in English as to whether certain questions actually \"are\" yes–no questions in the first place. Syntactically identical questions can be semantically different. It can be seen by considering the following ambiguous example:\nThe question could be a yes–no question or could be a choice question (also called alternative question). It could be asking the yes–no question of \"whether\" John played \"either\" of the games, to which the answer is yes or no; or it could be asking the choice question (which does not have a yes–no response) of \"which\" of the two games John played (with the presupposition that he played one or the other), to which the answer is the name of the game. Another such ambiguous question is \"Would you like an apple or an orange?\" to which the responses can be \"An apple\", \"An orange\", \"Yes\", and \"No\", depending from whether the question is seen as a choice question or a yes–no question. (The \"yes.\" answer involves a further ambiguity, discussed below.)\n\nA related ambiguity is questions with the form of yes–no questions but intended not to be. They are a class of questions that encompass \"indirect speech acts\". The question \"Can you reach the mustard?\" is an example. In form and semantics, it is a straightforward yes–no question, which can be answered either \"Yes, I can\" or \"No, I cannot\". There is, however, an indirect speech act (which Clark calls an \"elective construal\") that can optionally be inferred from the question, namely \"please pass the mustard\". Such indirect speech acts flout Grice's maxim of manner. The inference on the part of the listener is optional, one that can legitimately remain untaken.\n\nClark describes one study where a researcher telephoned fifty restaurants around Palo Alto, California, asking without embellishment the question \"Do you accept credit cards?\" The three forms of reply given were:\n\nAnother part of the same study was the question \"Do you have a price on a fifth of Jim Beam?\" Out of 100 merchants, 40 answered \"Yes\". A non-response bias forced researchers to disregard the survey question asking tobacconists \"Do you have Prince Albert?\" as although the researchers' intent was to observe whether the merchants specified that they offered the tobacco brand as packaged in a can and/or a pouch, the merchants frequently hung up the phone, presumably because they believed themselves to be the victims of a popular prank call.\n\nAccording to Grimes, the answer \"yes\" asserts a positive answer and the answer \"no\" asserts a negative answer, irrespective of the form of the question. However, simple \"yes\" or \"no\" word sentence answers to yes–no questions can be ambiguous in English. For example, a \"yes\" response to the question \"You don't beat your wife?\" could mean either \"yes, I don't beat my wife\" or \"yes, I do beat my wife\" depending from whether the respondent is replying with the truth-value of the situation or to the polarity used in the question. The ambiguity does not exist in languages that employ echo answers. In the Welsh language, for example, the response \"ydw\" (\"I am\") has no such ambiguity when it is used to reply to a question.\n\nOther languages also do not follow the custom, given by Grimes, with respect to the answers \"yes\" and \"no\". In New Guinea Pidgin, Polish and Huichol, the answer given has the logical polarity implied by the form of the question. \"Bai Renjinal i ranewe, o nogat?\", a positive form of a question translated as \"Will Reginald escape?\", is answered \"yes\" (agreement, he will escape) or \"nogat\" (disagreement, he will not escape). Phrased negatively, however, as \"Bai Rejinal i no ranewe, o nogat?\" (\"Won't Reginald escape?\") the senses of the answers take the opposite polarity to English, following instead the polarity of the question. An answer of \"yes\" is agreement that he \"will not\" escape, and a response of \"nogayt\" is disagreement, a statement that he \"will\" escape.\n\nA further ambiguity with yes–no questions, in addition to that of polarity, is the ambiguity of whether an \"exclusive\" or \"inclusive\" disjunction is meant by the word \"or\", as it can represent either. Conventionally, in English yes–no questions the \"or\" represents an exclusive disjunction. However, as with the \"Would you like an apple or an orange?\" question mentioned earlier, to which one possible answer, as a yes–no question, is \"yes.\", yes–no questions can also be taken to be \"inclusive\" disjunctions. The informativeness of the \"or\" in the question is low, especially if the second alternative in the question is \"something\" or \"things\". The \"exclusive\" and \"inclusive\" can be determined often in spoken language (the speaker will often lower their pitch at the end of an \"exclusive\" question, as opposed to raising it at the end of an \"inclusive\" question), but it is a frequent source of humour for computer scientists and others familiar with Boolean logic, who will give responses such as \"yes\" to questions such as \"Would you like chicken or roast beef for dinner?\". However, the ambiguity is not confined to humour. The apple-or-orange question may be legitimately asking whether either is wanted, for example, and \"Would you like an apple or something?\" is indeed \"expecting\" either \"yes\" or \"no\" as a proper answer rather than the answer \"Something\" that an exclusive disjunction would be requesting.\n\nThis ambiguity does not exist only in English. It exists in West Greenlandic Kalaallisut, for example. The question \"Maniitsu-mi Nuum-mi=luunniit najugaqar-pa\" (\"Does he live in Maniitsoq or Nuuk?\") is ambiguous as to whether exclusive or inclusive disjunction is meant. Commonly, this is clarified either by intonation (if the question is spoken) or the inclusion of an explicit question-word such as \"sumi\" (\"where\").\n\nYes–no questions are believed to carry some suggestibility load. For instance, in response to yes-no questions, children tend to display a compliance tendency: they comply with the structure of the question, negative or positive, by responding in the same way.\n\nFor example, if preschoolers are asked, \"Is this book big?\", they will tend to respond \"Yes, it is\". But if they are asked, \"Is this book not big?\" they are more likely to say, \"No, it is not\".\n\n\n"}
