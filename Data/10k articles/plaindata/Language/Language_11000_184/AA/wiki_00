{"id": "649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=649", "title": "Arraignment", "text": "Arraignment\n\nArraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant. In response to arraignment, the defendant is expected to enter a plea. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdiction but generally include peremptory (setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed), not guilty, guilty, the Alford (a type of guilty plea where the defendant asserts innocence but concedes that they will be found guilty, only used in the United States) and \"nolo contendere\" (or no contest).\n\nIn Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment. The judge will testify during the indictment process.\n\nIn every province in Canada except British Columbia, defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial (?). In British Columbia, arraignment takes places in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer. The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.\n\nIn France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest. However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime. The police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor (in the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent).\n\nIn Germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.\n\nAt the first appearance, the accused is read the charges and asked for a plea. The available pleas are, guilty, not guilty, and no plea. No plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea, which must be made on the second appearance.\n\nIn South Africa, arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear, the informing of the accused of the crime charged against him, the demanding of the accused whether he be guilty or not guilty, and the entering of his plea. His plea having been entered he is said to stand arraigned.\n\nIn England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment.\n\nIn England and Wales, the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than 24 hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent (or above) authorises detention for a further 12 hours (36 hours total), or a judge (who will be a magistrate) authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of 96 hours, but for terrorism-related offences people can be held by the police for up to 28 days before charge. If they are not released after being charged, they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable.\n\nThe United States has 57 court systems – one each for federal (1), state (50), commonwealth (2), territorial (3), and federal district (1) jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction establishes its own rules of criminal procedure. All 57 sets of rules must comply with certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution (e.g. the privilege against self-incrimination, prohibition of excessive bail, etc.) but otherwise are bound only by their own local constitutions and statutes.\n\nAt federal level, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that \"arraignment shall [consist of an] open...reading [of] the indictment...to the defendant...and call[] on him to plead thereto. He/she shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he/she is called upon to plead.\"\n\nFederal arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday. During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set bail. During the second arraignment, a post-indictment arraignment or PIA, the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.\n\nIn New York, most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours.\n\nIn California, arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and, in any event, within 48 hours of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays. Thus, an individual arrested without a warrant, in some cases, may be held for as long as 168 hours (7 days) without arraignment or charge. For example, both Thanksgiving Day and the day after Thanksgiving are state holidays in California. So, if someone was arrested at 9:00 am on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, the 48-hour period would not expire at 9:00 am on Thursday as it normally would, because that is a holiday; and the next day is a holiday; and the two days after that are the weekend; so the arraignment need not take place until 9:00 am on Monday morning following the arrest on the previous Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, the procedure differs for misdemenours and felonies. A defendant is allowed to enter a plea when arraigned for a misdemeanour but no plea is entered by a defendant charged with a felony. In either case, the judge explains the defendant's rights to him/her, advises of his/her right to an attorney, sets pre-release bail (except when inappropriate), and sets a date for a pre-trial conference (misdemeanour only) or pre-exam conference (felonies only, and only in some counties). Because of the Michigan Constitution's guarantee of a speedy arraignment, a least one judge in every Michigan District Court is on 24-hour call every day, including weekends and holidays, so that the arraignment can be held as soon after the arrest as possible.\n\nThe wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. However, it generally conforms with the following principles:\n\nVideo arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of videoconferencing technology. Use of video arraignment system allows the courts to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an audio-visual link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.\n\nUse of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. The transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.\n\nIf the defendant pleads guilty, an evidentiary hearing usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the mitigating factors, and the defendant's character, and passes sentence.\n\nIf the defendant pleads not guilty, a date is set for a preliminary hearing or a trial.\n\nIn the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or \"stood mute\") was subject to peine forte et dure (Law French for \"strong and hard punishment\"). Today in common-law jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea. The rationale for this is the defendant's right to silence.\n\nThis is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.\n\n"}

{"id": "3034054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3034054", "title": "Bishnupriya Manipuri language", "text": "Bishnupriya Manipuri language\n\nThe Manipuri Bishnupriya or Bishnupriya Manipuri (BPM) () is an Indo-Aryan language\nspoken in parts of the Indian states of Assam, Tripura and others, as well as in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh, Burma, and other countries. It uses the Assamese- Bengali alphabet as its writing system.\n\nBishnupriya Manipuri is spoken in parts of Assam and Tripura in India, in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh, and in several other countries. It is different from many Indo-Aryan languages like Bengali, Oriya, etc. The language originated and developed in Manipur and was originally confined to the surroundings of the Loktak Lake and is similar to the Assamese language. Other authorities such as \"An account of the valley of Manipore\" by Col. McCullock, \"Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal\" by E. T. Dalton and the \"Linguistic Survey of India\" by Dr. George A. Grierson mention that the language was in existence in Manipur before the 19th century. Dr. Grierson refers to the language as \"Bishnupuriya Manipuri\", while some other writers call it simply \"Bishnupriya\".\n\nThe language slowly started losing its ground in Manipur against a vast majority of Meiteis and is slowly facing its decay in Cachar and Bangladesh against a vast majority of Bengali-speakers. This language is still being spoken in Jiribam (a sub-division of Manipur), Cachar (a district of Assam) and in some pockets in Bangladesh and Tripura.\n\nThe language is known to its speakers as \"Imar Thar\" (), meaning \"Language of my Mother.\" They call themselves and their language \"Manipuri\", and use the term \"Bishnupriya\" to distinguish them from other ethnic groups of Manipur. The term \"Bishnupriya\" is most probably derived from \"Bishnupur\" along with the suffix \"-iya\", meaning \"people of Bishnupur\".\n\nOrthodox Bishnupriyas hold that the language was carried over to bishnupriya Manipuri by some immigrants from Dvārakā and Hastinapura just after the Mahabharata war. It is further said that these immigrants were led by Babhruvahana, the son of Chitrangada and Arjuna, the third Pandava. Some scholars and history writers came to support the Mahabharata origin of Bishnupriya Manipuri from observation of the morphology, the vocables, and the phonology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language. They hold that BPM is highly influenced by Sanskrit and Maharastri as well as Sauraseni Prakrits. Dr. KP Sinha, who has done considerable research on Bishnupriya Manipuri, disagrees with the theory and is of the opinion that the language was originated through Magadhi Prakrita. It is found from his observations that the language has retained dominant characteristics of Magadhi. According to Dr Sinha, pronouns and declensional and conjugational endings seem to be same as or closely related to those of Maithili, Oriya, Bengali. These forms of Oriya, Bengali are, on their parts, derived from Magadhi Apabhramsa coming from the Magadhi Prakrita.\n\nHowever, the Bishnupriya Manipuri language is certainly not one of the Tibeto-Burman languages, but is closer to the Indo-Aryan group of languages with remarkable influence from Meitei both grammatically and phonetically. At a different stage of development of the language the Sauraseni, Maharashtri and Magadhi languages and the Tibeto-Burman languages exerted influence on it as well. So it was probably developed from Sanskrit, Sauraseni-Maharashtri Prakrit and Magadhi Prakrita.The Sauraseni-Maharastri relation can be traced by observing some characteristics of pronouns. The Magadhi element is also remarkable, as the language retains many characteristics of Magadhi. It can further be noted that Bishnupriya Manipuri retains much of the old (15th century to 17th century A.D.) Meitei sound vocabulary, as the majority of speakers of the language left Manipur during the first part of the 19th century.\n\nBishnupriya Manipuri have two dialects, namely Rajar Gang (\"King's village\") and Madai Gang (\"Queen's village\"). Unlike the dialects of other tribes, these dialects of Bishnupriya are not confined to distinct geographical areas. In Manipur, however, these two dialects were confined to well-defined territories. From the viewpoint of phonetics, Madai Gang is more akin to Assamese and Meitei, whereas Rajar Gang is more akin to Bengali. In vocabulary Madai Gang is more influenced by Meitei and Assamese while Rajar Gang is more akin to Bengali. The morphological differences between the two dialects are negligible.\n\nLike other Indic languages, the core vocabulary of Bishnupriya Manipuri is made up of \"tadbhava\" words (i.e. words inherited over time from older Indic languages, including Sanskrit, including many historical changes in grammar and pronunciation), although thousands of \"tatsama\" words (i.e. words that were re-borrowed directly from Sanskrit with little phonetic or grammatical change) augment the vocabulary greatly. In addition, many other words were borrowed from languages spoken in the region either natively or as a colonial language, including Meitei, English, and Perso-Arabic.\n\n\nBishnupriya Manipuri retains the old eighteen sounds of Meitei. Of them, there were three vowels, such as \"ɑ\", \"i\" and \"u\", thirteen consonants such as p, t, k, pʰ, tʰ, kʰ, c͡ʃ, m, n, ŋ, l, ʃ, h and two semi vowels, such as \"w\" and \"j\". In later stage nine more sounds added to Meitei but Bishnupriya is not concerned with them, because the Bishnupriyas left Manipur during 1st part of 19th century. That is why Bishnupriya Manipuri retains the older sounds of Meitei, whereas in Meitei itself the sound system has under-gone various changes.\nThe most distinctive influence of Maitei language over Bishnupriya manipuri is formation of words starting with vowel soung 'aung' such as , , .\n\nAlthough there are numerous dissimilarities between Assamese and BPM, Dr. Suniti Kumar Chatterji, a recognized Bengali phonetician, listed the BPM language to be a dialect of Bengali, whereas Dr. Maheswer Neog and Dr. Banikanta Kakti claimed it as a dialect of indigenous Assamese. Their assumptions later caused contradiction about the origin of Bishnupriya Manipuri language. But the assumptions were proven incorrect by scientific research and observation of morphology, vocabulary and phonology of BPM.\n\nThe orthodox Bishnupriyas claim that they have their own script, that is, the Devanagari script, which was used to write in the Bishnupriya language in its early years.\n\nHowever, on introduction of modern education during the British period through the Bengali language the Bishnupriya Manipuri writers began to use the Purvanagari i.e. Assamese-Bengali script. This alphabet has consonant letters with dependent vowel signs (matras) as well as independent vowel letters. Punctuation marks and numerals are also used. Bishnupriya Manipuri is written from left to right and top to bottom, in the same manner as in English. Some of the consonants can combine with one another to make orthographic clusters (named conjuncts).\n\n\nIn Manipur the language is still spoken in the Jiribam subdivision. A large number of Bishnupriya Manipuri people settled in Assam ages ago, particularly in the districts of Cachar, Karimganj, Dullabcherra, Patherkandi and Hailakandi. These people are counted as one of the major groups of people in the Cachar and Karimganj districts. In Tripura, the Bishnupriya Manipuri population localities may be divided into a Dharmanagar sub-area, a Kailasahar sub-area, a Kamalpur sub-area and a West Tripura sub-area. In Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram, there is a scattered Bishnupriya Manipuri population.\n\nOutside of India, Bangladesh has the largest Bishnupriya Manipuri population. The main localities are Sylhet, Moulbivazar, Habiganj and the Sunamganj district. As per records, there were also a considerable number of the Bishnupriyas Manipuris living in local cities like Mymensingh, Rangamati of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and also at Tezgaon, Manipuri-para in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh.\n\nIn Burma the Bishnupriya Manipuri areas are probably Mandalay, Amarpura etc. In case of the United States of America, Canada, Germany, Middle East and Austria, there are a considerable number of Bishnupriya Manipuris settled there.\n\n\nA good stock of folk literatures of Bishnupriya Manipuri, which are older in origin, are handed down to this day through oral tradition. The ancient literature of Bishnupriya Manipuri is represented by folk stories, folk-songs, folk-poems, rhymes and proverbs. A rain-invoking song called \"Boron-dahanir Ela\" (, 1450–1600 A.D.) and a song relating to the conjugal life of Madai and Soralel known as \"Madai Soralel Ela\" (, 1500–1600 ) are sometimes considered the most important. The language of the songs are archaic and are replete with words of Tibeto-Burman origin. These two songs are very important for the study of the cultural and linguistic history of Bishnupriya Manipuri. Besides these, there are songs which are sung by women who work in the fields. Proverbs form another important part of BPM folk literature.\n\nThe Bishnupriya Manipuris have established the apex literary organization of the community Nikhil Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Parishad (1955), Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Sabha, Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Singlup, Pouri, Manipuri Theatre and many other organizations to encourage literary activities among the people. Serious literary culture of the BPM language began during the 2nd quarter of 20th century. In fact, the history of Manipuri literature began in 1925 with the literary magazine \"Jagaran\" () edited by Falguni Singha who was a Bishnupriya Social worker; this magazine published articles both in Bishnupriya and Meitei. The Manipuris of Surma valley formed their first formal association, Surma Valley Manipuri Society (later called Surma Valley Manipuri Association) in 1934. The members included the Meiteis, the Bishnupriyas and the Pangals (Manipuri Muslims). From 1933 a number of journals, e.g. \"Manipuri\" (1933), \"Mekhali\" (1938) and \"Kshatryajyoti\" (1944), fostered nationalism as well literary and cultural activities. A branch of modern BPM poetic literature, namely Vaishnava Padavali, based on Vaishnava philosophy, deserves special mention.\n\nThere is a Wikipedia in Bishnupriya Manipuri with articles as of . This makes it a little under half the size of the Bengali Wikipedia, and more than five times larger than the next-largest Eastern Nagari-script Wikipedia, Assamese.\n\n\n\n"}

The various units were historically defined in terms of the wine gallon so varied according to the definition of the gallon until the adoption of the Queen Anne wine gallon in 1707. In the United Kingdom and its colonies the units were redefined with the introduction of the imperial system whilst the Queen Anne wine gallon was adopted as the standard US liquid gallon.\n\nThe major wine producing countries use barrels extensively and have developed standards at variance with the traditional English volumes are commonly used in the wine and wine cooperage industries. Examples include a hogshead of , a barrique of (Bordeaux), a barrel of (Australia), a barrel of (Burgundy) and a puncheon of .\n\nThe tun (, , Middle Latin: \"\") is an English unit of \"liquid volume\" (not weight), used for measuring wine, oil or honey. Typically a large vat or vessel, most often holding 252 wine gallons, but occasionally other sizes (e.g. 256, 240 and 208 gallons) were also used.\n\nIn one example from 1507, a tun is defined as 240 gallons.\n\nThe butt (from the mediæval French and Italian \"botte\") or pipe was half a tun, or 1008 pints. Tradition has it that George, Duke of Clarence, the brother of Edward IV of England, was drowned in a butt of malmsey on 18 February 1478. (However, Josephine Tey in \"The Daughter of Time\" suggests that \"drowned in a butt of malmsey\" means rather that George, Duke of Clarence, drank himself to death rather than literally drowning in a container of wine.) In Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Cask of Amontillado\", the narrator claims he has received \"a pipe of what passes for Amontillado\". In Edward Bulwer-Lytton's novel \"Paul Clifford\", Lord Mauleverer states to Lawyer William Brandon \"Because he sent me, in the handsomest manner possible, a pipe of that wonderful Madeira, which you know I consider the chief grace of my cellars, and he gave up a canal navigation bill, which would have enriched his whole county, when he knew that it would injure my property.\"\nThe puncheon was a third of a tun. The term \"puncheon\", shortened to pon in the United States, is thought to derive from the fact that it would have been marked by use of a punch to denote its contents. The unit was also known as a \"tertian\" (from the Latin word for \"third\").\n\n\nOf comparable size to the beer hogshead, the wine hogshead was equal to half a butt or a quarter of a tun.\n\n\nClosely related to the modern oil barrel, the tierce was half a puncheon, a third of a butt or a sixth of a tun.\n\nThe wine barrel was half a wine hogshead or an eighth of a tun.\n\nThe rundlet was a seventh of a butt or a fourteenth of a tun.\n\nOriginally, the tun was defined as 256 wine gallons; this is the basis for the name of the quarter of 64 corn gallons. At some time before the 15th century, it was reduced to 252 gallons, so as to be evenly divisible by other small integers, including seven. Note that a 252-gallon tun of wine has an approximate mass of one long ton.\n\nWith the adoption of the Queen Anne wine gallon of 231 cubic inches the tun approximated the volume of a cylinder with both diameter and height of 42 inches. These were adopted as the standard US liquid gallon and tun.\n\nWhen the imperial system was introduced the tun was redefined in the UK and colonies as 210 imperial gallons. The imperial tun remained evenly divisible by small integers. There was also little change in the actual value the tun.\n"}
{"id": "501828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=501828", "title": "Equals sign", "text": "Equals sign\n\nThe etymology of the word \"equal\" is from the Latin word \"æqualis\" as meaning \"uniform\", \"identical\", or \"equal\", from \"aequus\" (\"level\", \"even\", or \"just\").\n\nThe \"=\" symbol that is now universally accepted in mathematics for equality was first recorded by Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde in \"The Whetstone of Witte\" (1557). The original form of the symbol was much wider than the present form. In his book Recorde explains his design of the \"Gemowe lines\" (meaning \"twin\" lines, from the Latin \"gemellus\"): \n\n\"And to auoide the tediouſe repetition of theſe woordes : is equalle to : I will ſette as I doe often in woorke vſe, a paire of paralleles, or Gemowe lines of one lengthe, thus: =, bicauſe noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle.\" \nAnd to avoid the tedious repetition of these words: is equal to: I will set as I do often in work use, a pair of parallels, or Gemowe lines of one length, thus: =, because no 2 things, can be more equal.\nAccording to Scotland's University of St Andrews History of Mathematics website:\nThe symbol '=' was not immediately popular. The symbol || was used by some and \"æ\" (or \"œ\"), from the Latin word \"aequalis\" meaning equal, was widely used into the 1700s.\n\nIn mathematics, the equals sign can be used as a simple statement of fact in a specific case (x = 2), or to create definitions (let x = 2), conditional statements (if x = 2, then …), or to express a universal equivalence codice_1.\n\nThe first important computer programming language to use the equals sign was the original version of Fortran, FORTRAN I, designed in 1954 and implemented in 1957. In Fortran, \"=\" serves as an assignment operator: codice_2 sets the value of codice_3 to 2. This somewhat resembles the use of \"=\" in a mathematical definition, but with different semantics: the expression following \"=\" is evaluated first and may refer to a previous value of codice_3. For example, the assignment codice_5 increases the value of codice_3 by 2.\n\nA rival programming-language usage was pioneered by the original version of ALGOL, which was designed in 1958 and implemented in 1960. ALGOL included a relational operator that tested for equality, allowing constructions like codice_7 with essentially the same meaning of \"=\" as the conditional usage in mathematics. The equals sign was reserved for this usage.\n\nBoth usages have remained common in different programming languages into the early 21st century. As well as Fortran, \"=\" is used for assignment in such languages as C, Perl, Python, awk, and their descendants. But \"=\" is used for equality and not assignment in the Pascal family, Ada, Eiffel, APL, and other languages.\n\nA few languages, such as BASIC and PL/I, have used the equals sign to mean both assignment and equality, distinguished by context. However, in most languages where \"=\" has one of these meanings, a different character or, more often, a sequence of characters is used for the other meaning. Following ALGOL, most languages that use \"=\" for equality use \":=\" for assignment, although APL, with its special character set, uses a left-pointing arrow.\n\nFortran did not have an equality operator (it was only possible to compare an expression to zero, using the arithmetic IF statement) until FORTRAN IV was released in 1962, since when it has used the four characters \".EQ.\" to test for equality. The language B introduced the use of \"==\" with this meaning, which has been copied by its descendant C and most later languages where \"=\" means assignment.\n\nThe equals sign is also used in defining attribute–value pairs, in which an attribute is assigned a value.\n\nIn PHP, the triple equals sign (codice_8) denotes value and type equality, meaning that not only do the two expressions evaluate to equal values, they are also of the same data type. For instance, the expression codice_9 is true, but codice_10 is not, because the number 0 is an integer value whereas false is a Boolean value.\n\nJavaScript has the same semantics for codice_8, referred to as \"equality without type coercion\". However, in JavaScript the behavior of codice_12 cannot be described by any simple consistent rules. The expression codice_9 is true, but codice_14 is false, even though both sides of the codice_12 act the same in Boolean context. For this reason it is recommended to avoid the codice_12 operator in JavaScript in favor of codice_8.\n\nIn Ruby, equality under codice_12 requires both operands to be of identical type, e.g. codice_9 is false. The codice_8 operator is flexible and may be defined arbitrarily for any given type. For example, a value of type codice_21 is a range of integers, such as codice_22. codice_23 is false, since the types are different (Range vs. Integer); however codice_24 is true, since codice_8 on codice_21 values means \"inclusion in the range\". Note that under these semantics, codice_8 is non-symmetric; e.g. codice_28 is false, since it is interpreted to mean codice_29 rather than codice_30.\n\nThe equals sign is sometimes used in Japanese as a separator between names.\n\nThe equals sign is also used as a grammatical tone letter in the orthographies of Budu in the Congo-Kinshasa, in Krumen, Mwan and Dan in the Ivory Coast. The Unicode character used for the tone letter (U+A78A) is different from the mathematical symbol (U+003D).\n\nA possibly unique case of the equals sign of European usage in a person's name, specifically in a double-barreled name, was by pioneer aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, as he is also known not only to have often used an equals sign (=) between his two surnames in place of a hyphen, but also seems to have personally preferred that practice, to display equal respect for his father's French ethnicity and the Brazilian ethnicity of his mother.\n\nIn linguistic interlinear glosses, an equals sign is conventionally used to mark clitic boundaries: the equals sign is placed between the clitic and the word that the clitic is attached to.\n\nIn chemical formulas, the two parallel lines denoting a double bond are commonly rendered using an equals sign.\n\nIn recent years, the equals sign has been used to symbolize LGBT rights. The symbol has been used since 1995 by the Human Rights Campaign, which lobbies for marriage equality, and subsequently by the United Nations Free & Equal, which promotes LGBT rights at the United Nations.\n\nSymbols used to denote items that are approximately equal include the following:\n\nThe symbol used to denote inequation (when items are not equal) is a slashed equals sign \"≠\" (U+2260; 2260,Alt+X in Microsoft Windows). In LaTeX, this is done with the \"\\neq\" command.\n\nMost programming languages, limiting themselves to the 7-bit ASCII character set and typeable characters, use codice_31, codice_32, codice_33, or codice_34 to represent their Boolean inequality operator.\n\nThe triple bar symbol \"≡\" (U+2261, LaTeX \"\\equiv\") is often used to indicate an identity, a definition (which can also be represented by U+225D \"≝\" or U+2254 \"≔\"), or a congruence relation in modular arithmetic. The symbol \"≘\" can be used to express that an item corresponds to another.\n\nThe symbol \"≅\" is often used to indicate isomorphic algebraic structures or congruent geometric figures.\n\nEquality of truth values, i.e. bi-implication or logical equivalence, may be denoted by various symbols including =, ~, and ⇔.\n\nAdditional symbols in Unicode related to the equals sign include:\n\n\nThe equals sign is sometimes used incorrectly within a mathematical argument to connect math steps in a non-standard way, rather than to show equality (especially by early mathematics students).\n\nFor example, if one were finding the sum, step by step, of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, one might incorrectly write\nStructurally, this is shorthand for\nbut the notation is incorrect, because each part of the equality has a different value. If interpreted strictly as it says, it implies\nA correct version of the argument would be\n\nThis difficulty results from subtly different uses of the sign in education. In early, arithmetic-focused grades, the equals sign may be \"operational\"; like the equals button on an electronic calculator, it demands the result of a calculation. Starting in algebra courses, the sign takes on a \"relational\" meaning of equality between two calculations. Confusion between the two uses of the sign sometimes persists at the university level.\n\nRelated:\n\n\n\n"}

The word mansion historically denotes homes with more character or uniqueness than an average executive home. This is because executive homes are usually constructed among homes of very similar size and type by a subdivider on speculation; they are generally built en-masse by development companies to be marketed as premium real estate. Executive homes can differ from traditional mansions mostly in their parcel size, since many of these newer homes are built on increasingly small lots so developers can maximize available acreage.\n\nExecutive homes are generally found in outlying suburban areas because lot sizes in older neighborhoods generally are not conducive to new residences of this large scale. However there have been many instances of developers buying large lots or multiple lots in historic neighborhoods, demolishing the older homes and building executive homes. This may have the effect of destroying the setting of older neighborhoods, and adversely impacting the integrity of historic districts. These lots are in desirable neighborhoods, and desirable school districts, and are close to urban centers, so the trend will likely continue. However, some communities such as Wellesley, Massachusetts and Austin, Texas have created policies and ordinances to retain older neighborhoods against these development pressures.\n\n\n"}

In 1657, he was encouraged to upgrade a system of shorthand on which he was working, by Samuel Hartlib, to a more ambitious universal system and he published on the subject later the same year.

It is often abbreviated as DGS. It is unclear how many use German Sign Language as their main language; Gallaudet University estimated 50,000 in 1986.\nThe language has evolved through use in deaf communities over hundreds of years.\n\nGermany has a strong oralist tradition and historically has seen a suppression of sign language. German Sign Language was first legally recognised in \"The Federal Disability Equality Act (2002)\" in May 2002. Since then, deaf people have a legal entitlement to Sign Language interpreters when communicating with federal authorities, free of charge.\n\nVery few television programs include an interpreter; those that do are the news and a news \"round-up\". There is at least one programme conducted entirely in German Sign Language called \"Sehen statt Hören\" (Seeing Instead of Hearing), a documentary-style programme produced by the Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR) and broadcast on Saturday mornings on Bayerischer Rundfunk and the other regional state broadcasters in Germany.\n\nGerman Sign Language is unrelated to spoken German. While spoken German builds sentences following a \"subject – verb – object\" pattern, German Sign Language uses a \"subject object verb\" strategy. Thus, the two have very different grammars, though as the dominant language of the region, German has had some influence on German Sign Language. A signed system that follows German grammar, Signed German (\"Lautsprachbegleitende Gebärden\" or \"Lautbegleitende Gebärden\", \"sound-accompanying signs\"), is used in education. It is not used as a natural means of communication between deaf people. Another system of manually representing German is cued speech, known as \"Phonembestimmes Manualsystem\" (Phonemic Manual System).\n\nGerman Sign Language uses a one-handed manual alphabet ('Fingeralphabet' in German) derived from the French manual alphabet of the 18th century; it is related to manual alphabets used across Europe and in North America.\n\nRegional variants of German Sign Language include Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich sign. Sign languages of regions in the former East Germany have a greater divergence from sign languages of the western regions; some may be unrelated. Polish Sign Language is descended from German Sign Language. Israeli Sign Language may be as well, as it evolved from the sign language used by German Jewish teachers who opened a school for deaf children in Jerusalem in 1932, and still shows some resemblance to its German counterpart. It is not related to Austrian Sign Language, which is used in parts of southern Germany, nor to Swiss Sign Language, both of which are part of the French Sign Language family, though they have had some influence from German Sign Language.\n\nEveryday users of German Sign Language use no written form of the language. In academic contexts, German Sign Language is usually described with the Hamburg notation system or HamNoSys. SignWriting also has its adherents in Germany.\n\nThe grammar of German Sign Language may be described in terms of the conventional linguistic categories phonology, morphology, morphosyntax and syntax.\n\nSigns are made up of a combination of different elements from each of the classes of distinctive features: handshape, hand orientation, location and movement. If one of these elements is changed, it can result in a sign with a completely different meaning. Two signs differing in only one element are deemed to be a minimal pair. German Sign Language uses 32 handshapes, of which six are basic handshapes found in all sign languages.\n\nTwo-handed signs are signs which are necessarily performed with both hands. Their formation is in accordance with certain phonotactic limitations, such as the rule of symmetry (when both hands move at the same time, they have the same handshape) and the rule of dominance (if the two hands have different handshapes, only the dominant hand is moved while the non-dominant hand remains passive).\n\nUninflected lexical signs in German Sign Language have at most two syllables. Syllables consist of two syllabic positions, described as \"Hold\" (H) and \"Movement\" (M). \"Holds\" consist of the handshape together with the hand orientation (together referred to as the hand configuration) at a specific location in signing space. \"Holds\" do not contain any change of location (movement from one location to another). \"Movements\", on the other hand, involve a change of location and may involve secondary movements such as wiggling of the fingers. Syllables may then be grouped into the following types: M (the minimal syllable), HM, MH, HMH (the maximal syllable). In the case of HM syllables, for example, the hand configuration of the \"Movement\" moves away from the location of the \"Hold\". A syllable of type M can consist of the following specifications: a path movement (from one location to another), a path movement with secondary movement (such as wiggling or twisting), or a secondary movement without path movement. The syllable type H (a segment without a \"Movement\") is not allowed for phonotactical reasons.\n\nAn elementary component of lexical signs are non-manual lexical markings, such as movements of eyes (rolling, widening), mouth (puffing, rounding) and face, as well as the whole head (nodding, tilting) and upper body (leaning). These are obligatory accompaniments of a quarter of all lexical signs. Making visual syllables with the mouth is referred to as mouthing.\n\nThe unmarked word order in DGS is subject-object-verb, similar to languages such as Turkish, Japanese and Latin, but differing from German.\n\nIf an indirect object appears in the sentence, it stands before the direct object.\n\nIn sentences with chains of verbs, auxiliary verbs and similar usually appear after the full verb, the opposite of English word order.\n\nThe Personal Agreement Marker (glossed as \"PAM\"), which looks almost like the sign for \"person\" and may be accompanied by the mouthing \"auf\" (\"on\"), is a sign used to indicate the location in signing space of animate objects when the verb in the sentence does not do this. It roughly fills the roll of object pronouns, however it seems to function more as an auxiliary verb, inflecting for person where the main verb does not. Although there is considerable variation, especially across dialects, it tends to occur where auxiliaries occur, after the verb, rather than in the object slot. The benefactive marker (glossed as \"BEM\") is similarly placed.\n\nTime expressions (\"tomorrow\", \"next week\") appear at the beginning of the sentence (as a discourse topic).\n\nPhrases specifying location tend to occur at the beginning of the sentence (after the time information).\n\nThis follows the figure-ground-principle, according to which smaller, more mobile referents (figures) tend to occur after larger, less mobile referents (ground).\n\nSentence adverbs often appear at the beginning of the sentence.\n\nHowever, adverbs that modify the verb but which cannot be expressed non-manually follow the verb as an extra clause.\n\nWh-words (interrogatives) usually occur at the end of the sentence after the verb.\n\nSome signs with a negative meaning tend to occur at the end of the sentence.\n\nHowever, if the negation is not emphasised, it can also appear in the expected position.\n\nDeterminers (articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, relative pronouns) follow the noun.\n\nTheir function is to set the location of referents within the signing space. If this is indicated instead by directional verbs, determiners can always be omitted, provided they are not required for other reasons (such as showing possession, pluralisation, etc.) There is no distinction between definite and indefinite articles.\n\nAttributive adjectives follow immediately after the noun.\n\nThe copula \"to be\" does not exist in DGS. Predicative adjectives are generally separated from the noun by a determiner.\n\nCompare the preceding sentence to the following noun phrase, in which the determiner follows the adjective.\n\nPossessive adjectives stand between the possessor and the possession.\n\nHere is an example of a longer but nevertheless simple, unmarked sentence.\n\nParts of the sentence which are moved outside of their usual unmarked position are accompanied by non-manual marking.\n\nSentence elements (with the exception of verbs) can be topicalised by being moved to the beginning of the sentence and marked with raised eyebrows.\n\nOften, a topic doesn't otherwise have any other role in the sentence. In these cases, it represents a limitation of the scope of the sentence. Compare the following three sentences.\n\n\n"}

Its speakers belong to the \"Schmiedleit\", \"Lehrerleit\", and \"Dariusleit\" Hutterite groups, but there are also some few speakers among the older generations of \"Prairieleit\" (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies). Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies learn and speak first Hutterite German before learning English, the standard language of the surrounding areas.\n\nAs of 2003, there are about 34,000 speakers in the world, 85% of them living in 333 communities in Canada and the remaining 15% in 123 communities in the USA. Canadian adults are generally literate in Early New High German (also called \"Biblical German\", the predecessor to Standard German used by Martin Luther) that they employ as the written form for Scriptures while Standard German is used in the USA for religious activities. Children learn English at school; Canadian Hutterites have a functional knowledge of English. Hutterite is for the most part an unwritten language, though in August 2006 Hutterite author Linda Maendel released a children's story titled \"Lindas glücklicher Tag\" (Linda's Happy Day) in which all the dialogue is written in the dialect. Maendel is also working on a series of biblical stories with Wycliff Bible translators.\n\nHutterite German is a koiné language based on the Bavarian dialects spoken in Tyrol, home of Jacob Hutter, and Carinthia in the mid-18th century. It is only 50% intelligible to a speaker of Pennsylvania German, as the latter variant is based on dialects spoken around the Electoral Palatinate. Hutterite German therefore belongs to the Southern Bavarian dialect group which is spoken in the southern parts of Bavaria and in Austria except for the westernmost part (Vorarlberg).\n\nAlthough the Hutterites once spoke Tirolean German, they no longer do. The switch among Hutterites from Tirolean German to Carinthian German occurred during years of severe persecution in Europe when Hutterite communities were devastated and survival depended on the conversion of many Carinthian \"Landler\" refugees to Hutterite anabaptism.\n\nThe language has adopted a limited number of Russian and also many English loan words, which are the result of Hutterite migrations into Eastern Europe and now North America. The core vocabulary is still almost exclusively of German origin.\n\n\n\n"}

Davies's work is highly influenced by the industrial landscape of his adopted village of Trealaw in the Rhondda Valley and his own nationalistic beliefs.\n\nBorn and brought up in Llangeitho in Ceredigion, Davies spent his working life in the newly industrialised coalfields of the Rhondda Valley. The sometimes bleak conditions of his early life, especially as his early adulthood coincided with the economic despair of the depression, is reflected in his plays. Davies was part of the Cadwgan Circle, a literary group of likeminded writers from Rhondda, that centred their image of Wales on the new industrialised society they were brought up in. Members of the Circle included Rhydwen Williams, Pennar Davies and Gareth Alban Davies.\n\nHis early play \"Cwm Glo\" (1934) was seen as controversial because it dealt with the social impact of the depression without the cultural romanticism which was stereotypical of Welsh literature. His verse play \"Meini Gwagedd\" (1944) is set in the Tregaron area and again looks at the harshness of the industrialised Wales and the self-destructive nature of people when drawn into a spiral of ill fortune.\n\nIn 1945, Davies stood in the United Kingdom general election, standing in the Rhondda East constituency as the first member of Plaid Cymru to contest the seat in the Rhondda Valleys. He came last out of three candidates, gaining 2,123 votes (6.1%). The next election, in 1950 he ran again, this time the Rhondda West constituency seat.

These phenomena occur in many non-rhotic varieties of English, such as those in most of England and Wales, part of the United States, and all of the Anglophone societies of the southern hemisphere, with the exception of South Africa. These phenomena first appeared in English sometime after the year 1700.\n\nBy definition, non-rhotic varieties of English only pronounce when it immediately precedes a vowel. This is called \"r\"-vocalisation, \"r\"-loss, \"r\"-deletion, \"r\"-dropping, \"r\"-lessness, or non-rhoticity.\n\nFor example, in non-rhotic varieties of English, the sound does not occur in a word such as \"tuner\" when it is spoken in isolation, before an intonation break (in pausa), or before a word beginning with a consonant. Even though the word is spelled with an (which reflects that an was pronounced in the past), non-rhotic accents do not pronounce an when there is no vowel sound to follow it. Thus, in isolation, speakers of non-rhotic accents may pronounce the words \"tuner\" and \"tuna\" identically as (or with the yod-dropping that typically occurs in the non-rhotic dialects of the northeastern United States, or with the yod-coalescence that occurs in Southern Hemisphere English).\n\nIn contrast, speakers of rhotic dialects, such as those of Scotland, Ireland, and most of North America (except in some of the Northeastern United States and Southern United States), always pronounce an in \"tuner\" and never in \"tuna\" so that the two always sound distinct, even when pronounced in isolation. Hints of non-rhoticity go back as early as the 15th century, and the feature was common (at least in London) by the early 18th century.\n\nIn many non-rhotic accents, words historically ending in (as evidenced by an in the spelling) may be pronounced with when they are closely followed by another morpheme beginning with a vowel sound. So \"tuner amp\" may be pronounced . This is the case in such accents even though \"tuner\" would not otherwise be pronounced with an . Here, \"closely\" means the following word must be in the same prosodic unit (that is, not separated by a pausa). This phenomenon is known as linking R. Not all non-rhotic varieties feature linking R. A notable non-rhotic accent that does not have linking R is Southern American English.\n\nThe phenomenon of intrusive R is an overgeneralizing reinterpretation of linking R into an r-insertion rule that affects any word that ends in the non-high vowels , , , or ; when such a word is closely followed by another word beginning in a vowel sound, an is inserted between them, even when no final was historically present. For example, the phrase \"bacteria in it\" would be pronounced . The epenthetic can be inserted to prevent hiatus, two consecutive vowel sounds.\n\nOther recognisable examples are the Beatles singing: \"I saw-r-a film today, oh boy\" in the song \"A Day in the Life\", from their 1967 \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album, in the song \"Champagne Supernova\" by Oasis: \"\"supernova-r-in the sky\", at the Sanctus in the Catholic Mass: \"Hosanna-r-in the highest\" and in the phrases, \"Law-r-and order\"\" and \"Victoria-r-and Albert Museum\". This is now common enough in parts of England that, by 1997, the linguist John C. Wells considered it objectively part of Received Pronunciation, though he noted that it was still stigmatized as an incorrect pronunciation, as it is or was in some other standardized non-rhotic accents. Wells writes that at least in RP, \"linking and intrusive are distinct only historically and orthographically\".\n\nJust like linking R, intrusive R may also occur between a root morpheme and certain suffixes, such as \"draw(r)ing\", \"withdraw(r)al\" or \"Kafka(r)esque\".\n\nRhotic dialects do not feature intrusive R. A rhotic speaker may use alternative strategies to prevent the hiatus, such as the insertion of a glottal stop to clarify the boundary between the two words. Varieties that feature linking R but not intrusive R (that is, \"tuna oil\" is pronounced ), show a clear phonemic distinction between words with and without in the syllable coda.\n\nSome speakers intrude an R at the end of a word even when there is no vowel following. An example is U.S. President George W. Bush (who is from Texas) speaking to Federal Emergency Management Agency director Michael Brown in 2005: \"The FEMA-R director's working 24/7\".\n\nA study examined the pronunciation of 30 British newsreaders on nationally broadcast newscasts around the turn of the 21st century speaking what was judged to be \"mainstream RP\". The data used in the study consisted mostly of the newsreaders reading from prepared scripts, but also included some more informal interview segments. It was found that all the newsreaders used some linking R and 90% (27 of 30) used some intrusive R.\n\nOverall, linking R was used in 59.8% of possible sites and intrusive R was used in 32.6% of possible sites. The factors influencing the use of both linking and intrusive R were found to be the same. Factors favouring the use of R-sandhi included adjacency to short words; adjacency to grammatical or non-lexical words; and informal style (interview rather than a prepared script). Factors disfavouring the use of R-sandhi included adjacency to proper names; occurrence immediately before a stressed syllable; the presence of another /r/ in the vicinity; and more formal style (prepared script rather than interview). The following factors were proposed as accounting for the difference between the frequency of linking and intrusive R:\n\n\n"}

He was born in Qingtian County (present-day Wencheng County, Wenzhou, Zhejiang). He served as a key advisor to Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor), the founder of the Ming dynasty, in the latter's struggle to overthrow the Yuan dynasty and unify China under his rule. Liu is also known for his prophecies and has been described as the \"Divine Chinese Nostradamus\". He and Jiao Yu co-edited the military treatise known as the \"Huolongjing\" (\"Fire Dragon Manual\").\n\nLiu served Zhu Yuanzhang in his rebellion against the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty in China, which had ruled since the conquest of the Southern Song dynasty in 1279. He dabbled in many fields of statecraft, philosophy, scholarly works, and technology. His philosophical outlook was that of a skeptical naturalist, and he became interested in astronomy, calendrical science, magnetism, and fengshui. He was known to be a friendly associate of the mathematician and alchemist Zhao Yuqin, and collaborated with the contemporary general and scholar Jiao Yu to edit and compile the military-technology treatise of the \"Huolongjing\", which outlined the use of various gunpowder weapons. He was very interested in the latter, and once said that \"thunder is like fire shot from a cannon\".\n\nLiu sat for the imperial examination and obtained the position of a \"jinshi\" (successful candidate) in the final years of the Yuan dynasty. He spent much of his early career attempting to save the Yuan dynasty from collapse. He served the Yuan dynasty as an official for 25 years, gaining a reputation for integrity and honesty, and became known as a distinguished scholar and strategist. In 1348, he was appointed to a military position and assigned to put down a southern rebellion against the dynasty. The leader of the rebellion attempted to save himself by offering Liu a bribe. When Liu refused, the rebel went to Beijing and succeeded in bribing his way into favour there.\n\nOnce the secessionist had bribed his way into the regime's favour, he was given a public office and a salary. Liu's relationship with the Yuan government deteriorated after this event. He attempted to resign twice, in 1349 and 1352. He was demoted in 1358, and finally left service to retire in his ancestral homeland. In 1360, Liu was introduced to Zhu Yuanzhang, a former leader of a radical White Lotus rebellion who was then the leader of a broad anti-Yuan rebellion.\n\nLiu served not only in the administration of Zhu Yuanzhang, but also in many battles as a commanding officer on land and water, leading the early Ming naval forces. Zhu Yuanzhang placed Liu in charge of the campaign to conquer all of Zhejiang from Yuan forces. Liu was also responsible for military ventures against opposing Chinese rebel groups, as well as the \"wokou\". His forces owed much of their success to the use of the medieval Chinese firearm known as the fire lance. It was during this period that he wrote the books \"Extraordinary Strategies of a Hundred Battles\" (\"百戰奇略\") and \"Eighteen Strategies and Affairs\" (\"時務十八策\"). Later in the rebellion, Zhu Yuanzhang only rarely relied on Liu to personally command his armies in the field, as he acquired other capable generals, including Xu Da, Deng Yu and Chang Yuchun. Liu was most often consulted for his strategic advice during this period.\n\nIn 1368, after eight years of Liu's service, Zhu Yuanzhang unified China. When Zhu founded the Ming dynasty and became historically known as the Hongwu Emperor, Liu was one of his most trusted advisors, but the relationship between Liu and the emperor eventually deteriorated in a manner similar to the way that Liu had become estranged from the Yuan government. In 1375, Liu rejected a man, Hu Weiyong, for appointment to high office. Hu Weiyong later obtained an audience with the Hongwu Emperor and slandered Liu by telling the emperor that Liu was plotting to establish his own power. After convincing the emperor of Liu's treachery, Liu was ejected from office, and Hu Weiyong was promoted.\n\nThe shock and shame of being groundlessly dismissed from office destroyed Liu's health, and he quickly died. Within five years of Liu's death, the man who had slandered Liu to achieve office was himself suspected of plotting against the Hongwu Emperor. In the subsequent orgy of the emperor's paranoid efforts to root out conspiracy, 30–40,000 people were executed.\n\nThe precise cause of Liu's death is considered uncertain by modern scholars. Some scholars believe that Liu was poisoned by the Hongwu Emperor himself, not because Liu failed his duty, but because the emperor was envious and even fearful of his knowledge and influence. Other sources have pointed out that the Hongwu Emperor did kill many people shortly after Liu lost his official position, but they are uncertain about whether Liu was part of this group.\n\nLiu's most famous prophecy to Zhu Yuanzhang, written down in a lyrical style, is called the \"Shaobing Song\" (燒餅歌). The poem is written in cryptic verse and is difficult to understand. Some people believe that the \"Shaobing Song\" has predicted future events in China, including the 1449 Mongol invasion, and the 1911 founding of the Republic of China.\n\nLiu's official biography is found in the 128th volume of the \"History of Ming\", which was written by Zhang Tingyu and others in the Qing dynasty. The author Chong Tai also wrote a biography on him.\n\n\"Shenji Miaosuan Liu Bowen\" (), a 404 episodes long television drama about Liu, was aired in Taiwan on TTV from 23 August 2006 to 12 March 2008, starring Taiwanese actor Huang Shaoqi (黃少祺) as Liu.\n\n\n"}

The Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem states that the Lyndon words furnish a factorisation. The Schützenberger theorem relates the definition in terms of a multiplicative property to an additive property.\n\nLet \"A\" be the free monoid on an alphabet \"A\". Let \"X\" be a sequence of subsets of \"A\" indexed by a totally ordered index set \"I\". A factorisation of a word \"w\" in \"A\" is an expression\n\nwith formula_2 and formula_3.\n\nA \"Lyndon word\" over a totally ordered alphabet \"A\" is a word which is lexicographically less than all its rotations.

Hence taking \"X\" to be the singleton set {\"l\"} for each Lyndon word \"l\", with the index set \"L\" of Lyndon words ordered lexicographically, we obtain a factorisation of \"A\".

{"id": "169319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169319", "title": "Necessity and sufficiency", "text": "Necessity and sufficiency\n\nIn logic, necessity and sufficiency are terms used to describe a conditional or implicational relationship between statements. For example, in the conditional statement \"If P then Q\", we say that \"Q is necessary for P\" because P cannot be true unless Q is true. Similarly, we say that \"P is sufficient for Q\" because P being true always implies that Q is true, but P not being true does not always imply that Q is not true. \n\nThe assertion that a statement is a \"necessary \"and\" sufficient\" condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true. That is, the two statements must be either simultaneously true or simultaneously false. \n\nIn ordinary English, \"necessary\" and \"sufficient\" indicate relations between conditions or states of affairs, not statements. Being a male sibling is a necessary and sufficient condition for being a brother.\n\nIn the conditional statement, \"if \"S\", then \"N\", the expression represented by \"S\" is called the antecedent and the expression represented by \"N\" is called the consequent. This conditional statement may be written in many equivalent ways, for instance, \"N\" if \"S\", \"S\" only if \"N\", \"S\" implies \"N\", \"N\" is implied by \"S\", , , or \"N\" whenever \"S\"\".\n\nIn the above situation, we also say that \"N\" is a necessary condition for \"S\". In common language this is saying that if the conditional statement is a true statement, then the consequent \"N\" must be true if \"S\" may at all be true (see \"truth table\" immediately below). Phrased differently, the antecedent \"S\" cannot be true without \"N\" being true. For example, in order for someone to be called Socrates, it is necessary for that someone to be Named.\n\nWe also say that \"S\" is a sufficient condition for \"N\". Consider the truth table again. If the conditional statement is true, then if \"S\" is true, \"N\" must be true; whereas if the conditional statement is true and N is true, then S may be true or be false. In common terms, \"\"S\" guarantees \"N\". Continuing the example, knowing that someone is called Socrates is sufficient to know that someone has a Name.\n\nA necessary and sufficient condition requires that both of the implications formula_1 and formula_2 (which can also be written as formula_3) hold. From the first of these we see that \"S\" is a sufficient condition for \"N\", and from the second that \"S\" is a necessary condition for \"N\". This is expressed as \"S\" is necessary and sufficient for \"N\" \", \"\"S\" if and only if \"N\" \", or formula_4.\n\nThe assertion that \"Q\" is necessary for \"P\" is colloquially equivalent to \"\"P\" cannot be true unless \"Q\" is true\" or \"if Q is false, then P is false\". By contraposition, this is the same thing as \"whenever \"P\" is true, so is \"Q\"\".\n\nThe logical relation between \"P\" and \"Q\" is expressed as \"if \"P\", then \"Q\" and denoted \"P\" ⇒ \"Q\" (\"P\" implies \"Q\"). It may also be expressed as any of \"P\" only if \"Q\", \"Q\", if \"P\", \"Q\" whenever \"P\", and \"Q\" when \"P\"\". One often finds, in mathematical prose for instance, several necessary conditions that, taken together, constitute a sufficient condition, as shown in Example 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \"P\" is sufficient for \"Q\", then knowing \"P\" to be true is adequate grounds to conclude that \"Q\" is true; however, knowing \"P\" to be false does not meet a minimal need to conclude that \"Q\" is false.\n\nThe logical relation is, as before, expressed as \"if \"P\", then \"Q\" or \"P\" ⇒ \"Q\". This can also be expressed as \"P\" only if \"Q\", \"P\" implies \"Q\"\" or several other variants. It may be the case that several sufficient conditions, when taken together, constitute a single necessary condition, as illustrated in example 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other. For instance, \"being a mammal\" (\"N\") is necessary but not sufficient to \"being human\" (\"S\"), and that a number formula_11 \"is rational\" (\"S\") is sufficient but not necessary to formula_11 \"being a real number\" (\"N\") (since there are real numbers that are not rational).\n\nA condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, \"today is the Fourth of July\" is a necessary and sufficient condition for \"today is Independence Day in the United States\". Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for invertibility of a matrix \"M\" is that \"M\" has a nonzero determinant.\n\nMathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are dual to one another. For any statements \"S\" and \"N\", the assertion that \"\"N\" is necessary for \"S\" is equivalent to the assertion that \"S\" is sufficient for \"N\"\". Another facet of this duality is that, as illustrated above, conjunctions (using \"and\") of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions (using \"or\") of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity. For a third facet, identify every mathematical predicate \"N\" with the set \"T\"(\"N\") of objects, events, or statements for which \"N\" holds true; then asserting the necessity of \"N\" for \"S\" is equivalent to claiming that \"T\"(\"N\") is a superset of \"T\"(\"S\"), while asserting the sufficiency of \"S\" for \"N\" is equivalent to claiming that \"T\"(\"S\") is a subset of \"T\"(\"N\").\n\nTo say that \"P\" is necessary and sufficient for \"Q\" is to say two things:\n\nOne may summarize any, and thus all, of these cases by the statement \"\"P\" if and only if \"Q\"\", which is denoted by formula_16, whereas cases tell us that formula_16 is identical to formula_15.\n\nFor example, in graph theory a graph \"G\" is called bipartite if it is possible to assign to each of its vertices the color \"black\" or \"white\" in such a way that every edge of \"G\" has one endpoint of each color. And for any graph to be bipartite, it is a necessary and sufficient condition that it contain no odd-length cycles. Thus, discovering whether a graph has any odd cycles tells one whether it is bipartite and conversely. A philosopher might characterize this state of affairs thus: \"Although the concepts of bipartiteness and absence of odd cycles differ in intension, they have identical extension.\n\nIn mathematics, theorems are often stated in the form \"\"P\" is true if and only if \"Q\" is true\". Their proofs normally first prove sufficiency, e.g. formula_14. Secondly, the opposite is proven, formula_20\n\nThis proves that the circles for Q and P match on the Venn diagrams above.\n\nBecause, as explained in previous section, necessity of one for the other is equivalent to sufficiency of the other for the first one, e.g. formula_13 is equivalent to formula_20, if \"P\" is necessary and sufficient for \"Q\", then \"Q\" is necessary and sufficient for \"P\". We can write formula_23 and say that the statements \"\"P\" is true if and only if \"Q\", is true\" and \"\"Q\" is true if and only if \"P\" is true\" are equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In \"clausal nominal TAM\", the noun indicates TAM information about the clause (as opposed to the noun phrase).\n\nWhether or not a particular language can best be understood as having clausal nominal TAM can be controversial, and there are various borderline cases. A language that can indicate tense by attaching a verbal clitic to a noun (such as the -\"'ll\" clitic in English) is not generally regarded as using nominal TAM.\n\nVarious languages have been shown to have clausal nominal TAM. In the Niger-Congo language Supyire, the form of the first person and second pronouns reflects whether the clause has declarative or non-declarative mood. In the /Gui language of Botswana, subject pronouns reflect the imperative or non-imperative mood of the clause (while the verb itself does not). In the Chamicuro language of Peru, the definite article accompanying the subject or object of a clause indicates either past or non-past tense. In the Pitta Pitta language of Australia, the mandatory case marking system differs depending on the tense of the clause. Other languages exhibiting clausal nominal TAM include Lardil (Australia), Gurnu (Australia), Yag Dii (Cameroon), Sahidic Coptic (Egypt), Gusiilay (Niger-Congo), Iai (Oceania), Tigak (Oceania), and Guaymi (Panama and Costa Rica).\n\nIn the Guarani language of Paraguay, nouns can optionally take several different past and future markers to express ideas such as \"our old house (the one we no longer live in)\", \"the abandoned car\", \"what was once a bridge\", \"bride-to-be\" or even \"my ex-future-wife,\" or rather, \"the woman who at one point was going to be my wife.\"\n\nAlthough verbal clitics such as -\"'ll\" in English are attached to nouns and indicate TAM information, they are not really examples of nominal TAM because they are clitics rather than inflections and therefore not part of the noun at all. This is easily seen in sentences where the clitic is attached to another part of speech, such as \"\"The one you want'll be in the shed\".\n\nAnother way to tell the difference is to consider the following hypothetical dialogue:\nThe speaker cannot emphasise the future time by placing voice stress on \"she'll\", and so instead uses the expanded phrase \"she will\". This is characteristic of clitics as opposed to inflections (i.e. clitics cannot be emphasised by placing voice stress on the word to which they are attached).\n\nThe significance of this can be seen by comparison with a second hypothetical dialogue, using the English negative suffix -\"n't\" (which is best understood as an inflection rather than a clitic):\nIn this case the speaker could choose to say isn't rather than is not. Even though the stress then falls on the syllable \"IS\", the meaning of the sentence is understood as emphasising the \"NOT\". This indicates that \"isn't\" is one inflected word rather than a word with a clitic attached.\n"}

Completed, or camera-ready, pages are known as mechanicals or mechanical art. In the offset lithography process, the mechanicals would be photographed with a stat camera to create a same-size film negative for each printing plate required.\n\nPaste up relied on phototypesetting, a process that would generate \"cold type\" on photographic paper that usually took the form of long columns of text. These printouts were often a single column in a scroll of narrow (3-inch or 4-inch) paper that was as deep as the length of the story.\n\nA professional known variously as a paste-up artist, layout artist, mechanical artist, production artist, or compositor would cut the type into sections and arrange it carefully across multiple columns. For example, a 15 inch strip could be cut into 3 5-inch sections. Headlines and other typographic elements were often created and supplied separately by the typesetter, leaving it to the paste up artist to determine their final position on the page.\n\nAdhesive was then applied to the back side of these strips, either by applying rubber cement with a brush or passing them through a machine that would apply a wax adhesive. The adhesives were intentionally made semi-permanent, allowing the strips to be removed and moved around the layout if it needed to be changed. The strips would be adhered to a board, usually a stiff white paper on which the artist would draw the publication's margins and columns, either lightly in pencil or in non-photographic blue ink, a light cyan color that would be ignored by the orthochromatic film used to make printing plates in offset lithography. For magazines, newspapers, and other recurring projects, often the boards would be pre-printed in this color.\n\nOther camera-ready materials like photostats and line art would also be prepared with adhesive and attached to the boards. Continuous-tone photographs would need halftoning, which would require black paper or red film (which photo-imaged the same as black) to be trimmed and placed on the board in place of the image; in the process of creating the negative film for the printing plates, the solid black area would create a clear spot on the negative, called a window. The photographs would be converted to halftone film separately and then positioned in this window to complete the page (although this process was typically performed by a different worker, known as a negative \"stripper\").\n\nOnce a page was complete, the board would be attached to an easel and photographed in order to create a negative, which was then used to make a printing plate.\n\nPaste up was preceded by hot type and cold type technologies. Starting in the 1990s, many newspapers started doing away with paste up, switching to desktop publishing software that allows pages to be designed completely on a computer. Such software includes QuarkXPress, PageMaker and InDesign. \n\n"}

{"id": "45241531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45241531", "title": "Radio homogenization", "text": "Radio homogenization\n\nRadio homogenization is a trend towards similar programming within broadcast radio in the United States. It is partially a result of the conglomeration of radio companies, particularly after the enactment of the now controversial Telecommunications Act of 1996. The bill relaxed regulations that limited ownership of radio stations, and subsequently their ownership became greatly consolidated. A number of the resulting large radio companies have been accused of broadcasting less new music, emulating a same-ness on the airwaves. Consolidation has allowed bigger companies to transition to a more profitable nationalized target marketing model, forcing local independent radio stations to adjust to the financial realities of their competitors. Corporate interests tend to favor the cost benefits of efficiency, however consolidation is reported to have significant effects on overall radio programming in the US.\n\nThe 1996 Telecommunications Act removed all national and local restrictions on national ownership that specified the number of stations one company could own in a set market. Before 1996, a company was prohibited from owning more than 40 stations, and from owning more than two AM and two FM stations in one market. The bill covered a wide range of formats and was the first time the Internet was included in broadcasting and spectrum allotment.\n\nThe federal government has regulated the extent of ownership for radio stations since the 1934 Communications Act. The policy was based on the notion that the airwaves were accessible to the public and therefor had an accompanying public trust. However, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began to relax these limitations.\n\nLydia Polgreen's research indicates that the 1996 Telecommunications Act was one of the most lobbied bills in history. Media interests spent $34 million on campaign contributions for the 1995–96 election cycle – nearly 40% more than the previous election. Martin Scherzinger claims the public was mostly uninformed of potential consequences, as \"the media covered the Telecommunications Act as a business technicality instead of a public policy story,\" assuring deregulation would increase competition and generate high-paying jobs. There was no discernible public debate.\n\nSince deregulation in 1996, more than a third of all US radio stations have been bought and sold. Polgreen indicates that in the year following the legislation alone, 2045 radio stations were sold – a net value of $13.6 billion. Of the 4992 total stations across 268 set radio markets, almost half are now owned by a company owning three or more stations in the same market. The Future of Music Coalition reported the number of stations owned by the ten largest companies increased by roughly fifteen times between 1985 and 2005. Robert F. X. Sillerman, Chairman of SFX Broadcasting, noted that consolidation also helps spread overhead costs around, and even adding a second station can cut costs. Consolidation doesn't necessarily mean less stations, merely less owners.\n\nTwo companies in particular, Clear Channel and the Infinity Broadcasting unit of Viacom, own roughly half the nation's airwaves. Clear Channel grew from 40 stations to 1,240 stations in seven years (30 times more than congressional regulation previously allowed) . Their aggressive acquisitions have gained them enemies as well as supporters, but their ownership of 247 of the nation's 250 largest radio markets and their domination of the Top 40 format makes them undeniably a significant player in the music industry.\n\nAfter 42 years, the country's largest radio broadcaster switched its name to iHeartRadio Inc. Though most of their revenue still comes from advertising on its airwaves, iHeartRadio only accounts for 10% of total listening for the company. Clear Channel has built the iHeartRadio brand beyond the Internet (see: iHeartRadio Festival, Jingle Ball, Pool Party, iHeartRadio Music Awards). After the company's concert promotion division spun off in 2005, it ditched the Clear Channel name in favor of Live Nation. This follows a general trend of Consolidation of Media Ownership, where corporate interests take precedence over the artistic integrity of the content. An analysis of a wide range of music professionals by Frontline illustrates this is especially true of the music industry.\n\nAccording to Martin Scherzinger, \"recorded music is the most concentrated global media market today.\" When he wrote this in 2005, six leading firms – PolyGram, EMI, Warner Music Group (a unit of AOL Time Warner), Sony Music Entertainment, BMG (a unit of Bertelsmann), and Universal Music Group (a unit of Vivendi) – were estimated to control between 80% to 90% of the global market. As of July 2013, the industry has consolidated even further. A series of mergers has reduced the big six to just three large corporations: Universal Music Group (now part of EMI's recorded music division), Sony Music Entertainment (EMI Publishing was absorbed into Sony/ATV Music Publishing), and Warner Music Group (which absorbed EMI's Parlophone and EMI/Virgin Classic labels). Most of these companies are part of larger conglomerates. Vertical concentration and horizontal integration allow cross pollination to promote products across multiple mediums. For instance, AOL Time Warner owns magazines, book publishing houses, film studios, television networks, cable channels, retail stores, libraries, sports teams etc., and can thus promote one through the utilization of another.\n\nScherzinger states that cross-ownership tends to reduce competition, lower risk, and increase profits. He argues this \"has forced musical production to succumb to the advertising, marketing, styling, and engineering techniques of increasingly uniform and narrow profit-driven criteria.\" In the name of efficiency, new technology has allowed a station's technician to cut and paste news, weather and host chatter into pre-recorded programming. Companies have greatly benefited from Top 40, national news, and sports programming shows that can be purchased at the national level. News programming in particular is often produced and recorded at a remote location, as the practice streamlines the number of personalities needed on the air, and emulates a similar feel for the listener. This process of regionalized programming is referred to as voice tracking. Cost-sharing is now common practice. For radio broadcasters, the more homogeneity between different services held in common ownership (or the more elements within a program schedule which can be shared between 'different' stations), the greater the opportunity to gain profits.\n\nThis increase of cost-efficiency, an application of economies of scale, also results in cutting staff and centralizing programming decisions on what should be broadcast. The music-loving DJ playing whatever they feel fits the mood is largely fictional at any major station at this point in time. \"Billboard Magazine\" reported that the mainstream press has accused several large radio conglomerates of playing less new music since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Consolidation has made it even less likely that one will hear something new, different, or unique.\n\nThe number of formats provided by radio stations increased in all markets between 1996 and 2000. However, an in-depth case study from the Future of Music Coalition shows that a quantitative focus on formats obscures their interconnections. Despite different names, formats extensively overlap and have similar playlists. For example, alternative, Top 40, rock, and hot adult contemporary are all likely to play songs by similar bands, even though their formats are not the same. The Future of Music Coalition reports an analysis of charts in Radio and Records and Billboard's Airplay Monitor revealed considerable playlist overlap – as much as 76% – between supposedly distinct formats. This overlap may enhance the homogenization of the airwaves.\n\nFMC's study concludes that allowing unlimited national consolidation has resulted in less competition, fewer viewpoints, and a decrease in diversity in radio programming – a trend in the opposite direction of Congress's stated goals for the FCC's media policy. The report, titled \"False Premises, False Promises: A Quantitative History of Ownership Consolidation in the Radio Industry\", also says that radio consolidation has no added benefits for DJ's, programmers and musicians working in the music industry.\n\nPolgreen says that for listeners, the most readily apparent result of consolidation is the rise of cookie cutter playlists. Teams of market researchers strategically compile playlists to be as widely appealing as possible rather than base the song choices on merit. For example, on an oldies show, probably the most heavily researched and systematized format in radio, classic hits will be played almost every day, while critically acclaimed songs by the same bands get little or no play. What one hears has been carefully crafted to appeal to targeted demographic groups for that station. Indeed, format competition and subsequent adaption of similar formats has become a major facet of modern radio.\n\nAs companies seek to extend their demographic reach, they tend to promote music with \"general\" appeal. While general appeal may seem relatively neutral at first glance, Scherzinger juxtaposes a best case scenario (tunes that are genuinely popular) with a worst-case scenario (bland content). Music under these conditions is subject to highly restrictive aesthetic codes and cultural judgments of those in positions of authority. He asserts that music with standardized ingredients is played on stations whose ownership is the most consolidated. Scherzinger continues, that \"far from reflecting a neutral and general taste in music, this stabilized aesthetic tends to mediate the tastes of a highly particular demographic, namely, the social sector with disposable income: predominantly white, middle-class, heterosexual, 18-to-45-year-old males.\"\n\nWhen economic criteria drive programming decisions, it follows that radio play, media coverage, and sales will be directed toward the most lucrative demographics.\nTrade publication \"Variety\" observed, \"A huge wave of consolidation has turned music stations into cash cows that focus on narrow playlists aimed at squeezing the most revenue from the richest demographics... Truth be told, in this era of megamergers, there has never been a greater need for a little diversity on the dial.\"\n\nIn a recent survey of how much new music is added to Top 40 stations each week, Billboard/Airplay Monitor discovered that smaller groups and individually owned stations add and play more new songs each week. But there are also some prominent exceptions and a wide variance within certain groups. In general, the trend is towards more conservative, less aggressive releases of new material.\n\nRadio tends to get a majority of their revenue from advertising. Polgreen claims that from the 1996 Telecom Act, commercial radio broadcasters sought to form national media companies that could transition radio to a national advertising model. Media companies could then pitch their stations to both local and national advertisers. A company with multiple stations now allows marketing firms to approach the parent company, who can then provide them with the desired target audience through a specific station and time slot.\n\nExpanded to a national level, this advertising model generates many more leads for marketers at a fraction of the time and energy that going to individual stations previously required. A study on the impact of ownership rules following the 1996 Telecom Act found that the biggest area of change following the first few years of unrestrained consolidation was the negotiation of advertising rates. Indeed, revenue more than doubled in a decade, from $8.4 billion in 1990 to more than $17 billion by 2000.\n\nScherzinger argues that marketing branches of music companies no longer are purely administrative. Instead, he contends that \"through intricate applications of management theory – supervising and measuring data – marketers settle priorities, make aesthetic judgments, and select musical forms.\" Marketers are increasingly who decide what music gets attention.\n\nRadio has always had to balance listeners' desires with the need to deliver a predictable audience to advertisers. In the past, if listeners felt a song was too monotonous or repetitive, they could tune to a different station. Now, however, there is less choice available, and that song might be playing on a nearby station. The radio spectrum is a limited and publicly owned commodity. Since there is a definite amount of space on the radio spectrum, big companies have an incentive to dominate as much of it as they can.\n\nConcentration of corporate ownership in the vast majority of local markets, at the expense of local ownership, has increased dramatically. The Local Ownership Index, created by Future of Music Coalition, shows that the localness of radio ownership has declined from an average of 97.1% to an average of 69.9%, a 28% percent drop. Polgreen asserts that the buying frenzy following the Telecom Act drove up station prices beyond the reach of the typical entrepreneur, making it difficult for smaller station owners to resist the financial pressures to sell. As a result, only dedicated local owners have survived.\n\nConcentration of radio ownership translates to concentration of radio listenership. According to the FMC, the top four firms received 48% of the listeners in 2005. Yet across 155 markets, radio listenership has declined over the past fourteen years that data is available for, a 22% drop since its peak in 1989. It is plausible that the decline in radio listenership is due to consumers finding alternatives more attractive than homogenized radio.\n\nThe two competing satellite radio services, Sirius and XM, merged to form Sirius XM Radio in 2009 and now has a government-regulated monopoly on the format. The merger combined more than 18.5 million subscribers for both companies based on their existing subscribers on the date they merged.\n\nOne of these alternative formats, LPFMs (low-power FM stations) is a promising alternative to nationalized radio stations. By broadcasting at well under 100 watts (the minimum for commercial stations is set at 100 watts), these independently run stations have been viewed as a possible antidote to radio consolidation, as they are local stations dealing with local issues. The Federal Communications Commission seems to be sympathetic to single station owners, and its chairman, William Kennard, has taken steps to encourage further diversity in ownership by proposing the creation of three new classes of licenses for LPFMs.\n\nOther less homogenized formats can be found through individual libraries, as well as internet radio formats like podcasts. Other streaming services like Pandora and Spotify are becoming increasingly popular. However, a 2014 Nielsen report indicates that radio still remains the most popular platform for music consumption, as 59% of listeners use a combination of AM/FM or online radio streams to hear their favorite artists.\n\nArtists that experienced success in the industry prior to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, such as David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Don Henley of The Eagles, have brought to light what they believe are contributing to the nationwide homogenization of music. Crosby tells PBS in an interview, \"When it all started, record companies – and there were many of them, and this was a good thing – were run by people who loved records, people like Ahmet Ertegun, who ran Atlantic Records, who were record collectors. They got in it because they loved music... Now record companies are run by lawyers and accountants.\" This view highlights a common theme that creativity and passion have been subverted by the financial incentives of corporatized media companies. Chief executives of large record labels often have no musical or cultural background. A head of Universal Vivendi, , was previously in pharmaceuticals. Gunter Thielen, the former head of Bertelsmann, previously managed the company's printing and industrial operations.\n\nMusic journalist Ernesto Aguilar expressed the sentiment that \"media consolidation means not only does corporate radio control who gets played, but also which artists get recognition, who is perceived as a voice in a music's history and who is erased from that history.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "34956355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34956355", "title": "Rhinelandic regiolect", "text": "Rhinelandic regiolect\n\nThe terms Rhinelandic, Rhenish, and Rhinelandic regiolect are used to name the colloquial language spoken in the so-called Rhineland of West Germany. This linguistic region is approximately formed of the West of North Rhine-Westphalia, the North of Rhineland-Palatinate and several smaller adjacent areas, including some areas in neighbouring countries.\n\nAlthough there is such a thing as a Rhinelandic accent, and the regiolect uses it, the Rhinelandic regiolect is not simply German spoken with an accent. Indeed, it deviates from Standard German with several thousand commonly used additional words, phrases, and idioms, and some grammatical constructions. Like other German regiolects, there is not a strict definition of what constitutues Rhinelandic; it can be spoken in a way very close to the standard language, but if locals talk to each other, it is mostly unintelligible to inhabitants of other German speaking regions.\n\nLinguists classify the Rhinelandic Regiolect as a dialect of Standard German having a strong substratum of the many diverse local community languages of the Rhineland. As such, it has a middle position between the group of older West Central German languages, and Low Franconian languages spoken in the Rhineland, and the newer Standard German. The latter has only been brought into the area recently, under the Prussian reign, when local speakers merged many common properties and words of their local languages into the standard language. Thus a new regiolect formed, which in many respects follows the conventions of Standard German, but at the same time continues local linguistic traditions, making it comprehensible in a much wider area than the original local languages. Nevertheless, it still reflects differences inside the dialect continuum of the Rhineland, since speakers often prefer distinct words, styles or linguistic forms depending on the subregion they come from.\n\nDiffering across subregions of the Rhineland, and continually evolving, the Rhinelandic regiolect is not easily formalized. Though spoken by millions, it is rarely written down, which hampers scientific treatment. It has long been regarded as 'sheer colloquial speech' by the scientific community, valued too low to be subject of serious recognition and research. Only recently has it shifted into the focus of empirical research of some linguists. Most notably, the linguistics department of the ' (Institute for Regional Studies and History, former: ' (ARL) – Office of Rhinelandic Regional Knowledge and Documentation) of the \" (LVR) has contributed to that work.\n\nScientists of today's \" have observed, documented, and researched lingual development in the Rhine Province, and lately the Rhineland, for about two hundred years.\nDuring the past decades, they have published several studies of the current regiolect, as well as scientific books and papers, popular science books, articles and essays. Some of their findings are available in the world wide web. They regularly make surveys based on printed questionnaires which more recently can also be obtained and submitted via e-mail. These surveys are supplemented, extended, and updated by use of their interactive website \"\" (Cooperative Dictionary of the Rhinelandic Colloquial Language) since 2007.\n\nLiterature on collquialisms and colloquial German generally lists words and phrases coming from the Rhineland, marking their regional provenience appropriately.\n\nDespite obviously not having heen created for this purpose and not including regiolect references at all, the well-known extensive multi-volume compendium ' is nevertheless usually very helpful for finding hints to the probable meanings of words of the Rhinelandic regiolect that cannot be determined from other sources. Many regiolectal words come from, or are identical to, local language words which are documented in the '. They usually bear identical, related, or quite similar meanings.\n\n\n\nThe following exemplary sentences may show how the regiolect is related to both Standard German and the actual dialect (Kölsch in this case), and found to be in the middle between the two.\n\nThe example shows that the regiolect is based on Standard German. Thus, it uses \"ers'ma\" (\"first\") from the standard \"erst mal\" (vs. dialect: \"eesch ens\"), and \"schonn\" (\"already\") from the standard \"schon\" (vs. dialect: \"att\" or \"allt\"). With words common to both languages, vowel and consonant qualities are usually those of the standard (\"trinken\" instead of \"drinke\"; \"immer\" instead of \"emmer\"), as are the rules of morphology.\n\nHowever, the strong dialectal influence is also evident: Word final \"t/d\" is often deleted after another consonant (\"jetz, un\"); there is a tendency towards vowel shortening (\"schonn, widder\"); some structure words come in the dialectal form (\"mer\" = \"wir\"; \"et\" = \"es, das\"); and words with an initial vowel are not separated from the preceding word by a glottal stop, but rather linked to it, like in English. (This is marked in the example by an underscore.)\nThe regiolect also uses diminutives more often (\"Käffchen\" instead of \"Kaffee\"), and has borrowed from the dialect many syntactical constructions unknown in the standard, e.g. \"mer trinken uns (en Käffchen)\", literally \"we drink (a coffee) to ourselves\", meaning: \"to drink something with ease and pleasure.\"\n\nAnother good example is the word \"afternoon\", for which the regiolect uses a form similar to the dialect, but has adapted a vowel and a consonant to the standard.\n\nThe continuum \"Rhenish dialects\" – \"Rhenish regiolect\" – \"Standard German\" is comparable (however not wholly equal) to the continuum \"Scots\" – \"(colloquial) Scottish English\" – \"British Standard English\" in Lowland Scotland. The first end of the continuum is made up by the traditional regional language, which is closely related to the standard, but has had its independent development for several centuries; in both cases, it is alive, but losing ground in everyday communication, especially among younger people. The other end of the continuum is the supra-regional standard language used for example on national television. In between the two, we find the new common speech, which is based on the standard, but has a strong substratum from the traditional language.\n\nThe Rhinelandic regiolect has several regional and subregional features. Very many approximately coincide with the general dialect groups found in the local languages. For example:\nAs usual, the Low Franconian area in the North uses their own way to build the diminutive. The Central Rhineland between the Benrath line and the Sankt Goar line usually has an intermediate position. In this instance, the South uses their own vocalism that already incorporates parts of the Palatinate German one, found even further South.\n\nLike other jargons and regional varieties, also the Rhinelandic is influencing the Vocabulary of the German Standard. Instances of more recent additions are:\n\nA grammatical deviation too, the \"am\"-Progressive mentioned above, has invaded the colloquial speech of other parts of the German-speaking areas. Experts state that it can be seen as \"almost standard language use in wide parts.\"\n\n\n\nThere are several sound samples of spoken Rhinelandic at the linguistic department at Institut für Landeskunde und Regionalgeschichte of the Landschaftsverband Rheinland:\n"}

His mother was a seamstress and his father owned a small corner store. He attended the Diesterweg Gymnasium where he studied art and design under Horst Henschel. He then studied sociology under Professor Urs Jaeggi at the Free University of Berlin, earning a master's degree. At the Berlin University of the Arts in Berlin in the 1980s, he studied life drawing under Professor Peter Müller. Stelter has also worked as a newspaper boy, a packer, a gardener, a house painter and as a labourer in the metal and construction industries. Since the 1970s he managed cultural exchange projects. He also worked as an academic tutor for Professor Wolfgang Fritz Haug at the Free University Berlin.\n\nIn the 1980s Stelter wrote for the arts sections of Berlin newspapers such as Berliner Extradienst, Die Neue and die Tageszeitung. He was CEO and editor-in-chief of the cultural journal omnibus published by the Akademie der Künste in Berlin, the Hochschule der Künste, the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Berliner Schaubühne, the \"Freunde der Deutschen Kinemathek\" and other major West Berlin cultural institutions. In the 1990s Stelter worked as a designer, content manager and copywriter for advertising agencies. In the late 1990s he was head of public relations for Germany’s largest city planner at that time, the development agency Bornstedter Feld. Stelter co-founded the Galerie Augustus in the Mitte area of Berlin in beginning of the 1990s. The gallery exhibited the works of artists such as Kerstin Grimm, Melanie Manchot, Martin Parr, Eva Rubinstein, Ransome Stanley and Emilio Vedova. Stelter also participated in the launch and organisation of many other cultural and political projects while continuing to work as an author, journalist, painter, sculptor and photographer. In 1983 he co-founded the ‘Aktives Museum Faschismus und Widerstand in Berlin’, serving together with Heinz Schilling as deputy chairman of the board of executives under Gerhard Schoenberner. He was one of the founders of the major project ‘1933-1983’. The project was the first to bring together all of West Berlin’s democratically-oriented political groups for a critical re-evaluation of the Nazi period in Germany. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1993, he launched the major project ‘Upheaval – Chaos and Hope’ (‘Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung’) with the support of the Senate of Berlin and the Treuhand, among others. His experiences with the \"new Europe\" were the inspiration of his international exhibition project ‘My Europe’ (‘Mein Europa’), ongoing since the year 2000.\n\nJune Carolyn Erlick wrote about the project Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung in the New York magazine ARTnews in October 1993:\n\nUlrich Roloff-Momin, Senator for Cultural Affairs Berlin, in the preface to the catalog \"Umbruch – Chaos und Hoffnung\" (\"Upheaval – Chaos and Hope\" [transl.]).

Minneapolis 2005:\n\nRoland Stelter has worked primarily as an author, painter, sculptor and photographer since the 1990s. His painting, drawing and sculpture are strongly influenced by post-war abstract modernism. Stelter met Emilia Vedova in the early 1990s. He and Vedova both participated in group exhibitions in the Galerie Augustus in Berlin and the Yavneh Art Workshop Gallery in Israel. Stelter’s photography strictly follows the principles of classical composition. He typically uses only natural light and avoids effects. Stelter’s work has been included in numerous exhibitions in Germany and around the world. He collaborated with Lutz Dölle on the prize-winning, large-scale sculpture ‘Fragment des Regens’ (‘Fragment of Rain’). He collaborated with a biotechnology company in 1999 to create an exhibit on genetic engineering that included paintings, large-scale photographs and a video installation. His photography and text exhibition ‘Ms Zhuk and her granddaughter’ (‘Frau Zhuk und ihre Enkelin’) was shown in the ‘Topography of Terror – documentation center forced labor memorial’ in Berlin (‘Topographie des Terrors – Dokumentationszentrum NS-Zwangsarbeit’) from fall of 2010 until summer of 2011. The exhibition was about the life of Ms Zhuk, a Ukrainian survivor of Nazi forced labour and concentration camps who was persecuted by the KGB after her return. Large-scale sculptures by Stelter stand in the American Academy of Berlin's private park and in the city centre of Osnabrück.\n\nFollowing his wish, to show political responsibility as an artist, he carried out the photo exhibition «Memories of Europe« in the Chernigov Art Museum M. Galagan in Ukraine in 2014.\n\nIn 2015 the mayor of Potsdam, the minister of science, research and culture in Brandenburg, the Armenian ambassador to Germany, the representative of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation of Berlin-Brandenburg, and the publicist Rolf Hosfeld inaugurated Roland Stelter’s marble sculpture \"Civil Courage.\" The sculpture memorializes Johannes Lepsius, and \"symbolizes the commitment to civil action against genocide and war crimes.\" (Jan Jacobs, mayor of Potsdam). It was placed in the park of the Lepsius Villa in Potsdam, in the former military zone No. 7 where the KGB was based in the GDR, now the home of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation of Berlin-Brandenburg. The location is also within a UNESCO world heritage site including a former KGB prison, the Neuer Garten park with the castle Cecilienhof where the Potsdam Conference was held in August 1945, the Belvedere of Sanssouci castle, and the Villa Henkel.\n\nThe artery magazine about Roland Stelter’s paintings and sculptures: [Gemälde und Steinskulpturen von Roland Stelter\" (\"Painting and stone sculptures by Roland Stelter\" [transl.]), in artery June 1994]\n\nPeter Herbstreuth wrote in the Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel [in: Der Tagesspiegel on 4 July 1994]:\nTom Bullman in the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung on the public sculpture ‘Fragment des Regens’ (‘Fragment of Rain’ [transl.])., May 8, 1999:\n\nSimone Reber in the radio transmission \"Galerie Rundgang\" for Radio Kultur of SFB and ORB about the photo exhibition \"Mythos Moscow\" by Roland Stelter in the Gallery Blickensdorf Berlin, April 24, 2001:\n\nKlaus Jörg Schönmetzler, Rosenheim's cultural attaché, said in a speech at the Galerie’s Christmas exhibition of the ‘Gallery of the Kunst und Kultur zu Hohenaschau e.V.’ in 2008:\n\nJulia Brodauf. ‘Frau Zhuk und ihre Enkelin’ (‘Ms. Zhuk and her granddaughter’ [transl.]), in: magazine ‘Junge Kunst’, Nr. 86, June 2011:\n\nBogdan Gulyay in the Ukrainian internet magazine „Gorod.cn.ua – Portal Tschernigova (Portal Çernigova)\" at August 10, 2014 about the Open Air – Vernissage of he exhibition «Memories of Europe« by Roland Stelter of the Art Museum Chernigov M.

{"id": "13400209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13400209", "title": "Sullivan conjecture", "text": "Sullivan conjecture\n\nIn mathematics, Sullivan conjecture can refer to any of several results and conjectures prompted by homotopy theory work of Dennis Sullivan. A basic theme and motivation concerns the fixed point set in group actions of a finite group formula_1. The most elementary formulation, however, is in terms of the classifying space formula_2 of such a group. Roughly speaking, it is difficult to map such a space formula_2 continuously into a finite CW complex formula_4 in a non-trivial manner. Such a version of the Sullivan conjecture was first proved by Haynes Miller. Specifically, in 1984, Miller proved that the function space, carrying the compact-open topology, of base point-preserving mappings from formula_2 to formula_4 is weakly contractible.\n\nThis is equivalent to the statement that the map formula_4 → formula_8 from X to the function space of maps formula_2 → formula_4, not necessarily preserving the base point, given by sending a point formula_11 of formula_4 to the constant map whose image is formula_11 is a weak equivalence. The mapping space formula_8 is an example of a homotopy fixed point set. Specifically, formula_8 is the homotopy fixed point set of the group formula_1 acting by the trivial action on formula_4. In general, for a group formula_1 acting on a space formula_4, the homotopy fixed points are the fixed points formula_20 of the mapping space formula_21 of maps from the universal cover formula_22 of formula_2 to formula_4 under the formula_1-action on formula_21 given by formula_27 in formula_1 acts on a map formula_29 in formula_21 by sending it to formula_31. The formula_1-equivariant map from formula_22 to a single point formula_34 induces a natural map η: formula_35→formula_20 from the fixed points to the homotopy fixed points of formula_1 acting on formula_4. Miller's theorem is that η is a weak equivalence for trivial formula_1-actions on finite-dimensional CW complexes. An important ingredient and motivation (see [1]) for his proof is a result of Gunnar Carlsson on the homology of formula_40 as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra.\n\nMiller's theorem generalizes to a version of Sullivan's conjecture in which the action on formula_4 is allowed to be non-trivial. In, Sullivan conjectured that η is a weak equivalence after a certain p-completion procedure due to A. Bousfield and D. Kan for the group formula_42. This conjecture was incorrect as stated, but a correct version was given by Miller, and proven independently by Dwyer-Miller-Neisendorfer, Carlsson, and Jean Lannes, showing that the natural map formula_43 → formula_44 is a weak equivalence when the order of formula_1 is a power of a prime p, and where formula_46 denotes the Bousfield-Kan p-completion of formula_4. Miller's proof involves an unstable Adams spectral sequence, Carlsson's proof uses his affirmative solution of the Segal conjecture and also provides information about the homotopy fixed points formula_48 before completion, and Lannes's proof involves his T-functor.\n\n"}

With its speakers variously estimated to be between 30,000 and 80,000, the UNESCO designates Svan as a \"definitely endangered language\". It is of particular interest because it has retained many archaic features that have been lost in the other South-Caucasian languages.\n\nLike all languages of the Caucasian language family, Svan has a large number of consonants. It has agreement between subject and object, and a split-ergative morphosyntactic system. Verbs are marked for aspect, evidentiality and \"version\".\n\nSvan retains the voiceless aspirated uvular plosive, , and the glides /w/ and /j/. It has a larger vowel inventory than Georgian; the Upper Bal dialect of Svan has the most vowels of any South-Caucasian language, having both long and short versions of plus , a total of 18 vowels (Georgian, by contrast, has just five).\n\nIts morphology is less regular than that of the other three sister languages, and there are notable differences in verbal inflections.\n\nSvan is the native language of fewer than 30,000 Svans (15,000 of whom are Upper Svan dialect speakers and 12,000 are Lower Svan), living in the mountains of Svaneti, i.e. in the districts of Mestia and Lentekhi of Georgia, along the Enguri, Tskhenistsqali and Kodori rivers. Some Svan speakers live in the Kodori Valley of the de facto independent republic of Abkhazia. Although conditions there make it difficult to reliably establish their numbers, there are only an estimated 2,500 Svan individuals living there.\n\nThe language is used in familiar and casual social communication. It has no written standard or official status. Most speakers also speak Georgian, the country's official language, and use it as their literary and business language. There is no official instruction in Svan, and the number of speakers is declining due to the dispersal of the Svan population in the face of increasing economic hardship and due to the campaign of the Georgian government to \"georgianize\" the svanetian people. The Georgian government does not recognize the Svanetian language as an language due to fear of separatism, despite the great difference between the two languages. The language is regarded as being endangered, as proficiency in it among young people is limited.\n\nSvan is the most differentiated member of the four South-Caucasian languages and is believed to have split off in the 2nd millennium BC or earlier, about one thousand years before Georgian did.\n\nThe Svan language is divided into the following dialects and subdialects:\n\n\nApart from the odd , only Upper Bal and Lashkh dialects have long vowels. Only Upper Bal has ; Lashkh does not have the front rounded vowels .\n\nThe alphabet, illustrated above, is similar to the Mingrelian alphabet, with a few additional letters otherwise obsolete in the Georgian script:\n\nThese are supplemented by diacritics on the vowels (the umlaut for front vowels and macron for length), though those are not normally written. The digraphs \nare used in the Lower Bal and Lentekh dialects, and occasionally in Upper Bal; these sounds do not occur in Lashkh dialect.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1674289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1674289", "title": "Syntactic hierarchy", "text": "Syntactic hierarchy\n\nSyntactics, or syntax, is concerned with the way sentences are constructed from smaller parts, such as words and phrases. Two steps can be distinguished in the study of syntactics. The first step is to identify different types of units in the stream of speech and writing. In natural languages, such units include sentences, phrases, and words. The second step is to analyze how these units build up larger patterns, and in particular to find general rules that govern the construction of sentences.\n\nThis can be broken down into constituents, which are a group of words that are organized as a unit, and the organization of those constituents. They are organized in a hierarchical structure, by embedding inside one another to form larger constituents.\n\nIn Chomsky’s view, humans are born with innate knowledge of certain principles that guide them in developing the grammar of their language. In other words, Chomsky’s theory is that language learning is facilitated by a predisposition that our brains have for certain structures of language. This implies in turn that all languages have a common structural basis: the set of rules known as \"universal grammar\". The theory of universal grammar entails that humans are born with an innate knowledge (or structural rules) of certain principles that guide them in developing the grammar of their language.\n\nFor example:\n\nRegarded as the \"Founder of Structural Linguistics\", which reflects the concept of structuralism, de Saussure stated the ways in which human culture requires an overarching structure to relate to in order to communicate. He defines language to be different than human speech, which is fundamental and essential to language. While speech is a combination of several disciplines (i.e. physical, psychological, etc.) and is part of an individual and their society, language is a system of classification of its own entity.\n\nDe Saussure argues that in written language, words are chained together in sequence on the chain of speaking, and therefore gain relations based on the linear nature of language. Language, however, is not simply a classification for universal concepts, as translating from one language to another proves to be a difficult task. Each Languages organizes their own world differently, and do not name existing categories, rather articulate their own. This idea explains that though languages can differ within levels of Syntactic Hierarchy, all languages encompass the same set of levels.\n\nSeparate sentences can combine together to create one sentence. For example, the sentence “The boy chased the ball” and “He didn’t catch it” can be combined together. You can do this in many ways including stringing one sentence after the other or joining the sentences with conjunctions.1. “The boy chased the ball, he didn’t catch it.”2. “The boy chased the ball, but he didn’t catch it.”3. “The boy chased the ball, and he didn’t catch it.”\n\nPhrases combined to form sentences. The phrase “the girl” combines with the phrase “ran away” to form the sentence: “The girl ran away.” \n\nWords combine to form phrases. The word “the” combines with “girl” to form the phrase: “The girl” \n\nMorphemes combine to form words. Morphemes belong to categories that determine how they combine. For example, the word 'manageable' is made up of two morphemes 'manage' which is a verb and 'able' which is an adjective, these categories tell the morphemes how to combine so they form the word 'manageable.' \n\nSmallest meaningful unit in a word. For example, “boys” has two morphemes “boy” and “-s.” \n\nA unit of sound such as individual consonants and vowels of a language. For example, /p/, /t/ and /æ/ are phonemes in English. \n\nA subset of sounds which demonstrates the different variations of a phoneme. Diacritics can be used to represent this, for example aspiration can be added to the letter /p/ in the word /pʰɪt/. \n\nRefers to ambiguous streams of words with spaces in between. For example, this can represent how an infant may hear human speech.\n\nSentences are the hierarchal structure of combined phrases. When constructing a sentence, two types of phrases are always necessary: Noun Phrase (NP) and Verb Phrase (VP), forming the simplest possible sentence. What determines whether a sentence is grammatically constructed (i.e. the sentence makes sense to a native speaker of the language), is its adherence to the language's phrase structure rules, allowing a language to generate large numbers of sentences. Languages cross-linguistically differ in their phrase structure rules, resulting in the difference of order of the NP and VP, and other phrases included in a sentence. Languages which do have the similar phrase structure rules, however, will translate so that a sentence from one language will be grammatical when translated into the target language.\n\nFrench example: \nThe French sentence directly translates to English, demonstrating that the phrase structures of both languages are very similar.\n\nThe idea that words combine to form phrases. For example, the word “the” combines with word “dog” to form the phrase “the dog”. A is a sequence of words or a group of words arranged in a grammatical way to combine and form a sentence. There are five commonly occurring types of phrases; Noun phrases (NP), Adjective phrases (AdjP), Verb phrases (VP), Adverb Phrases (AdvP), and Prepositional Phrases (PP).The idea that words combine to form phrases. For example, the word “the” combines with word “dog” to form the phrase “the dog” . Furthermore, hierarchical combinations of words in their formation of phrasal categories are apparent in French as well.\n\nFrench examples: \n\nA noun phrase refers to a phrase that is built upon a noun. For example, “ The dog” or “the girl” in the sentence “the dog loved the girl” act as noun phrases.\n\nVerb phrase refers to a phrase that is composed of at least one main verb and one or more helping/auxiliary verb (every sentence needs at least one main verb). For example, the word “loved the girl” in the sentence “the dog loved the girl” acts as a verb phrase.\n\n\"see also\" Adjective phrases (AdjP), Adverb phrases (AdvP), and Prepositional phrases (PP)\n\nA phrase structure tree shows that a sentence is both linear string of words and a hierarchical structure with phrases nested in phrases (combination of phrase structures) A phrase structure tree is a formal device for representing speaker’s knowledge about phrase structure in speech. The syntactic category of each individual word appears immediately above that word. In this way, “the” is shown to be a determiner, “child” is a noun, and so on.\n\nThe subdomain that deals with words is morphology, which states that words are made up of morphemes which combine in a regular and rule-governed fashion.\n\nFor example, the word 'national' is made up of two morphemes 'nation' which is a noun and '-al' which is a suffix that means pertaining to, this meaning helps us in categorizing '-al' as an adjective. These categories aid in arranging the morphemes so they can combine in a way that will form the word 'national,’ which is an adjective.\n\nMorphology states that words come in categories, and the morphemes that join together to create the word assign the category. The two main categories are open class, where new words can be created and closed class where there is a limited number of members. Within both of these categories there are further sub-categories. Open class includes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, and closed class includes: prepositions, determiners, numerals, complementizers, auxiliaries, modals, coordinators, and negation/affirmation. These sub categories can be further broken down for example, verbs can be either transitive or intransitive. These categories can be identified with semantic criteria about what a word means, for instance nouns are said to be people, places, or things while verbs are actions. Words are all placed in these categories and depending on their category they follow specific rules that determine their word order.\n\nCross-Linguistically other languages form words similarly to English. This is done by having morphemes of different categories combine in a rule governed fashion in order to create the word.\n\nFrench example:\n\nIn artificial languages, lexemes, tokens, and formulas are usually found among the basic units.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31438", "title": "Tagalog language", "text": "Tagalog language\n\nTagalog (; ) is an Austronesian language spoken as a first language by a quarter of the population of the Philippines and as a second language by the majority. Its standardized form, officially named \"Filipino\", is the national language of the Philippines, and is one of two official languages alongside English.\n\nIt is related to other Philippine languages, such as the Bikol languages, Ilocano, the Visayan languages, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan, and more distantly to other Austronesian languages, such as the Formosan languages of Taiwan, Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Hawaiian, Māori, and Malagasy. Tagalog is the predominant language used in the \"tanaga\", a type of Filipino poem and the indigenous poetic art of the Tagalog people.\n\nThe word \"Tagalog\" is derived from the endonym \"taga-log\" (\"river dweller\"), composed of \"tagá-\" (\"native of\" or \"from\") and \"ilog\" (\"river\"). Linguists such as Dr. David Zorc and Dr. Robert Blust speculate that the Tagalogs and other Central Philippine ethno-linguistic groups originated in Northeastern Mindanao or the Eastern Visayas.\n\nThe first written record of Tagalog is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, which dates to 900 CE and exhibits fragments of the language along with Sanskrit, Old Malay, Javanese and Old Tagalog. The first known complete book to be written in Tagalog is the \"Doctrina Christiana\" (Christian Doctrine), printed in 1593. The \"Doctrina\" was written in Spanish and two transcriptions of Tagalog; one in the ancient, then-current Baybayin script and the other in an early Spanish attempt at a Latin orthography for the language.\n\nThroughout the 333 years of Spanish rule, various grammars and dictionaries were written by Spanish clergymen. In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San Jose published the “Arte y reglas de la Lengua Tagala” (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala” in Pila, Laguna.\n\nThe first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the Czech Jesuit missionary Pablo Clain in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books. He prepared the dictionary, which he later passed over to Francisco Jansens and José Hernandez. Further compilation of his substantial work was prepared by P. Juan de Noceda and P. Pedro de Sanlucar and published as \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala\" in Manila in 1754 and then repeatedly reedited, with the last edition being in 2013 in Manila.\n\nAmong others, \"Arte de la lengua tagala y manual tagalog para la administración de los Santos Sacramentos\" (1850) in addition to early studies of the language.\n\nThe indigenous poet Francisco Baltazar (1788–1862) is regarded as the foremost Tagalog writer, his most notable work being the early 19th-century epic \"Florante at Laura\".\n\nTagalog differs from its Central Philippine counterparts with its treatment of the Proto-Philippine schwa vowel . In most Bikol and Visayan languages, this sound merged with and . In Tagalog, it has merged with . For example, Proto-Philippine (adhere, stick) is Tagalog \"dikít\" and Visayan & Bikol \"dukot\".\n\nProto-Philippine , , and merged with but is between vowels. Proto-Philippine (name) and (kiss) became Tagalog \"ngalan\" and \"halík\".\n\nProto-Philippine merged with . (water) and (blood) became Tagalog \"tubig\" and \"dugô\".\n\nTagalog was declared the official language by the first revolutionary constitution in the Philippines, the in 1897.\n\nIn 1935, the Philippine constitution designated English and Spanish as official languages, but mandated the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages. After study and deliberation, the National Language Institute, a committee composed of seven members who represented various regions in the Philippines, chose Tagalog as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines. President Manuel L. Quezon then, on December 30, 1937, proclaimed the selection of the Tagalog language to be used as the basis for the evolution and adoption of the national language of the Philippines. In 1939, President Quezon renamed the proposed Tagalog-based national language as \"Wikang Pambansâ\" (national language). Under the Japanese puppet government during World War II, Tagalog as a national language was strongly promoted; the 1943 Constitution specifying: The government shall take steps toward the development and propagation of Tagalog as the national language.\".\n\nIn 1959, the language was further renamed as \"Pilipino\". Along with English, the national language has had official status under the 1973 constitution (as \"Pilipino\") and the present 1987 constitution (as Filipino).\n\nThe adoption of Tagalog in 1937 as basis for a national language is not without its own controversies. Instead of specifying Tagalog, the national language was designated as \"Wikang Pambansâ\" (\"National Language\") in 1939. Twenty years later, in 1959, it was renamed by then Secretary of Education, José Romero, as \"Pilipino\" to give it a national rather than ethnic label and connotation. The changing of the name did not, however, result in acceptance among non-Tagalogs, especially Cebuanos who had not accepted the selection.\n\nThe national language issue was revived once more during the 1971 Constitutional Convention. Majority of the delegates were even in favor of scrapping the idea of a \"national language\" altogether. A compromise solution was worked out—a \"universalist\" approach to the national language, to be called \"Filipino\" rather than \"Pilipino\". The 1973 constitution makes no mention of Tagalog. When a new constitution was drawn up in 1987, it named Filipino as the national language. The constitution specified that as the Filipino language evolves, it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages. However, more than two decades after the institution of the \"universalist\" approach, there seems to be little if any difference between Tagalog and Filipino.\n\nMany of the older generation in the Philippines feel that the replacement of English by Tagalog in the popular visual media has had dire economic effects regarding the competitiveness of the Philippines in trade and overseas remittances.\n\nUpon the issuance of Executive Order No. 134, Tagalog was declared as basis of the National Language. On 12th of April 1940, Executive No. 263 was issued ordering the teaching of the national language in all public and private schools in the country. \nArticle XIV, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines specifies, in part:\n\nIn 2009, the Department of Education promulgated an order institutionalizing a system of mother-tongue based multilingual education (\"MLE\"), wherein instruction is conducted primarily in a student's mother tongue (one of the various regional Philippine languages) until at least grade three, with additional languages such as Filipino and English being introduced as separate subjects no earlier than grade two. In secondary school, Filipino and English become the primary languages of instruction, with the learner's first language taking on an auxiliary role. After pilot tests in selected schools, the MLE program was implemented nationwide from School Year (SY) 2012-2013.\n\nIt is the first language of a quarter of the population of the Philippines (particularly in Central Luzon) and a second language of the majority.\n\nTagalog is a Central Philippine language within the Austronesian language family. Being Malayo-Polynesian, it is related to other Austronesian languages, such as Malagasy, Javanese, Malay (Malaysian and Indonesian), Tetum (of Timor), and Yami (of Taiwan). It is closely related to the languages spoken in the Bicol Region and the Visayas islands, such as the Bikol group and the Visayan group, including Waray-Waray, Hiligaynon and Cebuano.\n\nAt present, no comprehensive dialectology has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. Ethnologue lists Manila, Lubang, Marinduque, Bataan (Western Central Luzon), Batangas, Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the Bulacan dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.\n\nSome example of dialectal differences are:\n\nPerhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque. Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.\n\nOne example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.\n\nNorthern and central dialects form the basis for the national language.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Authority, as of 2014 there were 100 million people living in the Philippines, where almost all of whom will have some basic level of understanding of the language. The Tagalog homeland, Katagalugan, covers roughly much of the central to southern parts of the island of Luzon—particularly in Aurora, Bataan, Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Metro Manila, Nueva Ecija, Quezon, Rizal and Zambales. Tagalog is also spoken natively by inhabitants living on the islands of Marinduque and Mindoro, as well as Palawan to a lesser extent. It is spoken by approximately 64 million Filipinos, 96% of the household population; 22 million, or 28% of the total Philippine population, speak it as a native language.\n\nTagalog speakers are found in other parts of the Philippines as well as throughout the world, though its use is usually limited to communication between Filipino ethnic groups. 2010, the US Census bureau reported (based on data collected in 2007) that in the United States it was the fourth most-spoken language at home with almost 1.5 million speakers, behind Spanish or Spanish Creole, French (including Patois, Cajun, Creole), and Chinese. Tagalog ranked as the third most spoken language in metropolitan statistical areas, behind Spanish and Chinese but ahead of French.\n\nThe Tagalog language also boasts accentations unique to some parts of Tagalog-speaking regions. For example, in some parts of Manila, a strong pronunciation of \"i\" exists and vowel-switching of \"o\" and \"u\" exists so words like \"gising\" (to wake) is pronounced as \"giseng\" with a strong 'e' and the word \"tagu-taguan\" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as \"tago-tagoan\" with a mild 'o'.\n\nBatangas Tagalog boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language. The Batangas accent has been featured in film and television and Filipino actor Leo Martinez speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangueños as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.\n\nBulacan Tagalog has more deep words and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.\n\nQuezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents.\n\nCavite's were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga.\n\nLaguna also has a different set of accents.\n\nNueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.\n\n\"Taglish\" and \"Englog\" are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.\n\nCode-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are \"Filipinized\" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.\n\nCity-dwellers are more likely to do this.\n\nThe practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like Wells Fargo, Wal-Mart, Albertsons, McDonald's, and Western Union have contained Taglish.\n\nTagalog has 33 phonemes: 19 of them are consonants and 14 are vowels. Syllable structure is relatively simple, being maximally \"consonant-ar-vowel-consonant\", where \"consonant-ar\" only occurs in borrowed words such as \"trak\" \"truck\" or \"sombréro\" \"hat\".\n\nTagalog has ten simple vowels, five long and five short, and four diphthongs. Before appearing in the area north of Pasig river, Tagalog had three vowel qualities: , , and . This was later expanded to five with the introduction of words from Northern Philippine languages like Kapampangan and Ilocano and Spanish words.\n\nNevertheless, simplification of pairs and is likely to take place, especially in some Tagalog as second language, remote location and worker class registers.\n\nThe four diphthongs are , , , and . Long vowels are not written apart from pedagogical texts, where an acute accent is used: \"á é í ó ú.\"\n\nThe table above shows all the possible realizations for each of the five vowel sounds depending on the speaker's origin or proficiency. The five general vowels are in bold.\n\nBelow is a chart of Tagalog consonants. All the stops are unaspirated. The velar nasal occurs in all positions including at the beginning of a word. Loanword variants using these phonemes are italicized inside the angle brackets.\n\nGlottal stop is not indicated. Glottal stops are most likely to occur when:\n\nLexical stress, coupled with glottalization, is a distinctive feature in Tagalog. Primary stress normally occurs on either the final or the penultimate syllable of a word. Long vowel accompany primary or secondary stress unless the stress occurs at the end of a word.\n\nTagalog words are often distinguished from one another by the position of the stress and the presence of the glottal stop. In general, there are four types of phonetic emphases, which, in formal or academic settings, are indicated with a diacritic (\"tuldík\") above the vowel. The penultimate primary stress position (\"malumay\") is the default stress type and so is left unwritten except in dictionaries. The name of each stress type has its corresponding diacritic in the final vowel.\n\nTagalog, like other Philippines languages today, is written using the Latin alphabet. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an abugida–or alphasyllabary—called Baybayin. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages Trinidad Pardo de Tavera published his study on the ancient Tagalog script \"Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos\" and in 1887, published his essay \"El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog\" which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography). A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter ⟨k⟩ rather than ⟨c⟩ and ⟨q⟩ to represent the phoneme .\n\nIn 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog \"La España Oriental\" newspaper, of which Isabelo de los Reyes was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would \"use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis\". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of \"La España\", Pascual H. Poblete's \"Revista Católica de Filipina\" began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters \"k\" and \"w\" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as \"unpatriotic\". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as \"La Lectura Popular\" in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles. Pedro Laktaw, a schoolteacher, published the first Spanish-Tagalog dictionary using the new orthography in 1890.\n\nIn April 1890, Jose Rizal authored an article \"Sobre la Nueva Ortografia de la Lengua Tagalog\" in the Madrid-based periodical La Solidaridad. In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as \"more perfect\" than what he himself had developed. The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century. The revolutionary society Kataás-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng̃ mg̃á Anak ng̃ Bayan or Katipunan made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.\n\nIn 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's national language. In 1940, the \"Balarílà ng Wikang Pambansâ\" () of grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced the Abakada alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language. The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.\n\nTagalog was written in an abugida—or alphasyllabary—called Baybayin prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular writing system was composed of symbols representing three vowels and 14 consonants. Belonging to the Brahmic family of scripts, it shares similarities with the Old Kawi script of Java and is believed to be descended from the script used by the Bugis in Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the Latin alphabet taught by the Spaniards during their rule.\n\nThere has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an abugida, or an alphasyllabary, rather than an alphabet. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.\n\nA \"kudlit\" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an \"E\" or \"I\" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an \"O\" or \"U\" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, \"bundok\" being rendered as \"budo\"), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.\n\nExample:\nBaybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name \"Tagalog\".\n\nUntil the first half of the 20th century, Tagalog was widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography consisting of 32 letters called 'ABECEDARIO' (Spanish for \"alphabet\"):\n\nWhen the national language was based on Tagalog, grammarian Lope K. Santos introduced a new alphabet consisting of 20 letters called \"ABAKADA\" in school grammar books called \"balarilà\":\n\nIn 1987, the Department of Education, Culture and Sports issued a memo stating that the Philippine alphabet had changed from the Pilipino-Tagalog Abakada version to a new 28-letter alphabet to make room for loans, especially family names from Spanish and English:\n\nThe genitive marker \"ng\" and the plural marker \"mga\" (e.g. \"Iyan ang mga damit ko.\" (Those are my clothes)) are abbreviations that are pronounced \"nang\" and \"mangá\" . \"Ng\", in most cases, roughly translates to \"of\" (ex. \"Siya ay kapatid ng nanay ko.\" She is the sibling \"of\" my mother) while \"nang\" usually means \"when\" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix \"-ly\" in English adverbs), among other uses. \n\nIn the first example, \"nang\" is used in lieu of the word \"noong\" (when; \"Noong si Hudas ay madulas\"). In the second, \"nang\" describes that the person woke up (\"gumising\") early (\"maaga\"); \"gumising nang maaga\". In the third, \"nang\" described up to what extent that Juan improved (\"gumaling\"), which is \"greatly\" (\"nang \"). In the latter two examples, the ligature \"na\" and its variants \"-ng\" and \"-g\" may also be used (\"Gumising na maaga/Maagang gumising\"; \"Gumaling na /Todong gumaling\").\n\nThe longer \"nang\" may also have other uses, such as a ligature that joins a repeated word:\n\nThe words \"pô/hô\" and \"opò/ohò\" are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative \"oo\" (\"yes\"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.\n\n\"Pô\" and \"opò\" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. \"Hô\" and \"ohò\" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, \"pô\" and \"opò\" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.\n\nUsed in the affirmative:\n\n\"Pô/Hô\" may also be used in negation.\n\nTagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the diphthongs -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit reduplication (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.\n\nTagalog also includes many loanwords from English, Indian languages (Sanskrit and Tamil), Chinese languages (Hokkien, Cantonese, Mandarin), Japanese, Arabic and Persian.\n\nDue to trade with Mexico via the Manila galleons from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from Nahuatl were introduced to Tagalog, but some of them were replaced by Spanish loanwords in the latter part of the Spanish colonization in the islands.\n\nThe Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, Silk Road, Tang Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Ryukyu Kingdom and Manila Galleon trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).\n\nIn pre-Hispanic times, Trade Malay was widely known and spoken throughout Maritime Southeast Asia.\n\nEnglish has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, balisong, boondocks, jeepney, Manila hemp, pancit, ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of Philippine English.\n\nTagalog has contributed several words to Philippine Spanish, like \"barangay\" (from \"balan͠gay,\" meaning \"barrio\"), the \"abacá\", \"cogon\", \"palay\", \"dalaga\" etc.\nBelow is a chart of Tagalog and a number of other Austronesian languages comparing thirteen words.\n\nReligious literature remains one of the most dynamic contributors to Tagalog literature. The first Bible in Tagalog, then called \"Ang Biblia\" (\"the Bible\") and now called \"Ang Dating Biblia\" (\"the Old Bible\"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the Philippine Bible Society translated the Bible into modern Tagalog. Even before the Second Vatican Council, devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible\n\nWhen the Second Vatican Council, (specifically the Sacrosanctum Concilium) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into vernacular languages, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines was one of the first to translate the Roman Missal into Tagalog. The Roman Missal in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941 and \"The Watchtower\" (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.\n\nTagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic Bible translations. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, liturgical prayers tend to be more ecumenical.\n\nIn Tagalog, the Lord's Prayer is exclusively known by its incipit, \"Amá Namin\" (literally, \"Our Father\").\n\nThis is Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (\"Pángkalahatáng Pagpapahayag ng Karapatáng Pantao\")\n\n\"Bawat tao'y isinilang na may layà at magkakapantáy ang tagláy na dangál at karapatán. Silá'y pinagkalooban ng pangangatwiran at budhî na kailangang gamitin nilá sa pagtuturingan nilá sa diwà ng pagkakapatiran.\"\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\n\nThe numbers (\"mga numero\") in Tagalog language are of two sets. The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number \"seven\", it can be translated into Tagalog as \"\"pito\" or \"syete\"\" (Spanish: \"siete\").\n\nMonths and days in Tagalog are also localised forms of Spanish months and days. \"Month\" in Tagalog is \"buwán\" (also the word for moon) and \"day\" is \"araw\" (the word also means sun). Unlike Spanish, however, months and days in Tagalog are always capitalised.\n\nTime expressions in Tagalog are also Tagalized forms of the corresponding Spanish. \"Time\" in Tagalog is \"panahon\", or more commonly \"oras\". Unlike Spanish and English, times in Tagalog are capitalized whenever they appear in a sentence.\n\n\"Ang hindî marunong lumingón sa pinánggalingan ay hindî makaráratíng sa paroroonan\". (José Rizal)One who knows not how to look back from whence he came, will never get to where he is going.\n\n\"Tao ka nang humarap, bilang tao kitang haharapin.\"(A proverb in Southern Tagalog that made people aware the significance of sincerity in Tagalog communities. It says, \"As a human you reach me, I treat you as a human and never act as a traitor.\")\n\n\"Hulí man daw at magalíng, nakákahábol pa rin. (Hulí man raw at magalíng, nakákahabol pa rin.)\"If one is behind but capable, one will still be able to catch up.\n\n\"Magbirô ka na sa lasíng, huwág lang sa bagong gising\".Make fun of someone drunk, if you must, but never one who has just awakened.\n\n\"Aanhín pa ang damó kung patáy na ang kabayo?\"What use is the grass if the horse is already dead?\n\n\"Ang sakít ng kalingkingan, ramdám ng buóng katawán.\"The pain in the pinkie is felt by the whole body.\n\n\"Nasa hulí ang pagsisisi.\"Regret is always in the end.\n\n\"Pagkáhabà-habà man ng prusisyón, sa simbahan pa rin ang tulóy.\"The procession may stretch on and on, but it still ends up at the church.\n\n\"Kung 'dî mádaán sa santóng dasalan, daanin sa santóng paspasan.\"If it cannot be got through holy prayer, get it through blessed force.\n\n\n\n() Calabarzon and Mimaropa\n\n\n"}

The festival is dedicated to the Pulitzer prize-winning American playwright Tennessee Williams. Every year, it features several events related to the long career of that writer, as well as writing workshops, panel discussions, literary readings, stage performances, a book fair, music, writing contests, and other events related to American literature, poetry, drama, opera, film, photography, art, history, culture, and cooking. The signature event is the \"Stella and Stanley Shouting Contest\" that closes the festival. \n\nThe festival in New Orleans is not related to the Mississippi Delta Tennessee Williams Festival in Clarksdale, Mississippi, which is held annually in October in the childhood hometown of Tennessee Williams.\n\nTennessee Williams was not native to New Orleans, but he lived in New Orleans's French Quarter at several points in his adult life. Two of his major plays, \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"Vieux Carré\", and several short stories were set in the historic French Quarter. Shortly after Williams death in 1983, the city of New Orleans experienced an economic recession. Among the proposals to attract tourists back to the French Quarter and revitalize the local economy was the creation of a literary festival dedicated to Williams. \n\nThe first Tennessee Williams Festival was a two-day event held in 1986, drawing an estimated 500 attendees. However, the event quickly grew, and now attracts over 10,000 attendees every year. In March 2006, the festival was also the first major festival to be held in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, as the French Quarter was not flooded during the disaster. Principal sponsors of the Festival include the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, the Historic New Orleans Collection, the University of New Orleans, Tulane University, and the Le Petit Theatre.\n\nThe five-day Festival is held on the weekend nearest March 26, the birthday of Tennessee Williams. This is usually the fourth week of March. Festival events are held at several sites around the French Quarter. \n\nHalf of these events are either speakers or discussion panels, featuring experts from literature, theater, film, the arts, history, culture, and other topics. In addition to these panels, there are master classes for aspiring writers, including advice from published writers, literary agents, and editors in the publishing industry. The Festival also hosts musical performances by local musicians. \n\nPast speakers have included Pulitzer-prize winning and best selling authors Edward Albee, Robert Olen Butler, Richard Ford, Michael Cunningham, Phillip Caputo, Rick Bragg, and Yusef Komunyakaa. Other speakers have included writers Anne Rice, Cokie Roberts, Michael Cunningham, John Waters, Nora Roberts, Stephen E. Ambrose, Douglas Brinkley, James Carville, Andrei Codrescu, Sue Grafton, Margaret Atwood, Larry Brown, Margaret Walker, Fannie Flagg, Allen Gilchrist, Kaye Gibbons, Dorothy Allison, Barry Gifford, Rex Reed, Peggy Scott Labrode, and Errol Laborde, as well as actors Patricia Clarkson, Stephanie Zimbalist, Alec Baldwin, John Goodman, Tab Hunter, Dixie Carter, Gerald McRaney, Elizabeth Ashley, Anne Jackson, Eli Wallach, and Kim Hunter. Tennessee Williams brother, Dakin Williams, was a frequent guest at the Festival until his death in 2008.\n\nAnother major feature of the Festival is its theatrical productions, including productions of full-length plays and one-act plays by Tennessee Williams himself, as well as other writers. In 1992, the Festival began hosting a one-act play contest. The winning plays are premiered at the Festival, and have become one of the Festival's most anticipated events. The Festival also sponsors poetry and short fiction contests.\n\nThe Festival highlights other contemporary Southern artists, such as the New Orleans novelist John Kennedy Toole and other writers from New Orleans. However, Tennessee Williams remains the focus of the Festival. His previously unpublished writings are often made public at the Festival, including premiere performances of newly discovered works. A scholars conference is held every year, and an academic journal, \"The Tennessee Williams Annual Review\", is associated with this conference. Since the first festival in 1986, there has been a guided walking tour to 722 Toulouse St. and other French Quarter residences where Williams once lived. \n\nAnd since 1996, the Festival has ended with the popular \"Stella and Stanley Shouting Contest\", a tribute to the third scene from A Streetcar Named Desire. The contest is open to the public and held on the last day of the Festival, usually Sunday afternoon, in Jackson Square. Actors playing the role of Stella and Stanely provoke the contestants from a gallery from one of the Pontalba Buildlings, and after the first round of tryouts, a second round takes place, where finalists compete for prizes and trophies.\n\n"}

Hayakawa to advocate the adoption of English as the official language of the United States.\n\nThe group operates two separate nonprofit entities out of its headquarters in Washington, D.C.—U.S. English, Inc. and the U.S. English Foundation.\n\nMauro E. Mujica has been the Chair and CEO of U.S. English since 1993. He was educated at Columbia University and holds bachelor's and master's degrees in Architecture. A naturalized citizen, Mujica was born in Antofagasta, Chile, and moved to the United States in 1964. An architect by trade, Mujica was the Chairman/CEO of the Pace Group, an international architecture and planning firm, from 1983 to 1987. He is fluent in five languages.\n\nEarly advisory board members included Alistair Cooke, Saul Bellow, Walter Cronkite, Norman Cousins, Gore Vidal, Norman Podhoretz. Some of them are no longer affiliated with the group. Schwarzenegger is still a board member. The gallerist André Emmerich (d. 2007), Charles Scripps, Togo Tanaka and the Nobel Prize laureate Rosalyn Yalow (d. 2007) were among the other past members of the advisory board.\n\nCurrent members of the Advisory Board include: Edward A. Capano, Denton Cooley, M.D., Midge Decter, Jorge Delgado, Dinesh Desai, Mrs. Richard DeVos, George Gilder, Nathan Glazer, Ph.D., Charles Gogolak, Lee Majors, Laura McKenzie, Harvey Meyerhoff, Barbara Mujica, Ph.D., Alex Olmedo, Arnold Palmer, Margie Petersen, Norman Podhoretz, Donald M. Ross, Randolph Rowland, James Schlesinger, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Norman D. Shumway, Rodney Smith, Alex Trebek, George W. Wilson, and Roger Wildermuth . To date, the United States federal government has recognized no official language, even though nearly all federal, state and local government business is conducted in English. Some states and territories do have English as an official language; a few have passed laws embracing another language alongside English, such as Hawaiian in the state of Hawaii. In total, 32 states have English as their official language. The U.S. House of Representatives passed English as the official language in 1996, but the Senate did not act on the measure before the conclusion of the 104th Congress.\n\nFor U.S. English, making English the official language of the United States means that all government business must be conducted in English \"with commonsense exceptions\" of necessity, such as disseminating public-health information to non-English speaking communities.\n\nOpponents of the goals of the U.S. English organization or of English as \"the\" official language object that the practice would express a bias against immigrants who have yet to learn English. In response, U.S. English argues that this would encourage immigrants to learn English more quickly, thereby reaping greater economic and political benefits. Thus, in the view of many supporters of this approach—including members of other English-only advocacy groups—the move to make English the only official language can have benefits for non-English speakers, and is not a form of legalized discrimination.\n\nWalter Cronkite was once a board member of the organization, and Linda Chavez was once executive director. A leak by the \"Arizona Republic\" newspaper of a memo from John Tanton, which many including Cronkite, who called the memo \"embarrassing\", believed went too far in its characterization of Latinos, prompted Chavez and Cronkite to resign. John Tanton was ousted from the group in 1988 following the leak of the memo, and is no longer associated with it; he later went on to found his own group, ProEnglish.\n\n"}
