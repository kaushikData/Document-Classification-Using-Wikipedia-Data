He wrote tough scientific ideas in an easy fashion suitable for children and teenagers. This writing style brought him fame as a pioneer of science writing in Bengali. He is the first Bangladeshi writer who has won UNESCO Kalingo prize.\n\nBorn in a village in Sirajgonj district, Muti was the eldest among five sons and six daughters of Sheikh Moin Shorfuddin and Halima Shrfuddin. In 1945, attending matriculation (presently SSC) from Muslim High School, Dhaka he placed second in Kolkata board. Two years later he passes IA exam (presently HSC) and got admitted in Dhaka University. He completed his B.Sc and M.Sc. in Physics standing first class first in 1952 and 1953 respectively. Then he got a scholarship from US government and went to University of Chicago, Illinois. There he accomplished MA(education) and PhD(education) in 1960 and 1962 respectively.\n\nAbdullah-Al-Muti started his career as a lecturer in Physics at the Rajshahi Government College in 1954. He became Professor in the same college in 1955. He held the post Director, Education Extension Center, Dhaka from 1965 to 1973. He also assumed office as Education and Culture Councilor at different foreign embassies of Bangladesh, Joint Secretary, Additional Secretary and Secretary at Education and Science Ministry at different times. After his retirement in 1986, he was the chief adviser of Secondary Scientific Education Program financed by ADB and UNDP. Besides he also presented several science related popular programs in radio and television.\n\nMuti started writing on science since his school days. At that time he contributed articles to the Dainik Azad ('Mukuler Mahfil') and Monthly Mohammadi. He was also associated with editing tabloid magazines named 'Mukul' and 'Mukul Fouz'. Besides, he also wrote about prospects of education in the Monthly 'Hullor' and 'Dilruba.\n\nThe prominent writer authored 27 books on science and education. He also translated 10 books from English into Bengali. He was the Executive Editor of Unesco Batayan, a quarterly Bengali edition of Unesco Courier from 1982 to until his death.\n\nSome notable books of Abdullah-Al-Muti are:\n\n"}

Although the term ‘Dinik’ can be used to designate the language regardless of cultural affiliation, people in the villages of the region readily recognize the terms ‘Ditti’ and ‘Afitti.’ There are approximately 4000 speakers of the Afitti language and its closest linguistic neighbor is the Nyimang language, spoken west of Jebel el-Dair in the Nuba Mountains of the South Kordofan province of Sudan.\n\nThe Afitti live to the east of Jebel el-Dair. They previously resided at the base of the mountain, but after World War I increasing numbers of cattle and overcrowding drove them down the mountain to the plain where they resettled on farms. As a result of these movements the towns of Kitra in the north, Kundukur in the east, and Sidra towards the south were established. Because of an increase in the number of cattle, a separate group was forced to settle at the foot of Jebel Dambir, further northeastwards. Cattle herders from Sidra settled to the southwest of Dambir and those from Kitra to the northeast. Today, the people of Kitra are known as “Ditti” while the others are known as \"Afitti\", but the dialects have only minor lexical differences between them.\n\nWhen a drought struck the country in 1984, the majority of the cattle herders lost their livestock and became farmers; consequently, Afitti and Ditti speakers no longer herd cattle. In the 1950s, when Islam entered the area, the process of conversion began and today all speakers of Afitti are considered Muslim. Arabic has become the main language of communication, especially for the Afitti speakers; the local school also uses Arabic for teaching.The change of occupation for the cattle herders, the modernization in Sidra, and the overall dominance of Arabic have combined to reduce the overall importance of Afitti as well as decreasing speaker proficiency. Loanwords pervade the language, and it is only the Ditti who raise their children until school-going age without the use of Arabic.\n\nThe table below illustrates the vowels of Afitti; the symbols in parentheses represent prominent allophones of the phoneme beside which they appear.\nAfitti has six vowels that have an allophonic variation that is mostly predicted by the syllable structure. Vowels are relatively short in Afitti with occasional lengthening occurring in stressed syllables. Furthermore, vowels are shorter in closed syllables than they are in open syllables. In closed syllables, vowels become open and sometimes centralized. The schwa, however, is always short and limited in distribution, never being found in word-final position. It remains short when the syllable is stressed and in such cases the consonant that follows it may be geminated. \n\nCombinations of two vowels are common in Afitti and include combinations where the second vowel is schwa. There are no clear (level) diphthongs and the vowels are given individual tones that can be analyzed as part of different syllables. Sequences of three or more vowels were not found within the confines of one word.\nThe table below displays the consonants of Afitti; sounds in parentheses are of uncertain phonemic status.\n\nAfitti has nasals and plosives at four places of articulation: alveolar, bilabial, velar, and palatal. The plosives have a voicing contrast primarily found in word-initial position. This distinction is mostly lost in intervocalic position with neutralization in favor of the voiced variant. The majority of plosives are voiceless in final position due to a devoicing process affecting other sounds as well.\n\nNo words begin with a voiceless bilabial stop and final voiceless stops are often unreleased, but these variants occur in free variation with a released allophone. Alveolar and dental stops also appear in free variation. The dental variant appears with some speakers if they wish to stress the consonant that is being pronounced. Nasals occur in all positions, including as syllabic nasals. They usually assimilate to a following consonant. When a word-initial velar nasal follows a word-final, voiceless velar stop, the stop will be unreleased and voiced. The liquids /l/ and /r/, like the plosives, tend to become devoiced in word-final position. For both /l/ and /r/ their devoiced allophones can be easily mistaken for a fricative because of the heavy airflow. Like the nasals, the liquids have a syllabic variant. The syllabic /r/ is common in the language and is found in monosyllabic words as well as in word-final position. The syllabic /l/, on the other hand, is rare and unattested in word-initial position. As a consonant the central resonant /r/, as opposed to /l/, however, is not found in word- initial position and changes to a retroflex flap intervocalically. Whenever /r/ occurs in word-initial position, it is in words clearly borrowed words from Arabic and other languages. The allophonic flap and /l/ are easily confused but the flap can also be found immediately following a consonant (and preceding a vowel), a position where /l/ is absent, one of the rare cases where a sequence of consonants can be found. The lateral liquid is found in word-initial, intervocalic and word-final position and is slightly palatalized. This palatalization leads to a slightly fricated voiceless palatal release with some speakers when it is in word-final position.\n\nThe fricatives /s/ and /f/ are usually voiceless but, in some instances, vary with their voiced counterparts. They occur word initially and intervocalically, but only loanwords possess the fricatives in word-final position. The /s/ is sometimes palatalized (realized as [ʃ]) before the high front vowel /i/.\nAfitti is a tone language with stress. Tonal minimal pairs are attested for monosyllabic, bisyllabic, and trisyllabic words. In longer, however, words stress seems to play a more important role. The stressed syllable is marked by a combination of volume, duration and change in tone, rather than just tone alone. Afitti has only two phonemic tones with clear and strong downdrift, with no third tone or even downstep. The shortening of syllables ending in /r/ has led to many words that have an intervocalic flap following a schwa or a syllabic /r/. The schwa is omitted altogether by some speakers reducing the word by one syllable and possibly eliminating a tone. When this reduction occurs, one tone is assimilated to the neighboring tone, keeping the tonal pattern intact.\n\nAfitti has both closed and open syllables. Syllables may be closed with a liquid, a nasal or a stop. Single-segment syllables may consist of a (syllabic) liquid, a (syllabic) nasal, or a vowel. Syllables include combinations of vowel and consonant but there are few consonant clusters. Nasals that precede consonants are always syllabic – there are no nasal-consonant sequences or prenasalized segments. Liquids that follow fricatives or consonants are preceded by a schwa for most speakers, but in many cases are realized (exceptionally) as consonant clusters. There are no tautosyllabic consonants that follow liquids or fricatives and nasals do not follow other consonants. Words usually contain one, two or three syllables, but verbs may contain as many as eight or more.\n\nAfitti can tentatively be defined as an agglutinative SOV language with postpositions. Plural marking on adjectives and nouns take the form of a suffix. Plural marking in verbs is found for both objects and subjects. Plural forms of verbs without a verbal plural marker are translated as duals. Afitti has no definite or indefinite articles and gender marking also seems to be absent. All of these characteristics are common both geographically and within the Eastern Sudanic language. However, with the exception of Nyimang, the differentiation between dual and plural is particular to Afitti.\n\nThe Afitti kinship terms have specific possessive pronouns and in the case of ‘father’ and ‘mother’, there is a separate set of dual forms. This set is also found when speaking, plurally, of ‘mothers and ‘fathers’. Other kinship terms, namely ‘son’, ‘sibling’ and ‘mother- in-law’, also have a set of dual forms but lose this distinction when speaking, plurally, of ‘sons’, ‘siblings’ and ‘mothers-in-law’. All other terms, including ‘daughter’, ‘father- in-law’, ‘husband’, ‘wife’ and ‘(paternal or maternal) uncle’ do not or no longer distinguish dual from plural forms. The dual is mainly formed by way of morpheme or word order. More specifically, in the case of ‘father’ and ‘mother,’ the dual seems to be created by inversing the order of possessive pronoun and kinship term.\n\nThe Afitti language may help scholars to better understand texts in Meroitic, a script whose sounds can be deciphered but whose meanings remain unclear. In the last few years, some linguists have come to the opinion that ancient Meroitic shares a history with a number of languages still spoken today. According to French archaeologist Claude Rilly, Meroitic belongs part of the Nilo-Saharan language group, and has particular affinities with that group’s North Eastern Sudanic branch which comprises a handful of languages spoken in Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Sudan.\n\n\n"}

Its precise meaning has varied by location and over time.\n\nThe word \"Bannwald\" is a combination of \"Bann\" (English \"ban\") and \"Wald\" (English \"forest\" or \"wood\"). \"Bann\" has many historical meanings in German, one of which refers to an area controlled by and set aside for the use of a landowner in medieval times (comparable to the forests subject to the royal ban in Anglo-Saxon England). A \"Bannwald\" was a forest where a nobleman had the prerogative to make use of it and the creatures in it. A royal ban forest existed at Dreieich (from the heathen worship of three oaks) for a very long period, and its charter was one of the most primitive. The (obsolete) French literal equivalent (also: \"banbois\") is still the toponym of local forests in areas which once were part of the former Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"Bannwald\" is, in a certain sense, an archaic word which has been revived as a specific term for forests under various types of protection.\n\nThe term is generally used with a rather broad meaning:\n\nDepending on the respective forest act, there may be an overlapping or difference in meaning between the terms \"banned forest\" and \"protection forest\".\n\nSilvicultural use is still permitted and in the case of protection forests it is even welcome (except in Baden-Württemberg). However, it is prohibited in the core zones of nature reserves. \"Forestal exclusion zones\" (temporarily restricted forest areas) subject to hunting prohibitions or restrictions, or temporary \"hunting grounds\" or \"game preserves\" (areas closed during a hunting season or breeding and upbringing season) are not classified as banned forests.\n\nThe term \"Bann\" dates back to the Middle Ages. At that time a \"Bannwald\" referred to a forest area where the respective territorial lord had the exclusive right to use the forest (\"forest privilege\"). Originally this applied only to hunting (\"hunting privilege\") and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of Switzerland banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for fencing torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with protection against avalanches, rockfalls and flooding. The concept of \"Bannwald\" plays an important part in Ludwig Ganghofer's novel \"Die Martinsklause\" in which a tyrannical administrator in Berchtesgaden claims excessive privileges.\n\n→ \"see also: \"\n\nIn Baden-Württemberg, there are \"Bannwälder Totalreservate\", fully protected reserves where any use is strictly prohibited by law. In other federal states of Germany such \"total reserves\" are known under different names. Due to their structural diversity in living trees and dry wood banned forests are refugia for many endangered species of animals, plants, and mushrooms.\n\nIn Bavaria \"forest and its existence and size is extremely essential in particular in densely populated and sparsely wooded areas and consequently its size and structure must be preserved as it is of extraordinary importance for the climate, water resources or for air purification\" and may be classified as banned forest.\"\n\nIn Hesse a \"Bannwald\" is a forest which because of its location, size and extraordinary importance for hydrological balance, climate and air purification has to be preserved and may be cut only in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Austria, a \"Bannwald\" is a stricter form of a protection forest.\n\nThe Swiss Forestry Act of 1874 uses the term, Schutzwald (protection forest), rather than \"Bannwald\".\n\n\n\n"}

Their purpose is a combination of arousing aggression and esprit de corps on one's own side and causing intimidation on the hostile side. Battle cries are a universal form of display behaviour (i.e., threat display) aiming at competitive advantage, ideally by overstating one's own aggressive potential to a point where the enemy prefers to avoid confrontation altogether and opts to flee. In order to overstate one's potential for aggression, battle cries need to be as loud as possible, and have historically often been amplified by acoustic devices such as horns, drums, conches, carnyxes, bagpipes, bugles, etc. (see also martial music).\n\nBattle cries are closely related to other behavioral patterns of human aggression, such as war dances and taunting, performed during the \"warming up\" phase preceding the escalation of physical violence. From the Middle Ages, many cries appeared on standards and were adopted as mottoes, an example being the motto \"Dieu et mon droit\" (\"God and my right\") of the English kings. It is said that this was Edward III's rallying cry during the Battle of Crécy. The word \"slogan\" originally derives from \"sluagh-gairm\" or \"sluagh-ghairm\" (\"sluagh\" = \"people\", \"army\", and \"gairm\" = \"call\", \"proclamation\"), the Scottish Gaelic word for \"gathering-cry\" and in times of war for \"battle-cry\".

Nadezhdin also translated the sections from John's gospel that were used for Orthodox Easter liturgy.\n\nAnother early translation, of the 23rd Psalm, made by an indigenous Tlingit, when back-translated, read \"The Lord is my goat-hunter; I don't want him.

By 2010 the phrase had gained popularity in Italy and the international press to refer to former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's sex parties, which caused a major political scandal in Italy.\n\nAn 1852 issue of \"Hogg's Instructor\" states that \"bunga bunga\" is the name given by locals to a location near Moreton Bay on the eastern coast of Australia.\n\nIn 1910 Horace de Vere Cole, Virginia Woolf, her brother Adrian Stephen and a small group of friends, pretended to be the Prince of Abyssinia and his entourage. They obtained permission to visit one of the world's most powerful warships HMS \"Dreadnought\" in Weymouth, Dorset, in what became known as the \"Dreadnought\" hoax. It was reported that each time the Commander showed them a marvel of the ship, they murmured the phrase \"bunga, bunga!\" which then became a popular catchphrase of the time. Adrian Stephen, had this to say about the phrase:\nA 1950 Bugs Bunny short \"Bushy Hare\" used the phrase \"Unga Bunga Bunga\" in a nonsensical exchange between Bugs Bunny and a character who represented an Australian Aborigine and who was referred to as \"Nature Boy\".\n\nIn Malay-speaking countries bunga means flower. As such bunga bunga (written as bunga-bunga) is simply the plural form of flower. Possibly, Makassan contact with Australia can explain the existence of the word within the Australian Aborigines culture.\n\nA century later, the term \"bunga bunga\" became popular again as part of a joke on the internet. This joke was then narrated by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at his dinner parties (in a version which featured, as prisoners, former ministers from the centre-left opposition party led by Romano Prodi).\n\nThis expression was then frequently quoted by the Italian and international press during the 2011 investigation surrounding Silvio Berlusconi's underage prostitution charges, acquiring a quite different meaning as \"an orgy involving a powerful leader\"; it was allegedly taught to Silvio Berlusconi by Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was also the unwitting originator of the phrase Zenga Zenga.\n\nIn Italy, the term \"has become an instant, supposedly hilarious, household expression\".\n\nRecent explanations disagree on its meaning, or perhaps illustrate the range of its reference. It \"is said to be a sort of underwater orgy where nude young women allegedly encircled the nude host and/or his friends in his swimming pool\", \"an African-style ritual\" performed for male spectators by \"20 naked young women\", or erotic entertainment hosted by a rich host involving pole dancing and competitive striptease by skimpy-costumed \"women in nurses' outfits and police uniforms\" – but topless women, the prize being prostitution for the host.\n\nAn alternative explanation for its origins was proposed by actress Sabina Began, who claimed that it was a nickname based on her surname and that she had organized the parties.\n\nThe lexicographer Jonathon Green does not expect the term to make much headway, or to last, in English.\n\nThe bunga bunga culture sparked a social movement called \"Se Non Ora Quando\" in 2011, which included street protests.\n\nIn 2011, the faux-French, American band Nous Non Plus released a song entitled \"Bunga Bunga\". The cover of the single featured a picture of Silvio Berlusconi. The song lyrics list famous cities around the world (in French) while the video is a black and white show-reel of semi-nude dancing women.\n\nIn 2012, the term was used in the British motoring show \"Top Gear\" in Season 18, Episode 1. It was used to describe The Stig's Italian cousin, who emerged from a motor-home dressed in a suit, followed by three glamorous girls, to set a lap time in a Ferrari 458 Italia at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari (Imola Circuit).\n\nIn 2013, the American band Cherry Poppin' Daddies used the term several times in the lyrics for their song \"The Babooch\", a satire of \"one-percenter\" lifestyles. The song's music video features clips of Berlusconi alongside other billionaire figures.\n\nIn 2014, comedians Maynard and Tim Ferguson started a podcast named Bunga Bunga.\n\n"}
{"id": "3639393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3639393", "title": "Chilean Spanish", "text": "Chilean Spanish\n\nChilean Spanish (, \"\" or \")\" is any of several varieties of Spanish spoken in most of Chile. Chilean Spanish dialects have distinctive pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and slang usage that differ from those of standard Spanish.\n\nIn Chile, there are not many differences between the Spanish spoken in the northern, central and southern areas of the country, although there are notable differences in zones of the far south—such as Aysén, Magallanes (mainly along the border with Argentina), and Chiloé—and in Arica in the extreme north. There is, however, much variation in the Spanish spoken by different social classes. In rural areas from Santiago to Valdivia, Chilean Spanish shows the historical influence of the Castúo dialects of Extremadura (Spain), but some authors point to the Spanish province of Andalusia and more specifically to the city of Seville as an even greater influence on the historical development of Chilean Spanish.\n\nThere are a number of phonetic features common to most Chilean accents, but none of them is individually unique to Chilean Spanish. Rather, it is the particular combination of features that sets Chilean Spanish apart from other regional Spanish dialects. The features include the following:\n\n\nChileans use the \"voseo\" and \"tuteo\" forms for the intimate second-person singular. \"Voseo\" is common in Chile, with both pronominal and verbal \"voseo\" being widely used in the spoken language.\nIn Chile there are at least four grades of formality:\nThis occurs only in very informal situations and should be approached and used with caution by foreigners. It is always considered rude and insulting but is tolerated and enjoyed as part of friendly bonding and banter. However, with even a slight change in intonation, it can change from a tone of friendly banter to a form of insult to a heated argument, even among friends. Non-natives should refrain from using \"vos\" until sufficient understanding of its use is gained.\n\n\n\nThe Chilean voseo conjugation has only three irregular verbs in the present indicative: \"ser\" 'to be', \"ir\" 'to go', and \"haber\" 'to have' (auxiliary).\n\nIn Chile, there are various ways to say 'you are' to one person.\n\n\nOnly the last two are considered Standard Spanish. Usage depends on politeness, social relationships, formality, and education. The ending \"(s)\" in those forms is aspirated or omitted.\n\nA comparison of the conjugation of the Chilean \"voseo\", the \"voseo\" used in Latin American countries other than Chile, and \"tuteo\" follows:\n\nChilean Spanish has a great deal of distinctive slang and vocabulary. Some examples of distinctive Chilean slang include \"al tiro\" (right away), \"gallo/a\" (guy/gal), \"fome\" (boring), \"pololear\" (to go out as girlfriend/boyfriend), \"pelambre\" (gossip), \"pito\" (marijuana cigarette i.e. joint) \"poto\" (buttocks), \"quiltro\" (mutt) and \"chomba\" (knitted sweater) \"wea\" (thing; can be used for an object or situation). In addition, several words in Chilean Spanish are borrowed from neighboring Amerindian languages.\n\nIn Chilean Spanish there is lexical influence from Argentine dialects, which suggests a covert prestige. Lexical influences cut across the different social strata of Chile. Argentine summer tourism in Chile and Chilean tourism in Argentina provide a channel for influence on the speech of the upper class. The middle classes receive Argentine influence by watching football on cable television and Argentine programs on broadcast television. \"La Cuarta\", a popular Chilean newspaper, regularly employs words and expressions from the lunfardo slang of the Buenos Aires region. Usually Chileans do not recognize the Argentine borrowings as such, claiming they are Chilean terms and expressions. The relation between Argentine dialects and Chilean Spanish is one of asymmetric permeability, with Chilean Spanish adopting sayings from Argentine variants but usually not the reverse.\n\n\nLunfardo is an argot of the Spanish language that originated in the late 19th century among the lower classes of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Coa is an argot common among criminals in Chile. It has been heavily influenced by Lunfardo. Examples of Lunfardo and Coa words and phrases in Chilean Spanish are:\n\nThe Mapudungun language has left a relatively small number of words in Chilean Spanish, given its large geographic expanse. Many Mapudungun loans are names for plants, animals, and places. For example:\n\nThe Quechua language is probably the Amerindian language that has given Chilean Spanish the largest number of loanwords. For example, the names of many American vegetables in Chilean Spanish are derived from Quechua names, rather than from Nahuatl or Taíno as in Standard Spanish. Some of the words of Quechua origin include:\n\nThere are some expressions of non-Hispanic European origin such as British, German or French. They came with the arrival of the European immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. There is also a certain influence from the mass media.\n\nHere is sample of a normal text in carefully-spoken Latin American Spanish and the same text with a very relaxed pronunciation in informal lower-clasd Chilean Spanish:\n\n\n"}

A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the message aside from the aesthetics in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use graphic design and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.\n\nCommunication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.\n\nWithin the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication affordances. Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a crowdsourcing platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform. The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of e-government applications and technologies. Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. \n\nCommunication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic business thinking, using market research, creativity, and problem-solving. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.\n\nThe term communication design is often used interchangeably with visual communication, but has an alternative broader meaning that includes auditory, vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include information architecture, editing, typography, illustration, web design, animation, advertising, ambient media, visual identity design, performing arts, copywriting and professional writing skills applied in the creative industries.\n\nStudents of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex digital environment around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the target audience. Students learn how to combine communication with art and technology. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design web pages, video games, animation, motion graphics and more.\n\nCommunication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.\n\n\nVisual design is the design working in any media or support of visual communication. This is considered by some to be more correct terminology to cover all types of design applied in communication that uses visual channel for transmission of messages, precisely because this term relates to the concept of visual language of some media and not limited to support a particular form of content, as do the terms graphic design (graphics) or interface design (electronic media).\n\n"}

Datelines are traditionally placed on the first line of the text of the article, before the first sentence.\n\nThe location appears first, usually starting with the city in which the reporter has written or dispatched the report. City names are usually printed in uppercase, though this can vary from one publication to another. The political division and/or nation the city is in may follow, but they may be dropped if the city name is widely recognizable due to its size or political importance (a national capital, for instance). The date of the report comes after, followed by an em dash surrounded by spaces, and then the article.\n\nA typical newspaper dateline might read: \n\nThe same story if pulled from the Associated Press (AP) wire might appear as:\n\nDatelines can take on some unusual forms. When reporters collaborate on a story, two different locations might be listed. The Associated Press omits a dateline \"when a story has been assembled from sources in widely separate areas\". In other cases, the exact location may be unknown or intentionally imprecise, such as when covering military operations while on a ship at sea or following an invasion force.\n\nThe concept of a dateline has been adapted to television. Reporters on news programs might have their location mentioned in an introduction from the news anchor:\nA field reporter might also end his stories by combining the location from where he filed the report with a \"lockout\" (the last thing a reporter says in the report, and includes his name and station ID); especially if the segment is recorded and not live. For example, the last bit of a report could sound like:\n\nA number of current affairs TV shows have \"dateline\" as part of their name.\n\n"}

Beukes wrote more than a hundred Afrikaans novels, a large number of short stories and numerous Afrikaans radio dramas, including some extensive pieces for the commercial station Springbok Radio. She died in 1999 in Bellville after a battle with blood cancer. There is a Dricky Beukes Street named after her in Kokrus, Vereeniging. \nShe was born on Seekoebaard farm in Prieska as Hendrika Johanna van Staden and she was the youngest of 13 children . When she was three years old, her father moved their family to Karos, a small town near the Gariep River in Upington in the Northern Cape, where she grew up and received her early school education. She matriculated from the Higher Business School in Paarl and took up a job at the Karos Post Office after writing her Public Service Examination . \n\nShe married Abraham Opperman Beukes of Prince Albert on July 4, 1942. He was the first principal of Laerskool Vredelust in Bellville, who himself also wrote three children's books. The couple moved to Bellville and they had a son, Van Staden, and two daughters Brenda and Wilmari. In Bellville, Beukes was the editor for a small newspaper called \"Die Noordwester\" and a regular contributor to the \"Oudtshoorn Courant\". After retirement, the couple settled in Tygerberg in Bellville . Beukes’ husband died in Durbanville in March 1993.\n\nBeukes was an accomplished writer and a host on the SABC’s service Springbok radio. Beukes was made popular by her sequel stories. A phrase which gained country-wide popularity at the time was her introduction to the radio drama Die Indringer (The Trespasser): 'n verhaal wat elke moederhart sal roer (a story to touch the heart of every mother). Die Indringer was a story about the trials of a woman who adopted child . Die Indringer was broadcast for the first time on the May 16, 1960 and it was the most popular day program on Springbok radio for 11 years. Other popular radio stories by Dricky Beukes include Skaduwees oor Summerdown, Blinkwater, Die geel karavaan and Dokter Karenien . Beukes remained on air for more than a decade making her a household name in Afrikaans speaking homes. \n\nShe wrote her first novel, “Madelief”, in just 14 days and it was published in 1945 in \"The Housewife\". She was just 18 years old at the time . The story was inspired by her mother’s death which occurred in the same year.\n\nBeukes published many popular books in Afrikaans. The Kamberg series: “Kamberg se wêreld” (Kamberg's world), 1982, “Kamberg se mense” (Kamberg's people), 1986 and “Kamberg se Kinders” (Kamberg's children), 1988, were popular among readers. Beukes also wrote Meetsnoere and Een wat ’n muur afbreek. The stories depicted the lives of the people in Karos, where she spent her childhood. \n\n"}
{"id": "48566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48566", "title": "Ecovillage", "text": "Ecovillage\n\nAn ecovillage is a traditional or intentional community with the goal of becoming more socially, culturally, economically, and ecologically sustainable. It is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes to regenerate and restore its social and natural environments. Most range from a population of 50 to 250 individuals, although some are smaller, and traditional ecovillages are often much larger. Larger ecovillages often exist as networks of smaller sub-communities. Some ecovillages have grown through like-minded individuals, families, or other small groups—who are not members, at least at the outset—settling on the ecovillage's periphery and participating \"de facto\" in the community.\n\nEcovillagers are united by shared ecological, social-economic and cultural-spiritual values. Concretely, ecovillagers seek alternatives to ecologically destructive electrical, water, transportation, and waste-treatment systems, as well as the larger social systems that mirror and support them. Many see the breakdown of traditional forms of community, wasteful consumerist lifestyles, the destruction of natural habitat, urban sprawl, factory farming, and over-reliance on fossil fuels as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster and create richer and more fulfilling ways of life.\n\nEcovillages offer small-scale communities with minimal ecological impact or regenerative impacts as an alternative. However, such communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own (\"see\" Global Ecovillage Network for an example). This model of collective action is similar to that of Ten Thousand Villages, which supports the fair trade of goods worldwide.\n\nIn 1991, Robert Gilman set out a definition of an ecovillage that became standard for many years. Gilman defined an ecovillage as a:\n\n\"human-scale full-featured settlement in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural world in a way that is supportive of healthy human development, and can be successfully continued into the indefinite future.\"\n\nKosha Joubert, Executive Director of the Global Ecovillage Network, more recently defined an ecovillage as an:\n\nIn this view, ecovillages are seen as an ongoing process, rather than a particular outcome. They often start off with a focus on one of the four dimensions of sustainability, e.g. ecology, but evolve into holistic models for restoration. In this view, aiming for sustainability is not enough; it is vital to restore and regenerate the fabric of life and across all four dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental, economic and cultural.\n\nEcovillages have developed in recent years as technology has improved so they have more sophisticated structures as noted by Baydoun, M. 2013.\n\nGenerally the ecovillage concept is not tied to specific sectarian (religious, political, corporate) organizations or belief systems not directly related to environmentalism, such as monasteries, cults, or communes.\n\nThe modern-day desire for community was most notably characterized by the communal \"back to the land\" movement of the 1960s and 1970s through communities such as the earliest example that still survives, the Miccosukee Land Co-op co-founded in May 1973 by James Clement van Pelt in Tallahassee, Florida. The movement became more focused and organized in the cohousing and related alternative-community movements of the mid-1980s. Then, in 1991, Robert Gilman and Diane Gilman co-authored a germinal study called \"Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities\" for Gaia Trust, in which the ecological and communitarian themes were brought together.\n\nThe ecovillage movement began to coalesce at the annual autumn conference of Findhorn, in Scotland, in 1995. The conference was called: \"Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities\", and conference organizers turned away hundreds of applicants. According to Ross Jackson, \"somehow they had struck a chord that resonated far and wide. The word 'ecovillage'... thus became part of the language of the Cultural Creatives.\" After that conference, many intentional communities, including Findhorn, began calling themselves \"ecovillages\", giving birth to a new movement. The Global Ecovillage Network, formed by a group of about 25 people from various countries who had attended the Findhorn conference, crystallized the event by linking hundreds of small projects from around the world, who had with similar goals but had formerly operated without knowledge of each other. Gaia Trust, Denmark, agreed to fund the network for its first five years. Today, there are self-identified ecovillages in over 70 countries on six continents.\n\nSince the 1995 conference, a number of the early members of the Global Ecovillage Network have tried other approaches to eco-village building in an attempt to build settlements that would be attractive to mainstream culture in order to make sustainable development more generally accepted. One of these with some degree of success is Living Villages and The Wintles where eco-houses are arranged so that social connectivity is maximised and residents have shared food growing areas, woodland and animal husbandry for greater sustainability.\n\nThe principles on which ecovillages rely can be applied to urban and rural settings, as well as to developing and developed countries. Advocates seek a sustainable lifestyle (for example, of voluntary simplicity) for inhabitants with a minimum of trade outside the local area, or ecoregion. Many advocates also seek independence from existing infrastructures, although others, particularly in more urban settings, pursue more integration with existing infrastructure. Rural ecovillages are usually based on organic farming, permaculture and other approaches which promote ecosystem function and biodiversity. Ecovillages, whether urban or rural, tend to integrate community and ecological values within a principle-based approach to sustainability, such as permaculture design.\n\nJohnathan Dawson, former president of the Global Ecovillage Network, describes five ecovillage principles in his 2006 book \"Ecovillages: New Frontiers for Sustainability\":\n\nThe imperative for alternatives to radically inefficient energy-use patterns, in particular automobile-enabled suburban sprawl, was brought into focus by the energy crises of the 1970s. The term \"eco-village\" was introduced by Georgia Tech Professor George Ramsey in a 1978 address, \"Passive Energy Applications for the Built Environment\", to the First World Energy Conference of the Association of Energy Engineers, to describe small-scale, car-free, close-in developments, including suburban infill, arguing that \"the great energy waste in the United States is not in its technology; it is in its lifestyle and concept of living.\" Ramsey's article includes a sketch for a \"self-sufficient pedestrian solar village\" by one of his students that looks very similar to eco-villages today.\n\nEffective government is important to Eco-villages. It provides (Cunningham and Wearing, 2013). While the first generation of ecovillagers tended to adopt consensus decision-making as a governance method, some difficulties with consensus as an everyday decision-making method emerged: it can be extremely time-intensive, and decisions too often could be blocked by a few intransigent members. More recently many ecovillages have moved toward sociocracy and related alternative decision-making methods.\n\nAlso, ecovillages look for alternative government which emphasis on deeper connections with ecology than economy.\n\nKellogg, W.

{"id": "2277450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277450", "title": "French conjugation", "text": "French conjugation\n\nFrench conjugation is the creation of derived forms of a French verb from its principal parts by inflection. French verbs are conventionally divided into three conjugations (\"conjugaisons\") with the following grouping:\n\nThe first two groups follow a regular conjugation, whereas the third group follows an irregular one. The third group is considered a closed-class conjugation form, meaning that most new verbs introduced to the French language are of the first group (\"téléviser, atomiser, radiographier\"), with the remaining ones being of the second group (\"alunir\").\n\nThe verb \"aller\" is the only verb ending in -er belonging to the third group.\n\nThere are seven different moods in French conjugation: indicative (\"indicatif\"), subjunctive (\"subjonctif\"), conditional (\"conditionnel\"), imperative (\"impératif\"), infinitive (\"infinitif\"), participle (\"participe\"), and gerund (\"gérondif\"). The infinitive, participle, and gerundive are not verbal moods.\n\nTenses are described under the mood to which they belong, and they are grouped as follows. Other tenses are constructed through the use of an auxiliary verb:\n\n\nThere are two auxiliary verbs in French: \"avoir\" (to have) and \"être\" (to be), used to conjugate compound tenses according to these rules:\n\n\nCompound tenses are conjugated with an auxiliary followed by the past participle, ex: \"j'ai fait\" (I did), \"je suis tombé\" (I fell). When \"être\" is used, the participle is inflected according to the gender and number of the subject. The participle is inflected with the use of the verb \"avoir\" according to the direct object, but only if the direct object precedes the participle, ex:\n\nAs stand-alone verbs, the conjugation of the two auxiliaries is listed in the table below:\n\nThis verb has different stems for different tenses. These are imperfect \"av-\" ; present subjunctive \"ai-\" ; future and conditional \"aur-\" ; simple past and past subjunctive \"e-\" (not pronounced: \"eus, eusse\" are pronounced as bare inflections ). Although the stem changes, the inflections of these tenses are as a regular \"-oir\" verb.\n\nIn the present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Notice that the imperative form uses the subjunctive conjugation.\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nThis verb has different stems for different tenses. These are all pronounced differently: imperfect \"ét-\" ; present subjunctive \"soi-\" ; future and conditional \"ser-\" ; simple past and past subjunctive in \"f-\" . The inflections of these tenses are as a regular \"-oir\" verb (that is, as an \"-re\" verb but with the vowel \"u\" in the \"f-\" forms). For example, subjunctive \"soyons, soyez\" is pronounced with the \"y\" sound () of other \"-re\" and \"-oir\" verbs.\n\nIn the simple present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The imperative form uses the subjunctive conjugation.\n\nThe non-finite forms use the stem \"êt-\" (before a consonant)/\"ét-\" (before a vowel):\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nFrench verbs ending in \"-er\", which constitute the largest class, inflect somewhat differently from other verbs. Between the stem and the inflectional endings that are common across most verbs, there may be a vowel, which in the case of the \"-er\" verbs is a silent \"-e-\" (in the simple present singular), \"-é\" or \"-ai\" (in the past participle and the \"je\" form of the simple past), and \"-a-\" (in the rest of simple past singular and in the past subjunctive). In addition, the orthographic \"-t\" found in the \"-ir\" and \"-re\" verbs in the singular of the simple present and past is not found in this conjugation, so that the final consonants are \"-Ø\", \"-s\", \"-Ø\" rather than \"-s\", \"-s\", \"-t.\"\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nExceptional contexts:\n\nExceptional verbs:\n\nThe \"-ir\" verbs differ from the \"-er\" verbs in the following points:\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\" (\"partir\" uses \"être\")\n\nThe verb \"haïr\" loses its diaeresis in the singular of the simple present tense (the \"i\" loses its trema, reflecting the pronunciation of the initial syllable as a single vowel rather than the hiatus ): \"je hais, tu hais, il/elle hait\" but \"nous haïssons, vous haïssez, ils/elles haïssent\" . \"Hais\" is as usual used for the imperative. In all other forms, the root is (imperfect and present & past subjunctive -, future and conditional -).\nAnother conjugation is used in Quebec French that keeps the two syllables stem with the hiatus , and therefore the diaeresis for all the paradigm: \"J'haïs, tu haïs, il/elle haït, nous haïssons, vous haïssez, ils/elles haïssent\". Note that the \"h\" of \"haïr\" is mute in Quebec French, hence the elision for \"j'haïs\" /ʒai/ compared to European French \"je hais\" /ʒə.ɛ/.\n\nMost irregular French verbs can be described with seven principal parts. In reality, few if any verbs have separate stems for all seven parts; instead, they tend to \"inherit\" the same stem as another part. Note that the endings for these verbs are basically the same as for regular \"-ir\" verbs; in fact, regular \"-ir\" verbs can be fit into this scheme by treating the \"-iss-\" variants as different principal parts.\n\nThe following table shows how the paradigm of an irregular verb is constructed from its principal parts. Note that a few verbs construct the present indicative (especially the singular) differently.\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nThe following table gives principal parts for a number of irregular verbs. There are a number of fair-sized groups of verbs that are conjugated alike; these are listed first. There are some additional irregularities in the present indicative, which are listed below. Nearly all irregularities affect the singular, and are purely issues of spelling. (Stems that are irregular in the sense of being unpredictable by the above rules are given in boldface.)\n\nThe following table shows an example paradigm of one of these verbs, \"recevoir\" \"to receive\".\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nNine verbs also have an irregular subjunctive stem, used at least for the singular and third plural of the present subjunctive. These verbs can be said to have 11 principal parts, because the subjunctive stem may or may not be used for the first and second plural present subjunctive, the imperative and/or the present participle, in ways that vary from verb to verb.\n\nThe following table shows how the paradigm of an 11-principal-part irregular verb is constructed from its principal parts. Note that these verbs are generally the most irregular verbs in French, and many of them construct the present indicative (especially the singular) in an idiosyncratic fashion. The verb \"aller\" also constructs its past participle and simple past differently, according to the endings for \"-er\" verbs.\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nThe following table gives the principal parts for the 11-principal-part verbs. (Stems that are irregular in the sense of being unpredictable by the above rules are given in boldface.)\n\nThe verb \"aller\" means \"to go\" and is sufficiently irregular that it merits listing its conjugation in full. It is the only verb with the first group ending \"er\" to have an irregular conjugation. It belongs to none of the three sections of the third group, and is often categorized on its own.\nThe verb has different stems for different tenses. These are all pronounced differently: past \"all-\" (simple past, imperfect, past subjunctive); present subjunctive \"aill-\" ; conditional and future \"ir-\" . The inflections of these tenses are completely regular, and pronounced as in any other \"-er\" verb. However, in the simple present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:\n\nThe non-finite forms are all based on \"all-\" :\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"être\"\n\n1. In an interrogative sentence, the final \"e\" is written \"é\" (traditional spelling) or \"è\" (rectified spelling), and is pronounced as an open \"è\" . Additionally, the \"e\" in \"je\" becomes silent. For example: je marche (I walk), marchè-je? (do I walk?)\n\n2. The following verbs have the ending \"-ont\": \"ils sont \"(they are), \"ils ont \"(they have), \"ils font \"(they do), \" ils vont \"(they go).\n\n2.1. Only the verb \"être\" has irregular endings here: \"nous sommes \"(we are), \"que je soi-s \"(that I be), \"que tu soi-s \"(that you be).\n\n2.2. The following verbs (and their derivatives) have the ending \"-es\": \"vous êtes\" (you are), \"vous faites\" (you do), \"vous dites\" (you tell).\n\n2.3. Only the verbs \"être\" and \"avoir\" take a final \"t: qu'il/elle/on soi-t \"(that it/he/she/we be), \"qu'il/elle/on ai-t \"(that it/he/she/we have).\n\n3.

This almost leads to a loss of a verb form in Modern French.

His original surname was Shidhaye. Because of 'Vatan' (right of Tax collection) that the family had received,the family was later called Deshmukh.\nDeshmukh is regarded as an important figure of the Social Reform Movement in Maharashtra.\n\nGopal Hari Deshmukh was born into a Chitpawan family, a subcaste of Maharashtrian Brahmins, in 1823. His father was the treasurer of Bapu Gokhale, the general of Bajirao II during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Deshmukh studied at the Poona English Medium School.\n\nDeshmukh started his career as a translator for the government then under British Raj. In 1867, the government appointed him a small cause judge in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. He worked as a Diwan also in Ratlam state. The government had honoured him while he was working only, as a 'Justice of Peace' and 'Raobahadur'. He retired as a sessions judge. He held many other important positions, including those of the Assistant Inam Commissioner, Joint Judge of Nasik High Court, and Member of the Law Council.\nAt age 25, Deshmukh started writing articles aimed at social reform in Maharashtra in the weekly \"Prabhakar\" (प्रभाकर) under the pen name \"Lokhitawadi\" (लोकहितवादी). In the first two years, he penned 108 articles on social reform. That group of articles has come to be known in Marathi literature as \"Lokhitawadinchi Shatapatre\" (लोकहितवादींची शतपत्रे).\n\nHe promoted emancipation (liberation) and education of women, and wrote against arranged child marriages, dowry system, and polygamy, all of which were prevalent in India in his times.\n\nHe wrote against the evils of the caste system which was strongly prevalent in India in his times, condemned harmful Hindu religious orthodoxy, and attacked the monopoly in religious matters and rituals which Brahmin priests had through a long tradition. (Noteworthily, Deshmukh belonged to the Brahmin class.) He enunciated certain 15 principles for bringing about religious reform in Hindu society.\n\nDeshmukh founded a public library in Pune under the leadership of the then governor of the state of Bombay, Henry Brown. He also donated some books to Univ. of Bombay (1875) Library, when it was established by British people. His personal collection is added to Univ. of Mumbai - J.N.Library, Vidyanagari, Mumbai -400098 − called as \"Deshmukh collection\". His life-size portrait (with some amount to add some new books from its interest every year) is donated to Univ. of Mumbai Library by his 5th generation − Mr. Ajit S. Deshmukh & Librarian/Poet/Translator- Mrs. Jyoti (Deshmukh) Kunte in his Death Centenary year 1992, for the benefit of students doing research on his work.\n\nHe took a leadership role in founding \"Gyan Prakash\" (ज्ञानप्रकाश), \"Indu Prakash\" (इंदुप्रकाश), and \"Lokhitwadi\" (लोकहितवादी) periodicals in Maharashtra.\n\nWhile Deshmukh was serving as a judge in Ahmedabad, he organized in that city annual speech conferences on social issues under the sponsorship of Premabhai Institute, and also himself delivered speeches. He established in Ahmedabad a branch of Prarthana Samaj, founded an institute promoting remarriages of widows, and invigorated Gujarat Vernacular Society. He started a weekly \"Hitechchhu\" (‘हितेच्छु) in both Gujarati and English. He also started \" Gujarati Budhhi-Wardhak Sabha\".\n\nDeshmukh wrote 35 books on diverse topics, including religious, social, economic, political, historic, and literary matters. He also translated some English works into Marathi. Many books are written 'on him & his work' by famous writers.\n"}

{"id": "14511671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14511671", "title": "Interpretation (logic)", "text": "Interpretation (logic)\n\nAn interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language. Many formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics.\n\nThe most commonly studied formal logics are propositional logic, predicate logic and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation is a function that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate \"T\" (for \"tall\") and assign it the extension {\"a\"} (for \"Abraham Lincoln\"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant \"T\", and does not make a claim about whether \"T\" is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation have anything to say about logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'. Though \"we\" may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.\n\nAn interpretation often (but not always) provides a way to determine the truth values of sentences in a language. If a given interpretation assigns the value True to a sentence or theory, the interpretation is called a model of that sentence or theory.\n\nA formal language consists of a possibly infinite set of \"sentences\" (variously called \"words\" or \"formulas\") built from a fixed set of \"letters\" or \"symbols\". The inventory from which these letters are taken is called the \"alphabet\" over which the language is defined. To distinguish the strings of symbols that are in a formal language from arbitrary strings of symbols, the former are sometimes called \"well-formed formulæ\" (wff). The essential feature of a formal language is that its syntax can be defined without reference to interpretation. For example, we can determine that (\"P\" or \"Q\") is a well-formed formula even without knowing whether it is true or false.\n\nA formal language formula_1 can be defined with the\nalphabet formula_2, and with a word being in formula_1 if it begins with formula_4 and is composed solely of the symbols formula_4 and formula_6.\n\nA possible interpretation of formula_1 could assign the decimal digit '1' to formula_4 and '0' to formula_6. Then formula_10 would denote 101 under this interpretation of formula_1.\n\nIn the specific cases of propositional logic and predicate logic, the formal languages considered have alphabets that are divided into two sets: the logical symbols (logical constants) and the non-logical symbols. The idea behind this terminology is that \"logical\" symbols have the same meaning regardless of the subject matter being studied, while \"non-logical\" symbols change in meaning depending on the area of investigation.\n\nLogical constants are always given the same meaning by every interpretation of the standard kind, so that only the meanings of the non-logical symbols are changed. Logical constants include quantifier symbols ∀ (\"all\") and ∃ (\"some\"), symbols for logical connectives ∧ (\"and\"), ∨ (\"or\"), ¬ (\"not\"), parentheses and other grouping symbols, and (in many treatments) the equality symbol =.\n\nMany of the commonly studied interpretations associate each sentence in a formal language with a single truth value, either True or False. These interpretations are called \"truth functional\"; they include the usual interpretations of propositional and first-order logic. The sentences that are made true by a particular assignment are said to be \"satisfied\" by that assignment.\n\nNo sentence can be made both true and false by the same interpretation, but it is possible that the truth value of the same sentence can be different under different interpretations. A sentence is \"consistent\" if it is true under at least one interpretation; otherwise it is \"inconsistent\". A sentence φ is said to be \"logically valid\" if it is satisfied by every interpretation (if φ is satisfied by every interpretation that satisfies ψ then φ is said to be a \"logical consequence\" of ψ).\n\nSome of the logical symbols of a language (other than quantifiers) are truth-functional connectives that represent truth functions — functions that take truth values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).\n\nThe truth-functional connectives enable compound sentences to be built up from simpler sentences. In this way, the truth value of the compound sentence is defined as a certain truth function of the truth values of the simpler sentences. The connectives are usually taken to be logical constants, meaning that the meaning of the connectives is always the same, independent of what interpretations are given to the other symbols in a formula.\n\nThis is how we define logical connectives in propositional logic:\n\nSo under a given interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The following table shows how this kind of thing looks. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. The other columns show the truth-values of formulas built from these sentence letters, with truth-values determined recursively.\n\nNow it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Take the formula \"F\": (Φ ∨ ¬Φ). If our interpretation function makes Φ True, then ¬Φ is made False by the negation connective. Since the disjunct Φ of \"F\" is True under that interpretation, \"F\" is True. Now the only other possible interpretation of Φ makes it False, and if so, ¬Φ is made True by the negation function. That would make \"F\" True again, since one of \"F\"s disjuncts, ¬Φ, would be true under this interpretation. Since these two interpretations for \"F\" are the only possible logical interpretations, and since \"F\" comes out True for both, we say that it is logically valid or tautologous.\n\nAn \"interpretation of a theory\" is the relationship between a theory and some subject matter when there is a many-to-one correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a correspondent it is called a \"full interpretation\", otherwise it is called a \"partial interpretation\".\n\nThe formal language for propositional logic consists of formulas built up from propositional symbols (also called sentential symbols, sentential variables, and propositional variables) and logical connectives. The only non-logical symbols in a formal language for propositional logic are the propositional symbols, which are often denoted by capital letters. To make the formal language precise, a specific set of propositional symbols must be fixed.\n\nThe standard kind of interpretation in this setting is a function that maps each propositional symbol to one of the truth values true and false. This function is known as a \"truth assignment\" or \"valuation\" function. In many presentations, it is literally a truth value that is assigned, but some presentations assign truthbearers instead.\n\nFor a language with \"n\" distinct propositional variables there are 2 distinct possible interpretations. For any particular variable \"a\", for example, there are 2=2 possible interpretations: 1) \"a\" is assigned T, or 2) \"a\" is assigned F. For the pair \"a\", \"b\" there are 2=4 possible interpretations: 1) both are assigned T, 2) both are assigned F, 3) \"a\" is assigned T and \"b\" is assigned F, or 4) \"a\" is assigned F and \"b\" is assigned T.\n\nGiven any truth assignment for a set of propositional symbols, there is a unique extension to an interpretation for all the propositional formulas built up from those variables. This extended interpretation is defined inductively, using the truth-table definitions of the logical connectives discussed above.\n\nUnlike propositional logic, where every language is the same apart from a choice of a different set of propositional variables, there are many different first-order languages. Each first-order language is defined by a signature. The signature consists of a set of non-logical symbols and an identification of each of these symbols as a constant symbol, a function symbol, or a predicate symbol. In the case of function and predicate symbols, a natural number arity is also assigned. The alphabet for the formal language consists of logical constants, the equality relation symbol =, all the symbols from the signature, and an additional infinite set of symbols known as variables.\n\nFor example, in the language of rings, there are constant symbols 0 and 1, two binary function symbols + and ·, and no binary relation symbols. (Here the equality relation is taken as a logical constant.)\n\nAgain, we might define a first-order language L, as consisting of individual symbols a, b, and c; predicate symbols F, G, H, I and J; variables x, y, z; no function letters; no sentential symbols.\n\nGiven a signature σ, the corresponding formal language is known as the set of σ-formulas. Each σ-formula is built up out of atomic formulas by means of logical connectives; atomic formulas are built from terms using predicate symbols. The formal definition of the set of σ-formulas proceeds in the other direction: first, terms are assembled from the constant and function symbols together with the variables. Then, terms can be combined into an atomic formula using a predicate symbol (relation symbol) from the signature or the special predicate symbol \"=\" for equality (see the section \"Interpreting equality\" below). Finally, the formulas of the language are assembled from atomic formulas using the logical connectives and quantifiers.\n\nTo ascribe meaning to all sentences of a first-order language, the following information is needed.\nAn object carrying this information is known as a structure ( signature σ), or σ-structure, or \"L\"-structure, or as a \"model\".\n\nThe information specified in the interpretation provides enough information to give a truth value to any atomic formula, after each of its free variables, if any, has been replaced by an element of the domain. The truth value of an arbitrary sentence is then defined inductively using the T-schema, which is a definition of first-order semantics developed by Alfred Tarski. The T-schema interprets the logical connectives using truth tables, as discussed above. Thus, for example, is satisfied if and only if both φ and ψ are satisfied.\n\nThis leaves the issue of how to interpret formulas of the form and . The domain of discourse forms the range for these quantifiers. The idea is that the sentence is true under an interpretation exactly when every substitution instance of φ(\"x\"), where \"x\" is replaced by some element of the domain, is satisfied. The formula is satisfied if there is at least one element \"d\" of the domain such that φ(\"d\") is satisfied.\n\nStrictly speaking, a substitution instance such as the formula φ(\"d\") mentioned above is not a formula in the original formal language of φ, because \"d\" is an element of the domain. There are two ways of handling this technical issue. The first is to pass to a larger language in which each element of the domain is named by a constant symbol. The second is to add to the interpretation a function that assigns each variable to an element of the domain. Then the T-schema can quantify over variations of the original interpretation in which this variable assignment function is changed, instead of quantifying over substitution instances.\n\nSome authors also admit propositional variables in first-order logic, which must then also be interpreted. A propositional variable can stand on its own as an atomic formula. The interpretation of a propositional variable is one of the two truth values \"true\" and \"false.\"\n\nBecause the first-order interpretations described here are defined in set theory, they do not associate each predicate symbol with a property(or relation), but rather with the extension of that property (or relation). In other words, these first-order interpretations are extensional not intensional.\n\nAn example of interpretation formula_12 of the language L described above is as follows.\n\nIn the interpretation formula_12 of L:\n\nAs stated above, a first-order interpretation is usually required to specify a nonempty set as the domain of discourse. The reason for this requirement is to guarantee that equivalences such as\nwhere \"x\" is not a free variable of φ, are logically valid. This equivalence holds in every interpretation with a nonempty domain, but does not always hold when empty domains are permitted. For example, the equivalence\nfails in any structure with an empty domain. Thus the proof theory of first-order logic becomes more complicated when empty structures are permitted. However, the gain in allowing them is negligible, as both the intended interpretations and the interesting interpretations of the theories people study have non-empty domains.\n\nEmpty relations do not cause any problem for first-order interpretations, because there is no similar notion of passing a relation symbol across a logical connective, enlarging its scope in the process. Thus it is acceptable for relation symbols to be interpreted as being identically false. However, the interpretation of a function symbol must always assign a well-defined and total function to the symbol.\n\nThe equality relation is often treated specially in first order logic and other predicate logics. There are two general approaches.\n\nThe first approach is to treat equality as no different than any other binary relation. In this case, if an equality symbol is included in the signature, it is usually necessary to add various axioms about equality to axiom systems (for example, the substitution axiom saying that if \"a\" = \"b\" and \"R\"(\"a\") holds then \"R\"(\"b\") holds as well). This approach to equality is most useful when studying signatures that do not include the equality relation, such as the signature for set theory or the signature for second-order arithmetic in which there is only an equality relation for numbers, but not an equality relation for set of numbers.\n\nThe second approach is to treat the equality relation symbol as a logical constant that must be interpreted by the real equality relation in any interpretation. An interpretation that interprets equality this way is known as a \"normal model\", so this second approach is the same as only studying interpretations that happen to be normal models. The advantage of this approach is that the axioms related to equality are automatically satisfied by every normal model, and so they do not need to be explicitly included in first-order theories when equality is treated this way. This second approach is sometimes called \"first order logic with equality\", but many authors adopt it for the general study of first-order logic without comment.\n\nThere are a few other reasons to restrict study of first-order logic to normal models. First, it is known that any first-order interpretation in which equality is interpreted by an equivalence relation and satisfies the substitution axioms for equality can be cut down to an elementarily equivalent interpretation on a subset of the original domain. Thus there is little additional generality in studying non-normal models. Second, if non-normal models are considered, then every consistent theory has an infinite model; this affects the statements of results such as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, which are usually stated under the assumption that only normal models are considered.\n\nA generalization of first order logic considers languages with more than one \"sort\" of variables. The idea is different sorts of variables represent different types of objects. Every sort of variable can be quantified; thus an interpretation for a many-sorted language has a separate domain for each of the sorts of variables to range over (there is an infinite collection of variables of each of the different sorts). Function and relation symbols, in addition to having arities, are specified so that each of their arguments must come from a certain sort.\n\nOne example of many-sorted logic is for planar Euclidean geometry. There are two sorts; points and lines. There is an equality relation symbol for points, an equality relation symbol for lines, and a binary incidence relation \"E\" which takes one point variable and one line variable. The intended interpretation of this language has the point variables range over all points on the Euclidean plane, the line variable range over all lines on the plane, and the incidence relation \"E\"(\"p\",\"l\") holds if and only if point \"p\" is on line \"l\".\n\nA formal language for higher-order predicate logic looks much the same as a formal language for first-order logic. The difference is that there are now many different types of variables. Some variables correspond to elements of the domain, as in first-order logic. Other variables correspond to objects of higher type: subsets of the domain, functions from the domain, functions that take a subset of the domain and return a function from the domain to subsets of the domain, etc. All of these types of variables can be quantified.\n\nThere are two kinds of interpretations commonly employed for higher-order logic. \"Full semantics\" require that, once the domain of discourse is satisfied, the higher-order variables range over all possible elements of the correct type (all subsets of the domain, all functions from the domain to itself, etc.). Thus the specification of a full interpretation is the same as the specification of a first-order interpretation. \"Henkin semantics\", which are essentially multi-sorted first-order semantics, require the interpretation to specify a separate domain for each type of higher-order variable to range over. Thus an interpretation in Henkin semantics includes a domain \"D\", a collection of subsets of \"D\", a collection of functions from \"D\" to \"D\", etc. The relationship between these two semantics is an important topic in higher order logic.\n\nThe interpretations of propositional logic and predicate logic described above are not the only possible interpretations. In particular, there are other types of interpretations that are used in the study of non-classical logic (such as intuitionistic logic), and in the study of modal logic.\n\nInterpretations used to study non-classical logic include topological models, Boolean-valued models, and Kripke models. Modal logic is also studied using Kripke models.\n\nMany formal languages are associated with a particular interpretation that is used to motivate them. For example, the first-order signature for set theory includes only one binary relation, ∈, which is intended to represent set membership, and the domain of discourse in a first-order theory of the natural numbers is intended to be the set of natural numbers.\n\nThe intended interpretation is called the \"standard model\" (a term introduced by Abraham Robinson in 1960). In the context of Peano arithmetic, it consists of the natural numbers with their ordinary arithmetical operations. All models that are isomorphic to the one just given are also called standard; these models all satisfy the Peano axioms. There are also non-standard models of the (first-order version of the) Peano axioms, which contain elements not correlated with any natural number.\n\nWhile the intended interpretation can have no explicit indication in the strictly formal syntactical rules, it naturally affects the choice of the formation and transformation rules of the syntactical system. For example, primitive signs must permit expression of the concepts to be modeled; sentential formulas are chosen so that their counterparts in the intended interpretation are meaningful declarative sentences; primitive sentences need to come out as true sentences in the interpretation; rules of inference must be such that, if the sentence formula_16 is directly derivable from a sentence formula_17, then formula_18 turns out to be a true sentence, with meaning implication, as usual. These requirements ensure that all provable sentences also come out to be true.\n\nMost formal systems have many more models than they were intended to have (the existence of non-standard models is an example). When we speak about 'models' in empirical sciences, we mean, if we want reality to be a model of our science, to speak about an \"intended model\". A model in the empirical sciences is an \"intended factually-true descriptive interpretation\" (or in other contexts: a non-intended arbitrary interpretation used to clarify such an intended factually-true descriptive interpretation.) All models are interpretations that have the same domain of discourse as the intended one, but other assignments for non-logical constants.\n\nGiven a simple formal system (we shall call this one formula_19) whose alphabet α consists only of three symbols formula_20 and whose formation rule for formulas is:\n\nThe single axiom schema of formula_19 is:\n\nA formal proof can be constructed as follows:\n\nIn this example the theorem produced \" formula_30 \" can be interpreted as meaning \"One plus three equals four.\" A different interpretation would be to read it backwards as \"Four minus three equals one.\"\n\nThere are other uses of the term \"interpretation\" that are commonly used, which do not refer to the assignment of meanings to formal languages.\n\nIn model theory, a structure \"A\" is said to interpret a structure \"B\" if there is a definable subset \"D\" of \"A\", and definable relations and functions on \"D\", such that \"B\" is isomorphic to the structure with domain \"D\" and these functions and relations. In some settings, it is not the domain \"D\" that is used, but rather \"D\" modulo an equivalence relation definable in \"A\". For additional information, see Interpretation (model theory).\n\nA theory \"T\" is said to interpret another theory \"S\" if there is a finite extension by definitions \"T\"′ of \"T\" such that \"S\" is contained in \"T\"′.\n\n\n"}

It is very similar to Jamaican Creole and has borrowed many words from English.\n\nJamaican Creole was introduced to the Limón Province by Jamaican migrant workers who arrived to work on the construction of the Atlantic railway, the banana plantations and on the Pacific railway.\n\nThe name \"Mekatelyu\" is a transliteration of the phrase \"make I tell you\", or in standard English \"let me tell you\". Linguists of the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica and the Universidad de Costa Rica consider it as not English.\n\nWhen European countries went to Africa to take people for slavery, they sent Africans from different countries who had no language in common to work on plantations in the Caribbean Islands. Those Africans had to develop a way to speak to communicate between themselves. If their slave driver spoke English, they started to learn it. Over time, those enslaved people created an English that was only understandable between them (a kind of pidgin) and then, they taught that way to speak to their childrena creole language.\n\nThose speakers of creole English had a lot of contact with Scottish, Irish and English people, so they had to learn to speak an English that was more understandable to different nationalities (a \"neutral\" or standard English). Therefore, they created many ways to speak English, from the \"most creole\" to the \"most standard\" varying gradually according to the context.\n\nAfricans enslaved by the French developed a French creole, but they had little or no contact with French speakers. So, their French creole became an independent language.\n\nOne common way to call the Limón Creole English in Costa Rica is by the term \"Patois\", a word was used initially by French. In France, there are many ways to speak French and also many languages (including other romance languages as Provençal). This country needed to homogenize the language and declared the French of Paris as the correct French. For that, the other varieties of French or the other minority languages were considered incorrect or bad ways to speak and were called \"patois\" (that means to speak with the feet). The French creole was also considered patois because it differed to the French or Paris. By the pass of time, the meaning of the term patois expanded even more. As an analogy to the French creole, the English creole was also called with patois. When Costa Ricans talk about the Costa Rican Patois used in Limón, it is not clear if they mean the creole English (the most common creole) or the creole French.\n\nLimón was once a very important port of the Caribbean and the English was an important language used there. There were French creole speakers that migrated to this region and had to learn English. As it was hard for these migrants to learn a new language as adults, they started to mix their native language (French creole) with the creole English. That is the reason why some Costa Ricans have the false belief that in Limón is spoken a mix of French and English. Only a few migrants made it.\n\nLinguists are undecided if the English creole is a kind of English or another language. According to some authors, the Limonese Creole should be declared other language as it happens with the French creole of Haiti. However, in Haiti there is no dialectal continuum, as the distinction between the French and the creole is clear; and in Limón there exists a continuum between the English and the Creole. This is related to the linguistic phenomenon of decreolization.\n\nThere is controversy about what should be taught in Limón schools, Creole English or Standard English. The first option would conserve cultural identity and history of those African descendants. However, the second option would allow people to have jobs needing bilingualism in Spanish and English.\n\n\n\n"}

Estimating the number of speakers of a given language is not straightforward, and various estimates may diverge considerably. This is first of all due to the question of defining \"language\" vs. \"dialect\". Identification of varieties as a single language or as distinct languages is often based on ethnic, cultural, or political considerations rather than mutual intelligibility. The second difficulty is multilingualism, complicating the definition of \"native language\". Finally, in many countries, insufficient census data add to the difficulties.\n\nDemolinguistics is a branch of Sociology of language observing linguistic trends as affected by population distribution and redistribution and by the status of societies.\n\nThe following table compares the estimates of Comrie (1998) and Weber (1997) (number of native speakers in millions). Also given are the estimates of SIL Ethnologue (2005). \nComparing estimates that do not date to the same year is problematic due to the 1.14% per year growth of world population (with significant regional differences).\n\nThis table shows that for the world's largest languages, it is impossible to give an estimate of the number of native speakers with a certainty better than 10% or so. Macrolanguages like Chinese and Arabic are particularly difficult to define, and estimates consequently show uncertainties of the order of 25%.\n\nCase studies:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1550259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1550259", "title": "Minimum viable population", "text": "Minimum viable population\n\nMinimum viable population (MVP) is a lower bound on the population of a species, such that it can survive in the wild. This term is used in the fields of biology, ecology, and conservation biology. More specifically, MVP is the smallest possible size at which a biological population can exist without facing extinction from natural disasters or demographic, environmental, or genetic stochasticity. The term \"population\" rarely refers to an entire species. For example, the undomesticated dromedary camel is extinct in its natural wild habitat; however, there is a domestic population in captivity and an additional feral population in Australia. Two groups of house cats in separate houses which are not allowed outdoors are also technically distinct populations. Typically, however, MVP is used to refer solely to a wild population, such as the red wolf.\n\nMinimum viable population is usually estimated as the population size necessary to ensure between 90 and 95 percent probability of survival between 100 and 1,000 years into the future. The MVP can be estimated using computer simulations for population viability analyses (PVA). PVA models populations using demographic and environmental information to project future population dynamics. The probability assigned to a PVA is arrived at after repeating the environmental simulation thousands of times.\n\nFor example, for a theoretical simulation of a population of 50 giant pandas in which the simulated population goes completely extinct, 30 out of 100 stochastic simulations projected 100 years into the future are not viable. Causes of extinction in the simulation may include inbreeding depression, natural disaster, or climate change. Extinction occurring in 30 out of 100 runs would give a survival probability of 70%. In contrast, in the same simulation with a starting population of 60 pandas, the panda population may only become extinct in four of the hundred runs, resulting in a survival probability of 96%. In this case the minimum viable population that satisfies the 90- to 95% probability for survival is between 50 and 60 pandas. (These figures have been invented for the purpose of this example.)\n\nMVP does not take external intervention into account. Thus, it is useful for conservation managers and environmentalists; a population may be increased above the MVP using a captive breeding program, or by bringing other members of the species in from other reserves.\n\nThere is naturally some debate on the accuracy of PVAs, since a wide variety of assumptions generally are required for future forecasting; however, the important consideration is not absolute accuracy, but promulgation of the concept that each species indeed has an MVP, which at least can be approximated for the sake of conservation biology and Biodiversity Action Plans.\n\nThere is a marked trend for insularity, surviving genetic bottlenecks and r-strategy to allow far lower MVPs than average. Conversely, taxa easily affected by inbreeding depression – having high MVPs – are often decidedly K-strategists, with low population densities while occurring over a wide range. An MVP of 500 to 1,000 has often been given as an average for terrestrial vertebrates when inbreeding or genetic variability is ignored. When inbreeding effects are included, estimates of MVP for many species are in the thousands. Based on a meta-analysis of reported values in the literature for many species, Traill \"et al.\" reported concerning vertebrates \"a cross-species frequency distribution of MVP with a median of 4169 individuals (95% CI = 3577–5129).\"\n\nPopulation uncertainty may be divided into four sources:\n\n"}

Most gun carriage designs should prevent this; however, if a gun is fired out of battery, then damage to the carriage can occur, as the effectiveness of the recoil mechanism will have been compromised.\n\nIn firearms and artillery where there is an automatic loading mechanism, a condition can occur in which a live round is at least partially in the firing chamber and capable of being fired, but is not properly secured by the usual mechanism of that particular weapon. The gas pressure produced at the moment of firing can rupture the not fully supported cartridge case and can result in flame and high-pressure gas being vented at the breech of the weapon, potentially creating flying fragments and possibly injuring the operator.\n\nDepending on the design, it is also possible for a semi-automatic handgun to simply not fire upon pulling the trigger when in an out-of-battery state.\n"}
{"id": "24401876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24401876", "title": "Punjabi dialects", "text": "Punjabi dialects\n\nThe Punjabi dialects are the series of dialects spoken in the Punjab region of Pakistan and India. A distinction is usually made between Punjabi in the east and the diverse group of \"Lahnda\" in the west. The literary languages that have developed on the basis of dialects of this area are Punjabi in eastern and central Punjab, Saraiki in the southwest, Hindko in the northwest, and Pothwari in the north. The varieties of \"Greater Punjabi\" have a number of characteristics in common, for example the preservation of the Prakrit double consonants in stressed syllables. Nevertheless, there is disagreement on whether they form part of a single language group, with some proposed classifications placing them all within the Northwestern zone of Indo-Aryan, while others reserving this only for the western varieties, and assigning the eastern ones to the Central zone alongside Hindi.\n\nMajhi is Punjabi dialect spoken by the majority of the people in Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal, Gujrat, Okara, Pakpattan, Sahiwal, Hafizabad, Nankana Sahib and Mandi Bahauddin districts of Pakistan's Punjab Province. It also has a large presence in every district in the rest of Pakistani Punjab, and in all large cities in Pakistan's other provinces.\n\nIn India it is spoken in Amritsar, Tarn Taran Sahib, Pathankot and Gurdaspur Districts of the State of Punjab and sizable population also in major cities of the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Mumbai India.\n\nIn Pakistan Standard Punjabi dialect is not called Majhi which is Indian terminology, in Pakistan it is simply called Standard Punjabi. This dialect is used for both Punjabi Films, TV and Theater industry to make Punjabi language content in Lahore.\n\nMalwai is spoken in the southern part of Indian Punjab South of river Sutlej and also in Bahawalnagar and Vehari districts of Pakistan. This dialect is spoken in Ludhiana, Moga, Ferozepur, Fazilka,\nMuktsar, Faridkot, Bathinda, Barnala, Sangrur and, Mansa districts of Punjab, India and also in Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts of Rajasthan and, the Sirsa and, Fatehabad districts of Haryana.\nNot to be confused with the Malvi language, which shares its name.\n\nDoabi is spoken in both the Indian Punjab as well as parts of Pakistan Punjab owing to post-1947 migration of Muslim populace from East Punjab. The word \"Do Aabi\" means \"the land between two rivers\" and this dialect is spoken between the rivers of the Beas and the Sutlej in the region called Doaba. Regions it is presently spoken includes the Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts in Indian Punjab as well as the Toba Tek Singh and Faisalabad districts in Pakistan Punjab where it is spoken by the erstwhile migrants from Eastern Punjab and their descendants. The dialect is known as Faisalabadi Punjabi in Pakistan.\n\nThis Dialect is also used as a standard for Indian Punjabi Films and TV shows.\n\nPwadhi, Powadh, Puadh or Powadha is a region of Punjab and parts of Haryana between the Satluj and Ghaggar rivers. The part lying south, south-east and east of Rupnagar adjacent to Ambala District (Haryana) is Powadhi. The Powadh extends from that part of the Rupnagar District which lies near Satluj to beyond the Ghaggar river in the east up to Kala Amb, which is at the border of the states of Himachal pradesh and Haryana. Parts of Fatehgarh Sahib district, and parts of Patiala districts like Rajpura are also part of Powadh. The language is spoken over a large area in present Punjab as well as Haryana. In Punjab, Kharar, Kurali, Ropar, Nurpurbedi, Morinda, Pail, Rajpura and Samrala are the areas where the Puadhi is spoken and the dialect area also includes Pinjore, Kalka, Ismailabad, Pehowa to Bangar area in Fatehabad district.\n\nThe literary language of Lahnda speakers has traditionally been Standard Punjabi.\n\nShahpuri dialect (also known as Sargodha dialect) is mostly spoken in Pakistani Punjab. Its name is derived from former Shahpur District (now Shahpur Tehsil, being part of Sargodha District). It is spoken throughout a widespread area, spoken in Sargodha and Khushab Districts and also spoken in neighbouring Mianwali and Bhakkar Districts. It is mainly spoken on western end of Sindh River to Chennab river crossing Jehlam river.\n\nJhangochi (جھنگوچی) dialect is spoken in Pakistani Punjab throughout a widespread area, starting from Khanewal and Jhang at both ends of Ravi and Chenab to Hafizabad district.\n\nJangli is a dialect of former nomad tribes of areas whose names are often suffixed with 'Bar' derived from jungle bar before irrigation system arrived in the start of the 20th century, for example, Sandal Bar, Kirana Bar, Neeli Bar, Ganji Bar. Former Layllpur and western half of Montgomary district used to speak this dialect.\n\nPothohari is spoken in north Pakistani Punjab and Azad Kashmir. The area where it is spoken extends in the north from Muzaffarabad to as far south as Jhelum(mainly in Dina and Sohawa tehsils), Gujar Khan, Rawat and Rawalpindi, Murree Hills north of Rawalpindi, and east to Bhimber. Chibhali and Dhundi-Kairali dialects may be related. It merges with Majhi dialect at Saraialamgir/Kharian in the south and with Hindko dialects in the north at Attock.\n\nThe diverse dialects of the furthest northwest areas of \"Greater Punjabi\" are known as Hindko. The central Hindko dialects comprise Ghebi, Awankari, Chacchi and Kohati. Peshawari, the divergent dialect spoken to the northwest in Peshawar, has been used as a basis for a literary language. The dialect of the Hazara region to the northeast forms a dialect group of its own known as Northern Hindko or Kagani.\n\nGhebi is quite similar to the Potowari dialect, but differs slightly, for example in the past tense, in which it uses (ahay+prefix) for 'was'. For example, \"Mea ahayaan\" means \"I was\". It also uses \"Vinjna\" instead of \"jaana\" or \"gchna\" for \"going\". It is mostly spoken in Fateh Jang Tehsil and Pindi Gheb Tehsil in Pakistani Punjab.\n\nSpoken in parts of Rawalpindi Division (Pothohar) of Pakistani Punjab. Its name is derived from Dhan valley where its spoken. It is spoken in Chakwal, Khewra, parts of Jehlam Districts and Attock Districts. The people of Pothohar speak Pothohari dialect. However, the people of Chakwal or the Dhanni area in particular do not speak Pothohari and are ethnologically not regarded as Potoharis. They speak a distinctive Chakwali or Dhanni dialect of Punjabi.\n\nThese are a form of Derawali very strongly influenced by baluchi and sindhi languages, spoken in Musakhel and Barkhan, districts of Pakistani Province Balochistan respectively. Khetrani may not actually be a Lahnda language, but originally a Dardic language that gradually merged into neighboring lahnda dialects.\n\nWest of Chenaab river in Jhang district of Pakistani Punjab the dialect of Jhangochi merges with Thalochi and resultant dialect is Chenavari. Name is derived from Chenaab river.\n\nThe emergent language of the southern parts of Punjab is Saraiki. Its standard is based on the central dialect of Multani. Other dialects that are commonly associated with it are Riasti (also known as Bahawalpuri or Choolistani) to the south and Thali (or Thalochri) to the northwest. The varieties of Multani and Thali spoken in the west along the boundary with Balochistan and Pashtun dominated regions are also known as Derawali.\n\nThere are several dialects all cited in the dialect link. Note as the language is spreading with immigration throughout the world variations on the exported dialects of the immigrants mixed with local languages are now emerging where Punjabi has managed to sustain itself. For example, in the UK and North America English words and grammar have begun infiltrating Punjabi spoken there as has Swahili in Kenya. The effect of this is a myriad of Diaspora Creole variations that deviate from the source language somewhat like English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French have in Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America.\n\n\n"}

It is spoken natively by some 1.4 million Rifians of Morocco and Algeria, primarily in the Rif provinces of Al Hoceima, Nador, Driouch, Berkane and as a minority language in Tangier, Oujda, Tetouan and Leɛrayec. In addition, Rifian expatriate communities also speak the language.\n\nRifian is a Zenati Berber language which consists of various sub-dialects specific to each clan and of which a majority are spoken in the Rif region, a large mountainous area of Northern Morocco, and a minority spoken in the western part of neighbouring Algeria.\n\nRifian is spoken mainly in the Moroccan Rif on the Mediterranean coast and in the Rif mountains, with a large minority in the Spanish autonomous city of Melilla. There are also speakers of Rifian in Morocco outside the Rif region, notably in the rest of Moroccan cities where they compose a minority. The neighbour state of Algeria is also home to Rif minorities. A Rifian-speaking community exists in the Netherlands and Belgium as well as to a lesser extent other European countries. Its own speakers simply call it \"Tamazight\", a term also often applied in a broader sense to the Berber language across North Africa in general.\n\nDialects include West-Rifian (Al Hoceima), Central-Rifian (Nador) and East-Rifian (Berkan). \n\nIznasen (Iznacen, Beni Snassen) is counted as a dialect in Kossman (1999), but Blench (2006) classifies it as one of the closely related Mzab–Wargla languages.\n\nThere is a large amount of dialectal variation in Rifian Berber; this can easily be seen using the dialect Atlas (Lafkioui, 1997), however Rifian compose a single language with its own phonetical innovations distinct from other Berber languages. Majority of them are spoken in Northern Morocco, this includes the varieties of Al Hoceima, Temsamane, Nador, Ikbadene (including Iznasen) and the more southernly variety in the Taza province. Besides Rifian, two other unrelated and smaller Berber languages are spoken in North Morocco : the Sanhaja de Srair and the Ghomara languages.\n\nA few Rifian dialects are or used to be in the western part of Algeria, notably by the Beni Snouss tribe of the Tlemcen, as well in Bethioua but also in various colonial districts Rifians started to emigrate to since the 19th century.\n\nRifian's most noticeable differences from other Berber dialects are that:\n\n\nThese variations do not occur in the Rifian dialects of Ikebdanen and Iznasen.\n\n\nLike other Berber languages, Rifian has been written with several different systems over the years. Most recently (since 2003), Tifinagh has become official throughout Morocco. The Arabic script is not used anymore for writing Rifian Berber. The Berber Latin alphabet continues to be used unofficially online and in most publications in Morocco and abroad. However, unlike the nearby Tashelhit (Shilha), Rifian Berber has little written literature before the twentieth century.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "780514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=780514", "title": "Spanish grammar", "text": "Spanish grammar\n\nSpanish grammar is the grammar of the Spanish language (\"español\"), which is a Romance language that originated in north central Spain and is spoken today throughout Spain, some twenty countries in the Americas, and Equatorial Guinea in Africa.\n\nSpanish is an inflected language. The verbs are potentially marked for tense, aspect, mood, person, and number (resulting in some fifty conjugated forms per verb). The nouns form a two-gender system and are marked for number. Pronouns can be inflected for person, number, gender (including a residual neuter), and a very reduced case; the Spanish pronominal system represents a simplification of the ancestral Latin system.\nSpanish was the first of the European vernaculars to have a grammar treatise, \"Gramática de la lengua castellana\", written in 1492 by the Andalusian philologist Antonio de Nebrija and presented to Queen Isabella of Castile at Salamanca.\n\nThe Real Academia Española (RAE, Royal Spanish Academy) traditionally dictates the normative rules of the Spanish language, as well as its orthography.\n\nFormal differences between Peninsular and American Spanish are remarkably few, and someone who has learned the dialect of one area will generally have no difficulties using formal speech in the other; however, pronunciation does vary, as well as grammar and vocabulary.\n\nRecently published comprehensive Spanish reference grammars in English include , , and .\n\nEvery Spanish verb belongs to one of three form classes, characterized by the infinitive ending: \"-ar\", \"-er\", or \"-ir\"—sometimes called the first, second, and third conjugations, respectively.\n\nA Spanish verb has nine indicative tenses with more-or-less direct English equivalents: the present tense ('I walk'), the preterite ('I walked'), the imperfect ('I was walking' or 'I used to walk'), the present perfect ('I have walked'), the past perfect — also called the pluperfect ('I had walked'), the future ('I will walk'), the future perfect ('I will have walked'), the conditional simple ('I would walk') and the conditional perfect ('I would have walked').\n\nIn most dialects, each tense has six potential forms, varying for first, second, or third person and for singular or plural number. In the second person, Spanish maintains the so-called \"T–V distinction\" between familiar and formal modes of address. The formal second-person pronouns (\"usted\", \"ustedes\") take third-person verb forms.\n\nThe second-person familiar plural is expressed in most of Spain with the pronoun \"vosotros\" and its characteristic verb forms (e.g. \"coméis\" 'you [pl.] eat'), while in Latin American Spanish it merges with the formal second-person plural (e.g. \"ustedes comen\"). Thus \"ustedes\" is used as both the formal and familiar second-person pronoun in Latin America.\n\nIn many areas of Latin America (especially Central America and southern South America), the second-person familiar singular pronoun \"tú\" is replaced by \"vos\", which frequently requires its own characteristic verb forms, especially in the present indicative, where the endings are \"-ás\", \"-és\", and \"-ís\" for \"-ar\", \"-er\", \"-ir\" verbs, respectively. See \"voseo\".\n\nIn the tables of paradigms below, the (optional) subject pronouns appear in parentheses.\n\nThe present indicative is used to express actions or states of being in a present time frame. For example:\n\nSpanish has a number of verb tenses used to express actions or states of being in a past time frame. The two that are \"simple\" in form (formed with a single word, rather than being compound verbs) are the preterite and the imperfect.\n\nThe preterite is used to express actions or events that took place in the past, and which were instantaneous or are viewed as completed. For example:\n\nNote that (1) for \"-ar\" and \"-ir\" verbs (but not \"-er\"), the first-person plural form is the same as that of the present indicative; and (2) \"-er\" and \"-ir\" verbs share the same set of endings.\n\nThe imperfect expresses actions or states that are viewed as ongoing in the past. For example:\nAll three of the sentences above describe \"non-instantaneous\" actions that are viewed as continuing in the past. The characteristic in the first sentence and the action in the second were continuous, not instantaneous occurrences. In the third sentence, the speaker focuses on the action in progress, not on its beginning or end.\n\nNote that (1) for all verbs in the imperfect, the first- and third-person singular share the same form; and (2) \"-er\" and \"-ir\" verbs share the same set of endings.\n\nThe preterite and the imperfect can be combined in the same sentence to express the occurrence of an event in one clause during an action or state expressed in another clause. For example:\nIn all three cases, an event or completed action interrupts an ongoing state or action. For example, in the second sentence, the speaker states that he was in his room (expressed through the imperfect to reflect the ongoing or unfinished state of being there) when the other person \"interrupted\" that state by entering (expressed through the preterite to suggest a completed action).\n\nThe present and imperfect progressive both are used to express ongoing, progressive action in the present and past, respectively. For example:\nThe present progressive is formed by first conjugating the verb \"estar\" or \"seguir\", depending on context, to the subject, and then attaching a gerund of the verb that follows. The past (imperfect) progressive simply requires the estar or seguir to be conjugated, depending on context, in imperfect, with respect to the subject.\n\nTo form the gerund of an \"-ar\" verb, replace the \"-ar\" of the infinitive with \"-ando\";\ne.g. \"jugar\", \"hablar\", \"caminar\" → \"jugando\", \"hablando\", \"caminando\".\nFor \"-er\" or \"-ir verbs\", replace the \"-er\" or \"-ir\" ending with \"-iendo\";\ne.g. \"comer\", \"escribir\", \"dormir\" → \"comiendo\", \"escribiendo\", \"durmiendo\" (note that \"dormir\" undergoes the stem vowel change that is typical of \"-ir\" verbs).\nIn \"-er\" verbs whose stem ends with a vowel, the \"i\" of the \"-iendo\" ending is replaced by \"y\": e.g. \"leer\", \"traer\", \"creer\" → \"leyendo\", \"trayendo\", \"creyendo\".\nIn \"-ir\" verbs whose stem ends with \"e\"—such as \"reír\" and \"sonreír\"—the stem vowel \"e\" is raised to \"i\" (as is typical of \"-ir\" verbs), and this \"i\" merges with the \"i\" of the \"-iendo\" ending; e.g. \"reír\", \"freír\" → \"riendo\", \"friendo\".\n\nThe subjunctive of a verb is used to express certain connotations in sentences such as a wish or desire, a demand, an emotion, uncertainty, or doubt.\n\nNormally, a verb would be conjugated in the present indicative to indicate an event in the present frame of time.\nIf the sentence expresses a desire, demand, or emotion, or something similar, in the present tense, the subjunctive is used.\n\nThe subjunctive is also used to convey doubt, denial, or uncertainty.\nIn the first two examples, the ideally likable friend has not yet been found and remains an uncertainty, and authors \"who write that\" are not known to exist. In the third, possibility is not certainty, but rather a conjecture, and the last expresses clear doubt. Thus, subjunctive is used.\nSome of the phrases and verbs that require sentences to have subjunctive formation include:\nSome phrases that require the indicative instead, because they express certainty, include:\n\nTo form the first-person singular subjunctive, first take the present indicative first-person singular ('yo') form of a verb. For example, the verbs hablar, comer, and vivir (To talk, to eat, to live) → Yo hablo, yo como, yo vivo. Then, replace the ending 'o' with the \"opposite ending\". This is done in the following way: if the verb is an -er or -ir verb such as comer, poder, vivir, or compartir, replace the ending 'o' with an 'a' i.e. : Yo como; yo puedo; yo vivo → Yo coma; yo pueda; yo viva. If the verb is an -ar verb such as hablar or caminar replace the ending 'o' with an 'e' i.e. : Yo hablo; yo camino → Yo hable, yo camine. This forms the first-person conjugation. The other conjugations work similarly, as follows:\n\nSince the \"vos\" forms are derived from \"vosotros\" the following would be expected (and used in Central America)\nHowever, the Royal Spanish Academy, following Argentinian usage, recommends using the \"tú\" forms:\n\nToday, the two forms of the imperfect subjunctive are largely interchangeable.* The \"-se\" form derives (as in most Romance languages) from the Latin pluperfect subjunctive, while the \"-ra\" form derives from the Latin pluperfect indicative. The use of one or the other is largely a matter of personal taste and dialect. Many only use the \"-ra\" forms in speech, but vary between the two in writing. Many may spontaneously use either, or even prefer the rarer \"-se\" forms. The imperfect subjunctive is formed for basically the same reasons as the present subjunctive, but is used for other tenses and time frames.\n\nIn Spanish, as in other Romance languages, all nouns belong to one of two genders, \"masculine\" or \"feminine\", and many adjectives change their form to agree in gender with the noun they modify. For most nouns that refer to persons, grammatical gender matches biological gender.\n\nSpanish generally uses adjectives in a similar way to English and most other Indo-European languages. However, there are three key differences between English and Spanish adjectives.\n\nSpanish uses determiners in a similar way to English. The main difference is that they inflect for both number (singular/plural) and gender (masculine/feminine). Common determiners include \"el\" (\"the\"), \"un\" (\"a\"), \"este\" (\"this\"), \"mucho\" (\"much, a lot\"), \"alguno\" (\"some\"), and so on.\n\nSpanish pronouns fall into the same broad categories as English pronouns do: personal, demonstrative, interrogative, relative, and possessive. The personal pronouns–those that vary in form according to whether they represent the first, second, or third grammatical person–include a variety of second-person forms that differ not only according to number (singular or plural), but also according to formality or the social relation between speakers. Additionally, these second-person forms vary according to geographical region. Because the form of a conjugated verb reflects the person and number of its subject, subject pronouns are usually omitted, except where they are felt to be needed for emphasis or disambiguation.\nSpanish adverbs work much like their English counterparts, e.g. \"muy\" (\"very\"), \"poco\" (\"a little\"), \"lejos\" (\"far\"), \"mucho\" (\"much, a lot\"), \"casi\" (\"almost\"), etc. To form adverbs from adjectives, the adverbial suffix \"-mente\" is generally added to the feminine singular of the adjective, whether or not it differs from the masculine singular. Thus:\n\n\nThe adjectives \"bueno\" (\"good\") and \"malo\" (\"bad\") have irregular adverbial forms: \"bien\" (\"well\") and \"mal\" (\"badly\"), respectively.\n\nAs in English, some adverbs are identical to their adjectival counterparts. Thus words such as \"temprano\" (\"early\"), \"lento\" (\"slow\"), and \"hondo\" (\"deep\") can also mean \"early\" (as in English, as in \"He arrived early\") \"slowly\", and \"deeply\", respectively.\n\nIn series of consecutive adverbs that would each end in \"-mente\" on their own, the \"-mente\" is dropped from all but the final adverb, and the others are left as if they were adjectives in the feminine singular. Thus:\n\n\nThere are also a wide variety of adverbial phrases in Spanish, such as \"a menudo\" (\"often\"), \"en todas partes\" (\"everywhere\"), \"de repente\" (\"suddenly\"), \"por fin\" (\"finally\"), and \"sin embargo\" (\"however, nevertheless\").\n\nAs with adjectives, the comparative of adverbs is almost always formed by placing \"más\" (\"more\") or \"menos\" (\"less\") before the adverb. Thus \"más temprano\" (\"earlier\"), \"más rápidamente\" (\"faster, quicker, more quickly\"), \"menos interesantemente\" (\"less interestingly\"), etc. The superlative is formed by placing the neuter article \"lo\" before the comparative, although it is generally used with an additional qualifier phrase such as \"que puedas\" (\"that you can\") or \"de todos\" (\"of all\"): \"lo más rápidamente que puedas\" (\"as quickly as you can\", lit. \"the most quickly that you can\"), \"lo más interesantemente de todos\" (\"most interestingly of all\"), \"lo menos claramente de ellos\" (\"the least clearly of them\"), etc. As with their corresponding adjectival forms, \"bien\" (\"well\") and \"mal\" (\"badly\") have irregular comparative forms (\"mejor\" (\"better\") and \"peor\" (\"worse\"), respectively), and \"más\" and \"menos\" are the comparatives of \"mucho\" (\"much, a lot\") and \"poco\" (\"a little\"), respectively.\n\nSpanish has a relatively large number of prepositions, and does not use postpositions. The following list is traditionally cited:\n\nRecently, two new prepositions have been added: \"durante\" and \"mediante\", usually placed at the end to preserve the list (which is usually learnt by heart by Spanish students).\n\nThis list includes two archaic prepositions (\"so\" and \"cabe\"), but leaves out two new Latinisms (\"vía\" and \"pro\") as well as a large number of very important compound prepositions.\n\nPrepositions in Spanish do not change a verb's meaning as they do in English. For example, to translate \"run out of water\", \"run up a bill\", \"run down a pedestrian\", and \"run in a thief\" into Spanish requires completely different verbs, and not simply the use of \"correr\" (\"run\") plus the corresponding Spanish preposition. This is more due to the nature of English phrasal verbs rather than an inherent function of Spanish verbs or prepositions.\nThe Spanish conjunctions \"y\" ('and') and \"o\" ('or') alter their form in both spoken and written language to \"e\" and \"u\" respectively when followed by an identical vowel sound. Thus, \"padre e hijo\" ('father and son'), \"Fernando e Isabel\" ('Ferdinand and Isabella'), \"sujeto u objeto\" ('subject or object'), \"vertical u horizontal\" ('vertical or horizontal').\n\nThe change does not take place before the \"(h)i\" of a diphthong, as in \"acero y hierro\" ('steel and iron'). Nor does the conjunction \"y\" change when initial in a question (where it serves to introduce or reintroduce a name as a topic, rather than to link one element with another), as in \"¿Y Inés?\" ('What about Inés?').\n\nWhen the conjunction \"o\" appears between numerals, it is usually spelled with an accent mark (\"ó\"), in order to distinguish it from zero (0); thus, \"2 ó 3\" ('2 or 3') in contrast to \"203\" ('two-hundred three').\n\nSpanish unmarked word order for affirmative declarative sentences is subject-verb-object (SVO); however, as in other Romance languages, in practice, word order is more variable, with topicalization and focus being the primary factors in the selection of a particular order. Verb-subject-object (VSO), verb-object-subject (VOS), and object-verb-subject (OVS) are also relatively common, while other orders are very uncommon outside of poetry.\n\nThus, to simply say, \"My friend wrote the book\", one would say (SVO):\n\nAlthough bare VSO and VOS are somewhat rare in declarative independent clauses, they are quite common in sentences in which something other than the subject or direct object functions as the focus. For example:\n\nIn many dependent clauses, the verb is placed before the subject (and thus often VSO or VOS) to avoid placing the verb in final position:\n\nA sentence in which the direct object is the topic or \"theme\" (old information), while the subject is part of the comment, or \"rheme\" (new information), often assumes OVS order. In this case the direct object noun phrase is supplemented with the appropriate direct object pronoun; for example:\n\nBecause subject pronouns are often dropped, one will often see sentences with a verb and direct object but no explicitly stated subject.\n\nIn questions, VSO is usual (though not obligatory):\n\nYes/no questions, regardless of constituent order, are generally distinguished from declarative sentences by context and intonation.\n\nA cleft sentence is one formed with the copular verb (generally with a dummy pronoun like \"it\" as its subject), plus a word that \"cleaves\" the sentence, plus a subordinate clause. They are often used to put emphasis on a part of the sentence. Here are some examples of English sentences and their cleft versions:\n\nSpanish does not usually employ such a structure in simple sentences. The translations of sentences like these can be readily analyzed as being normal sentences containing relative pronouns. Spanish is capable of expressing such concepts without a special cleft structure thanks to its flexible word order.\n\nFor example, if we translate a cleft sentence such as \"It was Juan who lost the keys\", we get \"Fue Juan el que perdió las llaves.\" Whereas the English sentence uses a special structure, the Spanish one does not. The verb \"fue\" has no dummy subject, and the pronoun \"el que\" is not a cleaver but a nominalising relative pronoun meaning \"the [male] one that\". Provided we respect the parings of \"el que\" and \"las llaves\", we can play with the word order of the Spanish sentence without affecting its structure – although each permutation would, to a native speaker, give a subtly different shading of emphasis.\n\nFor example, we can say \"Juan fue el que perdió las llaves\" (\"Juan was the one who lost the keys\") or \"El que perdió las llaves fue Juan\" (\"The one who lost the keys was Juan\"). As can be seen from the translations, if this word order is chosen, English stops using the cleft structure (there is no more dummy \"it\" and a nominalising relative is used instead of the cleaving word) whilst in Spanish no words have changed.\n\nHere are some examples of such sentences:\n\nNote that it is ungrammatical to try to use just \"que\" to cleave such sentences as in English, but using \"quien\" in singular or \"quienes\" in plural is grammatical.\n\nWhen prepositions come into play, things become complicated. Structures unambiguously identifiable as cleft sentences are used. The verb \"ser\" introduces the stressed element and then there is a nominaliser. Both of these are preceded by the relevant preposition. For example:\n\nThis structure is quite wordy, and is therefore often avoided by not using a cleft sentence at all. Emphasis is conveyed just by word order and stressing with the voice (indicated here within bolding):\n\nIn casual speech, the complex cleaving pronoun is often reduced to \"que\", just as it is reduced to \"that\" in English. Foreign learners are advised to avoid this.\n\nIn the singular, the subordinate clause can agree either with the relative pronoun or with the subject of the main sentence, though the latter is seldom used. However, in the plural, only agreement with the subject of the main sentence is acceptable. Therefore:\n\n\nThe use of \"usted\" and \"ustedes\" as a polite form of address is universal. However, there are variations in informal address. \"Ustedes\" replaces \"vosotros\" in much of Andalusia, the Canary Islands and Latin America, except in the liturgical or poetic of styles. In some parts of Andalusia, the pronoun \"ustedes\" is used with the standard \"vosotros\" endings.\n\nDepending on the region, Latin Americans may also replace the singular \"tú\" with \"usted\" or \"vos\". The choice of pronoun is a tricky issue and can even vary from village to village. Travellers are often advised to play it safe and call everyone \"usted\".\n\nA feature of the speech of the Dominican Republic and other areas where syllable-final /s/ is completely silent is that there is no audible difference between the second and third person singular form of the verb. This leads to redundant pronoun use, for example, the tagging on of \"¿tú ves?\" (pronounced \"tuvé\") to the ends of sentences, where other speakers would say \"¿ves?\".\n\n\"Vos\" was used in medieval Castilian as a polite form, like the French \"vous\" and the Italian \"voi\", and it used the same forms as \"vosotros\". This gave three levels of formality:\n\nWhereas \"vos\" was lost in standard Spanish, some dialects lost \"tú\", and began using \"vos\" as the informal pronoun. The exact connotations of this practice, called \"voseo\", depend on the dialect. In certain countries there may be socioeconomic implications. El \"voseo\" uses the pronoun \"vos\" for \"tú\", but maintains \"te\" as an object pronoun and \"tu\" and \"tuyo\" as possessives.\n\nIn \"voseo\", verbs corresponding to \"vos\" in the present indicative (roughly equivalent to the English simple present), are formed from the second person plural (the form for \"vosotros\"). If the second person plural ends in áis or éis, the form for \"vos\" drops the i:\n\n\nSimilarly the verb ser (to be) has:\n\n\nIf the second person plural ends in -ís (with an accent on the í), then the form for \"vos\" is identical:\n\n\nIn the imperative, the form for \"vos\" is also derived from the second person plural. The latter ends always in -d. So for the form for \"vos\" this d is removed, and if the verb has more than one syllable, an accent is added to the last vowel:\n\n\nThe only exception to these rules is in the verb ir (to go), which does not have an imperative form for vos and uses the analogous form of the verb andar, which has a similar meaning, and is regular:\n\n\nIn the present subjunctive, the same rules as for the present indicative apply, though these forms coexist in Argentina with those for the pronoun tú:\n\nOr:\n\nOther tenses always have the same form for vos as for tú.\n\nOutside Argentina, other combinations are possible. For instance, people in Maracaibo may use standard \"vosotros\" endings for \"vos\" \"(vos habláis, que vos habléis)\".\n\nIn Spain, colloquially, the infinitive is used instead of the normative imperative for \"vosotros\". This is not accepted in the normative language.\n\nA form used for centuries but never accepted normatively has an \"-s\" ending in the second person singular of the preterite or simple past. For example, \"lo hicistes\" instead of the normative \"lo hiciste\"; \"hablastes tú\" for \"hablaste tú\". That is the only instance in which the \"tú\" form does not end in an \"-s\" in the normative language.\n\nLadino has gone further with \"hablates\".\n\nThe third-person direct-object and indirect-object pronouns exhibit variation from region to region, from one individual to another, and even within the language of single individuals. The Real Academia Española prefers an \"etymological\" usage, one in which the indirect object function is carried by \"le\" (regardless of gender), and the direct object function is carried by \"la\" or \"lo\" (according to the gender of the antecedent, and regardless of its animacy).\n\nThe Academy also condones the use of \"le\" as a direct object form for masculine, animate antecedents (i.e. male humans). Deviations from these approved usages are named \"leísmo\" (for the use of \"le\" as a direct object), and \"laísmo\" and \"loísmo\" (for the use of \"la\" and \"lo\" as indirect objects). The object pronoun variation is studied in detail by .\n\nHere are some examples for this:\n\n\nNoun clauses in Spanish are typically introduced by the complementizer \"que\", and such a noun clause may serve as the object of the preposition \"de\", resulting in the sequence \"de que\" in the standard language. This sequence, in turn, is often reduced colloquially to just \"que\", and this reduction is called \"queísmo\".\n\nSome speakers, by way of hypercorrection (i.e. in an apparent effort to avoid the \"error\" of \"queísmo\"), insert \"de\" before \"que\" in contexts where it is not prescribed in standard grammar. This insertion of \"extraneous\" \"de\" before \"que\" — called \"dequeísmo\" — is generally associated with less-educated speakers.\n\n"}

{"id": "39145718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39145718", "title": "Subjacency", "text": "Subjacency\n\nSubjacency is a general syntactic locality constraint on movement. It specifies restrictions placed on movement and regards it as a strictly local process. This term was first defined by Noam Chomsky in 1973 and constitutes the main concept of the Government and Binding Theory. The revised definition of subjacency from Chomsky (1977) is as follows: \"A cyclic rule cannot move a phrase from position Y to position X (or conversely) in … X … [α… [β… Y … ] … ] … X …, where α and β are cyclic nodes. Cyclic nodes are S and NP\", (where S=Sentence and NP=Noun Phrase).\n\nThis principle states that no movement can move an element over more than one bounding node at a time. In more recent frameworks, bounding nodes which are hurdles to movement are AgrP (Agreement phrase) and DP (Determiner phrase) (S and NP in Chomsky’s definition respectively). Therefore, Subjacency condition limits movement by defining bounding nodes. It also accounts for the fact that all movements are local.\n\nThe notion of bounding was first observed in the early generative grammar by, for instance, John R. Ross (1967). He noticed that movement is impossible out of certain phrases called Extraction islands. These evidence were further interpreted in terms of the Government and Binding Theory and Subjacency condition in the following way:\n\n(1) who did [ Mary think [ t [ John saw t ]]]\n\n(2) *who did [ John ask [ when [ t fixed the car t ]]]\n\n(3) *who did [ John believe [ the statement [ t that [ Bill hit t ]]]]\n\nIn (1) the \"wh\"-element moves out of the object position of the embedded clause via cyclic movement, crossing only one AgrP at a time. Thereby, it respects the Subjacency condition and the sentence is grammatical. The details of this movement are presented in the diagram below:\n\nAs the specifier of CP position is empty in (1), the \"wh\"-element may use it as an escape hatch before moving further. In the example (2), on the other hand, the specifier of CP position is already taken and the \"wh\"-element moves over two AgrP at a time, violating the Subjacency condition and yielding the ungrammatical sentence.\n\n"}

He was famous for his \"anterliwtau\" (interludes or short plays), which he performed mainly around his native Denbighshire.\n\nEdwards was born in Llannefydd, Denbighshire (now in Conwy County Borough). When a child his parents moved to Y Nant Isaf (), near Nantglyn, from which he took his pen name. Edwards had little formal education: he attended one of Griffith Jones' circulating schools where he learned to read, and attended a school in Denbigh for two weeks to learn English. However, he was eager to learn to write – he cadged writing paper and wrote with ink that he made from elderberries.\n\nIn 1749 Edwards joined a local company of touring actors who typically performed on an improvised stage such as a cart. He wrote seven interludes before he was twenty years old, all of which have been lost.\n\nIn 1763 Edwards married Elizabeth Hughes; the wedding was conducted by the poet-priest Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd). The couple settled in Denbigh where Edwards worked hauling timber, performing in his interludes throughout North Wales, and selling printed copies of the interludes. After financial problems caused by the bankruptcy of his uncle for whom he stood surety, Edwards moved to South Wales where he again worked in timber haulage and for a time kept an inn in Llandeilo. He returned to North Wales in 1786 where he resumed his performances of interludes and became a stonemason. During 1808 he worked for William Madocks on the construction of the Porthmadog embankment.\n\nEdwards' interludes commentate on the social evils of his day, frequently referring to unpopular taxes, greedy landowners, swindling lawyers and immoral clergymen. They form a link between the medieval and modern traditions of Welsh drama. Edwards also wrote and published ballads, of which about 200 remain (some as fragments). He wrote a short autobiography which was published in the periodical \"Y Greal\" in 1805. \n\nEdwards participated in the annual eisteddfodau of the Gwyneddigion Society (the precursors of the National Eisteddfod). His failure to win the main prize at the Corwen eisteddfod in 1789 may be due to a dispute over an impromptu composition competition with Walter Davies (Gwallter Mechain), in which Edwards was supported by David Samwell (Captain Cook's surgeon). Samwell named Edwards \"The Cambrian Shakespeare\" and gave him a silver pen as a consolation prize for having been unfairly beaten. The silver pen is in the collection of National Museum Wales.\n\nEdwards died on 3 April 1810 and was buried at St Marcella's church, Denbigh, where there is a memorial.\n\nEdwards' interludes were republished after his death, and a collection of six interludes were published by Isaac Foulkes in 1874.\n\nGeorge Borrow devotes two chapters to Edwards in his 1862 travel book \"Wild Wales: Its People, Language and Scenery\", including a translation of part of Edwards' interlude \"Riches and Poverty\".\n\nIn 1974 the Welsh playwright Dedwydd Jones published \"Bard : a play on the life and times of Twm O'r Nant\", which was commissioned as the opening play of the Sherman Theatre, Cardiff.\n"}
{"id": "4791788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4791788", "title": "Uralic–Yukaghir languages", "text": "Uralic–Yukaghir languages\n\nUralic–Yukaghir is a proposed language family composed of Uralic and Yukaghir. It is also known as Uralo-Yukaghir.\n\nUralic is a large and diverse family of languages spoken in northern and eastern Europe and northwestern Siberia. Among the better-known Uralic languages are Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian.\n\nYukaghir is a small family of languages spoken in eastern Siberia. It formerly extended over a much wider area (Collinder 1965:30). It consists of two languages, Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir.\n\nThe idea that the Uralic and Yukaghir languages are related is not new. It was advanced in passing by Holger Pedersen in his 1931 book \"Linguistic Science in the Nineteenth Century\" (p. 338). Pedersen included both languages in his proposed Nostratic language family (ib.).\n\nA genetic relationship between Uralic and Yukaghir was argued for in \"Jukagirisch und Uralisch\" ('Yukaghir and Uralic'), a 1940 work by Björn Collinder, one of the leading Uralic specialists of the 20th century (Greenberg 2005:124). Collinder was inspired by a 1907 article by Heikki Paasonen, which pointed to similarities between Uralic and Yukaghir, though it did not identify the two languages as genetically related (Greenberg, ib.).\n\nUralic–Yukaghir is listed as a language family in \"A Guide to the World's Languages\" by Merritt Ruhlen (1987).\n\nUralic and Yukaghir are listed as a language family, forming a subgroup of a higher-order family called \"Eurasiatic\", in Joseph Greenberg's \"Indo-European and Its Closest Relatives\" (2000–2002). However, Greenberg did not present a discursive argument for this subgroup, presumably leaving it to the reader to work it out from the data on grammar and vocabulary he presented.\n\nThe Uralic–Yukaghir family has been accepted by the American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard (2008:176, citing Ruhlen 1987:64–65) but without presenting any argument for it, and Russian linguist Vladimir Napolskikh.\n\nCollinder summarizes his case for, not merely a relationship between Uralic and Yukaghir, but for a Uralic–Yukaghir language family, in his \"Introduction to the Uralic Languages\" (1965:30):\n\nCollinder goes on to compare Uralic with Indo-European (1965:30–34). He begins by saying, \"An Indo-Uralic affinity is far from being strictly proved\", and emphasizes that he has not been able to find as many \"plausible\" cognates for Uralic and Indo-European as for Uralic and Yukaghir, at most about twenty. He then goes on to list 15 of these cognates, with reflexes in Uralic and Indo-European languages, and to discuss similarities between Uralic and Indo-European in morphology.\nHe makes no explicit statement on the subgrouping of the language family that must have existed if Uralic, Yukaghir, and Indo-European are all related. While the similarities he attributes to Uralic and Yukaghir, but not to Indo-European, such as the imperative endings, show closer kinship of Uralic and Yukaghir than of Uralic and Indo-European, the similarities he attributes to Uralic and Indo-European, but not to Uralic and Yukaghir, could also be placed in the balance, for example a plural in \"*-i\".\n\nCollinder appears to enumerate approximately as many morphological similarities between Uralic and Indo-European as between Uralic and Yukaghir and at least as many similarities in pronouns (though his treatment of the pronouns is not very comprehensive), so that at bottom the case he makes, if any, for a closer relationship between Uralic and Yukaghir than between Uralic and Indo-European comes down to the fact that Uralic and Yukaghir, in his view, have about two and a half times as many fairly secure lexical cognates as Uralic and Indo-European — a fact that is certainly suggestive but cannot, in the present state of the question, be considered definitive.\n\nGreenberg (2002) lists 115 lexical cognates for Uralic and Indo-European versus 44 lexical cognates for Uralic and Yukaghir. He lists 35 lexical cognates for Indo-European and Yukaghir. Of these cognates, 27 are common to Indo-European, Uralic, and Yukaghir.\n\nEven if one considers Greenberg's listings to be only the result of inspection, as they do not involve the construction of a comprehensive set of sound correspondences, they at least constitute a suggestive preliminary result. However, a large number of Proto-Uralic lexemes are traditionally explained as loanwords from Proto-Indo-European.\n\nThe figures could also be skewed by the fact that the Indo-European and Uralic languages are much more heavily attested than the Yukaghir ones. However, the impressive figure is the 44 Uralic / Yukaghir cognates versus the 35 Indo-European / Yukaghir ones. This figure does not by any means suggest an overwhelmingly closer relationship of Yukaghir and Uralic than of Yukaghir and Indo-European, especially since the opportunities for mutual influence were much greater between Yukaghir and Uralic than between Yukaghir and Indo-European, both with regard to the transmission of innovations and the conservation of older forms (on the latter, cf. Sweet 1900:120–121).\n\nIt therefore appears that an explicit case for a Uralic–Yukaghir language family, as opposed to a Uralic–Yukaghir kinship at some unspecified higher level, has not been made. Collinder (1965:30) has vaguely implied the existence of a Uralic–Yukaghir genetic node, and in this he seems to have been followed by Ruhlen and Greenberg, followed in turn by Bomhard. The actual relations of these languages remain to be scrutinized in detail. No work of synthesis of a definitive nature has appeared on this subject. As in several other cases of this sort (see Ural–Altaic languages), that Uralic and Yukaghir are related has been argued for in some detail, but how they are related remains uncertain.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that, at the present time (2009), the validity of the Uralic–Yukaghir family is controversial. The questions that need to be answered to make a definitive determination in favor of it or against it are:\n\n\nIn answering these questions, a key additional question is:\n\n\nThe last question is a source of controversy, since historical linguists are divided into two opposed camps that have been called \"Geneticists\" and \"Diffusionists\" by Merritt Ruhlen (1994:113–114) and are sometimes caricatured as \"lumpers and splitters\". This conflict will not soon be resolved. However, the fact that, for instance, no-one still believes in the Hamitic family or that the Dené–Yeniseian family has recently attained general acceptance suggests that linguistic science may yet be able to resolve some of these seemingly intractable issues (cf. Vajda 2008).\n\nHäkkinen (2012) rejects a genetic link between Uralic and Yukaghir, arguing that the grammatical systems show too few convincing resemblances, especially the morphology, and proposes instead that many apparent Uralic–Yukaghir cognates are really borrowed from an early stage of Uralic (ca. 3000 BC; he dates Proto-Uralic at ca. 2000 BC) into an early stage of Yukaghir, while Uralic was (according to him) spoken near the Sayan region and Yukaghir near the Upper Lena River and near Lake Baikal. Aikio (2014) agrees that Uralic–Yukaghir is unsupported and implausible and that several apparent cognates are borrowings from Uralic into Yukaghir, though he rejects some of the examples adduced by Häkkinen as spurious or accidental resemblances and puts the date of borrowing much later, arguing that the loanwords he accepts as valid were borrowed from an early stage of Samoyedic (preceding Proto-Samoyedic; thus roughly in the 1st millennium BC) into Yukaghir, in the same general region west of Lake Baikal.\n\nA more decisive piece of evidence that Uralic and Yukaghir form a valid genetic node comes from the presence of similar negative verb formations in each. In 1933, the pioneering Indo-Europeanist Holger Pedersen published a comparative study of the verb endings in Uralic and Indo-European. According to Pedersen (1933: §8), the Uralic negative verb was formed from a verb \"*e-\" meaning 'be' plus the personal endings, which are identical to the personal pronouns. For instance, for the verb \"*mene\" 'go', the Proto-Uralic forms would have been: 1s. \"*e-m mene\", 2s. \"*e-t mene\"; 1p. \"*e-me mene\", 2p. \"*e-te mene\" meaning 'I do not go', 'thou dost not go', etc., literally 'be-me go', 'be-thou go', etc. The Uralic negative particle \"*ne\" 'not' would have originally formed part of the expression, as \"*ne e-m mene\" 'not be-me go' etc. What made it possible to drop the negative particle was that there was no morphological or syntactic possibility of confusing the expression with the positive verb, which had the form 1s. \"*mene-m\", 2s. \"*mene-t\"; 1p. \"*mene-me\", 2p. \"*mene-te\" (still preserved without change in Finnish, except for final \"*-m\" > \"-n\") 'I go', etc. The dropping of the negative particle is well-attested by such expressions as French \"pas\", \"personne\", \"rien\" and Old Norse \"engi\", \"eigi\" (ib.).\n\nPedersen’s argument implies that the Uralic negative verb is very ancient, for three reasons: (1) The Uralic negative verb represents a worn-down formation and is therefore presumably an old one. (2) It is built on an obsolete verb ‘to be’. (3) Most decisively, it is found in all branches of Uralic, including Samoyedic. Therefore, it is at least as ancient as Proto-Uralic, that is to say, some 4,500 or 6,500 years old, according to the two prevailing current estimates.\n\nThe Yukaghir negative verb is unlikely to be borrowed from Uralic, because morphological formations are rarely borrowed. Yet no evidence for the Uralic/Yukaghir negative verb formation is found in the Indo-European languages. It thus seems likely that the Uralic/Yukaghir negative verb goes back to a period of primitive Uralic–Yukaghir unity, from which Indo-European was separate. It could nevertheless be imagined that Indo-European once had this negative verb, but had lost it by Proto-Indo-European times, so this evidence is not conclusive, though strongly suggestive.\n\nChief sources for table: Greenberg 2000, Szemerényi 1996.

{"id": "22141298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22141298", "title": "Visual semiotics", "text": "Visual semiotics\n\nVisual semiotics is a sub-domain of semiotics that analyses the way visual images communicate a message.\n\nStudies of meaning evolve from semiotics, a philosophical approach that seeks to interpret messages in terms of signs and patterns of symbolism. Originating in literary and linguistic contexts, the study of semiotics (or semiology in France) has been expanding in a number of directions since the early turn-of-the-century work of Charles Sanders Peirce in the U.S. and Claude Lévi-Strauss and Ferdinand Saussure in France.\n\nA sign can be a word, sound, or visual image. Saussure divides a sign into two components: the signifier, which is the sound, image, or word, and the signified, which is the concept or meaning the signifier represents. As Berger points out, the problem of meaning arises from the fact that the relation between the signifier and the signified is arbitrary and conventional. In other words, signs can mean anything we agree that they mean, as well as mean different things to different people. Nonverbal signs can produce many complex symbols and hold multiple meanings.\n\nThe Belgian Mu Group (Groupe µ) (founded 1967) developed a structural version of visual semiotics, on a cognitive basis, as well as a visual rhetoric.\n\nMost signs operate on several levels—iconic as well as symbolic and/or indexical. This suggests that visual semiotic analysis may be addressing a hierarchy of meaning in addition to categories and components of meaning. As Umberto Eco explains, \"what is commonly called a 'message' is in fact a \"text\" whose content is a multilevel \"discourse\"\".\n\nThe broadening concept of text and discourse encourages additional research into how visual communication operates to create meaning. Deely explains that \"at the heart of semiotics is the realization that the whole of human experience, without exception, is an interpretive structure mediated and sustained by signs.\" Semiotics now considers a variety of texts, using Eco's terms, to investigate such diverse areas as movies, art, advertisements, and fashion, as well as visuals. In other words, as Berger explains, \"the essential breakthrough of semiology is to take linguistics as a model and apply linguistic concepts to other phenomena--texts--and not just to language itself.\" Anthropologists like Grant McCracken and marketing experts like Sydney Levy have even used semiotic interpretations to analyze the rich cultural meanings of products and consumer consumption behaviors as texts.\n\nVisual texts are an important area of analysis for semioticians and particularly for scholars working with visually intensive forms such as advertising and television because images are such a central part of our mass communication sign system. Linda Scott has deconstructed the images in perfume advertising as well as in Apple's \"1984\" commercial using close readings of the various messages that can be interpreted from the ads. Shay Sayre has also looked at perfume advertising images and the visual rhetoric in Hungary's first free election television advertisements using semiotic analysis. Also using semiotics, Arthur Asa Berger has deconstructed the meaning of the \"1984\" commercial as well as programs such as Cheers and films such as Murder on the Orient Express.\n\nSystems of meaning, Culler and Berger tells us, are analyzed by looking at cultural and communication products and events as signs and then by analysing the relationship between these signs. The categories of signs and the relationships between them create a system. Barthes, for example, has analyzed the \"fashion system,\" and classified the system of communication through fashion into two categories: image clothing and descriptive clothing. Likewise, an advertisement has its own system of meaning. We expect an appeal to purchase, either directly or implied, to be made and a product to be shown, for example, as part of the advertising system.\n\nIn their book Discourses in Place: Language in the material world, Ron Scollon and Suzie Wong Scollon note that visual semiotics has to do with turning “from the spoken, face-to-face discourses to the representations of that interaction order in images and signs” (82). Interaction order involves the various social interactions that takes place in any setting, such as being alone, being with a companion, at a meeting, watching a show etc., and it “is almost always complex,” with various interactions occurring at once (83). When it comes to images, says Scollon and Wong, there are also multiple relationships. These include the relationships between the components of a visual image, the relationships between the producers of the visual image, the relationships between the producers and the components, as well as the relationships between the components of an image and those who are viewing it. That's are the main point.\n\nThis interaction order has four main semiotic systems, says Scollon and Wong. These include represented participants, modality, composition and interactive participants. Represented participants are elements of a visual image, and are either narrative (“present unfolding actions and events or… processes of change”) or conceptual (“show abstract, comparative or generalized categories”) (Scollon and Wong 86). Modality is how true to reality a visual image is, and main indicators include color saturation, color differentiation, depth, illumination and brightness, among others. With modality, it is often found “that truth, veracity, or sincerity might be expressed in very different ways from one society to another,” with Western cultures favoring naturalistic representation, or as true to seeing it in person as possible (Scollon and Wong 89-90).\n\nComposition is the way in which represented participants within a visual image are arranged in relation to one another, with the three main systems of compositions being ideal-real(top to bottom), given-new(left to right), and center-margin relationships (Scollon and Wong 92). So for example, when reading a menu at a fast food restaurant, the given information would be something such as “hamburger,” and the new information would be the price, read left to right and recognized in that order. As mentioned above, interactive participants, explain Scollon and Wong, are the various relationships that occur around a visual image, such as those between the producers of the image and the represented participants in that image. In this way, these four components work together to help convey the meaning of signs and symbols.\n\nThe International Association of Visual Semiotics was formed in 1989. The Association, being of an international nature, recognizes three official languages: English, French, and Spanish. The Association is in French and Spanish: Association Internationale de Sémiotique Visuelle and El Asociación Internacional de Semiótica Visual, respectively.\n\nCongresses have been held in Blois (France) 1989, Bilbao (Spain) 1992, Berkeley (California, USA) 1994, São Paulo (Brazil) 1996, Siena (Italy) 1999, Québec (Canada) 2001, Mexico city 2003, Lyon (France) 2004, Istanbul (Turkey) 2007, Venice (Italy) 2010, and Buenos Aires (Argentina) 2012.\n\n\nPrevious Presidents: Jean-Marie Klinkenberg (2001-2012), Paolo Fabbri (1998-2001), Ana Claudia de Oliveira (1996-1998), Jacques Fontanille (1994-1996), Fernande Saint-Martin (1990-1994), Michel Costantini (1989-1990).\n\nVisual Semiotics are also associated with that of Film, Fashion and Advertising. it is suggested that the use of semiotics in films are used to connote a specific underlying theme like that of the nuclear bomb in Godzilla.\n\n"}

A number of his surviving plays are collaborative, or were revised by others after their original composition, although the exact number is open to debate. Some of the following attributions, such as \"The Two Noble Kinsmen\", have well-attested contemporary documentation; others, such as \"Titus Andronicus\", are dependent on linguistic analysis by modern scholars; recent work on computer analysis of textual style (word use, word and phrase patterns) has given reason to believe that parts of some of the plays ascribed to Shakespeare are actually by other writers. \n\nIn some cases the identity of the collaborator is known; in other cases there is a scholarly consensus; in others it is unknown or disputed. These debates are the province of Shakespeare attribution studies. Most collaborations occurred at the very beginning and the very end of Shakespeare's career.\n\nThe Elizabethan theatre was nothing like the modern theatre, but rather more like the modern film industry. Scripts were often written quickly, older scripts were revised, and many were the product of collaboration. The unscrupulous nature of the Elizabethan book printing trade complicates the attribution of plays further; for example, William Jaggard, who published the First Folio, also published \"The Passionate Pilgrim by W. Shakespeare\", which is mostly the work of other writers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
