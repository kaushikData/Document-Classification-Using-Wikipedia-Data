He received his primary education from his father. At age 15 he started writing amateur poems. Beginning in 1892 he studied medicine in Mashhad and Tehran. After returning to Shamakhi around 1900 he abandoned his professional field, as Russian institutions did not recognize medical diplomas from Iran. Sahhat started teaching Azeri and literature first in primary schools and then in a Realschule. This period is considered the beginning of his career as a poet and playwright. In 1903 he began writing articles for the Azeri-language newspaper \"Sharg-i Rus\", published in Tiflis. His articles mostly discussed topics in contemporary literature.\n\nAs a poet, Sahhat adhered generally to romanticism. His poetry was influenced by Ali bey Huseynzadeh, editor of the \"Fuyuzat\" magazine in 1905–1907. Sahhat also translated works of Pushkin, Lermontov, Nadson, Krylov, Hugo, Musset, Prudhomme, Amir Khusro as well as a number of German poets into Azeri.\n\nIn 1912 he published his first collection of poems entitled \"Sinig saz\" (\"Broken Saz\"), his narrative poem \"Ahmadin shujaati\" and his translations of Western European literature under the name \"Garb gunashi\" (\"The Sun of the West\"). In 1916 his romantic poem \"Shah, muza va shaharli\" was published. In his literary style, influence of classical poets such as Nizami, Hafez and Saadi, and modern poets such as Tevfik Fikret, is seen.\n\nAmong his dramatic pieces, \"Neft fontani\" (1912) and \"Yoxsullug ayib deyil\" (1913) are noteworthy. There are accounts of a novel written by Sahhat and entitled \"Ali and Aisha\". It was never published and its manuscript is believed to have perished during the Dashnak occupation of Shamakhi in April 1918, when Sahhat's house was ravaged and burned. The poet himself managed to escape the town with his family, fleeing first to Kurdamir and later to Ganja, where he died some months later of a stroke.\n\nAbbas Sahhat was in favour of liberal bourgeoisie and, due to his Iranian academic upbringing, disagreed with mass secularisation that was taking place among Azeris beginning in the early 20th century. Instead he promoted a more moderate idea of all-Muslim westernization. He dedicated some of his finest pieces of poetry to the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, in which he presented himself as a realist poet.\n"}

{"id": "75629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75629", "title": "Abstract syntax tree", "text": "Abstract syntax tree\n\nIn computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST), or just syntax tree, is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is \"abstract\" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural, content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit in the tree structure, and a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then expression may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches.\n\nThis distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees, traditionally designated parse trees, which are typically built by a parser during the source code translation and compiling process. Once built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent processing, e.g., contextual analysis.\n\nAbstract syntax trees are also used in program analysis and program transformation systems.\n\nAbstract syntax trees are data structures widely used in compilers to represent the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of the syntax analysis phase of a compiler. It often serves as an intermediate representation of the program through several stages that the compiler requires, and has a strong impact on the final output of the compiler.\n\nAn AST has several properties that aid the further steps of the compilation process:\n\nASTs are needed because of the inherent nature of programming languages and their documentation. Languages are often ambiguous by nature. In order to avoid this ambiguity, programming languages are often specified as a context-free grammar (CFG). However, there are often aspects of programming languages that a CFG can't express, but are part of the language and are documented in its specification. These are details that require a context to determine their validity and behaviour. For example, if a language allows new types to be declared, a CFG cannot predict the names of such types nor the way in which they should be used. Even if a language has a predefined set of types, enforcing proper usage usually requires some context. Another example is duck typing, where the type of an element can change depending on context. Operator overloading is yet another case where correct usage and final function are determined based on the context. Java provides an excellent example, where the '+' operator is both numerical addition and concatenation of strings.\n\nAlthough there are other data structures involved in the inner workings of a compiler, the AST performs a unique function. During the first stage, the syntax analysis stage, a compiler produces a parse tree. This parse tree can be used to perform almost all functions of a compiler by means of syntax-directed translation. Although this method can lead to a more efficient compiler, it goes against the software engineering principles of writing and maintaining programs. Another advantage that the AST has over a parse tree is the size, particularly the smaller height of the AST and the smaller number of elements.\n\nThe design of an AST is often closely linked with the design of a compiler and its expected features.\n\nCore requirements include the following:\n\n\nThese requirements can be used to design the data structure for the AST.\n\nSome operations will always require two elements, such as the two terms for addition. However, some language constructs require an arbitrarily large number of children, such as argument lists passed to programs from the command shell. As a result, an AST used to represent code written in such a language has to also be flexible enough to allow for quick addition of an unknown quantity of children.\n\nAnother major design requirement for an AST is that it should be possible to unparse an AST into source code form. The source code produced should be sufficiently similar to the original in appearance and identical in execution, upon recompilation.\n\nDue to the complexity of the requirements for an AST and the overall complexity of a compiler, it is beneficial to apply sound software development principles. One of these is to use proven design patterns to enhance modularity and ease of development.\n\nDifferent operations don't necessarily have different types, so it is important to have a sound node class hierarchy. This is crucial in the creation and the modification of the AST as the compiler progresses.\n\nBecause the compiler traverses the tree several times to determine syntactic correctness, it is important to make traversing the tree a simple operation. The compiler executes a specific set of operations, depending on the type of each node, upon reaching it, so it often makes sense to use the visitor pattern.\n\nThe AST is used intensively during semantic analysis, where the compiler checks for correct usage of the elements of the program and the language. The compiler also generates symbol tables based on the AST during semantic analysis. A complete traversal of the tree allows verification of the correctness of the program.\n\nAfter verifying correctness, the AST serves as the base for code generation. The AST is often used to generate an intermediate representation (IR), sometimes called an intermediate language, for the code generation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1505229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1505229", "title": "Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic", "text": "Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic\n\nBarzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is a modern Jewish Aramaic language, often called \"Neo-Aramaic\" or \"Judeo-Aramaic\". It was originally spoken in three villages near Aqrah in Iraq. The native name of the language is \"Lishanid Janan\", which means 'our language', and is similar to names used by other Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects (Lishan Didan, Lishanid Noshan).\nIt is nearly extinct, with only about 20 elderly speakers today.\n\nBarzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is classified as Afro-Asiatic, Semitic, and Aramaic language.\n\nThe Jewish inhabitants of a wide area from northern Iraq, eastern Turkey and north western Iran, corresponding to the area of Kurdistan, mostly spoke various dialects of modern Aramaic. The turmoil near the end of World War I and resettlement in Israel in 1951 (when eight families from Bijil moved to the new Jewish state) led to the decline of these traditional languages. This particular and distinct dialect of Jewish Neo-Aramaic was spoken in the villages of Bijil, Barzan and Shahe. It was known as \"Bijili\" until recently.\n\nThe last native speaker of Bijil Neo-Aramaic, Mrs. Rahel Avraham, died in Jerusalem in 1998. The remaining second-language speakers are all related and over 70 years of age, and most from Barzan. Other speakers are from Aqra. Barzan and Aqra are both located in Iraqi Kurdistan. The first language of these speakers is either Hebrew or Kurdish, and some also speak Arabic or another Neo-Aramaic dialect. Thus, the language is effectively extinct.\n\nMost of the speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic live in Jerusalem, Israel today.\n\nBarzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is part of the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) speech-type. Many of the NENA languages are seriously endangered, like Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic. Most of the NENA languages became endangered since most of the Aramaic speaking Jewry began to immigrate to Israel. This occurred mostly during the 1950s. Barzani Jewish-Neo Aramaic stands out from these languages because it began its endangerment in the early 1900s. This occurred in Kurdistan. The reason for the decline of the language was that most of the speakers were dispersed and integrated into communities that spoke other languages than Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic. This dispersal occurred violently in many of the communities by outside forces.\n\nMost speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic now speak Israeli Hebrew or Arabic.\n\nBarzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is only spoken in Israel today. Speakers come mostly from Iraq.\n\nBarzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is not the official language of any country.\n\nThere are 23 in the Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic alphabet and eight vowels. \nThe letters can sound differently, making 35 distinct sounds.\n\nBetween the years of 1996 and 2000, three dialects of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic were discovered. They are called Barzan, Shahe, and Bejil. Bejil is extinct.\n\nIt may be related to Lishanid Noshan, which has clusters around Arbil to the south east of Barzan. There may be some similarities between Barzani and the subdialect of Lishanid Noshan formerly spoken in the village of Dobe, 50 km north of Arbil. The Sandu dialect of Jewish Neo-Aramaic is quite similar to Barzani. However, studies suggest that it has more in common with Lishana Deni. There is evidence that the language was also spoken in the nearby village of Nerim, but no speaker from that village remains.\n\nBarzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic has been infused with words from the Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Zakho. This occurred due to the close proximity of the speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic and the dialect Zakho. This dialect is the most commonly spoken variant of Aramaic spoken in Jerusalem. This dialect is seen as more prestigious by the speakers and is most commonly understood.\n\nHezy Mutzafi has recorded and translated two texts in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.\n\nThe alphabet used in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is the same alphabet used in modern Hebrew.\n\n\n"}

New editions of the book were published in 2015 by The Idries Shah Foundation.\n\nShah relates the title to three traditional sources: the story of \"Maruf the Cobbler\", which can be found in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\"; a proverb which says, “The Dog may bark, but the Caravan moves on”; and some verses from the Sufi Master Bahaudin Naqshband which read:\n\n“Here we are, all of us: in a dream-caravan.\nA caravan, but a dream – a dream, but a caravan.\nAnd we know which are the dreams.\nTherein lies the hope.”\n\nThe book contains sections on the Traditions (Hadiths) of the Prophet Muhammad (primarily from the Mishkat of Al-Baghawi of Herat), the adventures of the Mulla Nasrudin, thoughts from Omar Khayyam, meditations of Rumi, and the definitions of Mulla Do-Piaza, as well as sayings from many classical Sufi Masters like Saadi, Bahaudin Naqshband and Khwaja Ahrar. Also included are some excerpts about Islamic culture and history from Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" and from Shah's earlier book of travels, \"Destination Mecca\". Two anecdotes are about Shah's great-great grandfather, Jan-Fishan Khan.\nMuch of the book is devoted to important teaching stories from the Middle East and Central Asia, such as \"The Four Men and the Interpreter\" (from Rumi's \"Masnavi\"), \"The Magic Horse\" (from the \"Arabian Nights\"), and \"The Story of Mushkil Gusha\" (a Persian tale traditionally recited on Thursday nights). Two folktales are contributed by Shah's sister, Amina Shah.\n\nDoris Lessing commented on how in this book “Shah spoke openly, but briefly, about the Sufi use of tales...” and she explained that “Sufis have always taught through stories, and pedants and traditionalists have perennially complained – and sometimes about the greatest of the Sufis – 'but these are merely tales of the kind you tell to children.' The claim is that the action of the genuine Sufi teaching story is 'direct and certain' upon the innermost self of the human being and this is true whether or not the said human is prepared to acknowledge that he or she has an innermost self. This attitude to literature brings us into an unfamiliar relation with our own literary heritage. The tales, anecdotes, illustrative recitals, jokes are not meant to be attacked by the intellectual apparatus...” \n\nScience fiction author, editor and reviewer, Douglas Hill reiterates Shah's assertion that the stories are not only entertaining, but establish in the reader “a means of communication with a non-verbalised truth.” The psychologist Robert Ornstein states that teaching tales like the ones found in \"Caravan of Dreams\" are traditionally used for the indirect communication of knowledge.\n\nIn his introduction to “The Magic Horse”, Shah writes that teaching stories operate on a level different from that of fables and parables and, when intact, are a “priceless heritage of mankind” and precisely tooled instruments to “assist the interior movement of the mind.”\n\nDouglas Hill wrote in \"Tribune\" that the teaching stories form the “real value” of the book: “One can read a story or two and be delighted. But the effect does not stop there. These stories adhere, return, seeming somehow to expand after reading into an area beyond outer consciousness. Like fine poems, their balanced harmonies appeal... they seem to enrich, elevate, nourish, without intellectualisation or special emotional attunement. The experience is more than rewarding, and impossible to forget.”\n\nA review in \"New Society\" said that the book indicates “real possibilities and practical alternatives to our present ways of operation; presenting not idle fantasies but signals from the tradition of known and tested activity; relevant, fruitful and urgent for our present society... Throughout the book notes are sounded, models given, maps drawn. Much is channelled through 'teaching stories' [which] concern human patterns of criticism, notions of communication, ideas of justice, and obstacles of self-esteem... Informing, instructing, entertaining, alarming: with funny and intensely painful moments, others of immediate practicality, and others... of extraordinary enchantment.”\n\nAward-winning author and later winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, Doris Lessing wrote that the book has information which is a “useful corrective” to the West's ignorance and prejudice about Islam, Islamic cultures and Islamic Sufism.\n\nA 1973 review in Afghanistan's \"Kabul Times\" said that \"Caravan of Dreams\" was “highly recommended” and “of especial interest to Afghans” because it is “basically an anthology of short stories, tales and proverbs, jokes and extracts, from the written and oral literature which forms a part of many an evening's talk and interchange – even in these modern times – in Afghanistan.” They pointed out that the book – which seemingly discussed almost every facet of Islamic life and thought – had been well-received in the United States and Continental Europe, and was on the reading list of several universities in Islamic and literature courses. They added that the book was also recommended for the purpose of deep psychological study by people like Professor Robert E. Ornstein (in his book \"The Psychology of Consciousness\") because it illustrates the pioneering work of Islamic thinkers who depicted, in traditional literature from many centuries ago, patterns and workings of the mind and brain now confirmed by modern scientific studies.\n\nThe \"Hindustan Standard\" of India found that \"Caravan of Dreams\" was a “fabulous collection of folklore nuggets from the West and Central Asia... extracts, thoughts and teachings, in very readable translation, of the unknown wise men of, in and around Arabia. The horse-sense of some of the anecdotes and stories is equally amusing and rewarding... This is a fine anthology, dippable-into at any time for entertainment, refreshment, consolation, and inspiration... witty, engrossing, utterly and appealingly human.”\n\n"}

Although a count off usually lasts just one or two bars, it is able to convey the music's style, tempo, dynamics from the leader (such as the conductor, bandleader or principal) to the other performers. A count off is generally in the same style of the piece of music—for instance, a joyful swing tune should have an energized count off. A misleading lead-in, one which indicates a different meter than that of the piece, is a false trail.\nCounting off is evident in musical genres other than Western classical and popular music; Ghanaian ethnomusicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has observed the benefits of such techniques in West African music.\n\nA silent count off, such as those given by an orchestral conductor using a baton, may be given as a value \"in front\" (\"i.e.\" \"eight in front\" refers to a count off of eight beats).\n\nIn recorded music, the final two beats of the count off (one, two, one—two—\"three\"—\"four\") are often silent to avoid spill onto the recording, especially if the piece has a pickup. The count off is typically edited out after the recording has finished. There are, however, instances where the count off is deliberately kept on a recording—sometimes even edited \"onto\" a recording. In the case of \"I Saw Her Standing There\" by The Beatles, the count off was edited onto a different take of the song. A recorded count off can be made by musicians through an open microphone or through the studio's talkback system, the latter being done by non-performing personnel such as the producer or engineer. The inclusion of a count off in a studio recording may give the impression of a live performance, as on the Beatles' \"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Reprise\" (1967).\n\nPre-count and count-off are functions of digital audio workstations which give an amount of click track—typically two bars—before the recording begins.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1646504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1646504", "title": "Countersink", "text": "Countersink\n\nA Countersink (symbol: ⌵) is a conical hole cut into a manufactured object, or the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use is to allow the head of a countersunk bolt, screw or rivet, when placed in the hole, to sit flush with or below the surface of the surrounding material (by comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a socket-head capscrew). A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.\n\nThe basic geometry of a countersink (cutter) inherently can be applied to the plunging applications described above (axial feed only) and also to other milling applications (sideways traversal). Therefore, countersinks overlap in form, function, and sometimes name with chamfering endmills (endmills with angled tips). Regardless of the name given to the cutter, the surface being generated may be a conical chamfer (plunging applications) or a beveled corner for the intersection of two planes (traversing applications).\n\nA countersink may be used in many tools, such as drills, drill presses, milling machines, and lathes.\n\nA Dan Martin Style \"zero flute\" countersink is a cone-shaped tool with a cutting edge provided by a hole that goes through the side of the cone. The intersection of the hole and cone form the cutting edge on the tool. The cone is not truly symmetrical as it is essential that the cone retreats away from the cutting edge as the tool rotates providing clearance. If this does not occur the cutting edge will lack clearance and rub rather than \"bite\" into the material. This clearance is referred to as cutting relief.\n\nThese tools are best used as deburring tools, where the burr from a previous machining operation needs to be removed for cosmetic and safety reasons, however they may be used in softer materials (such as wood or plastic) to create a countersunk hole for a screw.\n\nThe fluted countersink cutter is used to provide a heavy chamfer in the entrance to a drilled hole. This may be required to allow the correct seating for a countersunk-head screw or to provide the lead in for a second machining operation such as tapping. Countersink cutters are manufactured with six common angles, which are 60°, 82°, 90°, 100°, 110°, or 120°, with the two most common of those being 82° and 90°. Countersunk-head screws that follow the Unified Thread Standard very often have an 82° angle, and screws that follow the ISO standard very often have a 90° angle. Throughout the aerospace industry, countersunk fasteners typically have an angle of 100°.\n\nA \"back countersink\", also known as an \"inserted countersink\", is a two piece countersink used on tough to reach areas. One component is a rod that is inserted into the existing hole in the workpieces; the other component is the cutter, which is attached to the rod, or extends out of it, after it is in position. This is comparable to other types of \"back-\" machining, such as back-spotfacing, back-boring, back-counterboring, back-milling, and back-deburring. The common theme is accomplishing machining operations on the far side of the workpiece from the spindle face, which obviates a \"second operation\" setup. This reduces setup time and frustration in several ways. Not only does it obviate the flipping over, cleaning, reclamping, etc., but it also can allow effortless high concentricity, parallelism, and squareness with the first setup's datum without the hassle of reestablishing it on another setup (via painstaking indicating).\n\nIt can often be difficult to avoid chatter (also known as machining vibrations) when cutting with countersink cutters. As usual in machining, the shorter and more rigid the setup, the better. Better-quality fluted countersink cutters sometimes have the flutes (or at least one flute) at an irregular pitching. This variation in pitching reduces the chance of the cutting edges setting up a harmonic action and leaving an undulated surface. This surface ripple is also dependent on the surface speed of the cutting edges, material type, and applied pressure (or feed rate); once started it is hard to remove. Too light a feed tends to increase chatter risk. As in many other machining operations, an appropriate response to the chatter may be to decrease speed and increase feed. On a drill press, the slowest available spindle speed is usually best. With a variable-speed handheld power drill, the trigger is best squeezed lightly to yield a low spindle speed.\n\nGood chatter-free results can usually be had by countersinking by hand (as opposed to running the tool in a powered spindle). The slow speed and sensitive feed tend to prevent chatter. With a quarter-inch-hex shank, the countersink cutter can be held with a screwdriver handle of the indexable - bit type.\n\nForm countersinking, also known as \"dimpling\", is a countersink that is formed into sheet metal to increase the strength of a structure as the countersinks of multiple pieces nest together. There are two processes for producing formed countersinks: \"coin dimpling\" and \"modified radius dimpling\". Such dimples in fairly thick sheet can even be tapped to yield a threaded hardpoint on the sheet without the bother and expense of welding a nut to the sheet.

{"id": "11585618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11585618", "title": "Demand guarantee", "text": "Demand guarantee\n\nA demand guarantee is a guarantee that must be honoured by the guarantor upon beneficiary's demand. The beneficiary is not required to first make a claim or take any action against the obligor of the guaranteed obligation that the guarantee supports. A demand guarantee is enforceable notwithstanding any deficiencies in the enforceability of the underlying obligation.\n\n\nTraditionally, an English law guarantee is a secondary, conditional obligation: It is a promise to pay (or perform) the obligations of a distinct obligor should the obligor itself fail to perform. Therefore:\n. Thus if the contract giving rise to the underlying obligation is void, the guarantor may also avoid its obligations under the guarantee. Additionally, an Obligor's underling obligations may be altered by the operation of insolvency laws.\n\nMajor differences distinguish letters of credit from \"demand guarantees\"; in the latter instrument the obligation to pay is conditioned within the terms of the bank’s promise, therefore if the demand guarantee is payable upon the beneficiary’s written first demand he is assured payment notwithstanding any defence related to any other underlying transactions. Proof of default is not needed and issuers are not concerned with the underlying contract nor can they raise any defence available to the underlying contracting party.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, demand guarantees are seldom issued with most money center banks preferring to issue a standby letter of credit instead, primarily due to the banks familiarity with the undertaking. English courts give standby credits the same legal status that is given to demand guarantees. In the pecking order of seniority this, for the most part is true. In cases of a bank becoming insolvent all credit undertakings are deemed to be on par with the common shares of the bank. See Bank of International Settlements Basel II and Basel III accords.\n\nHowever, fundamental differences exist between the nature of Demand Guarantees and SBLCs. For example, SBLCs are issued as a contingent liability of the issuing banks and are issued in conjunction with a primary means of underwriting being considered. In effect SBLC's are as they sound.. there in a \"Stand-by\" position to a primary means of repayment. Demand Guarantees can be issued to be the primary means for repayment. In which case they are not necessarily contingent in nature. Because of the contingent and secondary means of collateral nature of the SBLC, it would be considered counter-intuitive for a bank to underwrite a loan or facility strictly on the basis of receiving an SBLC. A bank lending against an SBLC alone in such a manner would in effect be purposefully underwriting a loan with the expectation that there was to be a default... Which is not something your typical bank regulators would approve.\n\nDemand Guarantee can be issued as the primary means for meeting the loan or facility repayment terms.\n\nDemand guarantees developed to replace money deposits, which sellers had to provide to buyers in order to secure the latter against the former’s default under the contract. The substitution of money deposits by demand guarantees helped account parties to maintain their liquidity: they were no more forced to tie up their money for a considerable period of time pending completion of the underlying contracts, and where the account party had no sufficient money to pay an upfront deposit it was relieved from the expense of borrowing cash from a banker and paying interest on the loan during its life. The account party also benefits from the low cost of demand guarantees compared to other instruments such as accessory guarantees.\n\nThe account party might not trust the beneficiary enough to agree to provide him with a cash deposit; similarly the beneficiary might doubt the account party’s solvency and therefore ability to fulfill the underlying contract or its ability to rectify defaults in performance. The demand guarantee bridges the \"gap of distrust\" that exists between the parties. When the bank issues the demand guarantee, the beneficiary deals with a party whose financial strength he can trust and a party which would pay upon first demand regardless of an existing dispute between the parties on the performance of the underlying contract. More importantly, however, the demand guarantee is also used to reallocate the risks between the parties. In this regard, the demand guarantee is used to avoid three types of risk: judgment risks, execution risks and jurisdictional risks. Judgment risks include, inter alia, risks involved in taking the dispute to court, losing on a procedural issue, the risk of an unfriendly court, evidentiary problems and the threat of political uncertainty that could prevent an action being brought against a party. Execution risks include the risk that a plaintiff could not execute a judgment against the defendant. This is often due to defendant insolvency or due to the unenforceability of one country’s court judgments in another country. Finally jurisdictional risks are part of both the above risks: they revolve mainly around the costs and difficulty that a party would endure when bringing an action against the defendant who is usually located in another jurisdiction. Where the beneficiary is issued a demand guarantee by a bank in his own locality, the guarantee aims \"to shifting of risks and the cost of bearing them from [the beneficiary to the account party]\". Should the beneficiary find the contractor in default, he can immediately seek compensation by demanding on the guarantee and it is the account party who is forced to bring an action to recover any disputed amount. The premise in such transactions is that by agreeing to provide a demand guarantee both the account party and the beneficiary agree that the latter should not be deprived of his money (money due under the guarantee) by litigation against him at the suit of the account party.\n\nDemand guarantees are typically subject to international set of rules, like the ISP98, the URDG758, or the UCP600 by way of reference to such rules in the guarantee.\n\n"}

He was a bookseller, bibliographer, publicist, polemicist, historian, memoirist, author, editor, and publisher, all rolled into one.\n\nDeinard produced some 70 volumes whose subjects range from Jewish history and antiquities (especially of the Crimea, Russia, America, and The Holy Land), to treatises against Hasidism, Christianity, and Communism, parodies, medieval and modern Hebrew literature, Jewish religion, and especially booklore.\n\nDeinard's antiquarian activities, which involved constant travel throughout Europe, the Orient, and America, gave him a unique acquaintance with scholars, private collectors, fellow booksellers, and libraries. He came into contact and conflict with numerous Hebrew writers and Jewish communal and political figures. His wide-ranging knowledge and experience are fully reflected in his own voluminous writings, mostly in Hebrew, produced over more than half a century. His scope of interests, the intensity of his sentiments, the acerbity of his remarks, all coupled with his bibliophily, render Deinard's works a source of contemporary Jewish historical and literary controversy, as seen in the margins of the Hebrew-reading world, before and after World War I.\n\nDevoted to many periods and genres of Hebrew literature, Deinard published, aside from new or revised editions of early polemical tracts, various medieval and modern Hebrew texts, works by American Hebrew authors, and sharp critiques of modern Hebrew writing. Involved in Hebrew journalism since his youth, Deinard made several brief attempts to publish his own journals, including one of the first Hebrew papers in America, and a Zionist Yiddish paper in Newark, New Jersey, of which no copy survives. Deinard did not neglect Yiddish, and in the time he lived in Odessa, he published both Hebrew and Yiddish works by the Podolian-born historian and belletrist M. N. Litinsky. Some Yiddish texts appear in his Hebrew books, and he deals with Yiddish in his catalogs and bibliographies. One of his last books, \"Devir Efrayim\", which was published just after the founding of the Yiddish Scientific Institute (YIVO) in 1925, contains a chapter on Yiddish.\n\nHis books were printed in eleven towns in Europe, Ottoman Palestine, and America, including Odessa, Pressburg, Warsaw, Vienna, New York City, Newark, Kearny, Jerusalem, Jaffa, St. Louis and Arlington. In his time Deinard was the most prolific Hebrew author-publisher in New Jersey. At the end of his career, Deinard had sixteen volumes printed at the Moinester Press in St. Louis, more than he had printed in any other town. This press catered almost exclusively to immigrant rabbinic authors from Eastern Europe. Of the books printed in St. Louis, some were \"published\" in New Orleans, a Hebraist center where he spent his last twelve years.\n\nDeinard's works stand out for their secular subject matter, among them the first Hebrew book on local American Jewish history. \nA number of Deinard's books are bibliophilic curiosities; several were printed in limited editions of 50 or 100 copies, some have survived in only a handful of copies, and one was said to survive in only a single copy. Reviving an old tradition in Hebrew printing, five of his books were printed on colored papers (blue, green, red, yellow, and gold), two of them using a variety of these papers, and one using red ink. Some of his books are unusual in their dimensions: several are very small octavos, and one work, appropriate to Moses Montefiore, is an oversize folio on gold paper. The narrow miniature \"Zemir `Aritsim\" on colored papers is known as one of the great oddities of Hebrew booklore. Some books are enhanced with illustrative plates or other reproductions or fold-out leaves. The \"Kundes\", another octavo on multicolored papers, contains cartoons taken from Abraham Goldfaden's first illustrated Yiddish periodical. A few volumes make use of unusual or complex typography.\n\nFollowing a long tradition of false and fictional imprints in Hebrew publishing, especially in Eastern Europe, one of his books bears the imprint \"Sodom\" and another \"Boltunovka\" (\"Chatter-town\"), although in fact both were printed in Newark, New Jersey. A third rarity, on colored papers, bears the imprint \"Tsevu'im\" (\"the painted capital of hypocrites\"), \"at the press of the Raziel the angel\". Deinard's eccentric and combative personality is reflected in another textual-bibliographic idiosyncrasy: he is known to have printed special copies for specific individuals, with variant texts depending on the intended recipient, some copies differing considerably from each other.\n\nDeinard is remembered today as both a bookman and a prolific polemicist, two careers inextricably linked in his singular personality. Indeed, his works are devoted in large part to religious, political, and even bibliographical polemics. He attacked Hasidism and Christianity in equal measure, with plenty of bile left over for Communism, Reform Judaism, Kabbalah, Jewish apostates, and Karaism. Deinard reissued several early anti-Hasidic works, including two tracts of diverse authorship entitled \"Zemir 'Aritsim\", as well as his own Hebrew translation of Israel Ubel's German diatribe. He edited another polemical text preserved in manuscript in the Bodleian Library (one of several Oxford manuscripts edited by Deinard), and printed a previously unpublished anti-Hasidic work by the Russian maskil Isaac Baer Levinsohn. His two-volume \"Alatah\", which is of bibliographic interest, attempts to show the Zohar to be a forgery, and that Hasidism is Catholicism in disguise.\n\nAfter Hasidism, Deinard's biggest bugaboo was Christianity. Over the course of 40 years, he published seven volumes of anti-Christian polemics, beginning with his first book in America, an edition of medieval Judeo–Christian disputations. He later reissued Hasdai Crescas' 14th-century refutation of Christian beliefs, though his accompanying edition of an 18th-century anti-Christian polemic by David Nassy of Surinam was destroyed by fire. Deinard wrote several attacks on the Jewish biography of Jesus by Joseph Klausner, and his last printed book, \"A Zoo Without an Animal\", questioned the existence of Jesus. Several of his books contain essays directed against Jewish converts to Christianity, among them the ill-fated antiquarian Moses Wilhelm Shapira, who attempted to sell ancient Biblical fragments of questionable authenticity to the British Museum.\n\nDeinard's particular literary genius and satirical gifts are displayed in his \"Kundes\" (\"Prankster\") and \"Ployderzak\" (\"Chatterbox\"), written in the tradition and style of earlier maskilic or anti-Hasidic parodies. The latter, with its Yiddish title, mocks the flawed Jewish journalism of his day. These works are among the earliest of a whole genre of Hebrew parodies written in America shortly before and after 1900.\n\nA passionate Hebraist and Zionist, Deinard observed and participated in Jewish national activities on three continents. He devoted a number of books to Palestine, Zionism and related subjects, especially the Jewish national movements in Russia, Europe, and America. His narratives of trips to Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and every corner of Europe, focus on contemporary Jewish communities and their political affairs. Some of his earliest books, which were published in Pressburg, before his emigration to America in 1888, deal with Jewish aliyah. Some of his last books include an account of Ottoman rule in Palestine, a critique of British policy, and a critical biography of the Anglo-Jewish Maecenas and proto-Zionist Sir Moses Montefiore. While living in Palestine before the end of Ottoman rule, Deinard published texts and documents from manuscripts and old printed books, among them an account of anti-Jewish riots in Ancona, Italy, in the late 18th century. He also published S. Raffaeli's illustrated survey of ancient Hebrew coins, the first Hebrew book on this subject.\n\nHis most well known book is the two-volume \"Kohelet Amerika\", which records books of American Hebrew literature issued from 1735 to 1926. He was the first to devote attention to Hebrew books printed overseas by American authors. Yosef Goldman's \"Hebrew Printing in America\" is set around this book. (Indeed, some have taken to calling Goldman \"Deinard Junior\" for their supposed over-all similarities.)\n\nHe also dealt with early Hebrew printing, recording post-incunabula, especially Italian, in \"<nowiki>'</nowiki>Atikot Yehudah\", and he wrote about the history of Hebrew bibliography and of Hebrew printing, especially in Eastern Europe. The prospectus of Deinard's last library, subsequently acquired by Harvard, also contains a listing of ceremonial Judaica which passed to the Smithsonian.\n\nSurviving copies of Deinard's many works are scattered in libraries around the globe. No library holds a complete set, and some of his books are exceedingly rare. The largest and most comprehensive collection of Deinard works is said to be in the Yosef Goldman Collection, in New York. A further almost complete collection of Deinard's works, as well as a number of extremely rare works written against him by various literary enemies, is apparently to be found in the Pini Dunner private collection in Los Angeles. The Hebrew Union College libraries in Cincinnati and Los Angeles, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, and the Harvard University Library (which received donations of Deinard's texts from Lucius Nathan Littauer, housed in Widener and Houghton libraries) also have large collections of Deinard works.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12780889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12780889", "title": "Fabel", "text": "Fabel\n\nFabel is a critical term and a dramaturgical technique pioneered by the twentieth-century German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht.\n\n\"Fabel\" should not be confused with 'fable', which is a form of short narrative (hence the retention of the original German spelling in its adoption into English usage). Elizabeth Wright argues that it is \"a term of art which cannot be adequately translated\".\n\nAs a critical term, \"fabel\" refers to an analysis of the plot of a play. This includes three interrelated but distinct aspects: firstly, an analysis of the events portrayed in the story. In an epic production, this analysis would focus on the social interactions between the characters and the causality of their behaviour from a historical materialist perspective; the \"fabel\" summarizes \"the moral of the story not in a merely ethical sense, but also in a socio-political one\". For example, in relation to Brecht's play \"Man Equals Man\" (1926), Wright argues that \"[t]he \"fabel\" of this play centres on the transformation of an individual through his insertion into a collective.\"\n\nSecondly, a \"fabel\" analyzes the plot from a formal and semiotic perspective. This includes the play's dramatic structure and its formal shaping of the events portrayed. It also includes an analysis of the semiotic fabric of the play, recognizing that it \"does not simply correspond to actual events in the collective life of human beings, but consists of invented happenings [and that t]he stage figures are not simple representations of living persons, but invented and shaped in response to ideas.\"\n\nThirdly, a \"fabel\" analyzes the attitudes that the play appears to embody and articulate (in the sense of the author's, the characters' and, eventually, the company's). Brecht refers to this aspect of a play as its \"Gestus\". Analyzing a play in this way presupposes Brecht's recognition that \"every\" play encodes such attitudes; \"for art to be 'unpolitical'\", he argued in his \"Short Organum for the Theatre\" (1949), \"means only to ally itself with the 'ruling' group\".\n\nAs a practical tool, \"fabels\" form part of the process of engaging with a play-text undertaken by a company when mounting a production of a play. A \"fabel\" is a piece of creative writing, usually made by a dramaturg or the director, that summarizes the plot of a play in such a way as to emphasize the production’s interpretation of that play-text. It is produced in order to make clear the company's \"particular way\" of understanding and rendering the story. In this respect, it is related to the concept of Gestus (insofar as this renders an action and an attitude towards that action simultaneously); a \"fabel\" indicates the sequence of gestic episodes that constitute the dramatic or theatrical narrative.\n\nCarl Weber, who worked as a director with Brecht at his Berliner Ensemble, explains that:\n\"[w]hat he [Brecht] called \"fabel\" was the plot of the play told as a sequence of interactions, describing each event in the dialectic fashion developed by Hegel, Marx and, in Brecht’s last years, also by Mao. This may sound quite theoretical, but in Brecht’s practice the \"fabel\" was something utterly concrete and practical. Acting, music, the visual elements of the staging, in short, everything an audience perceived, had to contribute to the storytelling and make it lucid, convincing, entertaining and ‘elegant’--as Brecht liked to put it. One result was that the Ensemble’s productions were quite well understood by international audiences who could not follow the German text. Brecht insisted that the configuration and movement of actors and objects on stage should clearly ‘tell the \"fabel\"’. If they were to watch a play through a glass wall blocking all sound, the audience should still be able to follow the essential story. He also insisted that each of the performance elements: acting, design, music and so forth, should remain a recognisable separate entity while it contributed to the \"fabel\"’s presentation. Brecht liked to speak of a 'storytelling arrangement', which meant the specific blocking of actors and all props employed in a scene. He regarded this arrangement as the most important means to achieve a clear presentation of the \"fabel\", and the term 'scenic writing' may best convey what he was aiming for. [. . .] The thorough and extremely detailed preparation included countless discussions in which a text was dissected to determine which \"fabel\" it might yield.\"\n\nAs Weber's reference here to 'scenic writing' suggests, a director or other company member may produce multiple \"fabels\" during the course of a production, each detailing and clarifying a different aspect of the process: a dramatic analysis; an interpretive proposal; an initial springboard position from which to initiate a process of exploration and experiment in rehearsals; a description of individual production aspects (the lighting \"fabel\", the sound \"Fabel\", the visual or scenic design \"fabel\", etc.); an account of progress made at different stages of the rehearsal process; individual actor performance and character behaviour \"fabels\". Virtually any aspect of the theatrical process of production may be explored through the use of a specific \"fabel\".\n\nJohn Willett, Brecht's English translator, suggests that:\n\"[t]he primary principle which [Brecht] taught his collaborators was that of the \"fabel\" or story. The chain of events must be clearly and strongly established not just in the production, but beforehand in the actual play. Where it was not clear it was up to the ‘Dramaturg’ to alter the text, in order to cut unnecessary entanglements and come to the point. The play itself might be by Farquhar or Gerhart Hauptmann, Lenz or Molière, but ‘the writer’s words are only sacred insofar as they are true’. This went for Brecht’s own words as well, and his plays were subject to continual small changes even in the course of a single run. Atmosphere and ‘psychology’ did not matter as such; everything would emerge given a clear and credible sequence of concrete events. ‘Each scene,’ says a writer in \"Theaterarbeit\",\nThe chain of events had become his substitute for the tidy, comprehensive ‘plot’. Thus the \"Short Organum\":\n‘Playing according to the sense’, the Ensemble calls it; and the sense is what Brecht tried to get clear in any play, first for himself and his collaborators, then for the audience too.Hence, for example, his emphasis on that side of Shakespeare’s work which is so often neglected: the actual story. ‘It is a long time,’ he found, ‘since our theatre played these scenes for the events contained in them; they are played only for the outbursts of temperament which the events allow.’ [. . . ]\nIn such conferences Brecht would get his colleagues to make a written or verbal précis of the play, and later they would have to write descriptions of an actual performance. Both were practice in distilling the incidents that count.\n\nA \"fabel\" specifies, narrativizes, and objectifies the attitudes and activities involved in the process of producing a play. In doing so, it enables company members to dialecticize that process—in the sense that a particular \"fabel\" provides a fixed 'snapshot' of a transitory and constantly developing process in a form that enables comparisons to be made. These comparisons may be between the description in the \"Fabel\" and the reality of the production as it stands or between different \"fabels\" (which have been generated by the production either at different stages of the process or in relation to different aspects—lighting, sound, blocking, etc.---of it); for example, having produced a \"Fabel\" at the beginning of the rehearsal process, the director may return to it near the end of rehearsals to check that the production is 'telling the story' intended (or, alternatively, to clarify the ways in which that story has changed as a result of rehearsal exploration and development).\n\nThe use of \"fabels\" does not predetermine the style of production nor does it necessarily require an epic dramaturgy or aesthetic (the elimination of suspense and mystery, defamiliarization effects, etc.), despite having originated in Brechtian practice. The creation of \"Fabels\" is an attempt to achieve clarity for the \"producers\" (actors, director, designers) rather than the \"audience\" (which would characterize an epic production). One may create psychological (in a Stanislavskian approach) or metaphysical (in an Artaudian approach) \"fabels\" as well as the social ones that Brecht explored.\n\n"}

The manuscript was composed between 1688 and 1693 by Donnchadh MacRath in Wester Ross and is notable for the author's unique orthography which is, like the more famous Book of the Dean of Lismore, based upon English, rather than Classical Gaelic, phonetics. Although the manuscript has been studied, \"translated\" in accordance with correct Gaelic orthography and republished – for the first time in 1923 by Calum MacPhàrlainn – it has been said that it has yet to be reliably interpreted.\n\nIn addition to the unusual spelling system used the manuscript is notable for several other reasons. It is the only record of Scottish verse which is similar in form and nature to that practised by the Munster poets at the start of the 17th century. It also contains religious poems which predate the composition of the manuscript by several centuries and have been described as the only extant examples of religious verse from that period as equivalent examples recorded following Culloden are very sparse. All other remaining records of 17th century Gaelic verse were committed to paper only after surviving for a hundred years or more as part of the oral tradition. The manuscript contains 59 pieces with 10 being of unknown authorship, 12 attributed to MacRath himself with a further 17 authors named as responsible for the rest.\nThe manuscript, in the form of two books, is currently held by the University of Glasgow library. Prior to the university gaining possession the manuscript was held by a Matheson of Fernaig, and was thus named the Fernaig manuscript. It then passed through the hands of Dr Mackintosh-Mackay, Dr W.F. Skene and the Reverend John Kennedy of Arran who finally bequeathed it to Glasgow. The dialect used in the text varies and seems to vary between the formal, literary style and that of the local vernacular. While it is possible that MacRath had some knowledge of Gaelic (both Scottish and Irish) manuscripts written in the literary form, the almost total lack of eclipses present in the text – which are a feature of Irish Gaelic and the main distinction between Scottish and Irish dialects – suggest that the author did not commit anything to paper dictated by an Irish speaker. However the anthology does include pieces by two Irish poets who lived generations before the time of the author and this does point to some degree of familiarity by MacRath with that class of literature. The two books of the manuscript can basically be divided by the general theme of the verse found within them. The first contains mostly religious works of a literary style while the second is more political and colloquial in nature. A considerable number of the words used throughout cannot be found in modern Scottish Gaelic dictionaries but many can be found in Irish Gaelic dictionaries and Shaw's \"pan-Gaelic\" dictionary.\n\n\n"}

It defines three-letter codes for identifying languages. The standard was published by ISO on 1 February 2007.\n\nISO 639-3 extends the ISO 639-2 alpha-3 codes with an aim to cover all known natural languages. The extended language coverage was based primarily on the language codes used in the \"Ethnologue\" (volumes 10-14) published by SIL International, which is now the registration authority for ISO 639-3. It provides an enumeration of languages as complete as possible, including living and extinct, ancient and constructed, major and minor, written and unwritten. However, it does not include reconstructed languages such as Proto-Indo-European.\n\nISO 639-3 is intended for use as metadata codes in a wide range of applications. It is widely used in computer and information systems, such as the Internet, in which many languages need to be supported. In archives and other information storage, they are used in cataloging systems, indicating what language a resource is in or about. The codes are also frequently used in the linguistic literature and elsewhere to compensate for the fact that language names may be obscure or ambiguous.\n\nISO 639-3 includes all languages in ISO 639-1 and all individual languages in ISO 639-2. ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 focused on major languages, most frequently represented in the total body of the world's literature. Since ISO 639-2 also includes language collections and Part 3 does not, ISO 639-3 is not a superset of ISO 639-2. Where B and T codes exist in ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3 uses the T-codes.\n\nExamples:\n, the standard contains 7776 entries. The inventory of languages is based on a number of sources including: the individual languages contained in 639-2, modern languages from the Ethnologue, historic varieties, ancient languages and artificial languages from the Linguist List, as well as languages recommended within the annual public commenting period.\n\nMachine-readable data files are provided by the registration authority. Mappings from ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2 to ISO 639-3 can be done using these data files.\n\nISO 639-3 is intended to assume distinctions based on criteria that are not entirely subjective. It is not intended to document or provide identifiers for dialects or other sub-language variations. Nevertheless, judgments regarding distinctions between languages may be subjective, particularly in the case of oral language varieties without established literary traditions, usage in education or media, or other factors that contribute to language conventionalization.\n\nSince the code is three-letter alphabetic, one upper bound for the number of languages that can be represented is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17576. Since ISO 639-2 defines special codes (4), a reserved range (520) and B-only codes (23), 547 codes cannot be used in part 3. Therefore, a stricter upper bound is 17576 − 547 = 17029.\n\nThe upper bound gets even stricter if one subtracts the language collections defined in 639-2 and the ones yet to be defined in ISO 639-5.\n\nThere are 56 languages in ISO 639-2 which are considered, for the purposes of the standard, to be \"macrolanguages\" in ISO 639-3.\n\nSome of these macrolanguages had no individual language as defined by ISO 639-3 in the code set of ISO 639-2, e.g. 'ara' (Generic Arabic). Others like 'nor' (Norwegian) had their two individual parts ('nno' (Nynorsk), 'nob' (Bokmål)) already in ISO 639-2.\n\nThat means some languages (e.g. 'arb', Standard Arabic) that were considered by ISO 639-2 to be dialects of one language ('ara') are now in ISO 639-3 in certain contexts considered to be individual languages themselves.\n\nThis is an attempt to deal with varieties that may be linguistically distinct from each other, but are treated by their speakers as two forms of the same language, e.g. in cases of diglossia.\n\nFor example:\n\nSee for the complete list.\n\n\"A collective language code element is an identifier that represents a group of individual languages that are not deemed to be one language in any usage context.\" These codes do not precisely represent a particular language or macrolanguage.\n\nWhile ISO 639-2 includes three-letter identifiers for collective languages, these codes are excluded from ISO 639-3. Hence ISO 639-3 is not a superset of ISO 639-2.\n\nISO 639-5 defines 3-letter collective codes for language families and groups, including the collective language codes from ISO 639-2.\n\nFour codes are set aside in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 for cases where none of the specific codes are appropriate. These are intended primarily for applications like databases where an ISO code is required regardless of whether one exists.\n\nIn addition, 520 codes in the range codice_5–codice_6 are 'reserved for local use'. For example, the Linguist List uses them for extinct languages. Linguist List has assigned one of them a generic value:\n\nThis is used for proposed intermediate nodes in a family tree that have no name.\n\nThe code table for ISO 639-3 is open to changes. In order to protect stability of existing usage, the changes permitted are limited to:\nThe code assigned to a language is not changed unless there is also a change in denotation.\n\nChanges are made on an annual cycle. Every request is given a minimum period of three months for public review.\n\nThe ISO 639-3 Web site has pages that describe \"scopes of denotation\" (languoid types) and types of languages, which explain what concepts are in scope for encoding and certain criteria that need to be met. For example, constructed languages can be encoded, but only if they are designed for human communication and have a body of literature, preventing requests for idiosyncratic inventions.\n\nThe registration authority documents on its Web site instructions made in the text of the ISO 639-3 standard regarding how the code tables are to be maintained. It also documents the processes used for receiving and processing change requests.\n\nA change request form is provided, and there is a second form for collecting information about proposed additions. Any party can submit change requests. When submitted, requests are initially reviewed by the registration authority for completeness.\n\nWhen a fully documented request is received, it is added to a published Change Request Index. Also, announcements are sent to the general LINGUIST discussion list at Linguist List and other lists the registration authority may consider relevant, inviting public review and input on the requested change. Any list owner or individual is able to request notifications of change requests for particular regions or language families. Comments that are received are published for other parties to review. Based on consensus in comments received, a change request may be withdrawn or promoted to \"candidate status\".\n\nThree months prior to the end of an annual review cycle (typically in September), an announcement is set to the LINGUIST discussion list and other lists regarding Candidate Status Change Requests. All requests remain open for review and comment through the end of the annual review cycle.\n\nDecisions are announced at the end of the annual review cycle (typically in January). At that time, requests may be adopted in whole or in part, amended and carried forward into the next review cycle, or rejected. Rejections often include suggestions on how to modify proposals for resubmission. A public archive of every change request is maintained along with the decisions taken and the rationale for the decisions.\n\nLinguists Morey, Post and Friedman raise various criticisms of ISO 639, and in particular ISO 639-3:\n\n\nMartin Haspelmath agrees with four of these points, but not the point about language change. He disagrees because any account of a language requires identifying it, and we can easily identify different stages of a language. He suggests that linguists may prefer to use a codification that is made at the languoid level since \"it rarely matters to linguists whether what they are talking about is a language, a dialect or a close-knit family of languages.\" He also questions whether an ISO standard for language identification is appropriate since ISO is an industrial organization, while he views language documentation and nomenclature as a scientific endeavor. He cites the original need for standardized language identifiers as having been \"the economic significance of translation and software localization,\" for which purposes the ISO 639-1 and 639-2 standards were established. But he raises doubts about industry need for the comprehensive coverage provided by ISO 639-3, including as it does \"little-known languages of small communities that are never or hardly used in writing and that are often in danger of extinction\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56906499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56906499", "title": "Massachusett grammar", "text": "Massachusett grammar\n\nThe grammar of the Massachusett language shares similarities with the grammars of related Algonquian languages. Nouns have gender based on animacy, based on the world-view of the Indians on what has spirit versus what does not. A body would be animate, but the parts of the body are inanimate. Nouns are also marked for obviation, with nouns subject to the topic marked apart from nouns less relevant to the discourse. Personal pronouns distinguish three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), inclusive and exclusive first-person plural, and proximate/obviative third-persons. Nouns are also marked as absentative, especially when referring to lost items or deceased persons.\n\nSentence structures are typically SVO or SOV, but deviation from strict word order does not alter the meaning due to the synthetic structure. Verbs are quite complex, and can be broken into four classes of verbs: animate-intransitive (AI), inanimate-intransitive (II), animate-transitive (AT), and inanimate-transitive (IT). Verbs are also prefixed and suffixed with various inflections, particles, and conjugations, so complex things can easily be described just by a verb.\n\nMassachusett recognizes first, second and third person in singular and plural form. However, like other Algonquian languages, Massachusett makes a distinction between the first person plural exclusive, 'we, excluding you' and the first person plural inclusive, 'we, including you.' In general, the exclusive is more common when referring to oneself and one's family and network or when the audience is unknown, but the inclusive is used when the audience is definitely being referenced.\n\nThe obviate, a form of 'second third person' that disambiguates the activities of another third person in a sentence, may possess another noun which although technically a 'third third person,' has no forms that distinguish it from the unmarked proximate bare form of a noun, as opposed to more conservative languages like Ojibwe which have a separate form for nouns in this rare position. Similarly, there are no attested forms for obviate inanimate nouns, as exist in Ojibwe.\n\nPersons exist on an importance scale, which is often more important in establishing word order regarding synthetic placement of prefixes, suffixes and markers. For example, most words exist which generally follow a hierarchy of 2 > 1 > X > 3 > 3'.\n\n\nNouns can only have an animate/inanimate plural or absentative animate/inanimate singular or plural terminations on a given word. In general, the locative is the same in the singular and plural and replaces the animate/inanimate plural if any. All nouns can have a diminutive, locative and obviative ending, although it would be rare for a word to exist with all possible forms, the order is usually diminutive, absentative/animate-inanimate plural (if any), locative, obviative. For example, *wekeesiutoh *(weekeesayutah), literally 'his-house-diminutive-absentative-locative-obviate' which would signify 'at the other man's/woman's small house—that is no more? that was destroyed?'\n\nAlgonquian languages recognize two numbers, singular and plural. Although it is rare for a word to not have both a singular and plural form, a small number of nouns, as in English, are either uncountable or inherently plural or singular. This is clearest in loan words from English such as monêash (money\"ash), from English 'moneys,' which always appears in the plural and saut\" (salt), from English 'salt' which only appears in the singular.\n\nNouns are unmarked in the singular, but can take one of two forms dependent on the noun's gender, which can be either animate and refer to something considered living, moving, divine or said to have spirit and inanimate including natural objects, tools and small plants. Words that are animate have -ack/-og/-ak (-ak) and those that are inanimate have -ash/-osh (-ash) appended to the end, respectively. Although unmarked in the singular, words \"must\" have either an animate or inanimate plural, with only a few rare exceptions to this rule.\n\nNouns in the singular often exist in a truncated form, but when any endings such as the plural are appended, many nouns will have consonants or syllables appear where unexpected, but were probably the original form of the word from its development from Proto-Algonquian. For instance, the words 'dog,' 'man' and 'chair' appear in Massachusett as annum (anum) , wosketomp (waskeetôp) and appuonk (apuwôk) in the singular but anumwog (anumwak) , wosketompauog (waskeetôpâak) and appuonkanash (apuwôkanash) as 'dogs' and 'chairs,' respectively. In the case of 'dog,' Massachusett annum (anum) developed from Proto-Algonquian *aθemwa with the final *-wa only re-appearing in the non-truncated forms of the plural, i.e., Proto-Algonquian *aθemwaki and Massachusett annumwak (anumwak). As they are based on etymology, words with these non-truncated finals must be learned individually.\n\nAs seen in the plural formations, all nouns have a grammatical gender based on animacy, thus nouns are either animate or inanimate. Animate objects include human beings and their bodies, animals, trees and bushes, planetary bodies—essentially things considered to be alive, possess spirit or are mobile—whereas inanimate nouns cover most objects, body parts, natural land forms, abstract things—essentially objects that do not move, do not possess spirit and generally unable to move.\n\nNumerous exceptions to this general rule exist. The body parts -ohpee (-apee), 'hip,' -úhkus (-uhkas), 'finger nail' and woskequah (wushkeeqâh) , 'whale bone'; the English loan words conner (corner) and Testament (Testament) and the kitchen object kunnommaog (kunumuwôk) , 'ladle' or 'spoon' are all animate. The sun and moon, despite being planetary bodies, are inanimate. Although standing trees are animate, names of trees and species are always inanimate, thus the plural form of kꝏwa (k8wa) , 'pine tree,' is not *kꝏwak (*k8wak) but instead kꝏwash (k8wash).\n\nOnly a handful of words can appear with both genders, with subtle differences in meaning. For instance, the word for 'tree' is mehtog (muhtuq), but can also mean 'wood.' As gender is not overtly marked in the singular, this can be seen in the plural forms where mehtogquog (muhtuqak), 'trees' (that are still in the ground and living) and mehtogquosh (muhtuqash), 'trees' (that have been felled) but better translates as 'wood,' i.e., the product of a tree that is no longer living. Another rare form is to refer to land forms, structures or locales said to have a spiritual presence, or were considered the meeting place with or dwelling of tutelary spirits were discussed in the animate gender, in essence 'personifying' or linguistically 'animating' them. For example, wadchuash (wachuwash), 'mountains,' is the inanimate plural, but when it appears as *wadchuog (wachuwak) in the animate plural, it signifies 'mountains' but specifically the 'spirit(s) of the mountains.' This latter feature only appears in religious and ceremonial usage and is only known from a few examples, but was likely more common prior to the introduction of Christianity and the English missionary influences.\n\nMassachusett, just as in other Algonquian languages, marks second third persons with an obviative marker -oh (-ah) . The proximate, usually the primary subject or more important topic is left unmarked. In English, for example, 'He gives the book to me, then I give the money to him,' it is ambiguous if the man receiving the money is the same as the giver of the book or a different man present, but in Massachusett, the person giving the book would be proximate and thus unmarked and the recipient of the money would be marked for obviation and removing the ambiguity.\n\nThe noun marked for obviation tends to be the possessed, not the possessor, and also tends to be the less animate or the recipient of a particular action. For example, mosq nâau ahtuckoh (masq nâwâw ahtuhqah) , 'The bear sees the deer.' Like the word 'deer' in English, which may refer to the animal in the singular and collectively, the obviative forms are identical in the singular and the plural and have to be differentiated by context. Nouns which are truncated are restored, as with the plural endings, so anum (anum), 'dog' and plural anumwog (anumwak) and appuonk (apuwônk) and plural appuonkanash (apuwônkanash), 'chairs' become annumwoh (anumwah) and appuonkanah (apuwônkanah) , respectively, when marked for obviation. This can occur in verbs as well:\n\nProximate\n\nObviate\n\nProximate of obviate (third third-person)\n\nAlgonquian languages mark those objects that were, i.e., people or living things that are deceased and objects that are lost, stolen or destroyed, or 'absent,' as opposed to those that currently exist. For people and animate objects, it generally refers to something alive that has passed away. Items that are destroyed, beyond repair or lost forever tend to be inanimate objects. All nouns, whether animate or inanimate, are marked with the suffixes -i or -y (-ay) in the singular and -uk or -ug (-uk) in the plural. With the same forms, a noun's animacy must be known or determined from context. Truncated noun stems are also restored before absentative endings, so woskétomp (waskeetôp) is restored before becoming woskétompáay (waskeetôpâay) , 'man' (that is passed away).\n\nAnimate\n\nInanimate\n\nNouns can be marked with one of two diminutive endings, -ees (-ees) or -emes (-âmees) , with the latter form chosen for more extreme examples or euphony. These endings indicate that the noun is smaller, littler or younger. For example, nonkomp (nôkôp) , 'boy,' nonkompees (nôkôpees) , 'young boy' and nonkompamees (nôkôpâmees) , a 'very young boy.' Although rare in the written language, which may have thus protected against its complete intrusion in the spoken language, late-stage speakers along the western and northern transitional dialects permitted syncope and the diminutive ending is often truncated, as seen in the surname of Crispus Attucks, Attuck[ee]s (Ahtuq[ee]s), 'Little Deer,' and wachu[ee]s (wachu[w][ee]s), 'small mountain' or 'hill' as in the example of Mount Wachusett, a Native toponym from the closely related Nipmuc-speaking peoples where syncope was generally permitted.\n\nThe use of the diminutive, as in extant Algonquian languages, may have had some semantic functions that varied between dialects. Although it is the general rule to use diminutive endings on small, young and little things, examples from other Algonquian languages such as Ojibwe indicate that it can be used as a term of endearment, such as n'nechanemes (nuneechanâmees) , 'my little child,' but can also be used, in certain contexts, to mark something as inferior or degrading, such as keen wosketompees (keeen waskeetôpees) , 'you little man' but could have nuanced implied meanings of being weak, small in stature, inferior or unworthy dependent on context.\n\nNouns are suffixed with a locative suffix -et (also -ett, -it, etc.) (-ut) to indicate 'in/on/at' (physically). It can be used to mark areas near certain geographical features, and survives in the name Massachusett (Mâsach8sut) as well as most geographical place names and landmarks of Massachusett-language derivation. The locative is often, though not alwayss, identical in singular and the plural and number has to be determined from context.\n\nThe choice of locative seems to have some dialectal variation, where the older form -uck/-og/-uk (-uk) was generally more common in the speech of Nantucket and areas inhabited by the Nauset, and seems to have occurred with equal frequency in the related L-dialect Nipmuc language and areas inhabited by the Pawtucket. Areas inhabited by the Coweset, Massachusett and the closely related Y-dialect Narragansett seem to have been strongholds of the termination, although documents in Natick seem to have also used the variant, perhaps due to the influence of Nipmuc. As the written language of Eliot seems to have favored , most place names in the region in Massachusetts were 'standardized' under the influence of the literate Indians and the English missionaries.\n\nThere is a rare secondary locative -ehtu (-eehtyuw) or -uhkontu (-uhkôhtyuw) that only appears in a handful of attestations in the Native documents. It seems to have been somewhat more common in Eliot's translation of the Bible, where it seems to serve the purpose of a plural locative. For example, ayeuwogut, 'in/on/at the place,' and nuppeeit, 'in/on/at the water' and ayeuonganehtu (ayuwôkaneehtyuw), 'in/on/at the places,' and nippekontu (nupeehkôhtyuw) , 'in/on/at the waters.\n\nThe locative can be used for abstract phrases, such as 'in his posterity' and 'on this day' and these phrases can be literally translated from English. The locative, however, is also mandatory for certain transitive verbs that do not have an English parallel.\n\n'I place a door on my house.'\n\n'I am fishing in your canoe.'\n\n'On this day'\n\n'We (inclusive) go to the sachem's village'\n\n'I resemble my father.'\n\nThe prefixes, suffixes and infixes on nouns shown in the table under nouns determine ownership are used as genitive constructions, equivalent to 'my,' 'our,' 'ours,' 'his,' 'her,' 'hers,' 'its', 'their,' 'theirs' used in English. As previously states, the third-person form wu- (wu-) is truncated to u- (u-) or, with sufficient context, sometimes dropped altogether in certain situations, so meequon (meeqôn) is umeequon (umeeqôn) and \"never\" *wumeequon (*wumeeqôn). Both of the first-person plural forms have an ending (-un), which are otherwise distinguished by (nu-), equivalent to 'I'.\n\nPlural persons are formed with suffixes. For example, 'our' can be formed with nu-[stem]-un, 'I-[stem]-first-person plural' in the exclusive form or ku-[stem]-un, 'you-[stem]-[1st pl.] in the inclusive form. The inclusive form actually shares ku-, the second-person prefix, as the construction 'you-[stem]-[1st pl.],' somewhat suggesting 'you + us' as it would naturally include the audience or person being addressed in a description of a group action including the speaker. The second-person plural and third-person plural are formed with (ku-) and (wu-) or its variant (u-)—used before /m/, /p/, /k/ or /w/, but not /kʷ/—respectively. They also share use of the second/third-person plural suffix (-uw).\n\nPlural personhood in the dependency markers requires an infix, which wedges itself between the suffix appended to the stem and the peripheral markers, such as those that indicate the animate or inanimate plural, depending on the word's gender or absentative, locative or obviative forms. The first-person exclusive and first-person inclusive plurals share (-ôn-) whilst the second- and third-person plurals share (-ôw-). This prevents the previous stem from truncation or elimination, according to the complicated sound rules for joining morphemes and the influence of surrounding vowels. Thus, 'our (exclusive) feet' is (nuseetunônash) and not (*nuseetunash) and 'your (plural) feet' is (kuseetuwôwash) and not (*kuseetuwash).\n\nNouns are declined by person somewhat differently depending on whether or not the noun in question is dependent or independent. For example, a 'foot' always belongs to someone and therefore, in Algonquian languages, it can only exist in a genitive construction such as 'my foot,' 'your feet,' 'his foot,' etc., and is therefore 'dependent.' When the exact owner is unknown, (mu-) is attached and indicates 'someone's' or 'somebody's' foot. Dependency is a common feature of kinship terms such as 'mother' or 'father,' almost all body parts, including the body itself. Most other nouns are independent and can exist by themselves, although they can also be declined in genitive constructions, such as a 'tree' can be owned as 'my tree' or 'his tree' that do exist without implied ownership.\n\nAs a grammatical rule, a is inserted before the prefix that implies the person and an independent noun stem that begins with a vowel. For example, nutohkeem (nutahkeem), 'my land' where ohke (ahkee), 'earth' or 'land' is independent. This is in contrast to nꝏsh (n8sh), 'my father,' which does not require the 'intrusive t' as it is a dependent noun, i.e., not *nutꝏsh (*nut8sh) which are incorrect.\n\nThe example of 'my father' also shows that vowel-initial dependent noun roots assimilate the vowel of the person prefix, nꝏsh (n8sh) \"not\" *nuꝏsh (*nu8sh). When a dependent noun has ownership that is not implied or unknown, the Algonquian X person, it is prefixed with mu- which indicates that it is 'someone's' or 'somebody's,' for instance, musseett (museet) , 'someone's foot' or 'somebody's foot.' Dependent nouns that begin with a consonant do not assimilate the preceding vowel, e.g., kunnutcheg (kunucheek) , 'your (singular) hand.' Dependent nouns have to be learned separately.\n\nA small 'm-class' of independent nouns also exist. This small subset of words takes a final (-m) in words that end in a vowel or (-um) for words that end in a consonant, but only when the word is declined for person. This terminal is dropped when the noun exists in its, non-pronominally declined independent form. This was likely a retention of an archaic trait in the language that began to fade from the language around the time literacy was adopted, as the Indian documents show that many writers applied it inconsistently and seem to have been unsure, although it is just as likely that it may have varied by dialect or age of speaker. Where it was retained, the /m/ helps preserve noun stems from mutation or assimilation of vowels of various noun suffixes.\n\nwadchu (wachuw) 'mountain'\n\nohke (ahkee) 'land'\n\nkehtassꝏt (keehtahs8t) 'king' \n\nThe Algonquian languages are pro-drop languages which means that independent pronouns are usually unnecessary in conversation. Nouns can be inflected for possession and verbs often encode the subject, and sometimes, even the object information, rendering the use of pronouns mostly redundant. There are several instances where pronouns cannot be omitted. For instance, Massachusett lacks a copula which is found in English as the various conjugations of the verb 'to be' that link the subject and predicate. Thus, a pronoun would be mandatory in sentences such as kén nétop (keen neetôp) , 'you are my friend,' but literally 'you my-friend. The pronouns are also mandatory as the direct answers to questions involving figuring out who was doing what or what was done to whom.\n\nIn a sentence such as nuwoman (nuwâmôn), the transitive animate verb woman (wâmôn) is marked with the first-person prefix (nu-) marks the subject. The third-person recipient, 'her' or 'him' is assumed because it is an animate verb. Even though, nen nuwoman nagum or neen nagum nuwoman are possible, literally 'I I-love-[her/him] her/him' and 'I he/she I-love-[her/him],' respectively, enough information exists in the verb alone to warrant the exclusion of the pronouns.\n\nAlthough the exact roles that the pronouns filled are not fully understood, in related Algonquian languages, pronouns seem to help clear ambiguity, such as the similarity of certain verb forms and noun stems, some of which may differ by only a short syllable at the end, such as (kuseet) 'your (singular) foot,' (kuseetun) 'our (inclusive) foot' and (kuseetuw), which in rapid conversation, may require the independent pronouns (keen) 'you (singular)', (keenawun) 'we (inclusive)' and (keenaw) 'you (plural)' to disambiguate. In other cases, the insertion of pronouns were probably used for emphasis, such as a topical marker, or to mark deference as is done in other Algonquian languages.\n\nEmphasis<br>\nThe pronoun helps mark the topic and the emphasis of the statement. More important in the following example is not the canoe itself but the ownership of the canoe by the owner.\n\nDeference<br>\nPossibly used to mark the noun (sôtyum), 'chief' or 'leader,' as someone worthy of respect or importance.\n\nDisambiguation<br>\nAlthough the difference between 'your father' and 'our (inclusive) fathers' (obviative) is slight, \n\n\nReflexive pronouns are relatively uncommon. There only use appears with certain transitive animate verbs where the subject is also the recipient of the action. This is in stark contrast to languages such as Spanish or French, where reflexive verbs, and their accompanying reflexive pronoun markers, are quite common, often imbued with slightly different shades of meaning from there original non-reflexive counterparts.\n\nIn Massachusett, reflexive pronouns are only known in singular form, but plural forms are attested in closely related language. For instance, in the Loup language of Nipmuc refugees in New France, nahakanon, 'ourselves' (first person exclusive plural reflexive) appears in Mathevet's word lists recorded in the mid-eighteenth century. if it existed in Massachusett would probably appear as *nuhhoggan (*nuhakun) as Massachusett usually dropped the infix -on unless further suffixation as required but retained in Nipmuc which corresponds to Massachusett (-ôn), e.g., (nuseetun), 'our (exclusive) foot' and (nuseetunônash), 'our (exclusive) feet.'\n\n(Wususeequn wuhak) <br>\n'He anoints himself.' Literally, 'He-anoints his-self'\n\n(Nuwâmôn nuhak) <br>\n'I love myself.' Literally, 'I-love my-self.'\n\nThe deictic pronouns are used to express both specific objects and their physical distance in relation to the speaker, with the nearer deictic pronouns corresponding to English 'this' and plural 'these.' Objects that are too far for a speaker to use nearer deictic forms, such as objects 'over there' or 'yonder,' the farther deictic forms 'that' and 'those.'\n\nThe anaphoric pronouns were unknown to most dialects and is peculiar to the speech of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, but has been adopted as integral pronouns in the revived language. Their usage on the islands had two main uses. In some cases, they seem to represent 'furthest deictic,' roughly 'that'/'those' (over there) akin to the Spanish distinction between \"ese\", 'that' and \"aquel\", 'that yonder.' It also served in its anaphoric usage to reference 'this' or 'that' when the context was known and discussed earlier in conversation or in a written document. The anaphoric forms have obviate markings. As inanimate obviate marking is not used in Massachusett, the inanimate anaphoric forms (y8nuh) and (shanuh) perhaps have them by analogy to their animate counterparts.\n\nThe interrogative pronouns function as question words, such as 'who?', 'whom?' and 'what?' The interreogative pronouns in statements take different meanings, for instance teague (tyaqa) generally means 'what?' or 'what thing?' but also functions as 'something' as in howan (hawân) can, in non-interrogative functions, as 'somebody' or 'someone.'\n\nAs verbs are the basic and most important part of Massachusett word construction, nouns are often formed from verbs or can exist in verbal form, for example 'I am the chief' can be rendered with only nouns, and in an archaic style befitting a leader, sachem neen (sôtyum neen), literally \"sachem\" I,' or only with a verb as in nusontimauw (nusôtyumâw), literally 'I-chief-[animate intransitive verb]' or 'I-chief-be.' Although use of nominal versus verbal constructions were used interchangeably, they undoubtedly had distinct nuances in use that are unknown.\n\nConversion of nouns from verbal stems can occur in one of three ways. Nouns tend to be either the bare form of a verb, identical to the verbal form or modified with a nominalizing suffix.\n\nBare verb stem \n\nIdentical to verbal form\n\nNominalized with \"-onk (-ôk\")\n\nVerbs are very complex and form the basis of a typical word. Like nouns, verbs are divided into animate and inanimate forms which are distinct in meaning and usage. For example, chog- (chahk-), 'spot,' has different conjugations based on the animacy of the subject. An inanimate object, such as a body part, rock, leaf, man-made products, annual plants, etc., would be described as chogi (chahkây), 'it is spotted' (i.e., 'it has spots') whereas when referring to people, animals, large trees, planetary bodies, etc., it would be described as chogusu (chahkusuw), 'he/she/it is blemished' (literally, 'he/she is spotted'). As different verb endings are used to distinguish animacy, the subject or equivalent pronoun can be dropped in conversation and writing if there is sufficient context.\n\nTransitivity is another important division. Verbs are marked differently if they take an object or not. For example, the root mꝏs- (m8hs-) implies 'envy' or 'jealousy' but and can be found as intransitive, not requiring an object, mꝏsumꝏau (m8hsumuwâw), 'he/she is jealous' (i.e., 'he/she/it is a jealous person) or transitive, requiring an object, mꝏsumꝏ (m8hsumuw), 'he/she is jealous of' and requires an object, e.g., mꝏsumꝏ sontimoh (m8hsumuw sôtyumah), 'he/she is jealous of the chief.'\n\nTransitive and intransitive verbs differ when the object in question is animate or inanimate. For example, the root onch- (ôch-), signifies 'mend,' 'fix' or 'repair,' and appears as transitive with animate object onchheew (ôchuheew), 'he/she repairs [something]' and transitive with inanimate object onchuteaw (ôchuhteaw), 'he/she fixes (someone).' Similarly, quin- (qun-), 'long' or 'tall,' appears in the intransitive, no object, with animate subject qunôsu (qunôhsuw), 'he/she is tall,' and inanimate subject, no object, quinni (qunây), 'it is long' or 'it is tall'. Thus, verbs generally fall into one of four categories: animate subject, no object or animate intransitive (AI), animate object or transitive animate (TA), inanimate with no object or inanimate intransitive (II) and inanimate object or transitive inanimate (TI).\n"}

The word comes from Middle French \"mole\", ultimately from Latin \"mōlēs\", meaning a large mass, especially of rock; it has the same root as molecule and mole, the chemical unit of measurement. A mole may have a wooden structure built on top of it that resembles a wooden pier. The defining feature of a mole, however, is that water cannot freely flow underneath it, unlike a true pier. The oldest known mole is at Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor complex on the Red Sea.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area in California, there were several moles, combined causeways and wooden piers or trestles extending out from the eastern shore and utilized by various railroads, such as the Key System, Southern Pacific Railroad (two), and Western Pacific Railroad: the Alameda Mole, the Oakland Mole, and the Western Pacific Mole. By extending the tracks the railroads could get beyond the shallow mud flats and reach the deeper waters of the Bay that could be navigated by the Bay Ferries. A train fell off the Alameda Mole through an open drawbridge in 1890 killing several people. None of the four Bay Area moles survive today, although the causeway portions of each were incorporated into the filling in of large tracts of marshland for harbor and industrial development.\n\nA large mole was completed in 1947 at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco to accommodate the large Hunters Point gantry crane. The mole required of fill.\n\nThe two concrete moles protecting the outer harbour at Dunkirk played a significant part in the evacuation of British and French troops during World War II in May/June 1940. The harbour had been made unusable by German bombing and it was clear that troops were not going to be taken directly off the beaches fast enough. Naval captain W. G. Tennant had been placed ashore to take charge of the navy shore parties and organise the evacuation. Tennant had what proved to be the highly successful idea of using the East Mole to take off troops. The moles had never been designed to dock ships, but despite this, the majority of troops rescued from Dunkirk were taken off in this way.\n\nThe Churchill Barriers are a series of four causeways in the Orkney Islands with a total length of 1.5 miles (2.4 km). They link the Orkney Mainland in the north to the island of South Ronaldsay via Burray and the two smaller islands of Lamb Holm and Glimps Holm.\n\nThe barriers were built in the 1940s as naval defences to protect the anchorage at Scapa Flow. They were commissioned following the sinking of HMS \"Royal Oak\" in 1939 by German U-boat \"U-47\" which had penetrated the existing defences of sunken blockships and anti-submarine nets. The barriers now serve as road links, carrying the A961 road from Kirkwall to Burwick.\n\nNotable in antiquity was the Heptastadion, a giant mole built in the 3rd century BC in the city of Alexandria, Egypt to join the city to \"Pharos Island\" where the Pharos lighthouse stood. The causeway formed a barrier separating Alexandria's oceanfront into two distinct harbours, an arrangement which had the advantage of protecting the harbours from the force of the strong westerly coastal current. The Heptastadion is also believed to have served as an aqueduct while Pharos was inhabited, and geophysical research indicates that it was part of the road network of the ancient city. Silting over the years resulted in the former dyke disappearing under several metres of accumulated silt and soil upon which the Ottomans built a town from 1517 onwards. Part of the modern city of Alexandria is now built on the site.\n\nWhen England acquired the north African city of Tangier as English Tangier in 1661, the English began building a mole to improve the harbour. The mole was planned to be long and cost £340,000, and the improved harbour was to be long, deep at low tide, and capable of keeping out the roughest of seas. Work began on the mole in August 1663 and continued for some years under a succession of Governors. With an improved harbour the town would have played the same role that Gibraltar later played in British naval strategy.\nHowever, Parliament expressed concern about the cost of maintaining the Tangier garrison, and by 1680 King Charles II had threatened to give up Tangier unless the supplies were voted for its sea defences. A crippling blockade by the Jaysh al-Rifi finally forced the English to withdraw from Tangier in 1683. The King gave secret orders to abandon the city, level the fortifications, destroy the harbour, and evacuate the troops. Samuel Pepys was present at the evacuation and wrote an account of it.\n\nStone quaysides are sometimes called moles. A well-known example is the Molo in Venice. It is the site of the Doge's Palace and two pillars which form a gateway to the sea. It has been depicted numerous times by artists such as Canaletto.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20544", "title": "Morphophonology", "text": "Morphophonology\n\nMorphophonology (also morphophonemics or morphonology) is the branch of linguistics that studies the interaction between morphological and phonological or phonetic processes. Its chief focus is the sound changes that take place in morphemes (minimal meaningful units) when they combine to form words.\n\nMorphophonological analysis often involves an attempt to give a series of formal rules that successfully predict the regular sound changes occurring in the morphemes of a given language. Such a series of rules converts a theoretical underlying representation into a surface form that is actually heard. The units of which the underlying representations of morphemes are composed are sometimes called morphophonemes. The surface form produced by the morphophonological rules may consist of phonemes (which are then subject to ordinary phonological rules to produce speech sounds or \"phones\"), or else the morphophonological analysis may bypass the phoneme stage and produce the phones itself.\n\nWhen morphemes combine, they influence each other's sound structure (whether analyzed at a phonetic or phonemic level), resulting in different variant pronunciations for the same morpheme. Morphophonology attempts to analyze these processes. A language's morphophonological structure is generally described with a series of rules which, ideally, can predict every morphophonological alternation that takes place in the language.\n\nAn example of a morphophonological alternation in English is provided by the plural morpheme, written as \"-s\" or \"-es\". Its pronunciation alternates between , , and , as in \"cats\", \"dogs\", and \"horses\" respectively. A purely phonological analysis would most likely assign to these three endings the phonemic representations , , . On a morphophonological level, however, they may all be considered to be forms of the underlying object , which is a morphophoneme. The different forms it takes are dependent on the segment at the end of the morpheme to which it attaches: the dependencies are described by morphophonological rules. (The behaviour of the English past tense ending \"-ed\" is similar: it can be pronounced , or , as in \"hoped\", \"bobbed\" and \"added\".)\n\nThe plural suffix \"-s\" can also influence the form taken by the preceding morpheme, as in the case of the words \"leaf\" and \"knife\", which end with in the singular/but have in the plural (\"leaves\", \"knives\"). On a morphophonological level, the morphemes may be analyzed as ending in a morphophoneme , which becomes voiced when a voiced consonant (in this case the of the plural ending) is attached to it. The rule may be written symbolically as -> [αvoice] / [αvoice]. This expression is called Alpha Notation in which α can be +(positive value) or -(negative value).\n\nCommon conventions to indicate a morphophonemic rather than phonemic representation are double slashes (//  //) (as above, implying that the transcription is 'more phonemic than simply phonemic'), pipes (|  |), double pipes (‖  ‖) and curly brackets ({  }).\n\nFor instance, the English word \"cats\" may be transcribed phonetically as , phonemically as and morphophonemically as , if the plural is argued to be underlyingly , assimilating to after a voiceless nonsibilant. The tilde ~ may indicate morphological alternation, as in for \"kneel~knelt\" (the plus sign '+' indicates a morpheme boundary).\n\nInflected and agglutinating languages may have extremely complicated systems of morphophonemics. Examples of complex morphophonological systems include:\n\nUntil the 1950s, many phonologists assumed that neutralizing rules generally applied before allophonic rules. Thus phonological analysis was split into two parts: a morphophonological part, where neutralizing rules were developed to derive phonemes from morphophonemes; and a purely phonological part, where phones were derived from the phonemes. Since the 1960s (in particular with the work of the generative school, such as Chomsky and Halle's \"The Sound Pattern of English\") many linguists have moved away from making such a split, instead regarding the surface phones as being derived from the underlying morphophonemes (which may be referred to using various terminology) through a single system of (morpho)phonological rules.\n\nThe purpose of both phonemic and morphophonemic analysis is to produce simpler underlying descriptions for what appear on the surface to be complicated patterns. In purely phonemic analysis the data is just a set of words in a language, while for the purposes of morphophonemic analysis the words must be considered in grammatical paradigms to take account of the underlying morphemes. It is postulated that morphemes are recorded in the speaker's \"lexicon\" in an invariant (morphophonemic) form, which, in a given environment, is converted by rules into a surface form. The analyst attempts to present as completely as possible a system of underlying units (morphophonemes) and a series of rules that act on them, so as to produce surface forms consistent with the linguistic data.\n\nThe isolation form of a morpheme is the form in which that morpheme appears in isolation (when not subject to the effects of any other morpheme). In the case of a bound morpheme, such as the English past tense ending \"-ed\", it will generally not be possible to identify an isolation form, since such a morpheme does not occur in isolation.\n\nIt is often reasonable to assume that the isolation form of a morpheme provides its underlying representation. For example, in some varieties of American English, \"plant\" is pronounced , while \"planting\" is , where the morpheme \"plant-\" appears in the form . Here the underlying form can be assumed to be , corresponding to the isolation form, since rules can be set up to derive the reduced form from this (while it would be difficult or impossible to set up rules that would derive the isolation form from an underlying ).\n\nThat is not always the case, however; sometimes the isolation form itself is subject to neutralization that does not apply to some other instances of the morpheme. For example, the French word \"petit\" (\"small\") is pronounced in isolation without the final [t] sound, but in certain derived forms (such as the feminine \"petite\"), the [t] is heard. If the isolation form were adopted as the underlying form, the information that there is a final \"t\" would be lost, and it would be hard then to explain the appearance of the \"t\" in the inflected forms.\n\nAssume that the grammar of a language has two rules,rule A and rule B, with A ordered before B. If, in a given derivation, the application of rule A creates the environment for rule B to apply, which was not present before the application of rule A, rule A and B are in a \"feeding relationship\" so rule A feeds rule B.\n\nAssuming again rule A and B, with A ordered before B in the derivation in which rule A destroys the environment to which rule B shall apply, one says A and B are in a \"bleeding order\".\n\nIf it is assumed again that a pair of rules A and B, with A ordered before B and B creating an environment to which A could have applied, B is said to counterfeed A, and the relationship is \"counterfeeding\".\n\nIf one assumes a pair of rules A and B and A ordered before B is in a \"counterbleeding\" relationship if B destroys the environment that A applies to and has already applied, therefore, B ordered after A has missed its chance to bleed A.\n\n\"Conjunctive ordering\" is the ordering that ensures that all rules are applied in a derivation before the surface representation is arrived at. One says that rules applied in a feeding relationship are \"conjunctively ordered\".\n\n\"Disjunctive ordering\" is a rule that applies and prevents the other rule to apply up to the surface representation. Such rules have a bleeding relationship and are \"disjunctively ordered\".\n\nThe principle behind alphabetic writing systems is that the letters (graphemes) represent phonemes. However, in many orthographies based on such systems the correspondences between graphemes and phonemes are not exact, and it is sometimes the case that certain spellings better represent a word's morphophonological structure rather than the purely phonological. An example of this is that the English plural morpheme is written \"-s\" regardless of whether it is pronounced as or ; we write \"cats and \"dogs, not \"dogz\".\n\nThe above example involves active morphology (inflection), and morphophonemic spellings are common in this context in many languages. Another type of spelling that can be described as morphophonemic is the kind that reflects the etymology of words. Such spellings are particularly common in English; examples include science\" vs. \"unconscious\" , prejudice\" vs. prequel\" , sign signature\" , nation\" vs. nationalism\" , and special\" vs. species\" .\n\nFor more detail on this topic, see Phonemic orthography, in particular the section on Morphophonemic features.\n\n"}

{"id": "40031725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40031725", "title": "Optical braille recognition", "text": "Optical braille recognition\n\nOptical braille recognition is the act of capturing and processing images of braille characters into natural language characters. It is used to convert braille documents for people who cannot read them into text, and for preservation and reproduction of the documents.\n\nIn 1984, a group of researchers at the Delft University of Technology designed a braille reading tablet, in which a reading head with photosensitive cells was moved along set of rulers to capture braille text line-by-line. In 1988, a group of French researchers at the Lille University of Science and Technology developed an algorithm, called Lectobraille, which converted braille documents into plain text. The system photographed the braille text with a low-resolution CCD camera, and used spatial filtering techniques, median filtering, erosion, and dilation to extract the braille. The braille characters were then converted to natural language using adaptive recognition. The Lectobraille technique had an error rate of 1%, and took an average processing time of seven seconds per line. In 1993, a group of researchers from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven developed a system to recognize braille that had been scanned with a commercially available scanner. The system, however, was unable to handle deformities in the braille grid, so well-formed braille documents were required. In 1999, a group at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University implemented an optical braille recognition technique using edge detection to translate braille into English or Chinese text. In 2001, Murray and Dais created a handheld recognition system, that scanned small sections of a document at once. Because of the small area scanned at once, grid deformation was less of an issue, and a simpler, more efficient algorithm was employed. In 2003, Morgavi and Morando designed a system to recognize braille characters using artificial neural networks. This system was noted for its ability to handle image degradation more successfully than other approaches.\n\nOptical braille recognition is used to digitize and reproduce texts that have been produced with non-computerized systems, such as with braille typewriters. Digitizing braille texts also helps reduce storage space, as braille texts take up much more space than their natural language counterparts. Optical braille recognition is also useful for people who cannot read braille, but need to access the content of braille documents.\n\nMany of the challenges to successfully processing braille text arise from the nature of braille documents. Braille is generally printed on solid-color paper, with no ink to produce contrast between the raised characters and the background paper. However, imperfections in the page can appear in a scan or image of the page.\n\nMany documents are printed \"inter-point\", meaning they are double-sided. As such, the depressions of the braille of one side appear interlaid with the protruding braille of the other side.\n\nSome optical braille recognition techniques attempt to use oblique lighting and a camera to reveal the shadows of the depressions and protrusions of the braille. Others make use of commercially available document scanners.\n\n"}

And where the idea of a future judgment or a resurrection of the dead or of purgatory exists, prayers are often offered on behalf of the dead to God.\n\nAlong reading Buddhist sutras such as Sutra of The Great Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, Amitabha Sutra or Diamond Sutra, Ritsu offer refuge, Pure Land Buddhists nianfo or chant Pure Land Rebirth Dhāraṇī and Tibetan Buddhists chant Om mani padme hum repeatedly. Prayers such as Namo Ratnasikhin Tathagata are for animals.\n\nA passage in the New Testament which may refer to a prayer for the dead is found in , which reads as follows:\n\nAs with the verses from 2 Maccabees, these verses refer to prayers that will help the deceased \"on that day\" (perhaps Judgement Day, see also end times). It is not stated that Onesiphorus, for whom Saint Paul prayed, was dead, though some scholars infer this, based on the way Paul only refers to him in the past tense, and prays for present blessings on his household, but for him only \"on that day\". And towards the end of the same letter, in , Paul sends greetings to \"Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus\", distinguishing the situation of Onesiphorus from that of the still living Prisca and Aquila.\n\nPrayer for the dead is well documented within early Christianity, both among prominent Church Fathers and the Christian community in general. In Eastern Orthodoxy Christians pray for \"such souls as have departed with faith, but without having had time to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance\". In the Catholic Church the assistance that the dead receive by prayer on their behalf is linked with the process of purification known as purgatory. While prayer for the dead continues in both these traditions and in those of Oriental Orthodoxy and of the Assyrian Church of the East, many Protestant groups reject the practice.\n\nThe tomb of the Christian Abercius of Hieropolis in Phrygia (latter part of the 2nd century) bears the inscription: \"Let every friend who observes this pray for me\", i.e. Abercius, who throughout speaks in the first person.\n\nThe inscriptions in the Roman catacombs bear similar witness to the practice, by the occurrence of such phrases as:\n\nAmong Church writers Tertullian († 230) is the first to mention prayers for the dead: \"The widow who does not pray for her dead husband has as good as divorced him\". This passage occurs in one of his later writings, dating from the beginning of the 3rd century. Subsequent writers similarly make mention of the practice as prevalent, not as unlawful or even disputed (until Arius challenged it towards the end of the 4th century). The most famous instance is Saint Augustine's prayer for his mother, Monica, at the end of the 9th book of his \"Confessions\", written around 398.\n\nAn important element in the Christian liturgies both East and West consisted of the diptychs, or lists of names of living and dead commemorated at the Eucharist. To be inserted in these lists was a confirmation of one's orthodoxy, and out of the practice grew the official canonization of saints; on the other hand, removal of a name was a condemnation.\n\nIn the middle of the 3rd century, St. Cyprian enjoining that there should be no oblation or public prayer made for a deceased layman who had broken the Church's rule by appointing a cleric trustee under his will: \"He ought not to be named in the priests prayer who has done his best to detain the clergy from the altar.\"\n\nAlthough it is not possible, as a rule, to name dates for the exact words used in the ancient liturgies, yet the universal occurrence of these diptychs and of definite prayers for the dead in all parts of the Christian Church, East and West, in the 4th and 5th centuries shows how primitive such prayers were. The language used in the prayers for the departed is asking for rest and freedom from pain and sorrow. A passage from the Liturgy of St James reads:\nRemember, O Lord, the God of Spirits and of all Flesh, those whom we have remembered and those whom we have not remembered, men of the true faith, from righteous Abel unto to-day; do thou thyself give them rest there in the land of the living, in thy kingdom, in the delight of Paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, our holy fathers, from whence pain and sorrow and sighing have fled away, where the light of thy countenance visiteth them and always shineth upon them.\n\nPublic prayers were only offered for those who were believed to have died as faithful members of the Church. But Saint Perpetua, who was martyred in 202, believed herself to have been encouraged in a vision to pray for her brother, who had died in his eighth year, almost certainly unbaptized; and a later vision assured her that her prayer was answered and he had been translated from punishment. St. Augustine thought it needful to point out that the narrative was not canonical Scripture, and contended that the child had perhaps been baptized.\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox believe in the possibility of situation change for the souls of the dead through the prayers of the living, and reject the term \"purgatory\". Prayer for the dead is encouraged in the belief that it is helpful for them, though \"how\" the prayers of the faithful help the departed is not elucidated. Eastern Orthodox simply believe that tradition teaches \"that\" prayers should be made for the dead.\n\nSaint Basil the Great († 379), a saint of undivided Christianity, writes in his Third Kneeling Prayer at Pentecost: \"O Christ our God...(who) on this all-perfect and saving Feast, art graciously pleased to accept propitiatory prayers for those who are imprisoned in hades, promising unto us who are held in bondage great hope of release from the vilenes that doth hinder us and did hinder them ... send down Thy consolation... and establish their souls in the mansions of the Just; and graciously vouchsafe unto them peace and pardon; for not the dead shall praise thee, O Lord, neither shall they who are in Hell make bold to offer unto thee confession. But we who are living will bless thee, and will pray, and offer unto thee propitiatory prayers and sacrifices for their souls.\"\n\nSaint Gregory Dialogus († 604) in his famous \"Dialogues\" (written in 593) teaches that, \"The Holy Sacrifice (Eucharist) of Christ, our saving Victim, brings great benefits to souls even after death, provided their sins (are such as) can be pardoned in the life to come.\" However, St. Gregory goes on to say, the Church's practice of prayer for the dead must not be an excuse for not living a godly life on earth. \"The safer course, naturally, is to do for ourselves during life what we hope others will do for us after death.\" Father Seraphim Rose († 1982) says, \"the Church's prayer cannot save anyone who does not wish salvation, or who never offered any struggle (podvig) for it himself during his lifetime.\"\n\nThe various prayers for the departed have as their purpose to pray for the repose of the departed, to comfort the living, and to remind those who remain of their own mortality. For this reason, memorial services have an air of penitence about them.\n\nThe Church's prayers for the dead begin at the moment of death, when the priest leads the \"Prayers at the Departure of the Soul \", consisting of a special Canon and prayers for the release of the soul. Then the body is washed, clothed and laid in the coffin, after which the priest begins the \"First Panikhida\" (prayer service for the departed). After the First Panikhida, the family and friends begin reading the Psalter aloud beside the casket. This reading continues and concludes until the next morning, in which usually the funeral is held, up until the time of the \"orthros\".\n\nOrthodox Christians offer particularly fervent prayers for the departed on the first 40 days after death. Traditionally, in addition to the service on the day of death, the memorial service is performed at the request of the relatives of an individual departed person on the following occasions:\n\nIn addition to Panikhidas for individuals, there are also several days during the year that are set aside as special general commemorations of the dead, when all departed Orthodox Christians will be prayed for together (this is especially to benefit those who have no one on earth to pray for them). The majority of these general commemorations fall on the various \"Soul Saturdays\" throughout the year (mostly during Great Lent). On these days, in addition to the normal Panikhida, there are special additions to Vespers and Matins, and there will be propers for the departed added to the Divine Liturgy. These days of general memorial are:\n\nThe most important form of prayer for the dead occurs in the Divine Liturgy. Particles are cut from the prosphoron during the Proskomedie at the beginning of the Liturgy. These particles are placed beneath the Lamb (Host) on the diskos, where they remain throughout the Liturgy. After the Communion of the faithful, the deacon brushes these particles into the chalice, saying, \"Wash away, O Lord, the sins of all those here commemorated, by Thy Precious Blood, through the prayers of all thy saints.\" Of this action, Saint Mark of Ephesus says, \"We can do nothing better or greater for the dead than to pray for them, offering commemoration for them at the Liturgy. Of this they are always in need... The body feels nothing then: it does not see its close ones who have assembled, does not smell the fragrance of the flowers, does not hear the funeral orations. But the soul senses the prayers offered for it and is grateful to those who make them and is spiritually close to them.\"\n\nNormally, candidates for sainthood, prior to their Glorification (Canonization) as a saint, will be commemorated by serving Panikhidas. Then, on the eve of their Glorification will be served an especially solemn Requiem, known as the \"Last Panikhida.\"\n\nIn the West there is ample evidence of the custom of praying for the dead in the inscriptions of the catacombs, with their constant prayers for the peace and refreshment of the souls of the departed and in the early liturgies, which commonly contain commemorations of the dead; and Tertullian, Cyprian and other early Western Fathers witness to the regular practice of praying for the dead among the early Christians.\n\nHowever, in the case of martyred Christians, it was felt that it was inappropriate to pray \"for\" the martyrs, since they were believed to be in no need of such prayers, having instantly passed to the Beatific Vision of Heaven. Theoretically, too, prayer for those in hell (understood as the abode of the eternally lost) would be useless, but since there is no certainty that any particular person is in hell understood in that sense, prayers were and are offered for all the dead, except for those believed to be in heaven. These are prayed to, not for. Thus, prayers were and are offered for all those in Hades, the abode of the dead who are not known to be in heaven, sometimes rendered as \"hell\". With the development of the doctrine of purgatory, the dead prayed for were spoken of as being in purgatory and, in view of the certainty that by the process of purification and with the help of the prayers of the faithful they were destined for heaven, they were referred to as the \"holy souls\".\n\nLimits were placed on public offering of Mass for the unbaptised, non-Catholics, and notorious sinners, but prayers and even Mass in private could be said for them. The present Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church states that, unless the person concerned gave some signs of repentance before death, no form of funeral Mass may be offered for notorious apostates, heretics and schismatics; those who for anti-Christian motives chose that their bodies be cremated; and other manifest sinners to whom a Church funeral could not be granted without public scandal to the faithful.\n\nOn the other hand, \"provided their own minister is not available, baptised persons belonging to a non-catholic Church or ecclesial community may, in accordance with the prudent judgement of the local Ordinary, be allowed Church funeral rites, unless it is established that they did not wish this.\"\n\nDuring the slaughter of the First World War, Pope Benedict XV on 10 August 1915, allowed all priests everywhere to say three Masses on All Souls' Day. The two extra Masses were in no way to benefit the priest himself: one was to be offered for all the faithful departed, the other for the Pope's intentions, which at that time were presumed to be for all the victims of that war. The permission remains.\n\nEach Eucharistic Prayer, including the ancient Roman Canon, of the Order of Mass has a prayer for the departed.\n\nIn \"Communio Sanctorum\", the Lutheran and Roman Catholic Churches in Germany agreed that prayer for the dead \"corresponds to the communion in which we are bound together in Christ...with those who have already died to pray for them and to commend them...to the mercy of God.\" Likewise, in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church and Roman Catholic Church formulated a statement \"The Hope of Eternal Life\", which affirmed that \"there is communion among the living and the dead across the divide of death. ... Prayerful commendation of the dead to God is salutary within a funeral liturgy. ... Insofar as the resurrection of the dead and the general final judgment are future events, it is appropriate to pray for God's mercy for each person, entrusting that one to God's mercy.\"\n\nThe Church of England's 1549 Book of the Common Prayer still had prayer for the dead, as (in the Communion Service): \"We commend into thy mercy all other thy servants, which are departed hence from us with the sign of faith and now do rest in the sleep of peace: grant unto them, we beseech thee, thy mercy and everlasting peace.\" But since 1552 the Book of Common Prayer has no express prayers for the dead, and the practice is denounced in the Homily \"On Prayer\" (part 3). Nonjurors included prayers for the dead, a practice that spread within the Church of England in the mid-nineteenth century, and was authorized in 1900 for forces serving in South Africa and since then in other forms of service. Many jurisdictions and parishes of the Anglo-Catholic tradition continue to practice prayer for the dead, including offering the Sunday liturgy for the peace of named departed Christians and keeping All Souls' Day.\n\nThe Episcopal Church's 1979 Book of Common Prayer includes prayers for the dead. The prayers during the Sunday Eucharistic Liturgy include intercessions for the repose of the faithful departed. Furthermore, most of the prayers in the burial rite are for the deceased, including the opening collect: O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered: Accept our prayers on behalf of thy servant \"N.,\" and grant \"him\" an entrance into the land of light and joy, in the fellowship of thy saints; through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.According to the Catechism in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, \"We pray for (the dead), because we still hold them in our love, and because we trust that in God's presence those who have chosen to serve him will grow in his love, until they see him as he is.\" Although this statement indicates that prayer is typically made for those who are known to have been members of the Church (\"those who have chosen to serve him\"), prayer is also offered for those whose faith was uncertain or unknown—authorized options in the Prayer Book burial rite allow for prayers that thus entrust the deceased to the mercy of God while retaining integrity about what was known of the deceased's religious life. For example, following the intercessions, there are two options for a concluding prayer: the first begins, \"Lord Jesus Christ, we commend to you our brother (sister) \"N.,\" who was reborn by water and the Spirit in Holy Baptism . . .\"; the second, however, would be appropriate for one whose faith and standing before God is not known:Father of all, we pray to you for \"N.,\" and for all those whom we love but see no longer. Grant to them eternal rest. Let light perpetual shine upon them. May \"his\" soul and the souls of all the departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen. \n\nTo console women whose children were not born and baptized, Martin Luther wrote in 1542: \"In summary, see to it that above all else you are a true Christian and that you teach a heartfelt yearning and praying to God in true faith, be it in this or in any other trouble. Then do not be dismayed about your child or yourself. Know that your prayer is pleasing to God and that God will do everything much better than you can comprehend or desire. 'Call upon me,' he says in Psalm 50. 'In the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.' For this reason, we ought not to condemn such infants. Believers and Christians have devoted their longing and yearning and praying for them.\" In the same year 1542 he stated in his \"Preface to the Burial Hymns\": \"Accordingly, we have removed from our churches and completely abolished the popish abominations, such as vigils, masses for the dead, processions, purgatory, and all other hocus-pocus on behalf of the dead\".\n\nThe Lutheran Reformers de-emphasized prayer for the dead, because they believed that the practice had led to many abuses and even to false doctrine, in particular the doctrine of purgatory and of the Mass as a propitiatory sacrifice for the departed. But they recognized that the early Church had practiced prayer for the dead, and accepted it in principle. Thus in the 1580 Book of Concord, the Lutheran Church taught:\n\n\"... we know that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead, which we do not prohibit; but we disapprove of the application \"ex opere operato\" of the Lord's Supper on behalf of the dead.\"\n\nThe largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, \"remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints\". In Funeral rites of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, \"deceased are prayed for\" using \"commendations: 'keep our sister/brother ... in the company of all your saints. And at the last ... raise her/him up to share with all the faithful the endless joy and peace won through the glorious resurrection of Christ our Lord.'\" The response for these prayers for the dead in this Lutheran liturgy is the prayer of Eternal Rest: \"rest eternal grant him/her, O Lord; and let light perpetual shine upon him/her\".\n\nOn the other hand, the edition of Luther's \"Small Catechism\" widely used among communicants of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod recommends:This question and answer do not appear in Luther's original text, but reflect the views of the twentieth-century Lutherans who added this explanation to the catechism.\n\nSimilarly, the conservative Lutheran denomination WELS teaches:\n\nJohn Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, stated that: \"I believe it to be a duty to observe, to pray for the Faithful Departed\". He \"taught the propriety of Praying for the Dead, practised it himself, provided \"Forms\" that others might.\" Two such prayers in the \"Forms\" are \"O grant that we, with those who are already dead in Thy faith and fear, may together partake of a joyful resurrection\" and also, \"By Thy infinite mercies, vouchsafe to bring us, with those that are dead in Thee, to rejoice together before Thee\". As such, many Methodists pray \"for those who sleep.\" Shane Raynor, a Methodist writer, explains the practice saying that it is \"appropriate to pray for others in the community, even across time and space\", referencing the doctrine of Communion of Saints being a \"community made up of all past, present, and future Christians\". In a joint statement with the Catholic Church in England and Wales, the Methodist Church of Great Britain affirmed that \"Methodists who pray for the dead thereby commend them to the continuing mercy of God.\"\n\nIn its Easter liturgy, the Moravian Church prays for those \"departed in the faith of Christ\" and \"give[s] thanks for their holy departure\".\n\nPrayer for the dead is not practiced by members of Baptist and nondenominational Christian churches. For example, members of the Baptist churches hold that \"dead men receive no benefit from the prayers, sacrifices, &c. of the living.\"\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a number of sacred ordinances and rituals that are performed for the dead. The chief among these are baptism for the dead and the sealing of the dead to families. These practices are based upon multiple New Testament scriptures, some of which are 1 Corinthians 15:29-32, Matthew 16:19\n\nIn Hinduism there are funeral speeches with prayers for the dead. Many of these funeral speeches are read out from the Mahabharata, usually in Sanskrit. Family members will pray around the body as soon as possible after death. People try to avoid touching the corpse as it is considered polluting.\n\nIn Islam, Muslims of their community gather to their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead, a prayer is recited and this prayer is known as the Salat al-Janazah (Janazah prayer).\n\nThe Janazah prayer is as follows:\n\nlike Eid prayer, the Janazah prayer incorporates an additional (four) Takbirs, the Arabic name for the phrase Allahu Akbar, but there is no Ruku' (bowing) and Sujud (prostrating).\n\nSupplication for the deceased and mankind is recited.\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was done in the Battle of Uhud.\n\nDogma states it is obligatory for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, but the dogma embraces the practical in that it qualifies, when Janazah is performed by the few it alleviates that obligation for all.\n\nIn addition, \"Peace be upon him\" (sometimes abbreviated in writing as PBUH) is a constantly repeated prayer for dead people such as Mohammed.\n\nPrayers for the dead form part of the Jewish services. The prayers offered on behalf of the deceased consist of: Recitation of Psalms; Reciting a thrice daily communal prayer in Aramaic which is known as \"Kaddish\". \"Kaddish\" actually means \"Sanctification\" (or \"Prayer of Making Holy\") which is a prayer \"In Praise of God\"; or other special remembrances known as \"Yizkor\"; and also a \"Hazkara\" which is said either on the annual commemoration known as the \"Yahrzeit\" as well on Jewish holidays.\n\nThe form in use in England contains the following passage: \"Have mercy upon him; pardon all his transgressions ... Shelter his soul in the shadow of Thy wings. Make known to him the path of life.\"\n\n\"El Maleh Rachamim\" is the actual Jewish prayer for the dead, although less well known than the Mourner's Kaddish. While the Kaddish does not mention death but rather affirms the steadfast faith of the mourners in God's goodness, \"El Maleh Rachamim\" is a prayer for the rest of the departed. There are various translations for the original Hebrew which vary significantly. One version reads:\nA record of Jewish prayer and offering of sacrifice for the dead at the time of the Maccabees is seen being referred to in 2 Maccabees, a book written in Greek, which, though not accepted as part of the Jewish Bible, is regarded as canonical by Eastern Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church:\nJacques Le Goff, French historian and agnostic, concluded, \"at the time of Judas Maccabeus-around 170 B.C., a surprisingly innovative period- prayer for the dead was not practiced, but that a century later it was practiced by certain Jews.”\n\nThis extract does not explain on what grounds Le Goff argued that prayer for the dead was not in use in the first half of the 2nd century BC. The account of the action of Judas Maccabaeus was written midway through the second half of the same century, in about 124 B.C., and in the view of Philip Schaff its mention of prayer for the dead \"seems to imply habit\".\n\nTaoists chant Qinghuahao (青華誥) or Jiukujing (救苦經).\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith believes the soul continues to progress toward God in the afterlife. In fact the Bahá'í definition of heaven and hell are nearness and distance from God respectively. The belief is that souls can be aided in their progress by the saying of prayers for the departed. Here is a sample of one such prayer:\nThe Prayer for the Dead is a particular prayer for the departed said at Bahá'í funerals before internment.\n\nZoroastrians chant prayers in funeral ceremonies.\n\nThere are prayers in other religions.\n\n\n"}

He studied modern history at university before serving in the British Army during World War II. Afterwards, he completed his studies, and then joined the British Civil Service. In 1974, two years after \"Watership Down\" was published, Adams became a full-time author.\n\nRichard Adams was born on 9 May 1920 in Wash Common, near Newbury, Berkshire, England, the son of Lillian Rosa (Button) and Elveyn George Beadon Adams, a doctor. He attended Horris Hill School from 1926 to 1933, and then Bradfield College from 1933 to 1938. In 1938, he went to Worcester College, Oxford, to read Modern History. In July 1940, Adams was called up to join the British Army. He was posted to the Royal Army Service Corps and was selected for the Airborne Company, where he worked as a brigade liaison. He served in Palestine, Europe and the Far East but saw no direct action against either the Germans or the Japanese.\n\nAfter leaving the army in 1946, Adams returned to Worcester College to continue his studies for a further two years. He received a bachelor's degree in 1948, proceeding MA in 1953. After his graduation in 1948, Adams joined the British Civil Service, rising to the rank of Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, later part of the Department of the Environment. Now, finally he began to write his own stories in his spare time, reading his creations to his amazed children and then, a bit later on, grandchildren. \nAdams originally began telling the story that would become \"Watership Down\" to his two daughters on a car trip. They eventually insisted that he publish it as a book. He began writing in 1966, taking two years to complete it. In 1972, after four publishers and three writers' agencies turned down the manuscript, Rex Collings agreed to publish the work. The book gained international acclaim almost immediately for reinvigorating anthropomorphic fiction with naturalism.\n\nOver the next few years \"Watership Down\" sold over a million copies worldwide. Adams won both of the most prestigious British children's book awards, one of six authors to do so: the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize. In 1974, following publication of his second novel, \"Shardik\", he left the Civil Service to become a full-time author. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975.\n\nAt one point, Adams served as writer-in-residence at the University of Florida and at Hollins University in Virginia. Adams was the recipient of the inaugural Whitchurch Arts Award for inspiration in January 2010, presented at the Watership Down pub in Freefolk, Hampshire. In 2015 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester.\n\nIn 1982, Adams served one year as president of the RSPCA. Besides campaigning against furs, Adams wrote \"The Plague Dogs\" to satirize animal experimentation (as well as government and tabloid press). He also made a voyage through the Antarctic in the company of the ornithologist Ronald Lockley. Just before his 90th birthday, he wrote a new story for a charity book, \"Gentle Footprints\", to raise funds for the Born Free Foundation.\n\nAdams celebrated his 90th birthday in 2010 with a party at the White Hart in his hometown of Whitchurch, Hampshire, where Sir George Young presented him with a painting by a local artist. Adams wrote a poetic piece celebrating his home of the past 28 years. \n\nAdams died on 24 December 2016 at the age of 96 in Oxford, England from complications of a blood disorder.\n\nIn 1949, Adams married (Barbara) Elizabeth, daughter of R.A.F. Squadron-Leader Edward Fox Dyke Acland, son of the barrister and judge Sir Reginald Brodie Dyke Acland, whose father, the scientist Henry Wentworth Dyke Acland (himself created a baronet of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford) descended from the Acland baronets of Columb John.\n\nUntil his death, he lived with his wife in Whitchurch, within of his birthplace. Their daughters, to whom Adams originally related the tales that became \"Watership Down\", are Juliet and Rosamond.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3306307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3306307", "title": "Runic inscriptions", "text": "Runic inscriptions\n\nA runic inscription is an inscription made in one of the various runic alphabets. The body of runic inscriptions falls into the three categories of Elder Futhark (some 350 items, dating to between the 2nd and 8th centuries AD), Anglo-Frisian Futhorc (some 100 items, 5th to 11th centuries) and Younger Futhark (close to 6,000 items, 8th to 12th centuries).\n\nThe total 350 known inscriptions in the Elder Futhark script fall into two main geographical categories, North Germanic (Scandinavian, c. 267 items) and Continental or South Germanic (\"German\" and Gothic, c. 81 items). These inscriptions are on many types of loose objects, but the North Germanic tradition shows a preference for bracteates, while the South Germanic one has a preference for fibulae. The precise figures are debatable because some inscriptions are very short and/or illegible so that it is uncertain whether they qualify as an inscription at all.\n\nThe division into Scandinavian, North Sea (Anglo-Frisian), and South Germanic inscription makes sense from the 5th century. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Elder Futhark script is still in its early phase of development, with inscriptions concentrated in what is now Denmark and Northern Germany.\n\nThe tradition of runic literacy continues in Scandinavia into the Viking Age, developing into the Younger Futhark script. Close to 6,000 Younger Futhark inscriptions are known, many of them on runestones.\n\nThe following table lists the number of known inscriptions (in any alphabet variant) by geographical region:\n\nElder Futhark inscriptions were rare, with very few active literati, in relation to the total population, at any time, so that knowledge of the runes was probably an actual \"secret\" throughout the Migration period. Of 366 lances excavated at Illerup, only 2 bore inscriptions. A similar ratio is estimated for Alemannia, with an estimated 170 excavated graves to every inscription found (Lüthi 2004:323) \nEstimates of the total number of inscriptions produced are based on the \"minimal runological estimate\" of 40,000 (ten individuals making ten inscriptions per year for four centuries). The actual number was probably considerably higher, maybe close to 400,000 in total, so that of the order of 0.1% of the corpus has come down to us), and Fischer (2004:281) estimates a population of several hundred active literati throughout the period, with as many as 1,600 during the Alamannic \"runic boom\" of the 6th century.\n\nEspecially the earliest inscriptions are found on all types of everyday objects. Later, a preference for valuable or prestigious objects (jewelry or weapons) seems to develop, inscriptions often indicating ownership.\n\nThe earliest period of Elder Futhark (2nd to 4th centuries) predates the division in regional script variants, and linguistically essentially still reflect the Common Germanic stage. Their distribution is mostly limited to southern Scandinavia, northern Germany and Frisia (the \"North Sea Germanic runic \"Koine\"\"), with stray finds associated with the Goths from Romania and Ukraine.\nLinguistically, the 3rd and 4th centuries correspond to the formation of Proto-Norse, just predating the separation of West Germanic into Anglo-Frisian, Low German and High German.\n\n\nAbout 260 items in Elder Futhark, and close to 6,000 items (mostly runestones) in Younger Futhark.\nThe highest concentration of Elder Futhark inscriptions is in Denmark.\n\nAn important Proto-Norse inscription was on one of the Golden horns of Gallehus (early 5th century). A total of 133 known inscriptions on bracteates. There are several legible and partly interpretable inscription that date from the 1st half of the 5th century such as a Silver neck ring found near Aalen with \"noru\" inscribed in runic alphabets on its inner edge. others discoveries were unearthed around Germany, Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Belgium, England and Bosnia.\n\nThe oldest known runestones date to the early 5th century (Einang stone, Kylver Stone).\nThe longest known inscription in the Elder Futhark, and one of the youngest, consists of some 200 characters and is found on the early 8th-century Eggjum stone, and may even contain a stanza of Old Norse poetry.\n\nThe transition to Younger Futhark begins from the 6th century, with transitional examples like the Björketorp or Stentoften stones. In the early 9th century, both the older and the younger futhark were known and used, which is shown on the Rök Runestone.\nBy the 10th century, only Younger Futhark remained in use.\n\nSome 100 items spanning the 5th to 11th centuries. \nThe 5th-century Undley bracteate is considered the earliest known Anglo-Frisian inscription.\n\nThe 8th-century Franks Casket, preserved during the Middle Ages in Brioude, central France, exhibits the longest coherent inscriptions in Anglo-Saxon runes by far, including five alliterating long-lines, qualifying as the oldest preserved Anglo-Saxon poetry.\n\nWhile the Nordic bracteates are jewelry imitating Roman gold coins, there were a number of actual coins (currency) in Anglo-Saxon England inscribed with runes, notably the coins from Kent, inscribed with \"pada\", \"æpa\" and \"epa\" (early 7th century).\n\nThere are a number of Christian inscriptions from the time of Christianization.\nSt. Cuthbert's coffin, dated to 698, even has a runic monogram of Christ, and the Whitby II bone comb (7th century) has a pious plea for God's help, \"deus meus, god aluwaldo, helpæ Cy…\" \"my God, almighty God, help Cy…\". The Ruthwell Cross inscription could also be mentioned, but its authenticity is dubious; it might have been added only in the 10th century.\n\nUnlike the situation on the continent, the tradition of runic writing does not disappear in England after Christianization but continues for a full three centuries, disappearing after the Norman conquest. A type of object unique to Christianized Anglo-Saxon England are the six known Anglo-Saxon runic rings of the 9th to 10th centuries.\n\nApart from the earliest inscriptions found on the continent along the North Sea coast (the \"North Germanic \"Koine\"\", Martin 2004:173), continental inscriptions can be divided in those of the \"Alemannic runic province\" (Martin 2004), with a few dozen examples dating to the 6th and 7th centuries, and those associated with the Goths, loosely scattered along the Oder to south-eastern Poland, as far as the Carpathian Mountains (e.g. the ring of Pietroassa in Romania), dating to the 4th and 5th centuries.\nThe cessation of both the Gothic and Alemannic runic tradition coincides with the Christianization of the respective peoples.\n\nLüthi (2004:321) identifies a total of about 81 continental inscriptions found south of the \"North Germanic Koine\". Most of these originate in southern Germany (Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria), with a single one found south of the Rhine (Bülach fibula, found in Bülach, Switzerland), and a handful from Eastern Europe (Poland, Romania, Ukraine).\n\nA silver-plated copper disk, originally part of a sword-belt, found at Liebenau, Lower Saxony with an early 5th-century runic inscription (mostly illegible, interpreted as possibly reading \"rauzwih\") is classed as the earliest South Germanic (German) inscription known by the RGA (vol. 6, p. 576); the location of Liebenau is close to the boundary of the North Sea and South Germanic zones.\n\nSiglas Poveiras in Povoa de Varzim, Portugal are also a type of writing based on the Viking runes. The siglas were first studied by António de Santos Graça in his book Epopeia dos Humildes (\"The Odyssey of the Humble\"). Published in 1952, the book contains hundreds of siglas and the history and maritime tragedy of Póvoa. Other works of his are \"O Poveiro\" (The Poveiro, 1932), \"A Crença do Poveiro nas Almas Penadas\" (Poveiro Beliefs Regarding Dead Souls, 1933) e \"Inscrições Tumulares por Siglas\" (Tomb Inscriptions Using Siglas, 1942).\n\nAfter a visit to the National Museet in Copenhagen, Octávio Lixa Filgueiras, by accident, found objects marked with \"home-marks\" from Funen in Denmark. Moreover, the complex hereditary mark system of Póvoa de Varzim was also found in Funen.\n\nThe Siglas development is at least, partly, attributed to Vikings that settled in the town during the 10th century and 11th century. This form of primitive writing developed within the community of Póvoa de Varzim was kept due to the practice of endogamy. Also, the similarity with the Scandinavian tradition of using specific bomärken (\"homestead marks\") for signatures and for marking property has also been noted.\n\nOut of about a dozen candidate inscriptions, only three are widely accepted to be of Gothic origin: the gold ring of Pietroassa, bearing a votive inscription, part of a larger treasure found in the Romanian Carpathians, and two spearheads inscribed with what is probably the weapon's name, one found in the Ukrainian Carpathians, and the other in eastern Germany, near the Oder.\n\nThe inscription on the spearhead of Kovel, found in Ukraine (now lost) is a special case. Its date is very early (3rd century) and it shows a mixture of runic and Latin letters, reading\n<TᛁᛚᚨᚱᛁDᛊ> or <TIᛚᚨRIDS> (the \"i\", \"r\" and \"s\" letters being identical in the Elder Futhark and Latin scripts), and may thus reflect a stage of development before the runes became fixed as a separate script in its own right.\n\nThe known inscriptions from Alemannia mostly date to the century between AD 520 and 620. There are some 70 inscriptions in total, about half of them on fibulae. Some are explicitly dedications among lovers, containing \"leub\" \"beloved\", or in the case of the Bülach fibula \"fridil\" \"lover\".\nMost were found in Germany, in the states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. A lesser number originates in Hessen and Rheinland-Pfalz, and outside of Germany there is a single example from Switzerland, and a small number of what are likely Burgundian inscriptions from eastern France.\n\nThe precise number of inscriptions is debatable, as some proposed inscriptions consist of a single sign, or a row of signs that may also be \"rune-like\", in imitation of writing, or purely ornamental. For example, a ring found in Bopfingen has been interpreted as being inscribed with a single \"g\", i.e. a simple X-shape that may also be ornamental. Most interpretable inscriptions contain personal names, and only ten inscriptions contain more than one interpretable word. Of these, four translate to \"(PN) wrote the runes\".\n\nThe other six \"long\" interpretable inscriptions are:\n\nOther notable inscriptions:\n\nA small number of inscriptions found in eastern France may be Burgundian rather than Alemannic:\n\nVery few inscriptions can be associated with the Franks, reflecting their early Romanization and Christianization. An important find is the Bergakker inscription, suggested as recording 5th-century Old Frankish.\nThe only other inscription definitely classified as Frankish is the Borgharen buckle, reading \"bobo\" (a Frankish personal name).\n\n\n"}

It emerged in the early 1990s as a culturally affirming African American homosexual identity.\n\nSGL was adapted as an Afrocentric alternative to what are deemed Eurocentric homosexual identities (e.g. gay and lesbian) which do not culturally affirm or engage the history and cultures of people of African descent. The term SGL usually has broad, important and positive personal, social, and political purposes and consequences. SGL is anti-hate and anti-anti-Black.\n\nIn a 2004 study of African American men, most of whom were recruited from black gay organizations, 12% identified as same-gender-loving, while 53% identified as gay. Men attending Black Gay Pride Festivals in nine U.S. cities in 2000 responded similarly, with 10% identifying as same-gender-loving, 66% as gay, and 14% as bisexual. Recent studies indicate that African-American disadvantaged youths are less likely than Euro-American youths to self-label as gay male, lesbian, or transgender youths.\n\nThe term AGL / All Gender Loving is slowly being recognized as well. AGL is a label for bisexual and pansexual Black people.

Like section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", section 19 allows anyone to speak English or French in federal courts. However, only section 133 extends these rights to Quebec courts, while section 19 extends these rights to courts in New Brunswick. New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province under section 16 of the \"Charter\".\n\nSection 19 reads,\n\nSection 19 is based on rights in section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867.\" Section 133 provides that \"either of those Languages may be used by any Person or in any Pleading or Process in or issuing from any Court of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all or any of the Courts of Quebec.\" However, unlike section 133, section 19(2) extends these rights to courts in New Brunswick. This was not entirely new, as section 13(1) of the \"Official Languages of New Brunswick Act\" (1973) provided for statutory language rights in New Brunswick courts. Still, the wording of section 19(2) follows section 133 more closely than section 13(1). In the 1986 Supreme Court case \"Société des Acadiens v. Association of Parents\", Justice Jean Beetz found this to be significant. Since section 133 rights are limited, constitutional language rights in New Brunswick courts are more limited than rights under section 13(1).\n\nSection 13(1) reads,\nUnder section 23 of the Manitoba Act, people in Manitoba courts have rights similar to those in section 133. Hence, New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Quebec are the only provinces whose court systems constitutionally must provide such rights.\n\nSection 19(2) was controversial when the Charter was being negotiated. The Barristers' Society of New Brunswick considered the proposed provision and argued that over 90% of New Brunswick lawyers spoke only English and the section might emphasize the language of lawyers more so than their clients.\n\nIn \"Société des Acadiens\", Justice Beetz ruled that section 19 of the \"Charter\" and section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" established a right to speak in either English or French. However, neither section went so far as to guarantee a person speaking in either English or French would be understood by the judge or judges. Under these sections it would be possible for a judge who understood only one of the two languages to preside over a case in which someone chose to speak the other language. Beetz did not want such a situation, however, and felt that the right to be understood was protected by basic principles of fundamental justice found in sections 7 and 14 of the \"Charter\". Since this is a right established under fundamental justice and not the official language provisions, it was a right belonging to anyone regardless of whether they speak English, French or a non-official language. This interpretation was influenced by past interpretations of section 133, including the interpretation of similar language rights in the Parliament of Canada found in section 133 and section 17 of the \"Charter\". \n\nThis interpretation of section 19 has been disputed. In the same case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson and Justice Bertha Wilson both found that a right to be understood by a judge regardless of whether one chooses to speak English or French could be found in the penumbra of section 19.\n\nHowever, the restrictive interpretation of language rights in \"Société des Acadiens\" was largely overturned in R. v. Beaulac.\n\n"}

He was jailed by Nepal's repressive Panchayat regime for his activities supporting language rights.\n\nSudarshan was born Lumbini Raj Shakya at OkuL Baha, Lalitpur. His father was Nhuchhe Raj Shakya and mother Harkha Maya Shakya. In 1950, he travelled to Kushinagar, India to be ordained a novice monk and was given the dharma name Sudarshan. He received higher ordination in Sarnath.\n\nSudarshan graduated in literature in Hindi in 1954 and in Nepal Bhasa in 1967. He went on to receive a master's degree in Nepalese history, culture and archeology in 1979. He taught at various schools and was a lecturer at Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu.\n\nSudarshan was a prolific writer, and greatly enriched the corpus of Nepal Bhasa literature. His favourite genre was drama, and he has written more than nine plays, most of them based on Buddhist themes. He also wrote short stories and poetry. In addition to Nepal Bhasa, he has written in Nepali and English. A number of his books on Buddhism have been prescribed as course books at the bachelor and Master's levels by Tribhuvan University.\n\nHe was also engaged in journalism, and has been the editor of \"Nepal Bhasa Patrika\" daily, \"Dharmodaya\" and \"Lumbini\" monthlies and \"Purnima\" annual.\n\nSudarshan was a member of the preparatory committee formed by the Lumbini Development Trust to establish a Buddhist university. Under its initiative, Lumbini Bauddha University was founded in 2004.\n\nSudarshan became the abbot of Shri Kirti Vihara, a Theravada Buddhist monastery built in Thai architectural style, which he established in Kirtipur in 1989. He also founded the Shri Kirti Buddhist Center here to teach Buddhism.\n\nSudarshan was active in the Nepal Bhasa movement. In 1965, the Panchayat regime (1962–1990) banned Nepal Bhasa from being broadcast over state-run Radio Nepal, the only radio station in the country. He joined the public protest that erupted, and was jailed for six months and six days under security laws.\n\nOn 31 December 2012, the Postal Services Department of the government of Nepal issued a commemorative postage stamp depicting the portrait of Sudarshan to honor his contribution to the country.\n\nIn 1996, he was decorated with the title Bhasa Thuwa (Patron of the Language) by Nepal Bhasa Parishad for his service to Nepal Bhasa. His play \"Juju Jaya Prakash\" (\"King Jaya Prakash\"), on the last king of Kathmandu Jaya Prakash Malla, was awarded the Shrestha Sirapa in 1958.\n\nIn a writing career spanning 1951–2002, Sudarshan produced plays, biographies, translations, essays and poetry. He has published more than 75 books in Nepal Bhasa and four in Nepali. His plays are \"Ambapali\" (1955), \"Rastrapal\" (1958), \"Amritmaya Maun\" (1958), \"Juju Jaya Prakash\" (1962), \"85 Pau\" (1962), \"Ashanka\" (1971), \"Pratishodh\" (1986), \"Nirvana\" (1993) and \"Patachara\" (1997).\n"}

He worked for the International Red Crescent, \"The New York Times\" and Afghan state radio at various times during his career in journalism. Munadi was killed by friendly fire on September 9, 2009, in a British Special Boat Service special forces raid meant to rescue Stephen Farrell and Munadi, who were both captured by Taliban forces near Kunduz four days earlier.\n\nMunadi was born in Astana, Bazarak District, in Panjshir province, Afghanistan, on November 22, 1976. Munadi, an ethnic Tajik, grew up around the family's farm in the village of Astana in the Panjshir Valley. His father fought against Soviet forces during the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The family's home in Astana, which was used as a command post by the mujahedeen, was bombed by Soviet troops. Munadi and his brothers rebuilt the family home by hand following the bombing.\n\nMunadi attended Amir Sharali Khan Primary School. He graduated from Nadiria High School in 1991.\n\nMunadi was accepted into the journalism program at Kabul University in 1995. He also took a course in English while studying journalism at the university. In 1996, the Taliban seized control of the city of Kabul, forcing Munadi to temporarily abandon his undergraduate studies. He eventually received his bachelor's degree in journalism from Kabul University.\n\nMunadi worked as a press officer and liaison for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent's local office in Gulbahar, Parwan Province, during the period of Taliban control from 1997 until 2001. He coordinated communications between the office in northern Afghanistan and the ICRC main headquarters in Kabul.\n\nMunadi joined the Afghan staff of the \"New York Times\" in 2002, following the ouster of the Taliban and establishment of an interim government. Munadi worked as a local correspondent in the Kabul office for the New York Times and contributed reports to the headquarters in New York City. He also translated Dari, Pashto and English documents and reports for the newspaper. Munadi remained with the New York Times until 2006.\n\nIn 2006, Munadi joined the staff of Good Morning Afghanistan (GMA), which is produced by AwaNama Productions. He was employed as a production manager for the radio show, and performed the tasks of editor, director and radio producer. He was later promoted to the editor of the show's website and radio broadcasts, and assigned stories to journalists.\n\nMunadi moved to Germany in early 2009, where he enrolled in a graduate program at University of Erfurt School of Public Policy towards a master's degree in public policy, good governance and journalism. He returned to Afghanistan from Germany twice during 2009.\n\nMunadi returned to Afghanistan from Germany during his summer break to visit his wife and two children. The \"New York Times\" contacted Munadi while he was in Afghanistan to ask him to assist its foreign correspondents in the country.\n\nOn September 5, 2009, Munadi and \"New York Times\" journalist Stephen Farrell, a British–Irish colleague, were kidnapped by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan near Kunduz. Farrell and Munadi were in the area interviewing local residents about a recent NATO airstrike on two fuel tankers (that had been kidnapped by Taliban militants) which had allegedly killed Afghan civilians.\n\nMunadi and Farrell were held by Taliban militants for four days. The Taliban treated Farrell rather well, but were increasingly threatening and abusive to Munadi while he was in captivity. The Taliban reminded Munadi of a 2007 kidnapping in which an Italian reporter, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, was freed while his Afghan translator was killed and beheaded. Munadi had called his parents at 10:30 pm on September 8 to report that he and Farrell were safe. His parents immediately left their home in Kabul to travel to Kunduz to await a possible release.\n\nBritish Military Intelligence discovered the house in which Munadi and Farrell were being held. On September 9, 2009, British Special Boat Service special forces raided the home to rescue the captives. Farrell was rescued, but Munadi was shot and killed in the firefight between the Taliban and British forces. It was later concluded that Munadi was shot in the front by a British soldier while he was also apparently shot by Taliban bullets while trying to get to the helicopter after the British mistook him for an enemy militant.\n\nMunadi's body was left at the scene and his parents reportedly had to collect his body themselves. Neither the \"New York Times\" nor the Munadi or Farrell families knew about the planned rescue attempt in advance. Munadi's death and the failure to retrieve his body resulted in widespread anger among Afghan journalists, claiming that Munadi's death revealed a double standard by international forces over the treatment of Western reporters versus local Afghan journalists.\n\n"}
{"id": "41831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41831", "title": "Telephony", "text": "Telephony\n\nTelephony ( ) is the field of technology involving the development, application, and deployment of telecommunication services for the purpose of electronic transmission of voice, fax, or data, between distant parties. The history of telephony is intimately linked to the invention and development of the telephone.\n\nTelephony is commonly referred to as the construction or operation of telephones and telephonic systems and as a system of telecommunications in which telephonic equipment is employed in the transmission of speech or other sound between points, with or without the use of wires. The term is also used frequently to refer to computer hardware, software, and computer network systems, that perform functions traditionally performed by telephone equipment. In this context the technology is specifically referred to as Internet telephony, or voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).\n\nThe first telephones were connected directly in pairs. Each user had a separate telephone wired to the locations he or she might wish to reach. This quickly became inconvenient and unmanageable when people wanted to communicate with more than a few people. The inventions of the telephone exchange provided the solution for establishing telephone connections with any other telephone in service in the local area. Each telephone was connected to the exchange via one wire pair, the local loop. Nearby exchanges in other service areas were connected with trunk lines and long distance service could be established by relaying the calls through multiple exchanges.\n\nInitially, switchboards were manually operated by an attendant, commonly referred to as the \"switchboard operator\". When a customer cranked a handle on the telephone, it turned on an indicator on the board in front of the operator, who would then plug the operator headset into that jack and offer service. The caller had to ask for the called party by name, later by number, and the operator connected one end of a circuit into the called party jack to alert them. If the called station answered, the operator disconnected their headset and completed the station-to-station circuit. Trunk calls were made with the assistance of other operators at other exchangers in the network.\n\nIn modern times, most telephones are plugged into telephone jacks. The jacks are connected by inside wiring to a drop wire which connects the building to a cable. Cables usually bring a large number of drop wires from all over a district access network to one wire center or telephone exchange. When a telephone user wants to make a telephone call, equipment at the exchange examines the dialed telephone number and connects that telephone line to another in the same wire center, or to a trunk to a distant exchange. Most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems, forming the public switched telephone network (PSTN).\n\nAfter the middle of the 20th century, fax and data became important secondary users of the network created to carry voices, and late in the century, parts of the network were upgraded with ISDN and DSL to improve handling of such traffic.\n\nToday, telephony uses digital technology (digital telephony) in the provisioning of telephone services and systems. Telephone calls can be provided digitally, but may be restricted to cases in which the last mile is digital, or where the conversion between digital and analog signals takes place inside the telephone. This advancement has reduced costs in communication, and improved the quality of voice services. The first implementation of this, ISDN, permitted all data transport from end-to-end speedily over telephone lines. This service was later made much less important due to the ability to provide digital services based on the IP protocol.\n\nSince the advent of personal computer technology in the 1980s, computer telephony integration (CTI) has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services, initiated and controlled by the computer, such as making and receiving voice, fax, and data calls with telephone directory services and caller identification. The integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development in the evolution of the automated office. The term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers, such as those that direct your phone call to the right department at a business you're calling. It's also sometimes used to describe the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage phone calls (in which case you can think of your computer as your personal call center). CTI is not a new concept and has been used in the past in large telephone networks, but only dedicated call centers could justify the costs of the required equipment installation. Primary telephone service providers are offering information services such as automatic number identification, which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from call switching and will make it easier to add new services. Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) on a scale is wide enough for its implementation to bring real value to business or residential telephone usage. A new generation of applications (middleware) is being developed as a result of standardization and availability of low cost computer telephony links.\n\nStarting with the introduction of the transistor, invented in 1947 by Bell Laboratories, to amplification and switching circuits in the 1950s, and through development of computer-based electronic switching systems, the public switched telephone network (PSTN) has gradually evolved towards automation and digitization of signaling and audio transmissions.\n\nDigital telephony is the use of digital electronics in the operation and provisioning of telephony systems and services. Since the 1960s a digital core network has replaced the traditional analog transmission and signaling systems, and much of the access network has also been digitized.\n\nDigital telephony has dramatically improved the capacity, quality, and cost of the network. End-to-end analog telephone networks were first modified in the early 1960s by upgrading transmission networks with Digital Signal 1 (DS1/T1) carrier systems, designed to support the basic 3 kHz voice channel by sampling the bandwidth-limited analog voice signal and encoding using PCM. While digitization allows wideband voice on the same channel, the improved quality of a wider analog voice channel did not find a large market in the PSTN.\n\nLater transmission methods such as SONET and fiber optic transmission further advanced digital transmission. Although analog carrier systems existed that multiplexed multiple analog voice channels onto a single transmission medium, digital transmission allowed lower cost and more channels multiplexed on the transmission medium. Today the end instrument often remains analog but the analog signals are typically converted to digital signals at the serving area interface (SAI), central office (CO), or other aggregation point. Digital loop carriers (DLC) and fiber to the x place the digital network ever closer to the customer premises, relegating the analog local loop to legacy status.\n\n\nThe field of technology available for telephony has broadened with the advent of new communication technologies. Telephony now includes the technologies of Internet services and mobile communication, including video conferencing.\n\nThe new technologies based on Internet Protocol (IP) concepts are often referred to separately as voice over IP (VoIP) telephony, also commonly referred to as IP telephony or Internet telephony. Unlike traditional phone service, IP telephony service is relatively unregulated by government. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates phone-to-phone connections, but says they do not plan to regulate connections between a phone user and an IP telephony service provider.\n\nA specialization of digital telephony, Internet Protocol (IP) telephony involves the application of digital networking technology that was the foundation to the Internet to create, transmit, and receive telecommunications sessions over computer networks. Internet telephony is commonly known as voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), reflecting the principle, but it has been referred with many other terms. VoIP has proven to be a disruptive technology that is rapidly replacing traditional telephone infrastructure technologies. As of January 2005, up to 10% of telephone subscribers in Japan and South Korea have switched to this digital telephone service. A January 2005 \"Newsweek\" article suggested that Internet telephony may be \"the next big thing\". As of 2006, many VoIP companies offer service to consumers and businesses.\n\nIP telephony uses an Internet connection and hardware IP phones, analog telephone adapters, or softphone computer applications to transmit conversations encoded as data packets. In addition to replacing plain old telephone service (POTS), IP telephony services compete with mobile phone services by offering free or lower cost connections via WiFi hotspots. VoIP is also used on private networks which may or may not have a connection to the global telephone network.\n\nDirect person-to-person communication includes non-verbal cues expressed in facial and other bodily articulation, that cannot be transmitted in traditional voice telephony. Video telephony restores such interactions to varying degrees. Social Context Cues Theory is a model to measure the success of different types of communication in maintaining the non-verbal cues present in face-to-face interactions. The research examines many different cues, such as the physical context, different facial expressions, body movements, tone of voice, touch and smell.\n\nVarious communication cues are lost with the usage of the telephone. The communicating parties are not able to identify the body movements, and lack touch and smell. Although this diminished ability to identify social cues is well known, Wiesenfeld, Raghuram, and Garud point out that there is a value and efficiency to the type of communication for different tasks. They examine work places in which different types of communication, such as the telephone, are more useful than face-to-face interaction.\n\nThe expansion of communication to mobile telephone service has created a different filter of the social cues than the land-line telephone. The use of instant messaging, such as \"texting\", on mobile telephones has created a sense of community. In \"The Social Construction of Mobile Telephony\" it is suggested that each phone call and text message is more than an attempt to converse. Instead, it is a gesture which maintains the social network between family and friends. Although there is a loss of certain social cues through telephones, mobile phones bring new forms of expression of different cues that are understood by different audiences. New language additives attempt to compensate for the inherent lack of non-physical interaction.\n\nAnother social theory supported through telephony is the Media Dependency Theory. This theory concludes that people use media or a resource to attain certain goals. This theory states that there is a link between the media, audience, and the large social system. Telephones, depending on the person, help attain certain goals like accessing information, keeping in contact with others, sending quick communication, entertainment, etc.\n\n"}

This article describes the grammar of the Ugaritic language. For more information regarding the Ugaritic language in general, see Ugaritic language.\n\nUgaritic is an inflected language, and as a Semitic language its grammatical features are highly similar to those found in Classical Arabic and Akkadian. It possesses two genders (masculine and feminine), three cases for nouns and adjectives (nominative, accusative, and genitive [also, note the possibility of a locative case]) ; three numbers: (singular, dual, and plural); and verb aspects similar to those found in other Northwest Semitic languages. The word order for Ugaritic is verb–subject–object (VSO), possessed–possessor (NG), and noun–adjective (NA). Ugaritic is considered a conservative Semitic language, since it retains most of the Proto-Semitic phonemes, the basic qualities of the vowel, the case system, the word order of the Proto-Semitic ancestor, and the lack of the definite article.\n\nThe word order for Ugaritic is Verb Subject Object (VSO), Subject Object Verb (SOV), possessed–possessor (NG), and noun–adjective (NA).\n\nUgaritic, like all Semitic languages, exhibits a unique pattern of stems consisting typically of \"triliteral\", or 3-consonant consonantal roots (2- and 4-consonant roots also exist), from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, and/or adding prefixes, suffixes, or infixes.\n\nVerbs in Ugaritic have 2 aspects: perfect for completed action (with pronominal suffixes) and imperfect for uncompleted action (with pronominal prefixes and suffixes). Verb formation in Ugaritic is based on (like all Semitic languages) triconsonantal roots. Affixes inserted into the root form different meanings. Taking the root RGM (which means \"to say\") for example:\n\nUgaritic verbs occur in 5 moods:\n\nUgaritic verbs occur in 10 reconstructed patterns or binyanim:\n\nNouns in Ugaritic can be categorized according to their inflection into: cases (nominative, genitive, and accusative), state (absolute and construct), gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular, dual, and plural).\n\nUgaritic has three grammatical cases corresponding to: nominative, genitive, and accusative. Normally, singular nouns take the ending –u in the nominative, -i in the genitive and –a in the accusative. Using the word Malk- (king) and Malkat- (queen) for example:\n\nAs in Arabic, some exceptional nouns (known as diptotes) have the suffix -a in the genitive. There is no Ugaritic equivalent for Classical Arabic nunation or Akkadian mimation.\n\nNouns in Ugaritic occur in two states: absolute and construct.\nIf a noun is followed by a genitival attribute (noun in the genitive or suffixed pronoun) it becomes a construct (denoting possession). Otherwise, it is in the absolute state. Ugaritic, unlike Arabic and Hebrew, has no definite article.\n\nNouns which have no gender marker are for the most part masculine, although some feminine nouns do not have a feminine marker. However, these denote feminine beings such as ʼumm- (mother). /-t/ is the feminine marker which is directly attached to the base of the noun.\n\nUgaritic distinguishes between nouns based on quantity. All nouns are either singular when there is one, dual when there are two, and plural if there are three or more.\n\nThe singular has no marker and is inflected according to its case.\n\nThe marker for the dual in the absolute state appears as /-m/. However, the vocalization may be reconstructed as /-āmi/ in the nominative (such as malkāmi \"two kings\") and /-ēmi/ for the genitive and accusative (e.g. malkēmi). For the construct state, it is /-ā/ and /-ē/ respectively.\n\nUgaritic has only regular plurals (i.e. no broken plurals). Masculine absolute state plurals take the forms /-ūma/ in the nominative and /-īma/ in the genitive and accusative. In the construct state they are /-ū/ and /-ī/ respectively. The female afformative plural is /-āt/ with a case marker probably following the /-t/, giving /-ātu/ for the nominative and /-āti/ for the genitive and accusative in both absolute and construct state.\n\nAdjectives follow the noun and are declined exactly like the preceding noun.\n\nIndependent personal pronouns in Ugaritic are as follows (some forms are lacking because they are not in the corpus of the language):\n\nSuffixed (or enclitic) pronouns (mainly denoting the genitive and accusative) are as follows:\n\nThe following is a table of Ugaritic numerals:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5609564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5609564", "title": "Woleaian language", "text": "Woleaian language\n\nWoleaian is the main language of the island of Woleai and surrounding smaller islands in the state of Yap of the Federated States of Micronesia. Woleaian is a Trukic language. Within that family, its closest relative is Satawalese, with which it is largely mutually intelligible. Woleaian is spoken by approximately 1700 people. Woleai has a writing system of its own, a syllabary based on the Latin alphabet.\n\nMost Woleaian speakers or Woleaians as they are more commonly known as are mostly found in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Central and Eastern Caroline Islands. More specifically most of the speakers are found in Yap State in Micronesia where Woleaian is considered an official language. Most Woleaian speakers are classified as Pacific Islanders and Micronesian (People-In-Country Profile). The island of Yap is broken up into two parts: Yap Proper, which is made up of Gagil, Tomil, Fanif, Weloy, and Rull—and the Yap Outer Islands, which is made up of Ulithi, Faris/Sorol, Ngulu, Woleai, Eauripik, Ifalik, Faraulap, Elato, Lamotrek and Satawal. Aside from Woleaian, many speakers in Yap and other nearby places speak other languages, like Yapese, Satawalese, Ulithian, English, Chuukese, Kosraean, Pingelapese, Pohnpeian, Mwoakilloan, and some Asian and Polynesian Languages (Yap Census Report, 2002).\nThe Woleaian language and culture is very important to the Woleaian people, as well as their history. The Woleaian history is passed down from generation to generation by storytelling. By doing so this helps to keep their language alive. As well as passing down their history, they also pass down their music, which is important to them. An important part of their culture is their clothing. Their clothing is so important to them that they have strict rules against wearing any type of western clothing. They also enjoy using canoes to get around instead of motorboats, and simple things like beautiful beaches and going fishing. They also enjoy working and spending time with their family and friends (Team).\n\nIn 1987, a Yap Census was taken and reported that there were about 1,630 people speaking the language. 13 years later when the census was taken in 2000 there was an increase of speakers and about 5,000 people were speaking or knew the language. Of these 5,000 speakers about 4,500 of them spoke Woleaian as their first language and 500 of them as their second language (Yap Census Report, 2002).\n\nWoleaian is classified as an Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Remote Oceanic, Micronesian, Micronesian Proper, Ponapeic-Trukic, Trukic language (Woleaian).\n\nWoleaian has geminate (long) consonants and vowels.\n\nIn the orthography of Sohn (1975), along with a few approximations in the IPA, the inventory is,\n\nNote that both \"sh\" and \"r\" become \"ch\" when long, and that \"l\" becomes \"nn\".\n\nVowels occur long and short, except for \"eo\" and \"oa,\" which are only found long.\n\nAll simple vowels except \"a\" can occur as voiceless vowels in word-final position. (All simple vowels can also occur as word-final voiced vowels.) Though these voiceless vowels are generally not spelled out by native speakers, they represent an important change in pronunciation between words which are otherwise spelled the same. For example:\n\n\nIn the Woleaian language words can have anywhere from one to three consonants in a row. Words may either have CV, CCV, CCCV, or VV syllable structures, and words can end in consonants (Sohn, 1975).\n\nThere are four inflectional paradigms in Woleaian: possessive, objective, progressive, and plural.\nThese suffixes, attached to nouns, convey the person and number of a possessor. There are seven regular possessive suffixes and one defective possessive suffix. \n\nThe \"defective\" suffix is always followed by a noun, unlike regular possessive suffixes.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nThese suffixes occur with all transitive verbs and show person, number, and animateness of the object of that verb.\n\nProgressive action is shown in Woleaian through reduplication of initial parts of verbs. For example: \"mil\" \"to stay\" becomes \"mimmil\" \"to be staying.\"\n\nPlurality of nouns is generally left up to context, but the plural marker \"ka\" is added when nouns are accompanied by a demonstrative pronoun.\n\nWoleaian has many different sentences types—and the type of sentence determines the word order. The first types of sentences are major and minor sentences. Major sentences are expressions that contain a subject and a predicate. (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). Within a major sentence it can be broken up into two types, simple and complex sentences. Simple major sentences have a subject associated with a predicate. In a simple major sentence, the subject and predicates are interchangeable—so sometimes the subject comes first, and sometimes the predicate comes first. Simple major sentences can then be broken up into either equational or predicative. In an equational sentence the subject always follows the predicate, whether a question or statement. In predicative sentences, a subject or noun phrase usually follows a predicate. Two or more simple sentences together within one sentence produces a complex major sentence. Complex major sentences can either be coordinative or subordinative. Minor sentences are without \"...a subject, a predicate, or both, but still express a complete thought.” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). Just as major sentence can be divided into two types, so can minor sentences. Some refer back to the context and complete it, (completive), and some that appear independently, (exclamatory). (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). The problem with equational and predicative statement and question sentences in Woleaian is that you cannot differentiate between the question and statement based on how the words are arranged. An example of this in an equational sentence is ‘‘“Iiy semal sar skuul”’’, which can translate to “He is a student\" or \"is he a student?”—and in a predicative sentence, ‘‘“Go weri saw we”’’ which can translate to “You saw the child\" or \"Did you see the child?” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975).\n\nMany words in Woleaian, especially verbs, use reduplication, (Kennedy). They use both whole stem and partial reduplications “as initial or medial consonant doubling and initial or final reduplication,” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). An example of this is the word ‘‘fiyefiy’’, which means to squeeze and comes from the word ‘‘fiya’’, which means squeeze it. Some nouns also use reduplication, like ‘‘ugoug’’ or gallbladder, which reduplicates the word ‘‘ug’’ for net. Reduplication in Woleaian can be found in adjectives—like the word ‘‘yangoyang’’, meaning to be yellow, yellowish of ginger color, which comes from the word yang, which means ginger. (Sohn & Tawerilmang, Woleaian-English Dictionary, 1976). Another type of reduplication in Woleaian is reduplication-prefixation, which is when “a neutral verb has both reduplication and the causative prefix/” (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975). An example of this is the Woleaian word ‘‘gareparep’’, which means to get close. This word comes from the words ‘‘garepa’’ meaning approach to it, and ‘‘rep’’, meaning to be near (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975).\n\n\nMany loanwords in Woleaian come from Spanish, Japanese and English.\n\nWords from Spanish: (Sohn, Woleaian Reference Grammar, 1975)\n\nWords from Japanese: (Sohn & Tawerilmang, Woleaian-English Dictionary, 1976)\n\nWords from English: (Sohn & Tawerilmang, Woleaian-English Dictionary, 1976)\n\nThere are many resources on the Woleaian language—including books, websites, research papers, and even YouTube videos. Two books in particular are helpful in learning about the Woleaian language: the Woleaian Reference Grammar book by Ho-Min Sohn, and a Woleaian-English Dictionary by Ho-Min Sohn and Anthony Tawerilmang. These two books contain much information about the Woleaian language, such as the sentence structures, types of reduplication, vocabulary, etc. Many websites contain useful information. The 2000 Yap Census also provides information about the language and speakers. A few research papers are helpful as well. One by Tsz-him Tsui from the University of Hawaii at Manoa describes the Woleaian vocabulary and phonemes. A paper by Robert Kennedy from the University of Arizona is about Woleaian reduplication. Lastly, a YouTube channel provides Woleaian videos. Some of the videos are of church services, cultural dances similar to the hula, and Woleaian people singing Woleaian songs.\n\nWoleaian, under the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS, which determines the status of a language, is level five, a developing language. This means that it “is in vigorous use, with literature in a standardized form being used by some people, though it is not yet widespread or sustainable.” (Lewis, Simons & Fennig, 2013). From the rapid growth of Woleaian in 1987 to 2000 it is pretty safe to say that Woleaian is being transmitted and taught to young children. There is intergenerational transmission involved in Woleaian because of its language status on the EGIDS. It is described as a developing language in vigorous use—which means that the Woleaian speakers must pass it down from generation to generation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1596906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1596906", "title": "Xiang Chinese", "text": "Xiang Chinese\n\nXiang or Hsiang (; ), also known as Hunanese (), is a group of linguistically similar and historically related varieties of Chinese, spoken mainly in Hunan province but also in northern Guangxi and parts of neighboring Guizhou and Hubei provinces. Scholars divided Xiang into five subgroups, Chang-Yi, Lou-Shao, Hengzhou, Chen-Xu and Yong-Quan. Among those, Lou-shao, also known as Old Xiang, still exhibits the three-way distinction of Middle Chinese obstruents, preserving the voiced stops, fricatives, and affricates. Xiang has also been heavily influenced by Mandarin, which adjoins three of the four sides of the Xiang speaking territory, and Gan in Jiangxi Province, from where a large population immigrated to Hunan during the Ming Dynasty.\n\nXiang-speaking Hunanese people have played an important role in Modern Chinese history, especially in those reformatory and revolutionary movements such as Self-Strengthening Movement, Hundred Days' Reform, Xinhai Revolution and Chinese Communist Revolution. Some examples of Xiang speakers are Mao Zedong, Zuo Zongtang, Huang Xing and Ma Ying-jeou.\n\nDuring Qin and Han dynasty, most part of today's Eastern Hunan belonged to Changsha-Xian/Changsha-Guo. According to Yang Xiong's \"Fangyan\", people in this region spoke Southern Chu, which is considered the ancestor of Xiang Chinese today.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, a large-scale emigration took place with people emigrating from the north to the south, bringing Middle Chinese into Hunan. Today's Xiang still keeps some Middle Chinese words, such as (to have fun), (to weed), (to walk). Entering tone vowels started weakening in Hunan at this time.\n\nThe late Yuan Dynasty peasant uprising caused a great many casualties in Hunan. During the Ming dynasty, a large-scale emigration from Jiangxi to Hunan took place. Gan, which was brought by settlers from Jiangxi, influenced Xiang. The speech in east Hunan differentiated into New Xiang during that period.\n\nQuanzhou County became part of Guangxi province after the adjustment of administrative divisions in the Ming Dynasty. Some features of Xiang at that time were kept in this region.\n\nSince the classification of Yuan Jiahua (1960), Xiang has been considered one of seven major groups of varieties of Chinese.\nJerry Norman classified Xiang, Gan and Wu, as central groups, intermediate between the Mandarin group to the north and the southern groups, Min, Hakka and Yue.\n\nIn Xiang dialects, the voiced initials of Middle Chinese yield unaspirated initials in all tone categories. A few varieties have retained voicing in all tones, but most have voiceless initials in some or all tone categories.\n\nPervasive influence from Mandarin dialects has made Xiang dialects difficult to classify.\nXiang is traditionally divided into New Xiang, in which voicing has been lost completely, and Old Xiang varieties, which retain voiced initials in at least some tones.\nChangsha dialect is usually taken as representative of New Xiang, while Shuangfeng dialect represents Old Xiang.\nNorman describes the boundary between New Xiang and Southwestern Mandarin as one of the weakest in China, with considerable similarities between dialects near either side of the boundary, though more distant dialects are mutually unintelligible.\nIndeed, Zhou Zhenhe and You Rujie (unlike most authors) classified New Xiang as part of Southwestern Mandarin.\nWithin New Xiang and Old Xiang, there are also many different sub-dialects.\n\nThe \"Language Atlas of China\" identified a third subgroup, Ji-Xu in some places of Western Hunan.\nBao & Chen (2007) split out part of New Xiang as a new Hengzhou Xiang subgroup, and part of Old Xiang out as a Yong-Quan Xiang subgroup.\nThey also reclassified parts of the Ji–Xu subgroup as Southwest Mandarin, renaming the remainder of the subgroup as Chen-Xu Xiang.\nTheir five subgroups are:\n\n\nXiang is spoken by over 36 million people in China, primarily in the most part of the Hunan province, and in the four counties of Quanzhou, Guanyang, Ziyuan, and Xing'an in northeastern Guangxi province, and in several places of Guizhou and Guangdong provinces. It is abutted by Southwestern Mandarin-speaking areas to the north and west, as well as by Gan in the eastern parts of Hunan and Jiangxi. Xiang is also in contact with the Qo-Xiong Miao and Tujia languages in West Hunan.\n\n\n"}
