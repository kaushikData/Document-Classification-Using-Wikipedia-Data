Whereas an agonist causes an action, an antagonist blocks the action of the agonist, and an inverse agonist causes an action opposite to that of the agonist.\n\nReceptors can be activated by either endogenous agonists (such as hormones and neurotransmitters) or exogenous agonists (such as drugs), resulting in a biological response. A physiological agonist is a substance that creates the same bodily responses but does not bind to the same receptor.\n\n\nNew findings that broaden the conventional definition of pharmacology demonstrate that ligands can concurrently behave as agonist \"and\" antagonists at the same receptor, depending on effector pathways or tissue type. Terms that describe this phenomenon are \"functional selectivity\", \"protean agonism\", or selective receptor modulators.\n\nPotency is the amount of agonist needed to elicit a desired response. The potency of an agonist is inversely related to its EC value. The EC can be measured for a given agonist by determining the concentration of agonist needed to elicit half of the maximum biological response of the agonist. The EC value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies producing physiologically similar effects. The smaller the EC value, the greater the potency of the agonist, the lower the concentration of drug that is required to elicit the maximum biological response.\n\nWhen a drug is used therapeutically, it is important to understand the margin of safety that exists between the dose needed for the desired effect and the dose that produces unwanted and possibly dangerous side-effects (measured by the TD, the dose that produces toxicity in 50% of individuals). This relationship, termed the therapeutic index, is defined as the ratio TD:ED. In general, the narrower this margin, the more likely it is that the drug will produce unwanted effects. The therapeutic index emphasizes the importance of the margin of safety, as distinct from the potency, in determining the usefulness of a drug.\n\nFrom the Greek αγωνιστής (agōnistēs), contestant; champion; rival < αγων (agōn), contest, combat; exertion, struggle < αγω (agō), I lead, lead towards, conduct; drive\n\n"}

{"id": "32065312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32065312", "title": "Biblical Hebrew orthography", "text": "Biblical Hebrew orthography\n\nBiblical Hebrew orthography refers to the various systems which have been used to write the Biblical Hebrew language. Biblical Hebrew has been written in a number of different writing systems over time, and in those systems its spelling and punctuation have also undergone changes.\n\nThe earliest Hebrew writing discovered so far, dating back to the 10th century BCE, was found at Khirbet Qeiyafa in July 2008 by Israeli archaeologist Yossi Garfinkel. The 15 cm x 16.5 cm (5.9 in x 6.5 in) trapezoid pottery sherd (ostracon) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (the old form of the Phoenician alphabet). That the language of the tablet is Hebrew is suggested by the presence of the words תעש \"to do\" עבד \"servant\". The tablet is written from left to right, indicating that Hebrew writing was still in the formative stage.\n\nThe Israelite tribes who settled in the land of Israel adopted the Phoenician script around the 12th century BCE, as found in the Gezer calendar (circa 10th century BCE). This script developed into the Paleo-Hebrew script in the tenth or ninth centuries BCE. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet's main differences from the Phoenician script were \"a curving to the left of the dowstrokes in the 'long-legged' letter-signs... the consistent use of a Waw with a concave top, [and an] x-shaped Taw.\" The oldest inscriptions in Paleo-Hebrew script are dated to around the middle of the 9th century BCE, the most famous being the Mesha Stele in the Moabite language (which might be considered a dialect of Hebrew). The ancient Hebrew script was in continuous use until the early 6th century BCE, the end of the First Temple period.\n\nIn the Second Temple Period the Paleo-Hebrew script gradually fell into disuse. The epigraphic material in the ancient Hebrew script is poor in the Second Temple Period. Pentateuch fragments in the ancient Hebrew script dating to the 3rd or 2nd century BCE were found in Qumran, Hasmonaean coins and coins from the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 BCE), and ostraca from Masada before its fall in 74 CE are among the youngest finds in the ancient script, as well as the use of divine names in texts otherwise in other scripts. It seems that the Paleo-Hebrew script was completely abandoned among the Jews after the failed Bar Kochba revolt. The Samaritans retained the ancient Hebrew alphabet, which evolved into the modern Samaritan alphabet. In fact, the adoption of the script by the Samaritans may have influenced the Rabbis' negative view of the script and lead to its final rejection.\n\nThe only papyrus document from the First Temple period that has survived was found in the Wadi Murabba'at, and is dated to the 7th century BCE. However, fiber impressions on the back of many bullae of that period show that papyrus was in common use in that region. Presumably papyrus was common in the pre-exilic period, while in the Babylonian exile hide scrolls were used, given that papyrus does not grow there.\n\nBy the end of the First Temple period the Aramaic script, a separate descendant of the Phoenician script, became widespread throughout the region, gradually displacing Paleo-Hebrew. The Jews who were exiled to Babylon became familiar with Aramaic out of necessity, while the Jews remaining in Judea seem to have mostly lost the writing tradition. According to tradition, the Aramaic script became established with the return of Ezra from exile around the 4th century BCE. The oldest documents that have been found in the Aramaic Script are fragments of the scrolls of Exodus, Samuel, and Jeremiah found among the Dead Sea scrolls, dating from the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BCE. The modern Hebrew alphabet, also known as the Assyrian or Square script, is a descendant of the Aramaic alphabet. It seems that the earlier Biblical books were originally written in the Paleo-Hebrew script, while the later books were written directly in the later Assyrian script. Some Qumran texts written in the Assyrian script write the tetragrammaton and some other divine names in Paleo-Hebrew, and this practice is also found in several Jewish-Greek Biblical translations.\n\nWhile spoken Hebrew continued to evolve into Mishnaic Hebrew, the scribal tradition for writing the Torah gradually developed. A number of regional \"book-hand\" styles developed for the purpose of Torah manuscripts and occasionally other literary works, distinct from the calligraphic styles used mainly for private purposes. The Sephardi and Ashkenazi book-hand styles were later adapted to printed fonts after the invention of the printing press.\n\nThe Phoenician script had dropped five characters by the twelfth century BCE, reflecting the language's twenty-two consonantal phonemes. As a result, the 22 letters of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet numbered less than the consonant phonemes of ancient Biblical Hebrew; in particular, the letters <ח, ע, ש> could each mark two different phonemes. After a sound shift the letters ח, ע became uniphonic, but (except in Samaritan Hebrew) ש remained multiphonic. The old Babylonian vocalization wrote a superscript ס above the ש to indicate it took the value /s/, while the Masoretes added the shin dot to distinguish between the two varieties of the letter. The Aramaic script began developing special final forms for certain letters in the 5th century BCE, though this was not always a consistent rule (as reflected in the Qumran practice).\n\nThe original Hebrew alphabet consisted only of consonants, but gradually the letters א, ה, ו, י, also became used to indicate vowels, known as \"matres lectionis\" (Latin: \"mothers of reading\") when used in this function. It is thought that this was a product of phonetic development: for instance, *bayt 'house' shifted to בֵּית in construct state but retained its spelling. While no examples of early Hebrew orthography have been found, older Phoenician and Moabite texts show how First Temple period Hebrew would have been written. Phoenician inscriptions from the tenth century BCE do not indicate \"matres lectionis\" in the middle or the end of a word: ז ( = זה), לפנ (= לפני), similarly to the Hebrew Gezer Calendar: שערמ (= שעורים), ירח (= ירחו?). \"Matres lectionis\" were later added word-finally, for instance the Mesha inscription has בנתי (= בניתי), בללה (= בלילה); however at this stage they were not yet used word-medially, compare Siloam inscription זדה versus אש =) איש). The relative terms \"defective\" and \"full\" or \"plene\" are used to refer to alternative spellings of a word with less or more \"matres lectionis\", respectively.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible was presumably originally written in a more defective orthography than found in any of the texts known today. Of the extant textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible, the Masoretic text is generally the most conservative in its use of \"matres lectionis\", with the Samaritan Pentateuch and its forebearers being more full and the Qumran tradition showing the most liberal use of vowel letters. The Masoretic text mostly uses vowel letters for long vowels, showing the tendency to mark all long vowels except for word-internal /aː/. However, there are a number of exceptions, e.g. when the following syllable contains a vowel letter (as in קֹלֹוֹת 'voices' rather than קוֹלוֹת) or when a vowel letter already marks a consonant (so גּוֹיִם 'nations' rather than גּוֹיִים*), and within the Bible there is often little consistency in spelling. In the Qumran tradition, o- and u-type vowels, including short holem (מושה, פוה, חושך), qamets hatuf (חוכמה, כול), and hatef qamets (אוניה), are usually represented by <ו>. <י> is generally used for both long [iː] and tsere (אבילים, מית), and final [iː] is often written as יא- in analogy to היא, הביא, e.g. כיא, sometimes מיא. <ה> is found finally in forms like חוטה (Tiberian חוטא), קורה (Tiberian קורא), while <א> may be used for a-quality in final position (e.g. עליהא) and in medial position (e.g. יאתום) Pre-Samaritan and Samaritan texts show full spellings in many categories (e.g. כוחי vs. Masoretic כחי in Genesis 49:3) but only rarely show full spelling of the Qumran type (but see Genesis 24:41b Samaritan נקיא vs. Masoretic נקי).\n\nIn general the vowels of Biblical Hebrew were not indicated in the original text, but various sources attest them at various stages of development. Greek and Latin transcriptions of words from the Biblical text provide early evidence of the nature of Biblical Hebrew vowels. In particular, there is evidence from the rendering of proper nouns in the Koine Greek Septuagint (3rd-2nd centuries BCE), and the Greek alphabet transcription of the Hebrew Biblical text contained in the Secunda (3rd century CE, likely a copy of a preexisting text from before 100 BCE). In the 7th and 8th centuries CE various systems of vocalic notation were developed to indicate vowels in the Biblical text. The most prominent, best preserved, and the only system still in use, is the Tiberian vocalization system, created by scholars known as Masoretes around 850 CE. There are also various extant manuscripts making use of less common vocalization systems (Babylonian, and Palestinian), known as \"superlinear vocalizations\" because their vocalization marks are placed above the letters. In addition, the Samaritan reading tradition is independent of these systems, and was occasionally notated with a separate vocalization system. These systems often record vowels at different stages of historical development; for example, the name of the Judge Samson is recorded in Greek as Σαμψών \"Sampsōn\" with the first vowel as /a/, while Tiberian שִמְשוֹן /ʃimʃon/ with /i/ shows the effect of the law of attenuation. All of these systems together are used to reconstruct the original vocalization of Biblical Hebrew.\n\nThe Tiberian vowel-sign \"šwa\" (ְ ) was used both to indicate lack of a vowel (\"quiescent šwa\") and as another symbol to represent the phoneme /ă/, also represented by \"ḥataf pataḥ\" (ֲ). Before a laryngeal-pharyngeal, mobile šwa was pronounced as an ultrashort copy of the following vowel, e.g. וּבָקְעָה [uvɔqɔ̆ʕɔ], and as [ĭ] preceding /j/, e.g. תְדֵמְּיוּ֫נִי /θăðammĭjuni/. By contrast, ḥataf pataḥ would only used be used when pronounced [ă]. In the Palestinian system these echo vowels were written with full vowel letters, see Pronunciation of šwa is attested by alternations in manuscripts like ארֲריך~ארְריך, ואשמֳעָה~ואשמְעָה. Use of ḥataf vowels was considered mandatory under gutturals but optional under other letters.\n\nAt an early stage, documents written in the paleo-Hebrew script were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for Biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nachmanides in his introduction to the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used from the beginning of the 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script.\n\nIn addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.\n\nWhile the Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian reading traditions are extinct, various other systems of pronunciation have evolved over time, notably the Yemenite, Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Samaritan traditions. Modern Hebrew pronunciation is also used by some to read Biblical texts. The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system; for instance, the Sephardic tradition's distinction between qamatz gadol and qatan is pre-Tiberian. However, the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19263080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19263080", "title": "Charset detection", "text": "Charset detection\n\nCharacter encoding detection, charset detection, or code page detection is the process of heuristically guessing the character encoding of a series of bytes that represent text. The technique is recognised to be unreliable and is only used when specific metadata, such as a HTTP Content-Type: header is either not available, or is assumed to be untrustworthy.\n\nThis algorithm usually involves statistical analysis of byte patterns, like frequency distribution of trigraphs of various languages encoded in each code page that will be detected; such statistical analysis can also be used to perform language detection. This process is not foolproof because it depends on statistical data.\n\nIn general, incorrect charset detection leads to mojibake.\n\nOne of the few cases where charset detection works reliably is detecting UTF-8. This is due to the large percentage of invalid byte sequences in UTF-8, so that text in any other encoding that uses bytes with the high bit set is \"extremely\" unlikely to pass a UTF-8 validity test. However, badly written charset detection routines do not run the reliable UTF-8 test first, and may decide that UTF-8 is some other encoding. For example, it was common that web sites in UTF-8 containing the name of the German city München were shown as MÃ¼nchen.\n\nUTF-16 is fairly reliable to detect due to the high number of newlines (U+000A) and spaces (U+0020) that should be found when dividing the data into 16-bit words, and the fact that few encodings use 16-bit words. This process is not foolproof; for example, some versions of the Windows operating system would mis-detect the phrase \"Bush hid the facts\" (without a newline) in ASCII as Chinese UTF-16LE.\n\nCharset detection is particularly unreliable in Europe, in an environment of mixed ISO-8859 encodings.

{"id": "1644807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1644807", "title": "Chroneme", "text": "Chroneme\n\nIn linguistics, a chroneme is a basic, theoretical unit of sound that can distinguish words by duration only of a vowel or consonant. The noun \"chroneme\" is derived from Greek χρόνος (chrónos, \"time\"), and the suffixed \"-eme\", which is analogous to the \"-eme\" in \"phoneme\" or \"morpheme\". However, the term does not have wide currency and may be unknown even to phonologists who work on languages claimed to have chronemes.\n\nMost languages have differences in length of vowels or consonants, but in the case of most languages it would not be treated phonemically or phonologically as distinctive or contrastive. Even in those languages which do have phonologically contrastive length, a chroneme is only posited in particular languages. Use of a chroneme views as being composed of two segments: and , whereas in a particular analysis, may be considered a single segment with length one of its features. This may be compared to the analysis of a diphthong like as a single segment or as the sequence of a vowel and consonant: .\n\nFor the purposes of analysis of a chronemic contrast, two words with different meaning that are spoken exactly the same except for length of one segment are considered a minimal pair.\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) denotes length by doubling the letter or by diacritics above or after the letters:\n\nAmerican English does not have minimal pairs indicating the existence of chronemes or may theoretically be said to have only one chroneme. Some other dialects such as Australian English have contrastive vowel length, but it is not analysed as the consequence of a chroneme.\n\nMany Indo-European languages, including Classical Latin, have distinctive length in consonants, for example in Italian:\n\nClassical Latin, German, some Italian dialects and Thai have distinctive length in vowels. For example, in Thai:\n\nOr consider, for example, the cŭ/cū minimal pair in the dialect spoken near Palmi (Calabria, Italy):\n\nAlmost all Uralic languages, such as Finnish, Hungarian and Estonian have a distinctive moraic chroneme as a phoneme (also arguably called archiphoneme or epenthetic vowel/consonant). The etymology of the vocalic chroneme has been traced to a voiced velar fricative in the hypothetical Proto-Uralic language, such that becomes . For example, \"taka-\" \"back-\", \"takka\" \"fireplace\" and \"taakka\" \"burden\" are unrelated words. It is also grammatically important; the third person marker is a chroneme (\"menee\" \"s/he goes\"), and often in the spoken Finnish of the Helsinki area there are grammatical minimal pairs, e.g. nominative \"Stadi\" \"Helsinki\" vs. partitive \"Stadii\" \"at Helsinki\".\n\nIn Finnish, Estonian and Sami languages, there are also two allophonic lengths of the chroneme, \"half-long\" and \"over-long\". For example, Finnish imperative \"anna!\" \"give!\" has a short vowel, \"oma \"own\" has a half-long vowel, and \"Annaa \"at Anna\" has an overlong vowel (without any distinctive tonal variation to distinguish these three). Estonian and Sami also have a three-way distinction in consonants, e.g. \"lina\" \"bed sheet\", \"linna\" (half-long 'n') \"of the city\", \"linna\" (over-long 'n') \"to the city\". Estonian, in which the phonemic opposition is the strongest, uses tonal contour as a secondary cue to distinguish the two; \"over-long\" is falling as in other Finnic languages, but \"half-long\" is rising.\n\nFinnish also denotes stress principally by adding more length (approximately 100 ms) to the vowel of the syllable nucleus. This means that Finnish has five different physical lengths. (The half-long vowel is a phonemically short vowel appearing in the second syllable, if the first—and thus stressed—syllable is a single short vowel.) The unstressed short vowels are about 40 ms in physical duration, the unstressed long vowels about 70 ms. The stress adds about 100 ms, giving short stressed as 130–150 ms and long stressed as 170–180 ms. The half-long vowel, which is always short unstressed, is distinctively longer than the standard 40 ms.\n\nJapanese is another language in which vowel length is distinctive. For example, \"biru\" is a foreign loan word (clipped from a longer form) that means \"building\" whereas \"bīru\" is a foreign loan word for \"beer\". Using a notion intuitive to a speaker of Japanese, it could be said that more than anything, what differentiates \"bīru\" from \"biru\" is an extra mora (or minimal vowel syllable) in the speech rhythm that signifies a lengthening of the vowel . However, upon observation one might also note a rise in pitch and intensity of the longer vowel. It could be said, also, that vowel lengthening—chronemic contrasts—nearly doubles Japanese's rather small inventory of vowel phonemes (though the occurrence of diphthongs also augments vowel counts). Due to native literacy practices, Japanese long vowels are often thought of as sequences of two vowels of the same quality (rather than one vowel of a greater quantity or length) since that is how they are sometimes written.\n\nIn the case of consonants of Japanese, if treated phonemically, a medial consonant might appear to double, thus creating a contrast, for example, between the word \"hiki\" (meaning 'pull' or 'influence') and \"hikki\" (meaning 'writing'). In terms of articulation and phonetics, the difference between the two words would be that, in the latter \"hikki\", the doubled closes the first syllable and is realized in the glottis as glottal plosive stop (with some anticipatory articulation evident in the velum of the mouth, where a is usually made) while starting the next syllable as a articulated and realized as the regular velar sound. In effect, this consonant doubling then adds one mora to the overall speech rhythm and timing. Hence, among other contrasts, the word \"hik-ki\" is felt to be one mora or beat longer than \"hi-ki\" by a speaker of Japanese. \n"}

The class of deterministic pushdown automata accepts the deterministic context-free languages, a proper subset of context-free languages.\n\nMachine transitions are based on the current state and input symbol, and also the current topmost symbol of the stack. Symbols lower in the stack are not visible and have no immediate effect. Machine actions include pushing, popping, or replacing the stack top. A deterministic pushdown automaton has at most one legal transition for the same combination of input symbol, state, and top stack symbol. This is where it differs from the nondeterministic pushdown automaton.\n\nA (not necessarily deterministic) PDA formula_1 can be defined as a 7-tuple:\n\nwhere\n\n\n\"M\" is \"deterministic\" if it satisfies both the following conditions:\n\nThere are two possible acceptance criteria: acceptance by \"empty stack\" and acceptance by \"final state\". The two are not equivalent for the deterministic pushdown automaton (although they are for the non-deterministic pushdown automaton). The languages accepted by \"empty stack\" are those languages that are accepted by \"final state\" and are prefix-free: no word in the language is the prefix of another word in the language.\n\nThe usual acceptance criterion is \"final state\", and it is this acceptance criterion which is used to define the deterministic context-free languages.\n\nIf formula_25 is a language accepted by a PDA formula_9, it can also be accepted by a DPDA if and only if there is a single computation from the initial configuration until an accepting one for all strings belonging to formula_25. If formula_25 can be accepted by a PDA it is a context free language and if it can be accepted by a DPDA it is a deterministic context-free language.\n\nNot all context-free languages are deterministic. This makes the DPDA a strictly weaker device than the PDA. For example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.\n\nRestricting the DPDA to a single state reduces the class of languages accepted to the LL(1) languages. In the case of a PDA, this restriction has no effect on the class of languages accepted.\n\nClosure properties of deterministic context-free languages (accepted by deterministic PDA by final state) are drastically different from the context-free languages. As an example they are (effectively) closed under complementation, but not closed under union. To prove that the complement of a language accepted by a deterministic PDA is also accepted by a deterministic PDA is tricky. In principle one has to avoid infinite computations.\n\nAs a consequence of the complementation it is decidable whether a deterministic PDA accepts all words over its input alphabet, by testing its complement for emptiness. This is not possible for context-free grammars (hence not for general PDA).\n\nGéraud Sénizergues (1997) proved that the equivalence problem for deterministic PDA (i.e. given two deterministic PDA A and B, is L(A)=L(B)?) is decidable, a proof that earned him the 2002 Gödel Prize. For nondeterministic PDA, equivalence is undecidable.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "30044172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30044172", "title": "Direct fire", "text": "Direct fire\n\nDirect fire refers to the launching of a projectile directly at a target within the line-of-sight of the firer. The firing weapon must have a sighting device and an unobstructed view to the target, which means no objects or friendly units can be between it and the target. A weapon engaged in direct fire exposes itself to return fire from the target. This is in contrast to indirect fire, which refers to firing a projectile on a ballistic trajectory or delivering munitions by guided or unguided missiles. Indirect fire does not need a direct line of sight to the target because the shots are normally directed by a forward observer. As such, indirect fire weapons can shoot over obstacles or friendly units and the weapons can be concealed from counter-battery fire.\n\nExamples of direct fire weapons include most ancient and modern weapons such as bows, handguns, rifles, machine guns, and recoilless rifles. The term is most often used in the context of artillery, such as howitzers and mortars.\n\nDirect fire remained the dominant method of operating artillery throughout most of human history, with indirect fire used for sieges and involving specific siege guns. Technological developments born of the Industrial Revolution and the development of technical practices in the late 19th Century led to an appreciation of indirect fire, although it was not until World War I that indirect fire supplanted direct fire as the primary method by which artillery supported the other combat arms. During World War II direct fire remained secondary to indirect fire, although it was used profusely in situations where indirect fire was less effective and new direct fire artillery such as anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns were developed.\n\nAfter World War II new technology continued to diminish the role of direct fire, however in several situations it remains a necessary function. One of these is the defense of fixed fortified areas, for example fire support bases, for which specific firing techniques and munitions such as Killer Junior and Beehive anti-personnel rounds were developed. Another is when artillery is forced to defend itself, such as in a surprise attack. This could be the result of rapid maneuvering by ground forces, an attack by airborne troops, or from the lack of defined front lines as found in counterinsurgency operations. Direct fire artillery can also be massed to counter a penetration by enemy tanks. In particular self-propelled artillery are ideally suited for this role on account of their mobility, armor protection, and faster rate of fire compared to other weapons. A final situation is in urban warfare, where locating the enemy can be difficult, the physical structures give the defenders better protection, and the risk of collateral damage is high. In these cases direct fire artillery can unleash tremendous firepower to precisely destroy enemy fortified positions.\n\n"}

Erdős offered a prize of $100 for proving the conjecture, or $50 for a counterexample; it is one of many conjectures of Erdős.\n\nIf the conjecture is false, a counterexample would take the form of a graph with minimum degree three having no power-of-two cycles. It is known through computer searches of Gordon Royle and Klas Markström that any counterexample must have at least 17 vertices, and any cubic counterexample must have at least 30 vertices. Markström's searches found four graphs on 24 vertices in which the only power-of-two cycles have 16 vertices. One of these four graphs is planar; however, the Erdős–Gyárfás conjecture is now known to be true for the special case of 3-connected cubic planar graphs \n\nWeaker results relating the degree of a graph to unavoidable sets of cycle lengths are known: there is a set \"S\" of lengths, with |\"S\"| = O(\"n\"), such that every graph with average degree ten or more contains a cycle with its length in \"S\" , and every graph whose average degree is exponential in the iterated logarithm of \"n\" necessarily contains a cycle whose length is a power of two .

{"id": "2112884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112884", "title": "FrameNet", "text": "FrameNet\n\nIn computational linguistics, FrameNet is a project housed at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California which produces an electronic resource based on a theory of meaning called\nframe semantics. FrameNet reveals for example that the sentence \"John sold a car to Mary\" essentially describes the same basic situation (semantic frame) as \"Mary bought a car from John\", just from a different perspective. A semantic frame can be thought of as a conceptual structure describing an event, relation, or object and the participants in it. The FrameNet lexical database contains over 1,200 semantic \"frames\", 13,000 \"lexical units\" (a pairing of a word with a meaning; polysemous words are represented by several \"lexical units\") and 202,000 example sentences. FrameNet is largely the creation of Charles J. Fillmore, who developed the theory of frame semantics that the project is based on, and was initially the project leader when the project began in 1997. Collin Baker became the project manager in 2000. The FrameNet project has been influential in both linguistics and natural language processing, where it led to the task of automatic Semantic Role Labeling.\n\nA frame is a schematic representation of a situation involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles. Examples of frame names are Being_born and Locative_relation. A frame in FrameNet contains a textual description of what it represents (a frame definition), associated frame elements, lexical units, example sentences, and frame-to-frame relations.\n\nFrame elements (FE) provide additional information to the semantic structure of a sentence. Each frame has a number of core and non-core FEs which can be thought of as semantic roles. Core FEs are essential to the meaning of the frame while non-core FEs are generally descriptive (such as time, place, manner, etc.).\n\nSome examples include:\n\n\nFrameNet includes shallow data on syntactic roles that frame elements play in the example sentences. For an example sentence like \"She was born about AD 460\", FrameNet would mark \"She\" as a noun phrase referring to the Child FE, and \"about AD 460\" as a noun phrase corresponding to the Time frame element. Details of how frame elements can be realized in a sentence are important because this reveals important information about the subcategorization frames as well as possible diathesis alternations (e.g. \"John broke the window\" vs. \"The window broke\")\nof a verb.\n\nLexical units (LU) are lemmas, with their part of speech, that evoke a specific frame. In other words, when a LU is identified in a sentence, that specific LU can be associated with its specific frame(s). For each frame, there are many LUs associated to one frame and many frames that share multiple LUs, this is typically the case with LUs that have multiple word senses. Alongside the frame, each lexical unit is associated with specific frame elements by means of the annotated example sentences.\n\nExample:\n\nLexical units that evoke the Complaining frame (or more specific perspectivized versions of it, to be precise), include the verbs \"complain\", \"grouse\", \"lament\", and others.\n\nFrames are associated with example sentences and frame elements are marked within the sentences. Thus the sentence\nis associated with the frame Being_born, while \"She\" is marked as the frame element Child and \"about AD 460\" is marked as Time.\nFrom the start, the FrameNet project has been committed to looking at evidence from actual language use as found in text collections like the British National Corpus. \nBased on such example sentences, automatic semantic role labeling tools are able to determine frames and mark frame elements in new sentences.\n\nFrameNet also exposes the statistics on the \"valences\" of the \"frames\", that is the number and the position of the \"frame elements\" within example sentences. The sentence\nfalls in the valence pattern\nwhich occurs two times in the example sentences in FrameNet,\nnamely in:\n\nFrameNet additionally captures relationships between different frames using relations. These include the following.\n\n\nFrameNet has proven useful in a number of computational applications, because computers need additional knowledge in order to recognize that \"John sold a car to Mary\" and \"Mary bought a car from John\" describe essentially the same situation, despite using two quite different verbs, different prepositions and a different word order. FrameNet has been used in applications like question answering, paraphrasing, recognizing textual entailment, and information extraction, either directly or by means of Semantic Role Labeling tools. The first automatic system for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL, sometimes also referred to as \"shallow semantic parsing\") was developed by Daniel Gildea and Daniel Jurafsky based on FrameNet in 2002. Semantic Role Labeling has since become one of the standard tasks in natural language processing, with the latest version (1.7) of FrameNet now fully supported in the Natural Language Toolkit.\n\nSince frames are essentially semantic descriptions, they are similar across languages, and several projects have arisen over the years that have relied on the original FrameNet as the basis for additional non-English FrameNets, for Spanish, Japanese, German, and Polish, among others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4206728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4206728", "title": "German dialects", "text": "German dialects\n\nGerman dialects concern dialects of German. They are dominated by the geographical spread of the High German consonant shift, and the dialect continua that connect German to the neighbouring varieties of Low Franconian (Dutch) and Frisian.\n\nThe varieties of German are conventionally grouped into Upper German, Central German and Low German; Upper and Central German form the High German subgroup. Standard German is a standardized form of High German, developed in the early modern period based on a combination of Central German and Upper German varieties.\n\nIn linguistics of German, German dialects are distinguished from varieties of Standard German.\n\n\nThe variation among the German dialects is considerable with only the neighbouring dialects being mutually intelligible. Low German, most Upper German, High Franconian dialects, and even some Central German dialects when spoken in their purest form, are not intelligible to people who know only Standard German. However, all German dialects belong to the dialect continuum of High German and Low German. In the past (roughly until the end of World War II), there was a dialect continuum of all the continental West Germanic languages because nearly any pair of neighbouring dialects were perfectly mutually intelligible.\n\nThe German dialect continuum is typically divided into High German and Low German. The terms derive from the geographic characteristics of the terrain where they are spoken rather than from social status accorded to them.\n\nLow German varieties (in Germany usually referred to as \"Platt\" or \"Plattdeutsch\") are considered dialects of the German language by some but a separate language by others (then often termed \"Low Saxon\"). Linguistically Low German (that is, Ingvaeonic) and Low Franconian (that is, Istvaeonic) dialects are grouped together because both did not participate in the High German consonant shift. Low German is further divided into Dutch Low Saxon, West Low German and East Low German.\n\nMiddle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League. It was the predominant language in Northern Germany, and several translations of the Bible were printed in Low German. This predominance changed in the 16th century. In 1534, the Luther Bible was printed by Martin Luther; this translation is considered to be an important step towards the evolution of the Early New High German. It aimed to be understandable to an ample audience and was based mainly on High German varieties. The Early New High German language gained more prestige than Low Saxon and became the language of science and literature. Other factors included the Hanseatic League losing its importance around the same time (as new trade routes to Asia and the Americas were established) and that the most powerful German states of that period were located in Middle and Southern Germany.\n\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were marked by mass education with the language of the schools being standard German. Today, Low Saxon could be divided in two groups: Low Saxon varieties with a sizable standard German influx, and varieties of standard German with a Low Saxon influence (Missingsch).\n\nToday Low Saxon dialects are still widespread, especially among the elderly in the Northern parts of Germany, many of these being able to understand and speak the language, but younger people in Northern Germany are at least able to understand these dialects, though not to speak them. The local media take care not to let the Low Saxon language die out, so there are several newspapers published entirely in this language; other newspapers at least have recurring articles in Low Saxon. The North German Broadcasting (Norddeutscher Rundfunk) also offers TV programs (e.g. \"Talk op Platt\") and radio programs in Low Saxon.\nOn the other hand, Northern Germany is considered to be the region where the purest Standard German is spoken, and in everyday life little influence of dialect is heard. Still, there are notable differences in pronunciation even among North German speakers, e.g. lengthening of vowels, differences in accentuation etc. There are also some North German expressions in use even in Standard High German, which are seldom heard in Southern parts (e.g. the word \"plietsch\" for \"intelligent\").\n\nHigh German, that is, Irminonic, is divided into Central German, High Franconian, and Upper German.\n\nCentral German dialects include Ripuarian, Moselle Franconian, Central Hessian, East Hessian, North Hessian, Thuringian, North Upper Saxon, Rhine Franconian, Lorraine Franconian, Silesian German, High Prussian, \nLausitzisch-neumärkisch and Upper Saxon. It is spoken in the southeastern Netherlands, eastern Belgium, Luxembourg, parts of France, and in Germany approximately between the River Main and the southern edge of the Lowlands. Modern Standard German is based on Central and Upper German, but the usual German term for modern Standard German is \"Hochdeutsch\", that is, High German.\n\nThe Moselle Franconian varieties spoken in Luxembourg have been officially standardized and institutionalized and are therefore usually considered a separate language known as Luxembourgish.\n\nHigh Franconian dialects are transitional dialects in between the two greater High German groups. High Franconian dialects include East Franconian and South Franconian.\n\nUpper German dialects include Alsatian, Swabian, Low Alemannic, Central Alemannic, High Alemannic, Highest Alemannic, Southern Austro-Bavarian, Central Austro-Bavarian and Northern Austro-Bavarian. They are spoken in parts of the Alsace, southern Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, and in the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Italy.\n\nWymysorys, Sathmarisch and Siebenbürgisch are High German dialects of Poland and Romania.\n\nThe High German varieties spoken by Ashkenazi Jews (mostly in Czarist Russia, then the former Soviet Union and Poland) have several unique features, and are usually considered as a separate language, Yiddish. It is the only Germanic language that does not use the Latin script as its standard script. Since it developed in the Danube area, there are some similarities with Central und Upper German dialects in this region.\nThe dialects of German that are or were primarily spoken in colonies or communities founded by German speaking people resemble the dialects of the regions the founders came from. For example, Pennsylvania German resembles dialects of the Palatinate, and Hutterite German resembles dialects of Carinthia, whereas Venezuelan \"Alemán Coloniero\" is a Low Alemannic variant.\n\nAmana German is a dialect of West Central German. It is spoken in the Amana Colonies in Iowa, which were founded by Inspirationalists of German origin. Amana is derived from Hessian, another West Central German dialect. Amana German is called \"Kolonie-Deutsch\" in Standard German.\n\nIn Brazil, the largest concentrations of German speakers, German Brazilians, are in Rio Grande do Sul, where Riograndenser Hunsrückisch was developed, especially in the areas of Santa Catarina, Paraná, and Espírito Santo, as well as in Petrópolis (Rio de Janeiro).\n\nLagunen-Deutsch is a variety of High German spoken in Chile.\n\nMost speakers of Lagunen-Deutsch live around Lake Llanquihue.\nLagunen-Deutsch has integrated elements of the Spanish language. This includes the integration of false cognates with the Spanish language, transferring the Spanish meanings into Lagunen-Deutsch.\n\nThe geographical origin of most or all speakers of Lagunen-Deutsch is Chile, to where the ancestors of the speakers immigrated from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nGerman was at one time the main language used in schools, churches and businesses in certain parts of Texas surrounding Austin and San Antonio. As of October 2013, the Texas German Dialect Project at the University of Texas is recording residual German dialect in central Texas. The dialect is characterised by a loss of lip-rounding on the // phoneme.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13804375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13804375", "title": "Grammaticality", "text": "Grammaticality\n\nIn theoretical linguistics, a speaker's judgement on the well-formedness of a linguistic utterance—called a grammaticality judgement—is based on whether the sentence is produced and interpreted in accordance with the rules and constraints of the relevant grammar. If the rules and constraints of the particular language are followed then the sentence is considered to be grammatical. In contrast, an ungrammatical sentence is one that violates the rules of the given language.\n\nLinguists use grammaticality judgements to investigate the syntactic structure of sentences. Generative linguists are largely of the opinion that for native speakers of natural languages, grammaticality is a matter of linguistic intuition, and reflects the innate linguistic competence of speakers. Therefore, generative linguistics attempts to predict grammaticality judgements exhaustively. On the other hand, for linguists who stress the role of social learning, in contrast to innate knowledge of language, such as Hopper 1987 there has been a gradual abandonment of talk about grammaticality in favour of acceptability.\n\nThe concept of grammaticality is closely tied to generative grammar, which has the goal of generating all and only the well-formed sentences in a given language.\n\nAccording to Chomsky, a speaker's grammaticality judgement is based on two factors:\n\n\nIn his study of grammaticality in the 1950s, Chomsky identified three criteria which cannot be used to determine whether or not a sentence is grammatical.\n\n\nTo illustrate this point, Chomsky created the nonsensical sentence in (1), which does not occur in any corpus, is not meaningful, and is not statistically probable. However, the form of this sentence is judged to be grammatical by many native speakers of English. Such grammaticality judgements reflect the fact that the structure of sentence (1) obeys the rules of English grammar. This can be seen by comparing sentence (1) with sentence (2). Both sentences have the same structure, and both are grammatically well-formed.\n\nA grammatical string is not necessarily meaningful, as exemplified by Chomsky's famous sentence ‘Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’. However, language speakers can still understand nonsensical strings by means of natural intonation. Speakers are able to recall them more easily than ungrammatical sentences. It is also suggested that speakers are supposed to have intuitions about grammaticality, which is determined by their competence on that language.\n\nAcceptability is the extent to which:\n\n\nOn the other hand, grammaticality is the extent to which a ‘string’ of language conforms with a set of given rules.\n\nIt is assumed that a native speaker's grammar generates grammatical strings and that the speaker also has the ability to judge whether this string is acceptable in that language. In practice, the two notions are frequently confounded and speakers are typically asked to give their ‘grammaticality judgements’ instead of ‘acceptability judgements’. Lyons 1968 defines grammaticality as \"that part of the acceptability of utterances which can be accounted for in terms of the rules\", a criterion that complements acceptability for semantic soundness. Grammaticality is defined by what a particular grammar can have as its output, while acceptability is speaker-oriented and depends upon what speakers will consider appropriate.\n\nHowever, there are still modern linguists who side with the more traditional categorical interpretation of grammaticality, such as Sprouse (2007).\nSpeakers' judgements of the well-formedness of sentences form a continuous spectrum. While many grammaticality judgements are categorical, with a given sentence judged as either 'grammatical' or 'ungrammatical', there are many sentences that fall in a grey area of partial acceptability. According to Jon Sprouse (2007), the difference between grammaticality and acceptability is that grammatical knowledge is categorical, but acceptability is a gradient scale.\n\nThe acceptability of a sentence is often reported in a variety of terms including acceptable, marginally acceptable, unacceptable, terrible, good etc. Degrees of acceptability are usually represented by symbols like *, ?,??, ?* etc., usually on a scale of 0-?-*-** (acceptable to unacceptable).\n\nNote that examples (3)-(8) are open to interpretability as intuition of grammaticality is somewhat based on intuition so the degrees of grammaticality may range from individual to individual. Some linguists believe that the informal use of these diacritics is problematic because the exact meaning of the symbols have never been properly defined, and their usage is riddled with inconsistencies.\n\nAcceptability is about the performance of speakers, that is, the actual use of their language in concrete situations. As stressed by Chomsky, acceptability does not mean grammaticality: while an acceptable sentence must be grammatical, a grammatical sentence does not need to be acceptable. For a sentence to be judged acceptable, it must also appear natural and appropriate in a given context, be easily understood and, possibly, be to a certain extent conventionalised.\n\nThe two need not match, below are two examples:\n\nGrammatical but not acceptable:\n\nAcceptable but not grammatical:\n\nExample (9) is grammatical yet unacceptable since sleeping is not something that can pragmatically be described as being done furiously. Although the syntactic structure is grammatical, the semantic meaning does not make sense according to the English lexicon.\n\nExample (10) is not grammatical because the same preposition (\"in\") is both maintained in its original position and stranded. This contravenes the rules of English which allows either the entire prepositional phrase \"in which\" to be relativized, as in (11a), or the object of the preposition which to be relativized, as in (11b). However, (11c) is acceptable because of the frequency with which people hear it.\n\nThat the relative acceptability of (11c) is related to a frequency affect is confirmed by the fact that ordinarily such sentences are judged to be ungrammatical, as shown in (12).\n\nThe prevailing models on grammaticality since Chomsky (1965) postulate that the acceptability of sentences is a scale, with clearly acceptable on one side, clearly unacceptable on the other, and all manner of ranges of partial acceptability in between. However, in spite of this linguists since Chomsky have tended to assume that grammaticality is categorical, or binary, and that a sentence either is or is not grammatical, with no partial grammaticality in between. To explain the scale of partial acceptability, these linguists have said that phenomena other than grammatical knowledge—such as plausibility, working memory limitations, etc.—account for speakers reporting acceptability on a scale. However, there are a few exceptions to this trend, including those who claim that \"strength of violation\" plays a role in grammaticality judgements. Examples of linguists of this persuasion include Huang's (1982) proposal that ECP violations are stronger than Subjacency violations, Chomsky's (1986) proposal that each barrier crossed leads to lower acceptability, and Optimality Theory (esp. Keller 2000, 2003).\n\nSubjacency says that you cannot relate two positions across two bounding nodes. In (13), we see that the movement of the wh-expression 'what' was moved past a CP and a TP to get to the Spec CP position- thus this phrase is ungrammatical.\n\nWithin the past twenty years however, there has been a major shift in linguists' understanding of intermediate levels of acceptability. This is due to the increasing use of experimental methods to measure acceptability, making it possible to detect subtle differences along a scale of acceptability. Keller (2000) and Fanselow et al. (2004) are two proponents of this new way to construe grammaticality.\n\nPrescriptive grammars of controlled natural languages define grammaticality as a matter of explicit consensus. On this view, to consider a string as grammatical, it should conform with a set of norms. These norms are usually based on conventional rules that form a part of a higher/literary register for a given language. For some languages, these norms are defined and periodically updated by an appointed body of experts whose rulings are occasionally questioned by the frustrated members of the public.\n\nThere are several methods that successfully investigate sentence processing, some of which include eye tracking, self-paced listening and reading, or cross-modal priming. The most productive method however, is real-time grammaticality judgements. A grammaticality judgement is a test which involves showing participants sentences that are either grammatical or ungrammatical. The participant must decide whether or not they find the sentences to be grammatical as quickly as possible. Grammaticality is cross-linguistic, so this method has therefore been used on a wide variety of languages Grammaticality judgements are largely based on an individual's linguistic intuition, and it has been pointed out that humans have the ability to understand as well as produce an infinitely large number of new sentences that have never been seen before. This allows us to accurately judge a sentence grammatical or ungrammatical, even if it is a completely novel sentence.\n\n(Catt 1988) and (Catt and Hirst 1990) created a model of grammaticality based around a computer program developed for computer-assisted language instruction which was designed to perform automatic error diagnosis and correction of ungrammaticalities produced by second-language\nlearners. The program classified errors made by language-learners in their sentences as being due to errors in phrase structure, transformations, morphology, verb subcategorization, or by the languages-learners translating their primary language directly into the language they are learning. The program worked primarily by utilizing a parser which consisted of constraints which, if a first parsing attempt failed, could be selectively relaxed. Thus, for a given parse, the constraints which were relaxed indicated the precise nature and location of ungrammaticality.\n\nThere have been experiments conducted in order to test how early speakers gain the ability to judge grammaticality in their native language. In an experiment by Cairns et al., preschool children aged 4–6 were presented sentences such as (15) and (16) orally. (To make sure that the meaning of the sentences was clear to the children, sentences were enacted with toys.) While sentence (15) is well-formed in the adult grammar, sentence (16) is not, as indicated by the asterisk (*). The source of the ill-formedness is that the verb \"hug\" is a transitive verb and so must have a direct object, namely something or someone who receives the action of the verb. Sentence (16) is missing the receiver of \"hug\".\n\nThe results of this study show that the earliest age at which children can discriminate well-formed from ill-formed sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years. During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, there is a significant increase in the accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since metalinguistic skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the psycholinguistic ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute whether it can or cannot generate the target sentence. This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic grammar skills have been established, and is related to early reading acquisition—acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of syntactic awareness.\n\nLate learners of L2 perform worse on grammaticality judgment tasks or tests than native speakers or early acquirers, in that L2 learners are more likely to accept a sentence that is ungrammatical as grammatical. After the critical period, age of acquisition is no longer supposed to have an effect, and native-like performance is no longer supposed to be achievable. However, the idea that there is a critical period for the acquisition of syntactic competence, which is reflected by the ability to assess the well-formedness of a sentence, is controversial. On one view, biological or language-specific mechanisms become non-functional after a certain age. On another view, decreased L2 learning ability with age is not inevitable, and can be explained by factors such as motivation, learning environment, pressure, and time commitment. Although there is evidence that supports the claim that speakers outside the L2 mastery age range are not capable of acquiring native-like mastery of a language, there is also evidence supporting the opposite, as well as evidence for young learners not mastering an L2.\n\nGeneral processing problems, rather than a deficit in some syntax specific process or module, offer a viable explanation for populations that exhibit poor grammatical performance. Performance on L2 grammaticality judgments might be partially due to variable accessibility to and use of relevant grammatical knowledge. Difficulties in basic level cognitive processing are due to:\nThese issues have been tied to grammatical processing performance by testing native speakers of English on the same tasks under stressful conditions: there is shown to be difficulty in grammatical agreement when memory capacity is curtailed, important cues in the language when given noisy input, and processing important structures when not given enough time to process input. This shows that knowledge cannot always be automatically and consistently applied under stressful situations without having processing difficulties. However, these issues are not necessarily independent of each other, as low decoding ability of structure could affect processing speed. Overall, individual differences in L2 working memory and decoding ability are correlated to grammaticality judgment accuracy and latencies. However, there is no correlation between speed of processing measure and grammaticality judgment performance, age of arrival correlates with syntactic mastery, and knowledge of vocabulary probably drives grammaticality performance.\n\nAge for decrease of L2 grammaticality performance varies from early childhood to late adolescence, depending on the combinations of the speaker's first and second language. The age of acquisition at which L2 learners are worse than native speakers depends on how dissimilar the L1 and L2 are on phonological and grammatical level. For example, Chinese/English bilinguals at 7 years old perform just as well as Spanish/English bilinguals at 16 years old. This is due to the fact that a grammatical construction on an L2 that has a parallel structure in an L1 would impose less processing demand than one that does not have a parallel, causing a poorer performance on language structure.\n\nThere is evidence for late L2 learners generally having issues with plurals and past tense, and not so many issues with Subject-Verb-Object testing, in which they show native-like results; there is better performance on Yes/No as well as Wh- questions than on articles and past tense.\n\nThere is data supporting high-performing late learners well beyond the critical period: in an experiment testing grammaticality by J. L. McDonald, 7/50 L2 English late-learner subjects had scores within range of native speakers. The results are linked to how individual differences in L2 memory capacity, decoding, or processing speed affect processing resources to automatically apply the relevant grammatical knowledge.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "313075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313075", "title": "Identity politics", "text": "Identity politics\n\nIdentity politics are political positions based on the interests and perspectives of social groups with which people identify. Identity politics includes the ways in which people's politics are shaped by aspects of their identity through loosely correlated social organizations. Examples include social organizations based on age, religion, social class or caste, culture, dialect, disability, education, ethnicity, language, nationality, sex, gender identity, generation, occupation, profession, race, political party affiliation, sexual orientation, settlement, urban and rural habitation, and veteran status.\n\nThe term \"identity politics\" has been in use in various forms since the 1960s or 1970s, but has been applied with, at times, radically different meanings by different populations.\n\nThe term \"identity politics\" has been used in political discourse since at least the 1970s. One aim of identity politics has been for those feeling oppressed by and actively suffering under systemic social inequities to articulate their suffering and felt oppression in terms of their own experience by processes of consciousness-raising and collective action. One of the older written examples of it can be found in the April 1977 statement of the black feminist group, Combahee River Collective, which was subsequently reprinted in a number of anthologies, and Barbara Smith and the Combahee River Collective have been credited with coining the term. For example, in their terminal statement, they said: \nIdentity politics, as a mode of categorizing, are closely connected to the ascription that some social groups are oppressed (such as women, ethnic minorities, and sexual minorities); that is, the claim that individuals belonging to those groups are, by virtue of their identity, more vulnerable to forms of oppression such as cultural imperialism, violence, exploitation of labour, marginalization, or powerlessness. Therefore, these lines of social difference can be seen as ways to gain empowerment or avenues through which to work towards a more equal society.\n\nSome groups have combined identity politics and Marxist social class analysis and class consciousness — the most notable example being the Black Panther Party — but this is not necessarily characteristic of the form. Another example is MOVE, members of which mixed black nationalism with anarcho-primitivism (a radical form of green politics based on the idea that civilization is an instrument of oppression, advocating the return to a hunter gatherer society). Identity politics can be left wing or right wing, with examples of the latter being Ulster Loyalism, Islamism and Christian Identity movements.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the politics of identity became very prominent and it was linked to a new wave of social movement activism.\n\nThe mid-2010s have seen a marked rise of identity politics, including white identity politics in the United States. This phenomenon is attributed to increased demographic diversity and the prospect of whites becoming a minority in America. Such shifts have driven many to affiliate with conservative causes including those not related to diversity. This includes the presidential election of Donald Trump, who won the support of prominent white supremacists such as David Duke and Richard B. Spencer (which Trump disavowed.)\n\nThe term \"identity politics\" has been applied and misapplied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. discussed identity politics extensively in his 1991 book \"The Disuniting of America\". Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of civil rights, argues that a liberal democracy requires a common basis for culture and society to function. Rather than seeing civil society as already fractured along lines of power and powerless (according to race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc), Schlesinger suggests that basing politics on group marginalization is itself what fractures the civil polity, and that identity politics therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization. Schlesinger believes that \"movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than...perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference\". \n\nBrendan O'Neill has similarly suggested that identity politics causes (rather then simply recognizes and acts on) political schisms along lines of social identity. Thus, he contrasts the politics of gay liberation and identity politics by saying \"... [Peter] Tatchell also had, back in the day, ... a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview—which has nothing to do with the world—from any questioning.\" In these and other ways, a political perspective oriented to one's own well being can be recast as causing the divisions that it insists upon making visible.\n\nIn this same vein, author Owen Jones argues that identity politics often marginalize the working class, saying that: \n\nThe gay liberation movement of the late 1960s through the mid-1980s urged lesbians and gay men to engage in radical direct action, and to counter societal shame with gay pride. In the feminist spirit of the personal being political, the most basic form of activism was an emphasis on coming out to family, friends and colleagues, and living life as an openly lesbian or gay person. While the 1970s were the peak of \"gay liberation\" in New York City and other urban areas in the United States, \"gay liberation\" was the term still used instead of \"gay pride\" in more oppressive areas into the mid-1980s, with some organizations opting for the more inclusive, \"lesbian and gay liberation\". While women and transgender activists had lobbied for more inclusive names from the beginning of the movement, the initialism LGBT, or \"Queer\" as a counterculture shorthand for LGBT, did not gain much acceptance as an umbrella term until much later in the 1980s, and in some areas not until the '90s or even '00s. During this period in the United States, identity politics were largely seen in these communities in the definitions espoused by writers such as self-identified, \"black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother\" Audre Lorde's view, that lived experience matters, defines us, and is the only thing that grants authority to speak; that, \"If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive.\"\n\nBy the 2000s, in some areas of postmodern queer studies, notably those around gender, the idea of \"identity politics\" began to shift away from that of naming and claiming lived experience, and authority arising from lived experience, to one emphasizing choice and performance. Some who draw on the work of authors like Judith Butler, stress the importance of not assuming an already existing identity, but of remaking and unmaking identities through \"performance\". Writers in the field of Queer theory have at times taken this to the extent as to now argue that \"queer\", despite generations of specific use, no longer needs to refer to any specific sexual orientation at all; that it is now only about disrupting the mainstream, with author David M. Halperin arguing that straight people may now also self-identify as \"queer,\" which some believe, is a form of cultural appropriation which robs gays and lesbians of their identity and makes invisible and irrelevant the actual, lived experience that causes them to be marginalized in the first place. \"It desexualizes identity, when the issue is precisely about a sexual identity.\"\n\nThere are also supporters of identity politics who have developed their stances on the basis of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's work (namely, \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\") and have described some forms of identity politics as strategic essentialism, a form which has sought to work with hegemonic discourses to reform the understanding of \"universal\" goals.\n\nSome critics argue that groups based on a particular shared identity (e.g. race, or gender identity) can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, similar to the history of divide and rule strategies. Sociologist Charles Derber asserts that the American left is \"largely an identity-politics party\" and that it \"offers no broad critique of the political economy of capitalism. It focuses on reforms for blacks and women and so forth. But it doesn’t offer a contextual analysis within capitalism.\" Both he and David North of the Socialist Equality Party posit that these fragmented and isolated identity movements which permeate the left have allowed for a far-right resurgence. Critiques of identity politics have also been expressed on other grounds by writers such as Eric Hobsbawm, Todd Gitlin, Michael Tomasky, Richard Rorty, Sean Wilentz, Robert W. McChesney, and Jim Sleeper. Hobsbawm, in particular, has criticized nationalisms, and the principle of national self-determination adopted internationally after World War I, since national governments are often merely an expression of a ruling class or power, and their proliferation was a source of the wars of the 20th century. Hence, Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as queer nationalism, Islamism, Cornish nationalism or Ulster Loyalism are just other versions of bourgeois nationalism. The view that identity politics rooted in challenging racism, sexism, and the like actually obscures class inequality is widespread in the United States and many other Western nations; however, this framing ignores how class-based politics are identity politics themselves.\n\nIn her journal article \"Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color,\" Kimberle Crenshaw treats identity politics as a process that brings people together based on a shared aspect of their identity. Crenshaw applauds identity politics for bringing African Americans (and other non-white people), gays and lesbians, and other oppressed groups together in community and progress. However, Crenshaw also points out that frequently groups come together based on a shared political identity but then fail to examine differences among themselves within their own group: \"The problem with identity politics is not that it fails to transcend differences, as some critics charge, but rather the opposite—that it frequently conflates or ignores intragroup differences.\" Crenshaw argues that when society thinks \"black\", they think black \"male\", and when society thinks feminism, they think \"white\" woman. When considering black women, at least two aspects of their identity are the subject of oppression: their race and their sex. Crenshaw proposes instead that identity politics are useful but that we must be aware of intersectionality and the role it plays in identity politics. Nira Yuval-Davis supports Crenshaw's critiques in \"Intersectionality and Feminist Politics\" and explains that \"Identities are individual and collective narratives that answer the question 'who am/are I/we?\" \n\nIn her journal article  \"Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color\", Crenshaw provides the example of the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill controversy to expand on her point. Anita Hill came forward and accused Supreme Court Justice Nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment; Clarence Thomas would be the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court. Crenshaw argues that when Anita Hill came forward she was deemed anti-black in the movement against racism, and though she came forward on the feminist issue of sexual harassment, she was excluded because when considering feminism, it is the narrative of white middle-class women that prevails. Crenshaw concludes that acknowledging intersecting categories when groups unite on the basis of identity politics is better than ignoring categories altogether.\n\nA \"Le Monde\"/\"IFOP\" poll in January 2011 conducted in France and Germany found that a majority felt Muslims are ‘‘scattered improperly’’; an analyst for \"IFOP\" said the results indicated something ‘‘beyond linking immigration with security or immigration with unemployment, to linking Islam with a threat to identity’’.\n\n"}

{"id": "49375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49375", "title": "Larynx", "text": "Larynx\n\nThe larynx (), commonly called the voice box, is an organ in the top of the neck of tetrapods involved in breathing, producing sound, and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. The larynx houses the vocal folds, and manipulates pitch and volume, which is essential for phonation. It is situated just below where the tract of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus. The word larynx (plural larynges) comes from a similar Ancient Greek word (λάρυγξ \"lárynx\").\n\nIn adult humans, the larynx is found in the anterior neck at the level of the C3–C7 vertebrae. It connects the inferior part of the pharynx (hypopharynx) with the trachea. The laryngeal skeleton consists of six cartilages: three single (epiglottic, thyroid and cricoid) and three paired (arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform). The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx, though the larynx is suspended from the hyoid. The larynx extends vertically from the tip of the epiglottis to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. Its interior can be divided in supraglottis, glottis and subglottis.\n\nThere are six cartilages, three unpaired and three paired, that support the mammalian larynx and form its skeleton.\n\nUnpaired cartilages:\nPaired cartilages:\n\nThe muscles of the larynx are divided into \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" muscles.\n\nThe intrinsic muscles are divided into respiratory and the phonatory muscles (the muscles of phonation). The respiratory muscles move the vocal cords apart and serve breathing. The phonatory muscles move the vocal cords together and serve the production of voice. The extrinsic, passing between the larynx and parts around; and intrinsic, confined entirely. The main respiratory muscles are the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. The phonatory muscles are divided into adductors (lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, arytenoid muscles) and tensors (cricothyroid muscles, thyroarytenoid muscles).\n\nThe intrinsic laryngeal muscles are responsible for controlling sound production.\n\nNotably the only muscle capable of separating the vocal cords for normal breathing is the posterior cricoarytenoid. If this muscle is incapacitated on both sides, the inability to pull the vocal folds apart (abduct) will cause difficulty breathing. Bilateral injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve would cause this condition. It is also worth noting that all muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus except the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external laryngeal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (a branch of the vagus).\n\nAdditionally, intrinsic laryngeal muscles present a constitutive Ca-buffering profile that predicts their better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles. This profile is in agreement with their function as very fast muscles with a well-developed capacity for prolonged work. Studies suggests that mechanisms involved in the prompt sequestering of Ca (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-reuptake proteins, plasma membrane pumps, and cytosolic Ca-buffering proteins) are particularly elevated in laryngeal muscles, indicating their importance for the myofiber function and protection against disease, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Furthermore, differential levels of Orai1 in rat intrinsic laryngeal muscles and extraocular muscles over the limb muscle suggests a role for store operated calcium entry channels in those muscles' functional properties and signaling mechanisms.\n\nThe extrinsic laryngeal muscles support and position the larynx within the mid-cervical region. [trachea.]\n\n\nThe larynx is innervated by branches of the vagus nerve on each side. Sensory innervation to the glottis and laryngeal vestibule is by the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle. Motor innervation to all other muscles of the larynx and sensory innervation to the subglottis is by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. While the sensory input described above is (general) visceral sensation (diffuse, poorly localized), the vocal fold also receives general somatic sensory innervation (proprioceptive and touch) by the superior laryngeal nerve.\n\nInjury to the external laryngeal nerve causes weakened phonation because the vocal folds cannot be tightened. Injury to one of the recurrent laryngeal nerves produces hoarseness, if both are damaged the voice may or may not be preserved, but breathing becomes difficult.\n\nIn newborn infants, the larynx is initially at the level of the C2–C3 vertebrae, and is further forward and higher relative to its position in the adult body. The larynx descends as the child grows.\n\nSound is generated in the larynx, and that is where pitch and volume are manipulated. The strength of expiration from the lungs also contributes to loudness.\n\nManipulation of the larynx is used to generate a source sound with a particular fundamental frequency, or pitch. This source sound is altered as it travels through the vocal tract, configured differently based on the position of the tongue, lips, mouth, and pharynx. The process of altering a source sound as it passes through the filter of the vocal tract creates the many different vowel and consonant sounds of the world's languages as well as tone, certain realizations of stress and other types of linguistic prosody. The larynx also has a similar function to the lungs in creating pressure differences required for sound production; a constricted larynx can be raised or lowered affecting the volume of the oral cavity as necessary in glottalic consonants.\n\nThe vocal folds can be held close together (by adducting the arytenoid cartilages) so that they vibrate (see phonation). The muscles attached to the arytenoid cartilages control the degree of opening. Vocal fold length and tension can be controlled by rocking the thyroid cartilage forward and backward on the cricoid cartilage (either directly by contracting the cricothyroids or indirectly by changing the vertical position of the larynx), by manipulating the tension of the muscles within the vocal folds, and by moving the arytenoids forward or backward. This causes the pitch produced during phonation to rise or fall. In most males the vocal folds are longer and with a greater mass than most females' vocal folds, producing a lower pitch.\n\nThe vocal apparatus consists of two pairs of mucosal folds. These folds are false vocal folds (vestibular folds) and true vocal folds (folds). The false vocal folds are covered by respiratory epithelium, while the true vocal folds are covered by stratified squamous epithelium. The false vocal folds are not responsible for sound production, but rather for resonance. The exceptions to this are found in Tibetan Chant and Kargyraa, a style of Tuvan throat singing. Both make use of the false vocal folds to create an undertone. These false vocal folds do not contain muscle, while the true vocal folds do have skeletal muscle.\n\nThe most important role of the larynx is its protecting function; the prevention of foreign objects from entering the lungs by coughing and other reflexive actions. A cough is initiated by a deep inhalation through the vocal folds, followed by the elevation of the larynx and the tight adduction (closing) of the vocal folds. The forced expiration that follows, assisted by tissue recoil and the muscles of expiration, blows the vocal folds apart, and the high pressure expels the irritating object out of the throat. Throat clearing is less violent than coughing, but is a similar increased respiratory effort countered by the tightening of the laryngeal musculature. Both coughing and throat clearing are predictable and necessary actions because they clear the respiratory passageway, but both place the vocal folds under significant strain.\n\nAnother important role of the larynx is abdominal fixation, a kind of Valsalva maneuver in which the lungs are filled with air in order to stiffen the thorax so that forces applied for lifting can be translated down to the legs. This is achieved by a deep inhalation followed by the adduction of the vocal folds. Grunting while lifting heavy objects is the result of some air escaping through the adducted vocal folds ready for phonation.\n\nAbduction of the vocal folds is important during physical exertion. The vocal folds are separated by about during normal respiration, but this width is doubled during forced respiration.\n\nDuring swallowing, elevation of the posterior portion of the tongue levers (inverts) the epiglottis over the glottis' opening to prevent swallowed material from entering the larynx which leads to the lungs, and provides a path for a food or liquid bolus to \"slide\" into the esophagus; the hyo-laryngeal complex is also pulled upwards to assist this process. Stimulation of the larynx by aspirated food or liquid produces a strong cough reflex to protect the lungs.\n\nIn addition, intrinsic laryngeal muscles are spared from some muscle wasting disorders, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, may facilitate the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in a variety of clinical scenarios. ILM have a calcium regulation system profile suggestive of a better ability to handle calcium changes in comparison to other muscles, and this may provide a mechanistic insight for their unique pathophysiological properties\n\nThere are several things that can cause a larynx to not function properly. Some symptoms are hoarseness, loss of voice, pain in the throat or ears, and breathing difficulties. Larynx transplant is a rare procedure. The world's first successful operation took place in 1998 at the Cleveland Clinic, and the second took place in October 2010 at the University of California Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.\n\nPioneering work on the structure and evolution of the larynx was carried out in the 1920s by the British comparative anatomist Victor Negus, culminating in his monumental work \"The Mechanism of the Larynx\" (1929). Negus, however, pointed out that the descent of the larynx reflected the reshaping and descent of the human tongue into the pharynx. This process is not complete until age six to eight years. Some researchers, such as Philip Lieberman, Dennis Klatt, Brant de Boer and Kenneth Stevens using computer-modeling techniques have suggested that the species-specific human tongue allows the vocal tract (the airway above the larynx) to assume the shapes necessary to produce speech sounds that enhance the robustness of human speech. Sounds such as the vowels of the words see and do, [i] and [u], (in phonetic notation) have been shown to be less subject to confusion in classic studies such as the 1950 Peterson and Barney investigation of the possibilities for computerized speech recognition.\n\nIn contrast, though other species have low larynges, their tongues remain anchored in their mouths and their vocal tracts cannot produce the range of speech sounds of humans. The ability to lower the larynx transiently in some species extends the length of their vocal tract, which as Fitch showed creates the acoustic illusion that they are larger. Research at Haskins Laboratories in the 1960s showed that speech allows humans to achieve a vocal communication rate that exceeds the fusion frequency of the auditory system by fusing sounds together into syllables and words. The additional speech sounds that the human tongue enables us to produce, particularly [i], allow humans to unconsciously infer the length of the vocal tract of the person who is talking, a critical element in recovering the phonemes that make up a word.\n\nMost tetrapod species possess a larynx, but its structure is typically simpler than that found in mammals. The cartilages surrounding the larynx are apparently a remnant of the original gill arches in fish, and are a common feature, but not all are always present. For example, the thyroid cartilage is found only in mammals. Similarly, only mammals possess a true epiglottis, although a flap of non-cartilagenous mucosa is found in a similar position in many other groups. In modern amphibians, the laryngeal skeleton is considerably reduced; frogs have only the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages, while salamanders possess only the arytenoids.\n\nVocal folds are found only in mammals, and a few lizards. As a result, many reptiles and amphibians are essentially voiceless; frogs use ridges in the trachea to modulate sound, while birds have a separate sound-producing organ, the syrinx.\n\nThe ancient Greek physician Galen first described the larynx, describing it as the \"first and supremely most important instrument of the voice\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3449686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3449686", "title": "Speech error", "text": "Speech error\n\nA speech error, commonly referred to as a slip of the tongue (Latin: lapsus linguae, or occasionally self-demonstratingly, lipsus languae) or misspeaking, is a deviation (conscious or unconscious) from the apparently intended form of an utterance. They can be subdivided into spontaneously and inadvertently produced speech errors and intentionally produced word-plays or puns. Another distinction can be drawn between production and comprehension errors. Errors in speech production and perception are also called performance errors. Some examples of speech error include sound exchange or sound anticipation errors. In sound exchange errors the order of two individual morphemes is reversed, while in sound anticipation errors a sound from a later syllable replaces one from an earlier syllable. Slips of the tongue are a normal and common occurrence. One study shows that most people can make up to as much as 22 slips of the tongue per day.\n\nSpeech errors are common among children, who have yet to refine their speech, and can frequently continue into adulthood. When errors continue past the age of 9 they are referred to as \"residual speech errors\" or RSEs. They sometimes lead to embarrassment and betrayal of the speaker's regional or ethnic origins. However, it is also common for them to enter the popular culture as a kind of linguistic \"flavoring\". Speech errors may be used intentionally for humorous effect, as with Spoonerisms.\n\nWithin the field of psycholinguistics, speech errors fall under the category of language production. Types of speech errors include: exchange errors, perseveration, anticipation, shift, substitution, blends, additions, and deletions. The study of speech errors has contributed to the establishment/refinement of models of speech production since Victoria Fromkin's pioneering work on this topic.\n\nSpeech errors are made on an occasional basis by all speakers. They occur more often when speakers are nervous, tired, anxious or intoxicated. During live broadcasts on TV or on the radio, for example, nonprofessional speakers and even hosts often make speech errors because they are under stress. Some speakers seem to be more prone to speech errors than others. For example, there is a certain connection between stuttering and speech errors. Charles F. Hockett explains that \"whenever a speaker feels some anxiety about possible lapse, he will be led to focus attention more than normally on what he has just said and on what he is just about to say. These are ideal breeding grounds for stuttering.\" Another example of a \"chronic sufferer\" is Reverend William Archibald Spooner, whose peculiar speech may be caused by a cerebral dysfunction, but there is much evidence that he invented his famous speech errors (spoonerisms).\n\nAn outdated explanation for the occurrence of speech errors is that of Sigmund Freud, who assumed that speech errors are the result of an intrapsychic conflict of concurrent intentions. \"Virtually all speech errors [are] caused by the intrusion of repressed ideas from the unconscious into one's conscious speech output\", Freud explained. This gave rise to the expression Freudian slip. His hypothesis was rejected because it only explains a minority of speech errors.\n\nThere are few speech errors that clearly fall into only one category. The majority of speech errors can be interpreted in different ways and thus fall into more than one category. For this reason, percentage figures for the different kinds of speech errors may be of limited accuracy. Moreover, the study of speech errors gave rise to different terminologies and different ways of classifying speech errors. Here is a collection of the main types:\nSpeech errors can affect different kinds of segments or linguistic units:\n\n\n\nSpeech production is a highly complex and extremely rapid process so that research into the involved mental mechanisms is very difficult. Investigating the audible output of the speech production system is a way to understand these mental mechanisms. According to Gary S. Dell \"the inner workings of a highly complex system are often revealed by the way in which the system breaks down\". Therefore, speech errors are of an explanatory value with regard to the nature of language and language production.\n\nPerformance errors may provide the linguist with empirical evidence for linguistic theories and serve to test hypotheses about language and speech production models. For that reason, the study of speech errors is significant for the construction of performance models and gives insight into language mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the information that can be obtained is the use of \"um\" or \"uh\" in a conversation. These might be meaningful words that tell different things, one of which is to hold a place in the conversation so as not to be interrupted. There seems to be a hesitant stage and fluent stage that suggest speech has different levels of production. The pauses seem to occur between sentences, conjunctional points and before the first content word in a sentence. That suggests that a large part of speech production happens there.\n\nSchachter et al. (1991) conducted an experiment to examine if the numbers of word choices affect pausing. They sat in on the lectures of 47 undergraduate professors from 10 different departments and calculated the number and times of filled pauses and unfilled pauses. They found significantly more pauses in the humanities departments as opposed to the natural sciences. These findings suggest that the greater the number of word choices, the more frequent are the pauses, and hence the pauses serve to allow us time to choose our words.\n\nSlips of the tongue are another form of \"errors\" that can help us understand the process of speech production better. Slips can happen at many levels, at the syntactic level, at the phrasal level, at the lexical semantic level, at the morphological level and at the phonological level and they can take more than one form like: additions, substations, deletion, exchange, anticipation, perseveration, shifts, and haplologies M.F. Garrett, (1975). Slips are orderly because language production is orderly.\n\nThere are some biases shown through slips of the tongue. One kind is a lexical bias which shows that the slips people generate are more often actual words than random sound strings. Baars Motley and Mackay (1975) found that it was more common for people to turn two actual words to two other actual words than when they do not create real words. This suggests that lexemes might overlap somewhat or be stored similarly.\n\nA second kind is a semantic bias which shows a tendency for sound bias to create words that are semantically related to other words in the linguistic environment. Motley and Baars (1976) found that a word pair like \"get one\" will more likely slip to \"wet gun\" if the pair before it is \"damp rifle\". These results suggest that we are sensitive to how things are laid out semantically.\n\nAlthough the roots of misspeaking roots lie in Middle English and earlier, since the 1980s the word has been used increasingly in politics to imply that errors made by a speaker are accidental and should not be construed as a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the facts of a case. As such, its usage has attracted a degree of media coverage, particularly from critics who feel that the term is overly approbative in cases where either ignorance of the facts or intent to misrepresent should not be discarded as possibilities.\n\nThe word was used by a White House spokesman after George W. Bush seemed to say that his government was always \"thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people\", and more famously by then American presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who recalled landing in at the US military outpost of Tuzla \"under sniper fire\" (in fact, video footage demonstrates that there were no such problems on her arrival). Other users of the term include American politician Richard Blumenthal, who incorrectly stated on a number of occasions that he had served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n"}

The university and jury who awarded the degree were harshly criticised, though both they and Teissier had supporters and defenders.\n\nOn April 7, 2001, Elizabeth Teissier defended her thesis entitled \"Situation épistémologique de l'astrologie à travers l'ambivalence fascination-rejet dans les sociétés postmodernes\" (\"The Epistemological Situation of Astrology in Relation to the Ambivalent Fascination/Rejection of Postmodern Societies\") – accounts of the defense have been published. Her studies at the University of Paris Descartes (a member of the Sorbonne University alliance), were under the supervision of Michel Maffesoli, an Emeritus Professor of Sociology. The central idea of the thesis was described by \"The New York Times\" as being that astrology is being oppressed by science, which Teissier called \"official science\" and \"monolithic thought\". Teissier argued, however, that her work is devoid of bias and had \"focused only on the misunderstanding that astrology as a multimillennial knowledge vehicle\" provokes. Her prepared statement was enthusiastically received by her supporters, but there was also a declaration from the editor-in-chief of \"Science et Vie Junior\" that what was occurring was a \"farce\". At end of the defense, the jury deliberated only briefly before Serge Moscovici admitted Teissier to her doctoral degree with the \"very honourable\" distinction.\n\nControversy erupted in the scientific community following the decision, and several sociologists also publicly challenged its legitimacy. The university was criticised for granting the degree, as was the jury, along with Teissier's statements in support of astrology as a science, though the university rejected accusations of \"irresponsibility\". A petition signed by over 370 sociologists was sent to Professor Pierre Daumard, the President of the university; he responded that the Teissier had complied with all university requirements and it is not his place to question the \"guarantees of the scientific validity of the thesis\" from the independent jury. Daumard also defended that astrology is a legitimate subject for sociological study for its impact on society, a point on which Teissier's critics agreed. These critics were themselves criticised for their \"incendiary\" complaints which targeted her personally for her astrological beliefs instead of based on her thesis. Critics were also described as engaging in a witch-hunt whose true target was the academic reputation of Michel Maffesoli. Maffesoli addressed the controversy in an email on 23 April 2001, acknowledging that the thesis included some \"slippages\" but minimising the importance of these errors. Maffesoli added that there is a \"manhunt\" against him and more broadly against scientific and intellectual rigor in \"diverse approaches to sociology\", but still engaged with critics such as Christian Baudelot at an ASES-organised symposium on the Teissier affair. Maffesoli did state during the defense that he had tried to keep Teissier focused on the sociological impact of astrology rather than discussing its scientific legitimacy, while still maintaining that the thesis demonstrated sufficient sociological significance to justify awarding the doctorate.\n\nOnce the thesis was available following the defense, the Association française pour l'information scientifique (AFIS) organised for a group to critique the thesis; the analysis was published by a multi-disciplinary group (two experts in pseudoscience, including the editor of the AFIS \"Science et pseudo-sciences\", three astrophysicists, two sociologists, and a philosopher) on 6 August 2001. They looked at the scientific, philosophical, and sociological aspects of Teissier's thesis, describing it as \"not a thesis in sociology but actually pro-astrological advocacy\". They concluded that the Teissier's work did not meet the requirements of scientific rigor of doctoral research, regardless of the discipline in question. They described the jury as having accepted the thesis \"in defiance of basic academic requirements of objectivity and intellectual honesty\" in part because the AFIS group's multidisciplinary analysis shows that \"no relevant standard (analytical rigor, objectivity, indication of sources, style of writing, etc.) had truly been fulfilled\". They comment all Teissier has achieved is to \"demonstrate once again that [astrology] does not deserve the status of an intellectual discipline that can be taught in a university course\". According to the journal \"Skepter\", the \"thesis pretends to provide irrefutable proof that astrology is a science, but the author has no idea what constitutes a scientific proof, she is muddleminded about basic astronomical and astrological facts, and the \"pièce de resistance\" of her argument consists of statements about Michel Gauquelin which can only be called lies.\" Examples of excerpts from the thesis which bear this out, according to Broch, include unsupported medical claims, fundamental errors in astronomy, and a lack of proper evidence. Teissier was \"completely appalled\" that a \"tiny group\" would question the award of her doctorate and did not exclude the possibility of suing the AFIS, who published the critique of her thesis, after its \"intolerable attack\" on academic freedom.\n\nDiscussion of the circumstances of Teissier's doctorate occurred and continues to occur with the context of the science wars, a dispute which pitted humanities academics taking postmodernist perspectives against scientists taking positivist and rationalist approaches. In particular, comparisons have been made to the Sokal hoax, in that each case exemplifies the alleged support for pseudoscience and hostility to science within postmodernist circles. The emphatic language and personalised tone of the debate around Teissier's work was fuelled by the broader ongoing conflict, as was the targeting of Maffesoli and the description of the university as \"heavily influenced by so-called \"post-modern\" ideologists\" (emphasis in original). It also explains criticisms of the jury for its failure to seek input from scientists (a bone of contention in the science wars), and the unusually personalised tone of comments such as that Teissier, \"very astutely, has taken advantage of the \"intellectual weakness\" and/or \"incompetence\" of ... the nincompoops who accepted to ratify such nonsense\" (bold emphases from original omitted).\n"}

{"id": "504676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=504676", "title": "Torres Strait Creole", "text": "Torres Strait Creole\n\nTorres Strait Creole (also \"Torres Strait Pidgin, Yumplatok, Torres Strait Brokan/Broken, Cape York Creole, Lockhart Creole, Papuan Pidgin English, Broken English, Brokan/Broken, Blaikman, Big Thap, Pizin, Ailan Tok\") is an English-based creole language spoken on several Torres Strait Islands (Queensland, Australia), Northern Cape York and South-Western Coastal Papua. It has approximately 25,000 mother-tongue and bi/tri-lingual speakers, as well as several second/third-language speakers. It is widely used as a language of trade and commerce.\nTorres Strait Creole has six main dialects: Papuan, Western-Central, TI, Malay, Eastern, and Cape York. Its main characteristics show that it is a Pacific Pidgin, but the future in \"X [i] go VERB\" aligns it with Atlantic Creoles. Related languages are Pijin of the Solomon Islands, Tok Pisin of Papua New Guinea, and Bislama of Vanuatu. The other creoles of Australia (such as Roper River Kriol and Australian Kriol language) are more distantly related, being descendants of the Pidgin English that developed in and around Sydney after the colonisation of Australia.\n\nRecords of pidgin English being used in Torres Strait exist from as early as the 1840s (e.g. Moore 1979), and therefore Torres Strait Creole may very well be as old as, if not older, than its sister languages, and not a descendant of any of these. The main importers of the pidgin were British and other sailors, many of whom were South Sea Islanders, both Melanesian and Polynesian, as well as Island South-East Asians, Jamaicans, Cantonese Chinese, Japanese, and others. Therefore, Torres Strait Creole has various characteristics of these different types of Pidgin, the main ones being mid- to late 1800s Malay-area Pidgin English (but not Singlish, one of its modern representatives), Pacific Pidgin and Jamaican Patois. It may have creolised quite early (pre-1900) on Darnley Island, and somewhat later (post-1910) at St Pauls on Moa and on Yorke Island in the Central Islands. Creolisation is post-1960s elsewhere.\n\nThe Papuan dialect was replaced by Hiri Motu in many parts of its former territory, which in turn is being replaced by Tok Pisin.\n\nDialects differ mainly from the influences in the various areas the language is spoken or by the language of the ethnic groups that use the language as well as a certain amount of superstrata influence from English. Apart from accent and intonation, differences are mainly vocabulary used for local fauna, flora and so on, retentions from local indigenous languages or other substrata languages (such as Malay) and minor differences in pronunciation because of substrata influences.\n\nThe dialects group generally into the Western-Central-Cape York dialects where the western and central language of Torres Strait (Kala Lagaw Ya) has a strong influence (an influence which is also 'over-powering' other sub-strata influences), 'TI' Brokan with a strong Malay/Indonesian-Filipino-European influence, Eastern Brokan with a South Seas and Meriam Mìr influence, and Papuan, with influences from languages such as Agöb, Bine, Gizrra, Wipi, Kiwai, Motu and (now) Tok Pisin. Influences from other languages such as Japanese are to do with vocabulary specific to Japanese (or the like) items.\n\nTorres Strait Creole exists as part of a lect continuum: a local language, a local language mix called Ap-ne-Ap, a pidgin basilect creole, a mesolect creole called Torres Strait (Thursday Island) English, and General Australian English, as this example shows:\n\nThe language has the following vowels (with some dialectal difference as well):\nVowel length for the language as a whole is non-contrastive, though in some subdialects/dialects it appears to be contrastive.\n\nThe dental-alveolar contrast exists in the Western, Central and Cape York dialects, however only exists in other dialects in so far as either English or Western-Central influences force a contrast, or where the voiced alveolar stop realises as the rhotic tap (e.g. Western-Central \"wasamada\" 'what's the matter/what's wrong', Eastern/Papuan \"wasamara\"). In the Papuan dialects, the only alveolar consonant is , while and can be either dental (i.e. fall together with and ) or alveolar, according to local language. In Meriam influenced Broken, is dental, while is alveolar.\n\nThe stops , , , , and are aspirated and also have fricative allophones, particularly (thus , , , , , ) while and vary in pronunciation when word initial and medial between and , with only appearing at the ends of words in Torres Strait and Papuan dialects. These reflect indigenous language allophony as well as a rationalisation of the larger English (and Malay, etc.) consonant phoneme inventory. The consonants , , , , , , and do not have any major allophonic variation, while varies between .\n\nThe following are the forms of the personal pronouns in the Western-Central-Cape York dialects. Where the Eastern dialect is concerned, the dental-alveolar contrast is on the whole non-operative, and the dual forms are less commonly used than elsewhere. Furthermore, the 1-2 form \"yumi\" is often used as the general non-singular 1-2 form; and is sometimes used as such in other dialects in rhetorical discourse. The Central Islands dialect (and sometimes others) tends to also use \"wi\" for the 1st person plural.\n\nThe non-identfying 3rd plural \"òl\" is also found as a nominal plural marker:\n\nThere is a strong tendency for \"dhiswan\" and its forms to be used to the exclusion of \"dhaswan\".\n\nThree interrogatives and the two deictics have two forms, this being (interrogatives) a reduced clause initial form and a fuller clause final form, and in the case of the deitics, a pre-clitic and independent form, as in the following examples:\n\n\nClause position variation(initial, final)\nPre-clitic vs independent form:\n\nTwo interrogatives have variant words/forms, used interchangeably:\n\nDialectal variation is only found in two forms:\n\nThe language has no indefinite article, and uses the definite article much less than it is in English, having a more demonstrative feel than the English equivalent. There are singular, dual and plural forms:\nThe demonstrative articles have a general form, and a specific dual form, as well as variation, with a strong tendency to use the clitics \"iya\" and \"dhea\" to specify position; the definitie articles are often used with the demonstrative clitics to express the demonstrative articles :\n\nTorres Strait Creole is a somewhat atypical of Pidgin-Creole languages in its word order and various other syntactic (and grammatical) properties. Though the normal sentence word order is the expected transitive S-V-O-X(-) and intransitive S-V-X(-), there is variation in the form of S-X-V(-O), such as where the directional adverbs \"dhe\" 'there' and \"ia/ya\" 'here' come before the verb, as happens in all local languages (this is in common with virtually all verb tense/aspect/mood markers in the language).\n\nThe four sentences in Torres Strait Creole carry a semantic difference difficult to show in the English translation. \"Plein i dhe go plai\" is the basic sentence — 'the plane is flying [away] over there'. \"Plein i plai dhe go\" is more along the lines of 'the plane is flying away that way'; \"plein i plai go dhea\" is 'the plane is flying away heading that way', and finally \"plein i dhe plai go\" is 'the plane is there flying away'.\nUnlike Tok Pisin, Bislama and the Australian creoles, \"-pla\" is not used as an adjective formant.\n\nWhen not before the referent, adjectives are often suffixed by -wan, the adjective nominaliser, or by an appropriate nominal, such as \"man\" 'man, person'\n\nVerbs can be marked for transitivity and voice (transitive-passive or intransitive-antipassive), but not person, tense, aspect or mood. Voice marking is for the transitive-passive, and made by suffixing \"-e\" to the verb stem when the object follows the verb, and \"-em\" when the object is elsewhere in the clause. Note that the suffix \"-em\" is of fairly recent development, and is in origin an abbreviation of the verb phrase form \"VERB-e em\", where the cross referencing pronoun em and the suffix have coalesced (via \"-i em\" → \"-yem\" → \"-em\"). All these versions exist in everyday speech. The verb mentioned below is \"tek\" 'to take': intransitive-antipassive \"tek\", transitive-passive \"teke\", \"teki em\", \"tekyem\", \"tekem\":\nThe development of a full passive using this form also exists:\n\nIf the verb stem has \"e\" or a diphthong, then the transitive suffix is -e; if \"i\" or \"u\", then it can become -i, while of the stem contains \"a\" or \"o\", the suffix can become -a. One or two others verbs have stem extensions to form the verb from a noun:\n\nVerb stems that end in vowels do not take the suffix, while a few verbs are irregular in not taking the suffix:\n\nCertain verbs of position and movement are not followed by a preposition in their most normal clause types. These are not to be confused with transitive clauses:\n\nFour derivational suffixes exist which add aspectual meaning to verb stems. Though their origin are English intransitive prepositions, in Torres Strait Creole their status is completely aspectual; they can only be used as suffixes. They are suffixes to the stem of intransitive verbs, and to the full transitive-passive form of transitive verbs. When used as transitive-passive verbs, they also suffix the transitive ending after the suffix. They also derive verbs from other words.\n\nTorres Strait Creole shows strong substrata influence in its use of its prepositions. All local languages are either prepositionless case-marking agglutinative languages, or case-marking agglutinative languages where the case endings have evolved to postposition status, which contrast the following cases to varying extents, but which have little or no number marking on nouns:\nThey also contrast the following derived forms (among others according to language), which are not case forms in the local languages, but rather nominals:\n\n\nThe use of the prepositions in Torres Strait Creole reflect these cases and nominalisations to a certain (= simplified) extent:\n\nblo — genitive: <br> We aus blo misnari? \"Where is the priest’s house?\"\n\npò, lo — dative (in part dialect variation): <br> Em i bin spik pò em se wesis bl’em pinis kam. \"She told her her wages had already arrived.\"<br> Bos i bi gibi wesis pò/lo mi. \"The boss gave the wages to me.\"\n\nprom – ablative: <br> ’San i dhe kam prom Dhaudhai. \"This one is coming over from Papua.\"\n\nlo, we, ene — locative, perlative (lo and we are synonyms, and ene is an archaic word now normally found only in old songs): <br> Aus blo Ama blo mi i stanap dhe antap lo / we il ananith lo / we big mango dhe antap. \"My Aunty’s house is up there on the hill underneath the big mango up there.\" <br> Yu mas kam wantaim lo mi. \"You must/have to come with me.\" <br> Dhemtu baradha i sidaun ene [lo/we] kenu \"The two brothers were sitting in the canoe.\"\n\nlo — instrumental: <br> Òl man i kate tœtœl lo naip lo bele / lo ath \"The men cut (butcher) the turtle with a knife on the bottom shell\".\n\nòlsem, waze (waze is the somewhat more common reduced form of òlsem) – similative (like): <br> Dhempla lo Mari Ailan i no tòk waze yumpla. \"The people on Murray Island don’t talk like us.\" <br> Em i dhe swim go waze aligeta. \"He’s swimming away over there like a crocodile.\"\n\nThe prepositions also have syntactic uses, including the following, where they govern verbs or adjectives:\n\nBlo: obligation <br> Ai blo go nau \"I have to go now / I’m supposed to go now\".\n\nPò: a) focus on a goal <br> Bos i kam pò luk wòk blo yumi. \"The boss has come to see / look at our work.\" <br> b) extra intensity <br> Dhem pipol blo Saibai i pò dans! \"The Saibai people can really dance!\" <br> Ai pò taiad nau! \"I’m getting really tired!\"\n\nProm: avoidance <br> Smòl gel i prait prom dog i baite em. \"The little girl is afraid that the dog will bite her\"\n\nlo, prom — comparative (dialect variation): <br> Dhis dhangal ia i mò big prom/lo nadhawan dhea \"This dugong is bigger than that one\".\n\nWe: relative clause <br> Aus we Ama i stap i antap lo il we i gad wan big mango. \"The house where Aunty lives is on the hill where there is a big mango.\" <br> Boi we yumi bin paitem i krai go Ama bl'em. \"The boy that/who we fought went off crying to his Mum.\" <br> Òl pipol we i wande gud wòk i mas lane ingglis \"Everyone who wants a good job has to learn English.\"\n\nWaze (òlsem): in order, so that <br> Bos i kam waze em i ken luk òl wòk blo yumi. \"The Boss is coming so that he can see our work.\"\n\nThe language has vocabulary from various sources, though the dominant source language is English.

{"id": "254647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254647", "title": "Veps language", "text": "Veps language\n\nThe Veps language (also known as Vepsian, natively as \"vepsän kel’, vepsän keli,\" or \"vepsä\"), spoken by the Vepsians (also known as \"Veps\"), belongs to the Finnic group of the Uralic languages. Closely related to Finnish and Karelian, Veps is also written using Latin script.\n\nAccording to Soviet statistics, 12,500 people were self-designated ethnic Veps at the end of 1989.\n\nAccording to the location of the people, the language is divided into three main dialects: Northern Veps (at Lake Onega to the south of Petrozavodsk, to the north of the river Svir, including the former Veps National Volost), Central Veps (in the Saint Petersburg region and Vologda Oblast), and Southern Veps (in the Saint Petersburg region). The Northern dialect seems the most distinct of the three; however, it is still mutually intelligible for speakers of the other two dialects. Speakers of the Northern dialect call themselves \"Ludi\" (\"lüdikad\"), or \"lüdilaižed\".\n\nIn Russia, more than 350 children learn the Vepsian language in a total of 5 national schools.\n\nVeps is the easternmost surviving member of the Finnic languages. Having developed in relative isolation, the language lacks several features found in its relatives, such as consonant gradation and the length contrast in consonants. Original vowel length has mostly been lost as well (with the exception of Northern Veps, which retains \"ii\" and \"uu\"). At the same time, it retains a number of archaic features.\n\nThe closest relative of Veps is Ludic, connecting Veps to the wider Finnic dialect continuum.\n\nVeps also shows some characteristic innovations such as the vocalization of original syllable-final*l, and the expansion of the local case system.\n\nVeps shows substantial dialectal variation, affecting both phonetics and grammatical features. Three main dialect areas can be distinguished, the northern, central and southern dialects.\n\nNorthern Veps is spoken in the Republic of Karelia along the coast of Lake Onega south of Petrozavodsk. It is also spoken in a few small villages in Leningrad Oblast. Villages speaking Northern Veps include Shyoltozero, Rybreka, and Kvartsitny, as well as the city of Petrozavodsk itself.\n\nCharacteristics of Northern Veps are:\n\nCentral Veps dialects are rather distinct from each other compared to Northern and Southern Veps, which are relatively homogeneous. They are spoken around a long line stretching from Tervenichey in the Lodeinopolsky District of Leningrad Oblast, to near Lake Beloye. The largest locality speaking Central Veps dialects is Vinnitsy.\n\nCharacteristics of Central Veps are:\n\nSouthern Veps is spoken in the Boksitogorsky District of Leningrad Oblast, including the villages of Radogoshcha and Sidorovo.\n\nCharacteristics of Southern Veps are:\n\nIn general, palatalizable consonants are palatalized allophonically before a front vowel. However, palatalized consonants also occur in other environments, especially in word-final position or in word-final clusters.\n\nThere are some cases where the front vowel is preceded by a non-palatalized consonant. In native Finnic vocabulary, this occurs where inflectional endings beginning with are attached to words with a stem ending in a non-palatalized consonant. The consonant is not palatalized by in this case, but remains non-palatalized by analogy with the other inflected forms. The vowel is backed to in this case, as in Russian, making it unclear whether the palatalization is a consequence of the front vowel, or the backing is the result of the lack of palatalization. Either analysis is possible.\n\nCompare:\n\nRussian loanwords have also introduced instances of non-palatalized consonants followed by , which are much more frequent in that language.\n\nThe status of is marginal; it occurs as an allophone of after a non-palatalized consonant. See above under \"Palatalization\" for more information. It does not occur in the first syllable of a word.\n\nLike many other Finnic languages, Veps has vowel harmony but in a much more limited form. Words are split into back-vowel and front-vowel words based on which vowels they contain:\n\n\nHowever, the front vowels can only occur in the first two syllables of a word. In a third or later syllable, and also sometimes in the second syllable, they are converted to the corresponding back vowel. Thus, vowel harmony only applies (inconsistently) in the second syllable, and has been lost elsewhere. It is not applied for inflectional endings except in a few exceptional cases, but is retained more frequently in derivational endings.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe modern Vepsian alphabet is a Latin alphabet. It consists of a total of twenty-nine characters: twenty-two are from the basic modern Latin alphabet, six are derived from basic Latin letters by the addition of diacritical marks, and the final character is the apostrophe, which signifies palatalization of the preceding sound.\n\nVeps orthography is largely phonemic, and represents each phoneme with one letter. Palatalized consonants are single phonemes, and thus the combination of a letter and a following apostrophe is a single combined letter for this purpose. The following table shows the correspondences between letters and phonemes:\n\nPalatalization of consonants before front vowels is not indicated in the orthography, so plain consonant letters can represent both types of consonant depending on what vowel follows. For a following letter , this is ambiguous, however: it can be preceded by both types of consonants, as noted above in the phonology section. Whether a consonant before the letter is palatalized or not cannot be determined from the orthography and must be learned for each word.\n\nLike other Finnic languages, Veps is an agglutinating language. The preservation of the Proto-Finnic weak-grade consonants \"*d\" and \"*g\" in all positions, along with the loss of consonant gradation, has made Veps morphology relatively simple compared to the other Finnic languages. There are fewer inflectional classes, and inflections of nominals and verbs alike can be predicted from only a few basic principal parts.\n\nVeps has twenty-three grammatical cases, more than any other Finnic language. It preserves the basic set of Finnic cases shared by most Finnic languages, including the six locative cases, but several more cases have been added that generally have no counterpart in the others.\n\nNotes:\n\nNouns have four principal parts, from which all other noun forms can be derived by replacing the endings:\nThe illative singular stem is the same as the genitive singular stem, except that the final vowel is dropped in some cases. The vowel is retained if \"at least one\" of these is the case, and dropped otherwise:\n\nThus:\nIf the genitive singular stem has \"h\" before the final vowel, then the ending \"-ze\" (\"-že\" after \"i\") is used, and the vowel is never dropped:\n\nVeps has innovated a special reflexive conjugation, which may have middle voice or passive voice semantics. The endings are as follows:\n\nInfinitives:\n\nParticiples:\n\nThe original Finnic present active participle is falling out of use, and is preserved only for a few verbs, as \"-b\" (stem \"-ba-\").\n\nThe personal pronouns are of Finno-Ugric origin:\n\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, a village green was common grassland at the centre of a rural settlement used for grazing with a pond for watering cattle and other stock.\n\nThe village green also provided, and may still provide, an open-air meeting place for the local people, which may be used for public celebrations such as May Day festivities. The term is used more broadly to encompass woodland, moorland, sports grounds, buildings and roads.\n\nSome historical village greens have been lost as a result of the agricultural revolution and urban development. Greens are now most likely to be found in the older villages of mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, and older areas of the United States. Town expansion in the mid-20th century led in England to the formation of local conservation societies, often centring on village green preservation, as celebrated and parodied in The Kinks' album \"The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society\". The Open Spaces Society is a present-day UK national campaigning body which continues this movement.\n\nThe term may apply to urban parks. In the United States, the most famous example of a town green is probably the New Haven Green in New Haven, Connecticut. New Haven was founded by settlers from England and was the first planned city in the United States. Originally used for grazing livestock, the Green dates from the 1630s and is well preserved today despite lying at the heart of the city centre. The largest green in the U.S. is a mile in length, and can be found in Lebanon, Connecticut. One of the most unusual is the Dartmouth Green in Hanover, New Hampshire, which was owned and cleared by the college in 1770. The college, not the town, still owns it and surrounded it with buildings as a sort of collegiate quadrangle in the 1930s, although its origin as a town green remains apparent.\nA fine example of a traditional American town green exists in downtown Morristown, NJ. The Morristown Green dates from 1715 and has hosted events ranging from executions to clothing drives.\n\nApart from the general use of the term, \"village green\" has a specific legal meaning in England and Wales, and also includes the less common term \"town green\". Town and village greens were defined in the Commons Registration Act 1965, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, as land:\n\nRegistered greens are now governed by the Commons Act 2006, but the fundamental test of whether land is a town and village green remains the same. Thus land can become a village green if it has been used for twenty years without force, secrecy or request (\"nec vi, nec clam, nec precario\"). Village green legislation is often used to try to frustrate development. Recent case law (\"Oxfordshire County Council vs Oxford City Council and Robinson\") makes it clear that registration as a green would render any development which prevented continuing use of the green as a criminal activity under the Inclosure Act 1857 and the Commons Act 1876. This leads to some most curious areas being claimed as village greens, sometimes with success. Recent examples include a bandstand, two lakes and a beach.\n\nThe Open Spaces Society states that in 2005 there were about 3,650 registered greens in England covering and about 220 in Wales covering about .\n\nA notable example of a village green is that in the village of Finchingfield in Essex, England, which is said to be \"the most photographed village in England\". The green dominates the village, and slopes down to a duck pond, and is occasionally flooded after heavy rain. The small village of Car Colston in Nottinghamshire, England, has two village greens, totaling 29 acres (12 ha).\n\nSome greens that used to be a common or otherwise at the centre of a village have been swallowed up by a city growing around them. Sometimes they become a city park or a square, and manage to maintain a sense of place. London has several of these: Newington Green is a good example, with Newington Green Unitarian Church anchoring the northern end.\n\nThere are two places in the United States called Village Green: Village Green-Green Ridge, Pennsylvania, and Village Green, New York. Some New England towns, along with some areas settled by New Englanders such as the townships in the Connecticut Western Reserve, refer to their town square as a village green. The village green of Bedford, New York, is preserved as part of Bedford Village Historic District. The only village green in the United States still used for agriculture lies in Lebanon, Connecticut. This green is also one of the largest in the nation.\n\nIn Indonesia, especially in Java, a similar place is called \"Alun-Alun\". It is a central part of Javanese village architecture and culture.\n\nThe northern part of the province of Drenthe in the Netherlands is also known for its village greens. Zuidlaren is the village with the largest number of village greens in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Błonia Park, originally established in the Middle Ages, is an example of a large village green in Kraków, Poland.\n\n\n"}
