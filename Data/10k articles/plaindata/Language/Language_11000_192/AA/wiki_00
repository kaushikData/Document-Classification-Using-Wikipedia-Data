{"id": "3757615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3757615", "title": "Adomnán", "text": "Adomnán\n\nAdomnán or Adamnán of Iona (, ; 624  – 704), also known as Eunan (), was an abbot of Iona Abbey ( 679–704), hagiographer, statesman, canon jurist, and saint. He was the author of the most important book on the life of his cousin St Columba and the promulgator of the Law of Adomnán or \"Law of Innocents\" ().\n\nAdomnán was born about 624, a relative on his father's side of Columba. He was the son of Rónán mac Tinne by Ronat, a woman from the Northern Uí Néill lineage known as the \"Cenél nÉnda\". Adomnán's birthplace was Raphoe, a town in County Donegal in Ulster. Some of Adomnán's childhood anecdotes seem to confirm at least an upbringing in this area.\n\nIt is thought that Adomnán may have begun his monastic career at a Columban monastery called Druim Tuamma, but any Columban foundation in northern Ireland or Dál Riata is a possibility, although Durrow is a stronger possibility than most. He probably joined the Columban \"familia\" (i.e. the federation of monasteries under the leadership of Iona Abbey) around the year 640. Some modern commentators believe that he could not have come to Iona until sometime after the year 669, the year of the accession of Fáilbe mac Pípáin, the first abbot of whom Adomnán gives any information. However, Richard Sharpe argues that he probably came to Iona during the abbacy of Ségéne (d. 652). Whenever or wherever Adomnán received his education, Adomnán attained a level of learning rare in Early Medieval Northern Europe. It has been suggested by Alfred Smyth that Adomnán spent some years teaching and studying at Durrow, and while this is not accepted by all scholars, it remains a strong possibility.\n\nIn 679, Adomnán became the ninth abbot of Iona after Columba. Abbot Adomnán enjoyed a friendship with King Aldfrith of Northumbria. In 684, Aldfrith had been staying with Adomnán in Iona. In 686, after the death of Aldfrith's brother King Ecgfrith of Northumbria and Aldfrith's succession to the kingship, Adomnán was in the Kingdom of Northumbria on the request of King Fínsnechta Fledach of Brega in order to gain the freedom of sixty Gaels who had been captured in a Northumbrian raid two years before.\n\nAdomnán, in keeping with Ionan tradition, made several more trips to the lands of the English during his abbacy, including one the following year. It is sometimes thought, after the account given by Bede, that it was during his visits to Northumbria, under the influence of Abbot Ceolfrith, that Adomnán decided to adopt the Roman dating of Easter that had been agreed some years before at the Synod of Whitby. Bede implies that this led to a schism at Iona, whereby Adomnán became alienated from the Iona brethren and went to Ireland to convince the Irish of the Roman dating. Jeffrey Wetherill sees Adomnan's long absences from Iona as having led to something of an undermining of his authority; he was thus unable to persuade the monks to adopt the Roman dating of Easter, let alone the tonsure. It is clear that Adomnán did adopt that Roman dating, and moreover, probably did argue the case for it in Ireland.\n\nIt is generally believed that in 697, Adomnán promulgated the \"Cáin Adomnáin\", meaning literally the \"Canons\" or \"Law of Adomnán\". The \"Cáin Adomnáin\" was promulgated amongst a gathering of Irish, Dál Riatan and Pictish notables at the Synod of Birr. It is a set of laws designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of non-combatants in warfare. For this reason it is also known as the \"Law of Innocents\".\n\nAdomnán's most important work, and the one for which he is best known, is the \"Vita Columbae\" (i.e. \"Life of Columba\"), a hagiography of Iona's founder, Saint Columba, probably written between 697 and 700. The format borrows to some extent from Sulpicius Severus' \"Life of Saint Martin of Tours\". Adamnan adapted traditional forms of Christian biography to group stories about Columba thematically rather than chronologically, and present Columba as comparable to a hero in Gaelic mythology. Wetherill suggests that one of the motivations for writing the Vita was to offer Columba as a model for the monks, and thereby improve Adomnan's standing as abbot. The biography is by far the most important surviving work written in early medieval Scotland, and is a vital source for our knowledge of the Picts, as well as a great insight into the life of Iona and the early medieval Gaelic monk.\n\nHowever, the \"Vita\" was not his only work. Adomnán also wrote the treatise \"De Locis Sanctis\" (i.e. \"On Holy Places\"), an account of the great Christian holy places and centres of pilgrimage. Adomnán got much of his information from a Frankish bishop called Arculf, who had personally visited the Egypt, Rome, Constantinople and the Holy Land, and visited Iona afterwards. Adomnán gave a copy to the scholar-king Aldfrith of Northumbria (685-704). Also attributed to him is a good deal of Gaelic poetry, including a celebration of the Pictish King Bridei's (671-93) victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain (685).\n\nAdomnán died in 704, and became a saint in Scottish and Irish tradition, as well as one of the most important figures in either Scottish or Irish history. His death and feast day are commemorated on 23 September. Along with St. Columba, he is joint patron of the Diocese of Raphoe, which encompasses the bulk of County Donegal in the north west of Ireland. The Cathedral of St. Eunan and St. Columba (popularly known as St. Eunan's Cathedral), the Catholic cathedral in that diocese, is in Letterkenny.\n\nIn his native Donegal, the saint has given his name to several institutions and buildings including:\nIn Co. Sligo, just to the south, he is venerated as the founder of Skreen Abbey, now the site of the C. of I. church of Skreen Parish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its members practice all forms of communication design, including graphic design, typography, interaction design, branding and identity. The organization's aim is to be the standard bearer for professional ethics and practices for the design profession. There are currently over 22,000 members and 73 chapters, and more than 200 student groups around the United States.\n\nIn 1911, Frederic Goudy, Alfred Stieglitz, and W. A. Dwiggins came together to discuss the creation of an organization that was committed to individuals passionate about communication design. In 1913, president of the National Arts Club, John G. Agar, announced the formation of The American Institute of Graphic Arts during the eighth annual exhibition of “The Books of the Year.” The National Arts Club was instrumental in the formation of AIGA in that they helped to form the committee to plan to organize the organization. The committee formed included Charles DeKay and William B. Howland and officially formed the American Institute of Graphic Arts in 1914. Howland, publisher and editor of \"The Outlook\", was elected president. The goal of the group was to promote excellence in the graphic design profession through its network of local chapters throughout the country.\n\nIn 1920, AIGA began awarding medals to \"individuals who have set standards of excellence over a lifetime of work or have made individual contributions to innovation within the practice of design.\" Winners have been recognized for design, teaching, writing or leadership of the profession and may honor individuals posthumously.\n\nIn 1982, the New York Chapter was formed and the organization began creating local chapters to decentralize leadership.\n\nRepresented by Washington, D.C. arts advocate and attorney, James Lorin Silverberg, Esq., The Washington, D.C. Chapter of AIGA, was organized as the American Institute of Graphic Arts, Incorporated, Washington, D.C. on September 6, 1984.\n\nThe AIGA, in collaboration with the US Department of Transportation, produced 50 standard symbols to be used on signs \"in airports and other transportation hubs and at large international events\". The first 34 symbols were published in 1974, receiving a Presidential Design Award. The remaining 16 designs were added in 1979.\n\nIn 2012, AIGA replaced all its competitions with a single competition called \"Cased\" (formerly called \"Justified\"). The stated aim of the competition is to demonstrate \"the collective success and impact of the design profession by celebrating the best in contemporary design through case studies\".\n\nBetween 1941 and 2011 AIGA sponsored a juried contest for the 50 best designed books published in the previous year, entitled \"50 Books/50 Covers\". Jurors included booksellers, book publishers, and designers such as George Salter.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, AIGA announced that it would cease organizing the contest and that future contests would be organized by Design Observer. This move has been criticized.\n\nThe 365 was an annual design competition for all graphic design other than book design. The last “365” competition was organized in 2011, after which it was replaced by the \"Cased\" competition.\n\nAIGA organized two conferences, the AIGA Design Conference and GAIN: AIGA Design and Business Conference. Both conferences were held biennially and the two were held in alternating years. Beginning in 2016, the AIGA Design Conference will be held annually with the 2016 conference held in Las Vegas.\n\nThe first AIGA Design Conference took place in Boston, Massachusetts in 1985.\n\nPast AIGA Design Conferences include:\n\n\nThe 2016 and 2017 conferences was hosted by Roman Mars.\n\nAs of 2018, the national board consists of\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, AIGA was briefly a member of Icograda (now called Ico-D). In 2010, it withdrew from the international organization, citing financial reasons.\n\nAIGA opened up membership beyond local chapters in 2014, benefiting creative professionals living and working outside of the USA.\n\nIn 1947 AIGA started publishing the \"AIGA Journal of Graphic Design\" (ISSN 0736-5322), which in 2000 was renamed \"Trace: AIGA Journal of Design\" (ISSN 1471-3497). The journal ceased publication in 2003.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2003 AIGA published \"Loop: AIGA Journal of Interaction Design Education\", an “interactive, web-based” research journal on interaction and visual interface design co-sponsored by Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Design Studies.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2011 AIGA published \"Voice: AIGA Journal of Design\", “an online publication for the discussion of design matters” listing Steven Heller as its editor.

Stewart in 1968, and provide a way of distinguishing a \"language\" from a \"dialect\".\n\nA variety is said to be autonomous if it has an independent cultural status.\nThis may occur if the variety is structurally different from all others, a situation Heinz Kloss called \"abstand\".\nThus language isolates such as Basque are necessarily autonomous.\nWhere several closely related varieties are found together, a standard language is autonomous because it has its own orthography, dictionaries, grammar books and literature.\nIn the terminology of Heinz Kloss, these are the attributes of \"ausbau\", or the elaboration of a language to serve as a literary standard.\n\nA variety is said to be heteronomous with respect to a genetically related standardized variety if speakers read and write the other variety, which they consider the standard form of their speech, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.\nIn such cases, the heteronomous variety is said to be dependent on, or oriented towards, the autonomous one.\nIn the terminology of Heinz Kloss, the heteronomous varieties are said to be under the \"roof\" of the standard variety.\nFor example, the various regional varieties of German (so called \"dialects\"), such as Alemannic, Austro-Bavarian, Central, Eastern and Northern Hessian, Kölsch, Low German, and more, are heteronomous with respect to Standard German, even though many of them are not mutually intelligible.\nA dialect continuum may be partitioned by these dependency relationships, which are often determined by extra-linguistic factors.\nFor example, although Germanic varieties spoken on either side of the Dutch–German border are very similar, those spoken in the Netherlands are oriented towards Standard Dutch, whereas those spoken in Germany are oriented towards Standard German.\n\nWithin this framework, a \"language\" may be defined as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it.\nStewart noted that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by Charles A. Ferguson and John J. Gumperz in 1960.\nIn these terms, Danish and Norwegian, though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages.\nConversely, although the varieties of Chinese are mutually unintelligible and have significant differences in phonology, syntax and vocabulary, they may be viewed as comprising a single language because they are all heteronomous with respect to Standard Chinese.\nSimilarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a \"dialect\" of a language defined in this way.\n\nAutonomy and heteronomy are largely sociopolitical constructs rather than the result of intrinsic linguistic differences, and thus may change over time.\n\nHeteronomous varieties may become dependent on a different standard as a result of social or political changes.\nFor example, the Scanian dialects spoken at the southern tip of Sweden, were considered dialects of Danish when the area was part of the kingdom of Denmark.\nA few decades after the area was transferred to Sweden, these varieties were generally regarded as dialects of Swedish, although the dialects themselves had not changed.\n\nEfforts to achieve autonomy are often connected with nationalist movements and the establishment of nation states.\nExamples of varieties that have gained autonomy are Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian from Serbo-Croatian and Afrikaans, which was formerly considered a dialect of Dutch.\n\nExamples of languages that have previously been considered to be autonomous but are now sometimes considered heteronomous are Occitan, sometimes considered a dialect of French, and Low German, occasionally considered to be a dialect of German.\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}

As student at Uppsala University, he gave up theology for a career in philosophy. Teaching there from 1893 until his retirement in 1933, he attacked the then dominant philosophical idealism of the followers of Christopher Jacob Boström (1797-1866). He is best known as a founder of the (quasi-) positivistic Uppsala school of philosophy—the Swedish counterpart of the Anglo-American Analytical Philosophy as well as of the Logical Positivism of the Vienna Circle—and as the founder of the Scandinavian legal realism movement.\n\nSome of his work was published by the Muirhead Library of Philosophy.\n\nHe was Inspektor of the Östgöta nation from 1925 to his retirement in 1933.\n\nThe jurisprudential camp of legal realism, broadly speaking, consists of those scholars who strictly reject the concept of natural law and who believe that legal concepts, terminology and values should be based on experience, observation and experimentation and are thus, ‘real’.\n\nHägerström is considered to be the founding father of the Scandinavian school of legal realism. His disciples Karl Olivecrona, Alf Ross and Anders Vilhelm Lundstedt all take a similar basic view to Hägerström in their opinions on the language of Western law. Due to their verdict on natural law, they also reject the concept of human rights.\n\nHägerström, who had been influenced by the Neo-Kantianism of the Marburg school, rejected metaphysics in their entirety. His motto was: \"Praeterea censeo metaphysicam esse delendam\", paraphrasing Cato's famous \"delenda Carthago\". His opinion was that words such as ‘right’ and ‘duty’ were basically meaningless as they could not be scientifically verified or proven. They may have influence or be able to direct a person who obtains such a right or duty but ultimately, if they could not stand up to a factual test, they were mere fantasies. Similarly, Hägerström regarded all value judgements as mere emotional expressions using the form of judgements without being judgments in the proper sense of the word. This position caused Hägerström's critics to characterize his philosophy as \"value nihilism\" - a label that was invented by journalists and later endorsed by some of Hägerström's less orthodox followers, namely Ingemar Hedenius.\n\nHägerström attacked various words and legal concepts in his writings so as to prove they could not stand up to scientific application.\n\n"}

Personal computers now have the capacity to process information easier and quicker than ever before, and so today's computer could be considered an important or even essential tool in translation. However, problems arise in the use of computers in translation, as the computer is no substitute for traditional tools such as monolingual and bilingual dictionaries, terminologies and encyclopaedias on paper or in digital format and although we can easily access a large amount of information, we need to find the right and reliable information.\n\nHere Corpora and concordancing software play an important role since gaining access to information about language, content and translation practices which was hardly available to translators before the present stage of ICT development.\n\nMachine translation from corpus linguistics is based in the analysis of real samples with its own translations. Among the different devices that use corpus, there are statistical methods and based on examples.\n\nThe main objective of statistic machine translation is to generate translations from statistical methods based in corpus of bilingual texts. For instance European parliament minutes are written in all EU (European Union) official languages. If there were more of this corpus, we would get excellent results of translation of texts about those subjects. \nThe first statistic machine translation program was CANDIDE by IBM.\n\nMachine translation based on examples is well known for using a bilingual corpus as the main source of knowledge. Basically it’s an analogical translation and could be interpreted as a practice of cases reasoning used in automatic learning, which consists in solving a problem basing on solutions of others similar problems.\n\nAccording to EAGLES, we can make a general distinction between Monolingual and Multilingual corpora. At the same time in multilingual corpora, we can distinguish between Comparable corpora and Corpora compiled using similar design criteria but which are not translations.\n\nParallel or Translation corpora are texts in one language aligned with their translation in another. We have to take into account several variables like directness of translation, number of languages, etc.\n\nThere are many Monolingual Comparable Corpora (corpus composed in two sub-sections, one of original texts in one language and the other texts translated into the same language). It’s useful for translation theorists and researchers but professional technical translators use translation memories.\n\nTranslation memory is a very specific type of parallel corpus in that:\n\n\nTranslation workbenches and TMs could be considered the most successful translation tool; however it’s restricted to specific text types.\n\nThe previous kinds of corpora can be combined with other tools like a dictionary for example. Corpora can function as general or specialized dictionaries. In that way, Comparable corpora can be seen as a monolingual dictionary and Parallel corpora could be compared to a bilingual dictionary.\n\nNot all dictionaries are the same, and neither are all corpora.\nApart from translation memories, corpus resources with a potential use for professional translators could be classified from “robust” to “virtual”.\n\nSome examples of corpora could be BNC (British National Corpus) or the Spanish corpus CREA or the Italian CORIS and so on.\n\nIt’s important to mention the difference by corpus linguistics between corpora and archives of electronic texts; the second one is only a repertory of electronic texts.\nBuilding a corpus of web pages implies an information retrieval operation, in order to locate relevant and reliable documents.\n\nIn many translation classes students have made their own corpora with DIY (do it yourself) corpora. \nThe main benefits of DIY corpora may be summarized as follows: \n\nFinally the advantages of “robust” corpora that we can see over “virtual” corpora are the following:\n\nBaker, M (1993). \"Corpus linguistics and translation studies. \"Implications and applications\" in M.

The department and its manning requirements, including the responsibilities of each rank are regulated within the STCW Convention. The department is led by deck officers, who are licensed mariners and they are commanded overall by the ship's captain. Seafarers in the deck department work a variety of jobs on a ship or vessel, but primarily they will carry out the navigation of a vessel, from the bridge. However, they are usually also responsible for supervising and monitoring any maritime cargo onboard, as well as ensuring maintenance of the deck and upper hull structure, monitoring the stability of the ship including loading and discharging ballast water, carrying out mooring operations and finally anchoring a ship.\n\nThe deck department is divided into deck officers and ratings. All ranks in the deck department are required to have undertaken training in accordance with the STCW Convention. For officers this involves the passing of an exam to receive a certificate of competency, the level of understanding and certification varies according to ship size. All ranks are required to have undertaken generic maritime training, which usually involves time at sea and time in an approved college. International standards under the STCW Code set out the minimum requirements for training, however individual nations also have their own maritime training regulations. For example, in the United Kingdom the Maritime and Coastguard Agency ensure that the deck department receive training and examinations in order to assume the responsibilities of their rank at sea.

The chief mate also compiles supply, overtime, and cost control records, and requisitions or purchases stores and equipment. Depending on the number of officers carried, he may or may not be a watch officer. If the ship carries a second mate and two third mates, he will be a dayworker, with a duty day from 0800 to 1700 ship's time. If only one third mate is carried, he will stand the 4 to 8 watch in addition to handling his executive duties.\n\nThe ship's other deck officers, generally a second mate and third mate, are also members of the deck department. Each watchstanding officer is responsible for the unlicensed crewmen on his watch.\n\nIn a four-mate ship where the chief mate is a dayworker, the second mate will stand the 4 to 8 watch, because sunrise and sunset usually fall on that watch. In the days before satellite navigation systems, the second mate shot morning and evening star fixes to determine the ship's position. The second mate is also responsible for maintaining the ship's charts and navigational publications, the ship's gyrocompass, and all navigational gear. He also keeps the log extract for each voyage used by company management as a short form \"howgozit\" sheet, covering time at sea, time under pilotage, time in port, and types and tonnages of cargoes moved.\n\nThe two third mates are often called the senior third and the junior third. The senior third mate stands the 12 to 4 watch, the junior third the 8 to 12 watch. While on duty, they are responsible for handling the ship and fixing its position by shooting sun lines, taking hourly fixes from the satellite navigation gear, and piloting the ship in coastal waters; and the senior third will prepare the noon position slip for the use of the captain and chief engineer.\n\nIn the military, the deck department comprises sailors who perform a variety of functions depending on ship type and size.\n\nExamples include maintenance and upkeep of the ship, handling of the ship's rigging and ground tackle, coordination of underway replenishment operations, conductance of minesweeping operations, maintenance and operation of the ship's boats, supervision of diving and salvage operations (including towing), and serving as shipboard seamanship specialists. Undesignated seamen, or those who have not selected a rating (e.g. job or vocation), are normally the most junior sailors on board and are usually sent to the deck department for their first assignment.\n\n"}

The recording is done by the use of a digital recorder. Digital recorders are lighter, have a longer battery life and are able to record for a lot longer utilizing the same media, as compared to analog tape based dictation machines. The files generated with digital recorders vary in size, depending on the manufacturer and the format the user chooses. The most common file formats that digital recorders generate have one of the extensions WAV, WMA or MP3. True dictation machines record in the DSS and DS2 format.\n\nThe DSS and DS2 file formats compress audio allowing for greater portability. In some cases, speech is recorded where sound quality is paramount and transcription unnecessary, e.g. for broadcasting a theatre play; such recording uses techniques closer to high-fidelity music recording, rather than those discussed here.\n\nDigital dictation offers several advantages over traditional cassette tape based dictation:\n\n\nDictation audio can be recorded in various audio file formats. Most digital dictation systems use a lossy form of audio compression based on modelling of the vocal tract to minimize hard disk space and optimize network utilization as files are transferred between users. (Note that WAV is not an audio encoding format, but a file format and has little or no bearing on the encoding rate (kbit/s), size or audio quality of the resulting file.)\n\nDigital dictation is different from speech recognition where audio is analyzed by a computer using speech algorithms in an attempt to transcribe the document. With digital dictation the process of converting digital audio to text may be done using digital transcription software, typically controlled by a foot switch which allows the transcriber to PLAY, STOP, REWIND, and BACKSPACE.\n\nThese days there are Digital Transcription Kits that allow integration with Speech Recognition Software. This gives the typist the option to either type a document manually, or send a document to be converted to text by Software such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking.\n\nPortable Recorder<br>\nPortable, hand held, digital recorders are the modern replacement for analog handhelds. Digital portables allow transfer of recordings by docking or plugging into a computer. Digital recorders eliminate the need for cassette tapes. Professional digital hand held recorders are available with slide switch, push button, fingerprint locking, and barcode scanning options.\n\nComputer<br>\nAnother common way to record digital dictation is with a computer dictation microphone. There are several different types of computer dictation microphones available, but each one has similar features and operation. Olympus Direct Rec, Philips SpeechMike, and Dictaphone Powermic are all digital computer dictation microphones that also feature push button control for operating dictation or speech recognition software. The dictation microphone operates through a USB port on the computer it is used with.\n\nCall-in Dictation System<br> \nCall in dictation systems allow one to record their dictations over the phone. With call in dictation systems, the author dials a phone number, enters a PIN and starts dictating. Touch tone controls allow for start, pause, playback, and sending of dictation audio file. The call in dictation systems usually feature a Pod that can be plugged into a phone line. The pod can then be plugged into a computer to store dictation audio recording in compatible transcription or management software.\n\nMobile Phone<br>\nCurrently there are several digital dictation applications available for mobile phones. With mobile dictation apps, one can record, edit, and send dictation files over networks. Wireless transfer of dictation files decreases turnaround time. Mobile dictation applications allow users to stay connected to dictation workflows through a network, such as the Internet.\n\nThere are two types of digital dictation software:\n\nRecordings can be made over the telephone, on a computer or via a hand held dictation device that is \"docked\" to a computer.\n\n"}

For example, the attribute named \"number\" might have the value \"singular\". The value of an attribute may be either atomic, e.g. the symbol \"singular\", or complex (most commonly a feature structure, but also a list or a set).\n\nA feature structure can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with the nodes corresponding to the variable values and the paths to the variable names. Operations defined on feature structures, e.g. unification, are used extensively in phrase structure grammars. In most theories (e.g. HPSG), operations are strictly speaking defined over equations describing feature structures and not over feature structures themselves, though feature structures are usually used in informal exposition.\n\nOften, feature structures are written like this:\n\nformula_1\n\nHere there are the two features \"category\" and \"agreement\". \"Category\" has the value \"noun phrase\" whereas the value of \"agreement\" is indicated by another feature structure with the features \"number\" and \"person\" being \"singular\" and \"third\".\n\nThis particular notation is called \"attribute value matrix\" (AVM).\n\nThe matrix has two columns, one for the feature names and the other for the values. In this sense a feature structure is a list of key-value pairs. The value might be atomic or another feature structure. This leads to another notation for feature structures: the use of trees. In fact, some systems (such as PATR-II) use S-expressions to represent feature structures.\n\n"}

In a theatre, the front of house manager is responsible for ticket sales, refreshments, and making sure the auditorium is set out properly.\n\nSound operators, excluding the monitor engineers, are normally positioned in a small sectioned-off area front-of-house, surrounded by the audience or at the edge of the audience area. From this position they have unobstructed listening and a clear view of the performance, enabling the operation of the main speaker system, show control consoles and other equipment. In this case \"front of house\" can refer to both the general audience/public area or to the specific small section from where the show is mixed.\n\nThe front of house speakers are the main speakers that cover the audience, and the front of house desk is the desk that generates the front of house audio mix. In smaller venues the front of house desk may also produce foldback (monitor) mixes for the monitor speakers onstage, whereas in larger venues there will normally be a second mixing desk for monitor control positioned just off the side of the main stage. The audio engineer that designs the front of house sound system and puts it into place for the show/event is the system engineer, and this role is often separate from the person who operates the mixing desk who is often employed by the band directly on larger tours or employed by the venue for smaller tours. The touring engineer is usually assisted by a house sound engineer (employed by the venue) who will be familiar with the installed system of the venue.\n\nIn stage lighting, any lighting fixtures that are on the audience side of the proscenium arch are referred to as being FOH.

In 2004 George Lakoff used it to describe political progressives in the United States, saying that relative to conservatives they suffer from \"massive hypocognition,\" which he described as the lack of having a progressive philosophy framed around the progressive core values of empathy and responsibility such as \"effective government\" versus \"less government\" or \"broader prosperity\" versus \"free markets.\"\n\nHypocognition has been blamed for preventing the practical application of evidence-based medicine in areas where frames (contextual and presentational influences on perceptions of reality) obscure facts.

{"id": "18603822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18603822", "title": "Illyrian languages", "text": "Illyrian languages\n\nThe Illyrian languages are a group of Indo-European languages that were spoken in the western part of the Balkans in former times by groups identified as Illyrians: Ardiaei, Delmatae, Pannonii, Autariates, Taulantii (see list of ancient tribes in Illyria). Some sound changes from Proto-Indo-European to Illyrian and other language features are deduced from what remains of the Illyrian languages, but because there are no examples of ancient Illyrian literature surviving (aside from the Messapian writings if they can be considered Illyrian), it is difficult to clarify its place within the Indo-European language family. Because of the uncertainty, most sources provisionally place the Illyrian language family on its own branch of Indo-European, though its relation to other languages, ancient and modern, continues to be studied.\n\nThe Illyrian languages are part of the Indo-European language family. The relation of the Illyrian languages to other Indo-European languages—ancient and modern—is poorly understood due to the paucity of data and is still being examined. Today, the main source of authoritative information about the Illyrian language consists of a handful of Illyrian words cited in classical sources, and numerous examples of Illyrian anthroponyms, ethnonyms, toponyms and hydronyms.\n\nGiven the scarcity of the data it is difficult to identify the sound changes that have taken place in the Illyrian languages; the most widely accepted one is that the Indo-European voiced aspirates , , became voiced consonants , , .\n\nA grouping of Illyrian with the Messapian language has been proposed for about a century, but remains an unproven hypothesis. The theory is based on classical sources, archaeology and onomastics. Messapian material culture bears a number of similarities to Illyrian material culture. Some Messapian anthroponyms have close Illyrian equivalents.\n\nA grouping of Illyrian with the Venetic language and Liburnian language, once spoken in northeastern Italy and Liburnia respectively, has also been proposed. The consensus now is that Illyrian was quite distinct from Venetic and Liburnian. \n\nIn the absence of sufficient lexical data and texts written in the Illyrian languages, the theories supporting the Centum character of the Illyrian language have been based mainly on the Centum character of the Venetic language, which was thought to be related to Illyrian, in particular regarding Illyrian toponyms and names such as \"Vescleves\", \"Acrabanus\", \"Gentius\", \"Clausal\" etc. The relation between Venetic and Illyrian was later discredited and they are no longer considered closely related.\n\nScholars supporting the Satem character of the Illyrian languages highlight particular toponyms and personal names such as \"Asamum\", \"Birzinimum\" \"Zanatis\" etc. in which these scholars claim that there is clear evidence of the Satem character of the Illyrian language. They also point to other toponyms including \"Osseriates\" derived from \"/*eghero/\" (lake) or \"Birziminium\" from PIE \"/*bherǵh/\" or \"Asamum\" from PIE \"/*aḱ-mo/\" (sharp).\n\nEven if the above-mentioned Venetic toponyms and personal names are accepted as Illyrian in origin, it is not clear that they originated in a Centum language. \"Vescleves\", \"Acrabanus\", \"Gentius\" and \"Clausal\" are explained by proponents of the hypothesis that the Illyrian languages had a Centum character, through comparison with IE languages such as Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or reconstructed PIE. For example, \"Vescleves\" has been explained as PIE \"*wesu-ḱlewes\" (of good fame). Also, the name \"Acrabanus\" as a compound name has been compared with Ancient Greek \"/akros/\" with no signs of palatalization, or \"Clausal\" has been related to /*\"klew\"/ (wash, rinse). In all these cases the supporters of the Centum character of the Illyrian language consider PIE \"*ḱ > /*k/\" or PIE \"*ǵ > /*g/\" followed by an \"/l/\" or \"/r/\" to be evidence of a Centum character of the Illyrian language. However, it has been shown that even in Albanian and Balto-Slavic, which are Satem languages, in this phonetical position the palatovelars have been generally depalatized (the depalatization of PIE \"*ḱ > *k\" and \"*ǵ > *g\" before \"/r/\" and \"/l/\" regularly in Albanian). Even the name \"Gentius\" or \"Genthius\" does not help to solve the problem since we have two Illyrian forms \"Genthius\" and \"Zanatis\". If \"Gentius\" or \"Genthius\" derives from \"*ǵen-\" (be born) this is proof of a Centum language, but if the name \"Zanatis\" is similarly generated (or from \"*ǵen-\" know) than we have a Satem language. Another problem related to the name \"Gentius\" is that nowadays it cannot be stated surely if the initial \"/g/\" of the sources was a \"palatovelar\" or a \"labiovelar\".\n\nTaking into account the absence of sufficient data and sometimes the dual nature of their interpretation, the Centum/Satem character of the Illyrian language is still uncertain and requires more evidence.\n\n\nThe Greeks were the first literate people to come into frequent contact with the speakers of Illyrian languages. Their conception of \"Illyrioi\", however, differed from what the Romans would later call \"Illyricum\". The Greek term encompassed only the peoples who lived on the borders of Macedonia and Epirus. Pliny the Elder, in his work Natural History, applies a stricter usage of the term Illyrii when speaking of \"Illyrii proprie dicti\" (\"Illyrians properly so-called\") among the native communities in the south of Roman Dalmatia.\n\nFor a couple of centuries before and after the Roman conquest in the late 1st century BC, the concept of Illyricum expanded towards the west and north. Finally it encompassed all native peoples from the Adriatic to the Danube, inhabiting the Roman provinces of Dalmatia, Pannonia and Moesia, regardless of their ethnic and cultural differences.\n\nAn extensive study of Illyrian names and territory was undertaken by Hans Krahe in the first decades of the twentieth century. He and other scholars argued for a broad distribution of Illyrian peoples considerably beyond the Balkans, though in his later work, Krahe curbed his view of the extent of Illyrian settlement.\n\nThe further refinements of Illyrian onomastic provinces for that Illyrian area included in the later Roman province were proposed by Géza Alföldy. He identified five principal groups: (1) \"real Illyrians\" south of the river Neretva and extending south of the provincial boundary with Macedonia at the river Drin to include the Illyris of north and central Albania; (2) the \"Delmatae\" who occupied the middle Adriatic coast between the \"real Illyrians\" and the Liburni; (3) the \"Venetic Liburni\" of the northeast Adriatic; (4) the \"Japodes\" who dwelt north of the Delmatae and behind Liburni, where names reveal a mixture of Venetic, Celtic and Illyrian; and (5) the \"Pannonian\" people north in Bosnia, Northern Montenegro, and western Serbia.\n\nThese identifications were later challenged by Radoslav Katičić who on the basis of personal names which occur commonly in Illyricum distinguished three dialect areas: (1) \"South-Eastern Illyrian\", extending southwards from the southern part of Montenegro and including most of Albania west of the river Drin, though its demarcation to the south remains uncertain; (2) \"Central Illyrian\" consisting of most of ex-Yugoslavia, north of southern Montenegro to the west of Morava, excepting ancient Liburnia in the northwest, but perhaps extending into Pannonia in the north; (3) \"Liburnian\", whose names resemble those of the Venetic territory to the northeast.\n\nThe onomastic differences between the \"South-Eastern\" and \"Central\" areas are not sufficient to show that two clearly differentiated dialects of Illyrian were in use in these areas. However, as Katičić has argued, the core onomastic area of Illyrian proper is to be located in the southeast of that Balkan region, traditionally associated with the Illyrians (centered in modern Albania).\n\nTraditionally Illyrian has referred to any non-Celtic language in the northwestern Balkans. Recent scholarship from the 1960s tends to agree that the region inhabited by Illyrian tribes can be divided into three distinct linguistic and cultural areas, of which only one can be properly termed \"Illyrian\". No written texts regarding self-identification exist from the Illyrians and no inscriptions in Illyrian exist, with the only linguistic remains being place names (toponyms) and some glosses. \n\nSince there are no Illyrian texts, sources for identifying Illyrian words have been identified by Hans Krahe as being of four kinds: inscriptions, glosses of Illyrian words in classical texts, names—including proper names (mostly inscribed on tombstones), toponyms and river names—and Illyrian loanwords in other languages. The last category has proven particularly contentious. The names occur in sources that range over more than a millennium, including numismatic evidence, as well as posited original forms of placenames. There are no Illyrian inscriptions (Messapian inscriptions are treated separately, and there is no consensus that they are to be reckoned as Illyrian). The spearhead found at Kovel and thought by some to be Illyrian is considered by the majority of runologists to be Eastern Germanic, and most likely Gothic, while a votive inscription on a ring found near Shkodër which was initially interpreted as Illyrian was shown to actually be Byzantine Greek.\n\nSome additional words have been extracted by linguists from toponyms, hydronyms, anthroponyms, etc.:\n\n\nThe following anthroponyms derive from Illyrian or are not yet connected with another language unless noted, such as the Delmatae names of Liburnian origin. Alföldy identified five principal onomastic provinces within the Illyrian area: 1) the \"real\" Illyrians south of the river Neretva in Dalmatia and extending south to Epirus; 2) the Delmatae, who occupied the middle Adriatic coast between the \"real Illyrians\" to the south and the Liburni to the north; 3) the Liburni, a branch of Venetic in the northeast Adriatic; 4) the Iapodes, who dwelt north of the Delmatae and behind (inland from) the coastal Liburnians; 5) the Pannonians in the northern lands, and in Bosnia, northern Montenegro and Western Serbia. Katičić does not recognize a separate Pannonian onomastic area, and includes the Pannoni with the Delmatae. Below, names from four of Alföldy's five onomastic areas are listed, Liburnian excluded, having been identified as being akin to Venetic. A Dardanian area is also detailed.\n\nHundreds of Delmatae names have been recorded. Characteristic names include:\n\nDelmatae names in common with the Pannoni (some also occur among the south Illyrians):\nSome Delmatae names probably originate from the Liburnians. This conclusion is based on the Liburnian suffixes: -icus, -ica, -ocus, -ico; and from the distribution of the names among the Liburni/Veneti, and from their absence or scarcity in other onomastic areas:\nFrom the southern Illyrians, the names Boria, Epicadus, Laedicalius, Loiscus, Pinnes and Tato and some others are present. From the Iapodes, Diteio and Ve(n)do, and a few names of Celtic origin (not shown here).\n\nSome names attested among the Pannoni:\n\nThe following names are confined to the Pannonian onomastic province:\n\nNorthern Pannoni:\n\n\nNames attested among the Colapiani, an Illyric tribe of Pannonia:\n\n\nAmong the Jasi: Scenus. The Breuci: Scilus Bato (first and last name), Blaedarus, Dasmenus, Dasius, Surco, Sassaius, Liccaius, Lensus. The Amantini, the Scordisci: Terco, Precio, Dases, Dasmenus.\n\n\nThe following names of gods (theonyms) derive from possibly several languages (Liburnian, Illyrian, etc.) and are names of gods worshipped by the Illyrians. However, they are known through Interpretatio romana and their names may have been corrupted.\n\nThe Ancient Greek language would have become an important external influence on Illyrian-speakers who occupied lands adjacent to ancient Greek colonies, mainly on the Adriatic coast. The Taulantii and the Bylliones had, according to Strabo, become bilingual. Invading Celts who settled on lands occupied by Illyrians brought the Illyrians into contact with the Celtic languages and some tribes were Celticized especially those in Dalmatia and the Pannoni. Intensive contact may have happened in what is now Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia. Due to this intensive contact, and because of conflicting classical sources, it is unclear whether some ancient tribes were Illyrian or Celtic (ex: Scordisci) or mixed in varying degree. Thracians and Paeonians also occupied lands populated by Illyrians, bringing Illyrians into contact with the Thracian language and Paeonian language. Certainly, no serious linguistic study of Illyrian language could be made without the inclusion of Latin, in addition to ancient Greek, Thracian and Celtic languages, as the peoples that spoke those languages were recorded by both ancient and modern historians to have lived in lands inhabited by Illyrians at one period of time in history or another. Last, but certainly not least, any comprehensive study of Illyrian language must take into account the Indo-European glossary.\n\nThe following Illyrian names derive from Celtic:\nThe following names derive from Thracian:\nThe following names may derive from Greek:\n\nThe following names may derive from Latin:\n\nThe Illyrian languages were likely extinct between the 2nd and 6th centuries AD, with the possible exception of the language that developed into Albanian according to the theory of Albanian descent from Illyrian. It has also been posited that Illyrian was preserved and spoken in the countryside, as attested in the 4th-5th century testimonies of St. Jerome.\n\n\n"}

Although Mark E. Gold has shown that not every regular language can be learned this way (see language identification in the limit), approaches have been investigated for a variety of subclasses. They are sketched in this article. For learning of more general grammars, see Grammar induction.\n\nA regular language is defined as a (finite or infinite) set of strings that can be described by one of the mathematical formalisms called \"finite automaton\", \"regular grammar\", or \"regular expression\", all of which have the same expressive power. Since the latter formalism leads to shortest notations, it shall be introduced and used here. Given a set Σ of symbols (a.k.a. alphabet), a regular expression can be any of\nFor example, using Σ = { 0,1 }, the regular expression (0+1+ε)⋅(0+1) denotes the set of all binary numbers with one or two digits (leading zero allowed), while 1⋅(0+1)⋅0 denotes the (infinite) set of all even binary numbers (no leading zeroes).\n\nGiven a set of strings (also called \"positive examples\"), the task of regular language induction is to come up with a regular expression that denotes a set containing all of them.\nAs an example, given { 1, 10, 100 }, a \"natural\" description could be the regular expression 1⋅0, corresponding to the informal characterization \"a 1 followed by arbitrarily many (maybe even none) 0es\".\nHowever, (0+1) and 1+(1⋅0)+(1⋅0⋅0) is another regular expression, denoting the largest (assuming Σ={0,1}) and the smallest set containing the given strings, and called the trivial overgeneralization and undergeneralization, respectively.\nSome approaches work in an extended setting where also a set of \"negative example\" strings is given; then, a regular expression is to be found that generates all of the positive, but none of the negative examples.\n\nDupont et al. have shown that the set of all structurally complete finite automata\ngenerating a given input set of example strings forms a lattice, with the trivial undergeneralized and the trivial overgeneralized automaton as bottom and top element, respectively.\nEach member of this lattice can be obtained by factoring the undergeneralized automaton by an appropriate congruence relation.\nThe image shows an example for the above input string set { 1, 10, 100 }.\nEach automaton is denoted by an equivalent regular expression.

Each node's automaton is the result of factoring the bottom automaton by the congruence relation shown in below the node.\n\nIf both positive and negative example strings are given, Dupont et al. build the lattice from the positive examples, and then investigate the separation border between automata that generate some negative example and such that do not.\nMost interesting are those automata immediately below the border.\nIn the image, separation borders are shown for the negative example strings 11, 1001, 101, 0.\n\nCoste and Nicolas present an own search method within this lattice, which they relate to Mitchell's version space paradigm.\nTo find the separation border, they use a graph coloring algorithm on the state inequality relation induced by the negative examples.\nLater, they investigate several ordering relations on the set of all possible state fusions.\n\nKudo and Shimbo use the representation by automaton factorizations to give a unique framework for the following approaches (sketched below):\nEach of these approaches is shown to correspond to a particular kind of congruence relations used for factorization.\n\nAngluin considers so-called \"\"k\"-reversible\" regular automata, that is, deterministic automata in which each state can be reached from at most one state by following a transition chain of length \"k\".\nFormally, if Σ, \"Q\", and δ denote the input alphabet, the state set, and the transition function of an automaton \"A\", respectively, then \"A\" is called \"k\"-reversible if : ∀\"a\"...,\"a\" ∈ Σ ∀\"s\", \"s\" ∈ \"Q\": δ(\"s\",\"a\"...\"a\") = δ(\"s\",\"a\"...\"a\") ⇒ \"s\" = \"s\", where δ means the homomorphic extension of δ to arbitrary words.\nAngluin gives a cubic algorithm for learning of the smallest \"k\"-reversible language from a given set of input words; for \"k\"=0, the algorithm has even almost linear complexity.\nThe required state uniqueness after \"k\"+1 given symbols forces unifying automaton states, thus leading to a proper generalization different from the trivial undergeneralized automaton. \nThis algorithm has been used to learn simple parts of English syntax;\nlater, an incremental version has been provided.\nAnother approach based on \"k\"-reversible automata is the \"tail clustering method\".\n\nFrom a given set of input strings, Vernadat and Richetin build a so-called successor automaton, consisting of one state for each distinct character and a transition between each two adjacent characters' states.\nFor example, the singleton input set { \"\" } leads to an automaton corresponding to the regular expression (\"a\"⋅\"b\").\n\nAn extension of this approach is the predecessor-successor method which generalizes each character repetition immediately to a Kleene and then includes for each character the set of its possible predecessors in its state.\nSuccessor automata can learn exactly the class of local languages.\nSince each regular language is the homomorphic image of a local language, grammars from the former class can be learned by \"lifting\", if an appropriate (depending on the intended application) homomorphism is provided.\nIn particular, there is such a homomorphism for the class of languages learnable by the predecessor-successor method.\nThe learnability of local languages can be reduced to that of \"k\"-reversible languages.\n\nChomsky and Miller (1957)\nused the pumping lemma: they guess a part \"v\" of an input string \"uvw\" and try to build a corresponding cycle into the automaton to be learned; using membership queries they ask, for appropriate \"k\", which of the strings \"uw\", \"uvvw\", \"uvvvw\", ..., \"uvw\" also belongs to the language to be learned, thereby refining the structure of their automaton. In 1959, Solomonoff generalized this approach to context-free languages, which also obey a pumping lemma.\n\nCâmpeanu et al. learn a finite automaton as a compact representation of a large finite language.\nGiven such a language \"F\", they search a so-called \"cover automaton\" \"A\" such that its language \"L\"(\"A\") covers \"F\" in the following sense: \"L\"(\"A\") ∩ Σ = \"F\", where \"l\" is the length of the longest string in \"F\", and Σ denotes the set of all strings not longer than \"l\". \nIf such a cover automaton exists, \"F\" is uniquely determined by \"A\" and \"l\".\nFor example, \"F\" = { \"ad\", \"read\", \"reread\" } has \"l\"=6 and a cover automaton corresponding to the regular expression (\"r\"⋅\"e\")⋅\"a\"⋅\"d\".\n\nFor two strings \"x\" and \"y\", Câmpeanu et al. define \"x\" ~ \"y\" if \"xz\"∈\"F\" ⇔ \"yz\"∈\"F\" for all strings \"z\" of a length such that both \"xz\" and \"yz\" are not longer than \"l\". Based on this relation, whose lack of transitivity causes considerable technical problems, they give an \"O\"(\"n\") algorithm to construct from \"F\" a cover automaton \"A\" of minimal state count.\nMoreover, for union, intersection, and difference of two finite languages they provide corresponding operations on their cover automata.\nPăun et al. improve the time complexity to \"O\"(\"n\").\n\nFor a set \"S\" of strings and a string \"u\", the Brzozowski derivative \"u\"\"S\" is defined as the set of all rest-strings obtainable from a string in \"S\" by cutting off its prefix \"u\" (if possible), formally: \"u\"\"S\" = { \"v\" ∈ Σ: \"uv\" ∈ \"S\" }, cf. picture.\nDenis et al. define a residual automaton to be a nondeterministic finite automaton \"A\" where each state \"q\" corresponds to a Brzozowski derivative of its accepted language \"L\"(\"A\"), formally: ∀\"q\"∈\"Q\" ∃\"u\"∈Σ: \"L\"(\"A\",\"q\") = \"u\"\"L\"(\"A\"), where \"L\"(\"A\",\"q\") denotes the language accepted from \"q\" as start state.\n\nThey show that each regular language is generated by a uniquely determined minimal residual automaton. Its states are ∪-indecomposable Brzozowski derivatives, and it may be exponentially smaller than the minimal deterministic automaton.\nMoreover, they show that residual automata for regular languages cannot be learned in polynomial time, even assuming optimal sample inputs.\nThey give a learning algorithm for residual automata and prove that it learns the automaton from its \"characteristic sample\" of positive and negative input strings.\n\nBrill defines a reduced regular expression to be any of \nGiven an input set of strings, he builds step by step a tree with each branch labelled by a reduced regular expression accepting a prefix of some input strings, and each node labelled with the set of lengths of accepted prefixes.\nHe aims at learning correction rules for English spelling errors,\nrather than at theoretical considerations about learnability of language classes.\nConsequently, he uses heuristics to prune the tree-buildup, leading to a considerable improvement in run time.\n\n"}

It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian Talmud (which was completed in the seventh century) and of post-Talmudic (Geonic) literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Jews. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of inscriptions on incantation bowls.\n\nThe language was closely related to other Eastern Aramaic dialects such as Mandaic. Its original pronunciation is uncertain, and has to be reconstructed with the help of these kindred dialects and of the reading tradition of the Yemenite Jews, and where available those of the Iraqi, Syrian and Egyptian Jews. The value of the Yemenite reading tradition has been challenged by some scholars. (The vocalized Aramaic texts with which Jews are familiar, from the Bible and the prayer book, are of limited usefulness for this purpose, as they are in a different dialect.)\n\nTalmudic Aramaic bears all the marks of being a specialist language of study and legal argumentation, like Law French, rather than a vernacular mother tongue, and continued in use for these purposes long after Arabic had become the language of daily life. It has developed a battery of technical logical terms, such as \"tiyuvta\" (conclusive refutation) and \"tiqu\" (undecidable moot point), which are still used in Jewish legal writings, including those in other languages, and have influenced modern Hebrew.\n\nLike the Judean (Galilean Aramaic) and Jewish dialects it was written with Hebrew alphabet.\n\nThere are six major verb stems or verbal patterns (binyanim) in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. The form \"pe‘al\" (פְּעַל) “to do”, the form \"Aph'el\" (אַפְעֵל) “let do”, and the form \"Pa'el\" (פַּעֵל) “like to do”, are all in the active voice. But the form \"Itpe'el\" (אִתְפְּעֵל), the form \"Itaph'al\" (אִתַפְעַל) and the form \"Itpa'al\" (אִתְפַּעַל) are essentially reflexive and have usually function in a passive sense.\n\n\nThe Aramaic verb has two participles: an active participle with suffix and a passive participle with suffix:\n\n\n\n\nThe verbal pattern (binyan) \"pa‘el\" are frequentative verbs showing repeated or intense action.\n\nThe verbal pattern \"pa'el\" is Active Frequentative.\n\n\n\nThe verbal pattern \"itpa'al\" is Passive Frequentative.\n\nThe verbal pattern \"aphel\" is Active Causative.\n\n\n\n\nThe verbal pattern \"itaphal\" is Passive Causative.\n\nThe language has received considerable scholarly attention, as shown in the Bibliography below. However, the majority of those who are familiar with it, namely Orthodox Jewish students of Talmud, are given no systematic instruction in the language, and are expected to \"sink or swim\" in the course of Talmudic studies, with the help of some informal pointers showing similarities and differences with Hebrew.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3362370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3362370", "title": "Kelly drive", "text": "Kelly drive\n\nA kelly drive refers to a type of well drilling device on an oil or gas drilling rig that employs a section of pipe with a polygonal (three-, four-, six-, or eight-sided) or splined outer surface, which passes through the matching polygonal or splined kelly (mating) bushing and rotary table. This bushing is rotated via the rotary table and thus the pipe and the attached drill string turn while the polygonal pipe is free to slide vertically in the bushing as the bit digs the well deeper. When drilling, the drill bit is attached at the end of the drill string and thus the kelly drive provides the means to turn the bit (assuming that a downhole motor is not being used).\n\nThe kelly is the polygonal tubing and the \"kelly bushing\" is the mechanical device that turns the kelly when rotated by the rotary table. Together they are referred to as a \"kelly drive\". The upper end of the kelly is screwed into the swivel, using a left-hand thread to preclude loosening from the right-hand torque applied below. The kelly typically is about 10 ft (3 m) longer than the drill pipe segments, thus leaving a portion of newly drilled hole open below the bit after a new length of pipe has been added (\"making a connection\") and the drill string has been lowered until the kelly bushing engages again in the rotary table.\n\nThe kelly hose is the flexible, high-pressure hose connected from the standpipe to a gooseneck pipe on a swivel above the kelly and allows the free vertical movement of the kelly while facilitating the flow of the drilling fluid down the drill string. It generally is of steel-reinforced rubber construction but also assemblies of Chiksan steel pipe and swivels are used.\n\nAccording to the ″Dictionary of Petroleum Exploration, Drilling and Production″, ″[The] kelly was named after Michael J. (King) Kelly, a Chicago baseball player (1880-1887) who was known for his base running and long slides.″ As steel was not as good a quality back then as it was today, the kelly was always hanging up in the kelly bushing. There was a popular song for the famous baseball player at that time called, ″Slide Kelly, Slide!″ ″Sliding″ is the act of a kelly passing through the kelly bushing as it drills.\n\nAlternatively, some say the name kelly is derived from the machine shop in which the first kelly was made. It was located in a town formerly named Kellysburg, Pennsylvania.\nSee \"List of components of oil drilling rigs\" to view a diagram.\n"}

L. Austin's theory of the illocutionary act outlined in his \"How To Do Things With Words\". The second essay, \"Limited Inc a b c...\", is Derrida's response to John Searle's \"Reply to Derrida: Reiterating the Differences,\" which criticizes Derrida's interpretation of Austin. The book concludes with a letter by Derrida, written in response to questions posed by Gerald Graff in 1988: \"Afterword: Toward an Ethic of Discussion\".\nSearle's essay is not itself included: he denied Northwestern University Press permission to reprint it. A summary is included between the two Derrida essays, and Derrida quotes the essay extensively.\n\n\"Signature Event Context\" was originally delivered at a Montreal conference entitled \"Communication,\" organized by the Congrès international des Sociétés de philosophie de langue française in August 1971. It was subsequently published in the Congrès' \"Proceedings\" and then collected in Derrida's \"Marges de la philosophie\" in 1972. It first appeared in English translation in the inaugural issue of the journal \"Glyph\" in 1977 and was followed in the same issue by Searle's \"Reply to Derrida: Reiterating the Differences\". Derrida's reply to Searle's reply, \"Limited Inc a b c...\", was published in \"Glyph\"'s second issue later in 1977. A French edition of \"Limited Inc\" was published by Éditions Galilée under that same title (but with a point added after \"Inc\") in 1990.\n\nThe essay has three section headings, beginning with: \"Writing & Telecommunication\" on the third page, and then followed by \"Parasites. Iter, of Writing: That It Perhaps Does Not Exist\", and concluding with \"Signatures\".\n\nDerrida highlights Austin's theory of illocutionary acts in the \"Parasites...\" section because he finds it in contradiction to the definition of communication he has formulated in \"Writing & Telecommunication\". There he considers all communication in terms traditionally reserved for writing. Derrida lists three traits of writing. First, it subsists without the subject who inscribed it. Second, the meaning of the text is never constrained by its context. \"[T]he sign\", Derrida explains, \"possesses the characteristic of being readable even if the moment of its production is irrevocably lost and even if I do not know what its alleged author-scriptor intended to say at the moment he wrote it\". Third, this possibility of rupture from its origin is provided by a text's elements (e.g. words) being separated by spacing. Derrida says that these traits \"are valid not only for all orders of 'signs' and for languages in general but moreover, beyond semio-linguistic communication, for the entire field of what philosophy would call experience\".\n\nIn 1972, Derrida wrote \"Signature Event Context,\" an essay on J. L. Austin's speech act theory; following a critique of this text by John Searle in his 1977 essay \"Reiterating the Differences\", Derrida wrote the same year \"Limited Inc abc ...\", a long defense of his earlier argument.\n\nSearle exemplified his view on deconstruction in \"The New York Review of Books\", February 2, 1984; for example:\n\nIn 1983, Searle told to \"The New York Review of Books\" a remark on Derrida allegedly made by Michel Foucault in a private conversation with Searle himself; Derrida later decried Searle's gesture as gossip, and also condemned as violent the use of a mass circulation magazine to fight an academic debate. According to Searle's account, Foucault called Derrida's prose style \"terrorist obscurantism\"; Searle's quote was:\n\nIn 1988, Derrida wrote \"Afterword: Toward An Ethic of Discussion\", to be published with the previous essays in the collection \"Limited Inc\". Commenting on criticisms of his work, he wrote:\nIn the main text he argued that Searle avoided reading him and didn't try to understand him and even that, perhaps, he was not able to understand, and how certain practices of academic politeness or impoliteness could result in a form of brutality that he disapproved of and would like to disarm, in his fashion.\n\nDerrida also criticized Searle's work for pretending to talk about \"intention\" without being aware of traditional texts about the subject and without even understanding Husserl's work when talking about it. Because he ignored the tradition he rested blindly imprisoned in it, repeating its most problematic gestures, falling short of the most elementary critical questions.\n\nDerrida would even argue that in a certain way he was more close to Austin, than Searle that, in fact, was more close to continental philosophers that himself tried to criticize.\nHe would also argue about the problem he found in the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition from which Austin and Searle were only paradigmatic examples.\n\nHe continued arguing how problematic was establishing the relation between \"nonfiction or standard discourse\" and \"fiction,\" defined as its \"parasite, “for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place-and in so doing to \"de-essentialize\" itself as it were”. \nHe would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:\n"}

The system was used from 1981 to 30 September 2001 by Environment Canada to translate forecasts issued in French in the province of Quebec into English and those issued in English in other Canadian provinces into French. Since then, a competitor program has replaced METEO System after an open governmental bid.\n\nThe system was developed by John Chandioux and was often mentioned as one of the few success stories in the field of machine translation. \n\nThe METEO System was in operational use at Environment Canada from 1982 to 2001. It stems from a prototype developed in 1975-76 by the TAUM Group, known as TAUM-METEO. \n\nThe initial motivation to develop that prototype was that a junior translator came to TAUM to ask for help in translating weather bulletins at Environment Canada. Since all official communications emanating from the Canadian government must be available in French and English, because of the Official Languages Act of 1969, and weather bulletins represent a large amount of translation in real time, junior translators had to spend several months producing first draft translations, which were then revised by seniors. That was a difficult and tedious job, because of the specificities of the English and French sublanguages used, and not very rewarding, as the lifetime of a bulletin is only 4 hours.\n\nTAUM proposed to build a prototype MT system, and Environment Canada agreed to fund the project. A prototype was ready after a few months, with basic integration in the workflow of translation (source and target bulletins travelled over telex lines at the time and MT happened on a mainframe computer). The first version of the system (METEO 1) went into operation on a Control Data CDC 7600 supercomputer in March 1977.\n\nChandioux then left the TAUM group to manage its operation and improve it, while the TAUM group embarked on a different project (TAUM-aviation, 1977–81). Benoit Thouin made improvements to the initial prototype over the subsequent year, and turned it into an operational system. After three years, METEO 1 had demonstrated the feasibility of microcomputer-based machine translation to the satisfaction of the Canadian government's Translation Bureau of Public Works and Government Services Canada.\n\nMETEO 1 was formally adopted in 1981, replacing the junior translators in the workflow. Because of the need for high quality translation, the \"revision\" step, done by senior translators, was maintained. The quality, measured as the percentage of edit operations (inserting or deleting a word counts as 1, replacing as 2) on the MT results, reached 85% in 1985.\n\nUntil that time, the MT part was still implemented as a sequence of Q-systems. The Q-systems formalism is a rule-based SLLP (Specialized Language for Linguistic Programming) invented by Alain Colmerauer in 1967 as he was a postdoc \"coopérant\" at the TAUM group. He later invented the Prolog language in 1972 after returning to France and becoming a university professor in Marseille-Luminy.\n\nAs the \"engine\" of the Q-systems is highly non-deterministic, and the manipulated data structures are in some ways too simple, without any types such as string or number, Chandioux encountered limitations in his efforts to raise translation quality and lower computation time to the point he could run it on microcomputers.\n\nIn 1981, Chandioux created a new SLLP, or \"metalanguage for linguistic applications\", based on the same basic algorithmic ideas as the Q-systems, but more deterministic, and offering typed labels on tree nodes. Following the advice of Bernard Vauquois and Colmerauer, he created Gram\"R\", and developed it for microcomputers.\n\nIn 1982, he could start developing in Gram\"R \" a new system for translating the weather bulletins on a high-end Cromemco microcomputer. METEO 2 went into operation in 1983. The software then ran in 48Kb of central memory with a 5Mb hard disk for paging. METEO 2 was the first MT application to run on a microcomputer.\n\nIn 1985, the system had nothing left of the initial prototype, and was officially renamed METEO. It translated about 20 million words per year from English into French, and 10 million words from French into English, with a quality of 97%. Typically, it took 4 minutes for a bulletin in English to be sent from Winnipeg and come back in French after MT and human revision.\n\nIn 1996, Chandioux developed a special version of his system (METEO 96) which was used to translate the weather forecasts (different kinds of bulletins) issued by the US National Weather Service during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nThe last known version of the system, METEO 5, dates from 1997 and ran on an IBM PC network under Windows NT. It translated 10 pages per second, but was able to fit into a 1.44Mb floppy disk.\n"}

The population is 1,798 (2015 est.) in an area of 114.64 km². It is located 489 km west of the state capital of Porto Alegre and northeast of Alegrete.\n\nAs is the case in many of its surrounding municipalities, listed below, the Riograndenser Hunsrückisch language is spoken in Mato Queimado since pioneer days and has been intrinsic to its history. Although technically a language, it is commonly referred to as a dialect of the German language. In recent years the Portuguese translation of its name is gaining wider use throughout Brazil: \"hunsriqueano riograndense\" (no caps in Port.). However, the majority of estimated three millions native speakers of Riograndenser Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul mostly often refer to their language simply as \"Deitsch\" or \"Hunsrückisch\", and the majority of them probably do not recognize the term \"hunsriqueano\", as used in academia and presently more and more in the larger cultural context (i.e. internet, social media, etc.).\n\nThe establishment of this community dates back to 1919, and its original settlers were all German Brazilian, as well documented, most originating from the neighboring municipality of Cerro Largo (then called \"Serro Azul\") and some from the eastern \"Altkolonie\" (trans.: Old Colony; in Port.: Colônia Velha) region of state. Therefore, all the founders of the community were native speakers of the variety of Hunsrückisch spoken in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, a Germanic language which is in fact uniquely Brazilian (there are two much smaller pockets of Hunsrückisch speakers in Brazil, located on the Atlantic coast of Santa Catarina state and in the mountains of the state of Espirito Santo). \n\nAlthough Riograndenser Hunsrückisch has a relatively large number of native speakers, the vast majority are also being fluent in the national language, many if not the majority of their children are not learning their parents mother tongue. This situation can be observed in Mato Queimado as well as in many localities with a similar profile found throughout the state of Rio Grande do Sul and also in neighboring regions outside the state where the language is spoken. However, there a few notable exceptions, as well documented by published research (See Altenhofen, cited above), affording some stability to this regional language. Nonetheless, given the overall language shift towards the dominant Brazilian language, Hunsrückisch has been officially classified as endangered for quite some time by world languages' monitoring organizations such as Ethnologue. \n\nThere are many complex factors and interwoven dynamics that help explain the status quo of this language and its very pronounced lack of social prestige, centrally among them are the specific public policies enacted by Brazil's dictator Getúlio Vargas during II World War with his \"Nationalization Campaign\", the \"Campanha de Nacionalização\", which aimed aggressively at the eradication non-autochthonous minority languages both from public as well as privet life. Long after Vargas' linguistic legislation was officially suspended, its effect can still be observed among members of communities such as Mato Queimado (See Stigma management).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "175918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175918", "title": "Moksha", "text": "Moksha\n\nMoksha (; , \"\"), also called vimoksha, vimukti and mukti, is a term in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism which refers to various forms of emancipation, enlightenment, liberation, and release. In its soteriological and eschatological senses, it refers to freedom from \"saṃsāra\", the cycle of death and rebirth. In its epistemological and psychological senses, \"moksha\" refers to freedom from ignorance: self-realization, self-actualization and self-knowledge.\n\nIn Hindu traditions, \"moksha\" is a central concept and the utmost aim to be attained through three paths during human life; these three paths are \"dharma\" (virtuous, proper, moral life), \"artha\" (material prosperity, income security, means of life), and \"kama\" (pleasure, sensuality, emotional fulfillment). Together, these four concepts are called Puruṣārtha in Hinduism.\n\nIn some schools of Indian religions, \"moksha\" is considered equivalent to and used interchangeably with other terms such as \"vimoksha\", \"vimukti\", \"kaivalya\", \"apavarga\", \"mukti\", \"nihsreyasa\" and \"nirvana\". However, terms such as \"moksha\" and \"nirvana\" differ and mean different states between various schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The term nirvana is more common in Buddhism, while \"moksha\" is more prevalent in Hinduism.\n\n\"Moksha\" is derived from the root , ', which means free, let go, release, liberate. In Vedas and early Upanishads, the word , ' appears, which means to be set free or release, such as of a horse from its harness.\n\nThe definition and meaning of \"moksha\" varies between various schools of Indian religions. \"Moksha\" means freedom, liberation; from what and how is where the schools differ. \"Moksha\" is also a concept that means liberation from rebirth or \"saṃsāra\". This liberation can be attained while one is on earth (\"jivanmukti\"), or eschatologically (\"karmamukti\", \"videhamukti\"). Some Indian traditions have emphasized liberation on concrete, ethical action within the world. This liberation is an epistemological transformation that permits one to see the truth and reality behind the fog of ignorance.\n\n\"Moksha\" has been defined not merely as absence of suffering and release from bondage to \"saṃsāra\", various schools of Hinduism also explain the concept as presence of the state of \"paripurna-brahmanubhava\" (the experience of oneness with Brahman, the One Supreme Self), a state of knowledge, peace and bliss. For example, Vivekachudamani - an ancient book on \"moksha\", explains one of many meditative steps on the path to \"moksha\", as:\n\nMoksha has been defined in the book \"Sulightenment by Fathor\" \"Moksha is the State of Universe that having the liberation from the physical aspect. You liberate from the material aspects of life that you are in.\"\n\n\"Moksha\" is a concept associated with \"saṃsāra\" (birth-rebirth cycle). \"Samsara\" originated with religious movements in the first millennium BCE. These movements such as Buddhism, Jainism and new schools within Hinduism, saw human life as bondage to a repeated process of rebirth. This bondage to repeated rebirth and life, each life subject to injury, disease and aging, was seen as a cycle of suffering. By release from this cycle, the suffering involved in this cycle also ended. This release was called \"moksha\", \"nirvana\", \"kaivalya\", \"mukti\" and other terms in various Indian religious traditions.\n\nEschatological ideas evolved in Hinduism. In earliest Vedic literature, heaven and hell sufficed soteriological curiosities. Over time, the ancient scholars observed that people vary in the quality of virtuous or sinful life they lead, and began questioning how differences in each person's \"puṇya\" (merit, good deeds) or \"pāp\" (demerit, sin) as human beings affected their afterlife. This question led to the conception of an afterlife where the person stayed in heaven or hell, in proportion to their merit or demerit, then returned to earth and were reborn, the cycle continuing indefinitely. The rebirth idea ultimately flowered into the ideas of \"saṃsāra\", or transmigration - where one's balance sheet of \"karma\" determined one's rebirth. Along with this idea of \"saṃsāra\", the ancient scholars developed the concept of \"moksha\", as a state that released a person from the \"saṃsāra\" cycle. \"Moksha\" release in eschatological sense in these ancient literature of Hinduism, suggests van Buitenen, comes from self-knowledge and consciousness of oneness of supreme soul.\n\nScholars provide various explanations of the meaning of \"moksha\" in epistemological and psychological senses. For example, Deutsche sees \"moksha\" as transcendental consciousness, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of \"realizing the whole universe as the Self\".\n\n\"Moksha\" in Hinduism, suggests Klaus Klostermaier, implies a setting-free of hitherto fettered faculties, a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life, permitting a person to be more truly a person in the full sense; the concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity, compassion and understanding which had been blocked and shut out. \"Moksha\" is more than liberation from a life-rebirth cycle of suffering (\"samsara\"); the Vedantic school separates this into two: \"jivanmukti\" (liberation in this life) and \"videhamukti\" (liberation after death). \"Moksha\" in this life includes psychological liberation from \"adhyasa\" (fears besetting one's life) and \"avidya\" (ignorance or anything that is not true knowledge).\n\nMany schools of Hinduism according to Daniel Ingalls, see \"moksha\" as a state of perfection. The concept was seen as a natural goal beyond \"dharma\". \"Moksha\", in the epics and ancient literature of Hinduism, is seen as achievable by the same techniques necessary to practice \"dharma\". Self-discipline is the path to \"dharma\", \"moksha\" is self-discipline that is so perfect that it becomes unconscious, second nature. \"Dharma\" is thus a means to \"moksha\".\n\nThe Samkhya school of Hinduism, for example, suggests that one of the paths to \"moksha\" is to magnify one's \"sattvam\". To magnify one's \"sattvam\", one must develop oneself where one's \"sattvam\" becomes one's instinctive nature. Many schools of Hinduism thus understood \"dharma\" and \"moksha\" as two points of a single journey of life, a journey for which the \"viaticum\" was discipline and self-training. Over time, these ideas about \"moksha\" were challenged.\n\n\"Dharma\" and \"moksha\", suggested Nagarjuna in the 2nd century, cannot be goals on the same journey. He pointed to the differences between the world we live in, and the freedom implied in the concept of \"moksha\". They are so different that \"dharma\" and \"moksha\" could not be intellectually related. \"Dharma\" requires worldly thought, \"moksha\" is unworldly understanding, a state of bliss. How can the worldly thought-process lead to unworldly understanding? asked Nagarjuna. Karl Potter explains the answer to this challenge as one of context and framework, the emergence of broader general principles of understanding from thought processes that are limited in one framework.\n\nAdi Shankara in the 8th century AD, like Nagarjuna earlier, examined the difference between the world one lives in and \"moksha\", a state of freedom and release one hopes for. Unlike Nagarjuna, Shankara considers the characteristics between the two. The world one lives in requires action as well as thought; our world, he suggests, is impossible without \"vyavahara\" (action and plurality). The world is interconnected, one object works on another, input is transformed into output, change is continuous and everywhere. \"Moksha\", suggests Shankara, is that final perfect, blissful state where there can be no change, where there can be no plurality of states. It has to be a state of thought and consciousness that excludes action. How can action-oriented techniques by which we attain the first three goals of man (\"kama\", \"artha\" and \"dharma\") be useful to attain the last goal, namely \"moksha\"?\n\nScholars suggest Shankara's challenge to the concept of \"moksha\" parallels those of Plotinus against the Gnostics, with one important difference: Plotinus accused the Gnostics of exchanging an anthropocentric set of virtues with a theocentric set in pursuit of salvation; Shankara challenged that the concept of \"moksha\" implied an exchange of anthropocentric set of virtues (\"dharma\") with a blissful state that has no need for values. Shankara goes on to suggest that anthropocentric virtues suffice.\n\nVaishnavism, one of the \"bhakti\" schools of Hinduism, is devoted to the worship of God, sings his name, anoints his image or idol, and has many sub-schools. Vaishnavas (followers of Vaishnavism) suggest that \"dharma\" and \"moksha\" cannot be two different or sequential goals or states of life.\nInstead, they suggest God should be kept in mind constantly to simultaneously achieve \"dharma\" and \"moksha\", so constantly that one comes to feel one cannot live without God's loving presence. This school emphasized love and adoration of God as the path to \"moksha\" (salvation and release), rather than works and knowledge. Their focus became divine virtues, rather than anthropocentric virtues. Daniel Ingalls regards Vaishnavas' position on \"moksha\" as similar to the Christian position on salvation, and Vaishnavism as the school whose views on \"dharma\", \"karma\" and \"moksha\" dominated the initial impressions and colonial-era literature on Hinduism, through the works of Thibaut, Max Müller and others.\n\nThe concept of \"moksha\" appears much later in ancient Indian literature than the concept of \"dharma\". The proto-concept that first appears in the ancient Sanskrit verses and early Upanishads is \"mucyate\", which means freed or released. It is the middle and later Upanishads, such as the Svetasvatara and Maitri, where the word \"moksha\" appears and begins becoming an important concept.\n\nKathaka Upanishad, a middle Upanishadic era script dated to be about 2500 years old, is among the earliest expositions about \"saṃsāra\" and \"moksha\". In Book I, Section III, the legend of boy Naciketa queries Yama, the lord of death to explain what causes \"saṃsāra\" and what leads to liberation. Naciketa inquires: what causes sorrow? Yama explains that suffering and \"saṃsāra\" results from a life that is lived absent-mindedly, with impurity, with neither the use of intelligence nor self-examination, where neither mind nor senses are guided by one's \"atma\" (soul, self). Liberation comes from a life lived with inner purity, alert mind, led by \"buddhi\" (reason, intelligence), realization of the Supreme Self (\"purusha\") who dwells in all beings. Kathaka Upanishad asserts knowledge liberates, knowledge is freedom. Kathaka Upanishad also explains the role of yoga in personal liberation, \"moksha\".\n\nSvetasvatara Upanishad, another middle era Upanishad written after Kathaka Upanishad, begins with questions such as why is man born, what is the primal cause behind the universe, what causes joy and sorrow in life? It then examines the various theories, that were then existing, about saṃsāra and release from bondage. Svetasvatara claims bondage results from ignorance, illusion or delusion; deliverance comes from knowledge. The Supreme Being dwells in every being, he is the primal cause, he is the eternal law, he is the essence of everything, he is nature, he is not a separate entity. Liberation comes to those who know Supreme Being is present as the Universal Spirit and Principle, just as they know butter is present in milk. Such realization, claims Svetasvatara, come from self-knowledge and self-discipline; and this knowledge and realization is liberation from transmigration, the final goal of the Upanishad.\nStarting with the middle Upanishad era, \"moksha\" - or equivalent terms such as \"mukti\" and \"kaivalya\" - is a major theme in many Upanishads. For example, Sarasvati Rahasya Upanishad, one of several Upanishads of the bhakti school of Hinduism, starts out with prayers to Goddess Sarasvati. She is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning and creative arts; her name is a compound word of ‘‘sara’’ and ‘‘sva’’, meaning \"essence of self\". After the prayer verses, the Upanishad inquires about the secret to freedom and liberation (mukti). Sarasvati's reply in the Upanishad is:\n\nThe concept of \"moksha\", according to Daniel Ingalls, represented one of many expansions in Hindu Vedic ideas of life and afterlife. In the Vedas, there were three stages of life: studentship, householdship and retirement. During the Upanishadic era, Hinduism expanded this to include a fourth stage of life: complete abandonment. In Vedic literature, there are three modes of experience: waking, dream and deep sleep. The Upanishadic era expanded it to include \"turiyam\" - the stage beyond deep sleep. The Vedas suggest three goals of man: kama, artha and dharma. To these, the Upanishadic era added \"moksha\".\n\nThe acceptance of the concept of \"moksha\" in some schools of Hindu philosophy was slow. These refused to recognize \"moksha\" for centuries, considering it irrelevant. The Mimamsa school, for example, denied the goal and relevance of \"moksha\" well into the 8th century AD, until the arrival of a Mimamsa scholar named Kumarila. Instead of \"moksha\", Mimamsa school of Hinduism considered the concept of heaven as sufficient to answer the question: what lay beyond this world after death. Other schools of Hinduism, over time, accepted the \"moksha\" concept and refined it over time.\n\nIt is unclear when the core ideas of samsara and \"moksha\" were developed in ancient India. Patrick Olivelle suggests these ideas likely originated with new religious movements in the first millennium BCE. \"Mukti\" and \"moksha\" ideas, suggests J. A. B. van Buitenen, seem traceable to yogis in Hinduism, with long hair, who chose to live on the fringes of society, given to self-induced states of intoxication and ecstasy, possibly accepted as medicine men and \"sadhus\" by the ancient Indian society. \"Moksha\" to these early concept developers, was the abandonment of the established order, not in favor of anarchy, but in favor of self-realization, to achieve release from this world.\n\nIn its historical development, the concept of \"moksha\" appears in three forms: Vedic, yogic and bhakti. In the Vedic period, \"moksha\" was ritualistic. Mokṣa was claimed to result from properly completed rituals such as those before \"Agni\" - the fire deity. The significance of these rituals was to reproduce and recite the cosmic creation event described in the Vedas; the description of knowledge on different levels - \"adhilokam\", \"adhibhutam\", \"adhiyajnam\", \"adhyatmam\" - helped the individual transcend to moksa. Knowledge was the means, the ritual its application. By the middle to late Upanishadic period, the emphasis shifted to knowledge, and ritual activities were considered irrelevant to the attainment of \"moksha\". Yogic \"moksha\" replaced Vedic rituals with personal development and meditation, with hierarchical creation of the ultimate knowledge in self as the path to \"moksha\". Yogic \"moksha\" principles were accepted in many other schools of Hinduism, albeit with differences. For example, Adi Shankara in his book on \"moksha\" suggests:\n\nBhakti \"moksha\" created the third historical path, where neither rituals nor meditative self-development were the way, rather it was inspired by constant love and contemplation of God, which over time results in a perfect union with God. Some Bhakti schools evolved their ideas where God became the means and the end, transcending \"moksha\"; the fruit of bhakti is bhakti itself. In the history of Indian religious traditions, additional ideas and paths to \"moksha\" beyond these three, appeared over time.\n\nThe words \"moksha\", nirvana (\"nibbana\") and kaivalya are sometimes used synonymously, because they all refer to the state that liberates a person from all causes of sorrow and suffering. However, in modern era literature, these concepts have different premises in different religions. Nirvana, a concept common in Buddhism, is a state of realization that there is no self (no soul) and Emptiness; while \"moksha\", a concept common in many schools of Hinduism, is acceptance of Self (soul), realization of liberating knowledge, the consciousness of Oneness with Brahman, all existence and understanding the whole universe as the Self. Nirvana starts with the premise that there is no Self, \"moksha\" on the other hand, starts with the premise that everything is the Self; there is no consciousness in the state of nirvana, but everything is One unified consciousness in the state of \"moksha\".\n\nKaivalya, a concept akin to \"moksha\", rather than nirvana, is found in some schools of Hinduism such as the Yoga school. Kaivalya is the realization of aloofness with liberating knowledge of one's self and union with the spiritual universe. For example, Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra suggests:\nNirvana and \"moksha\", in all traditions, represents a state of being in ultimate reality and perfection, but described in a very different way. Some scholars, states Jayatilleke, assert that the Nirvana of Buddhism is same as the Brahman in Hinduism, a view other scholars and he disagree with. Buddhism rejects the idea of Brahman, and the metaphysical ideas about soul (atman) are also rejected by Buddhism, while those ideas are essential to \"moksha\" in Hinduism. In Buddhism, nirvana is 'blowing out' or 'extinction'. In Hinduism, \"moksha\" is 'identity or oneness with Brahman'. Realization of \"anatta\" (anatman) is essential to Buddhist nirvana. Realization of \"atman\" (atta) is essential to Hindu \"moksha\".\n\nAncient literature of different schools of Hinduism sometimes use different phrases for \"moksha\". For example, \"Keval jnana\" or \"kaivalya\" (\"state of Absolute\"), \"Apavarga\", \"Nihsreyasa\", \"Paramapada\", \"Brahmabhava\", \"Brahmajnana\" and \"Brahmi sthiti\". Modern literature additionally uses the Buddhist term nirvana interchangeably with \"moksha\" of Hinduism. There is difference between these ideas, as explained elsewhere in this article, but they are all soteriological concepts of various Indian religious traditions.\n\nThe six major orthodox schools of Hinduism have had a historic debate, and disagree over whether \"moksha\" can be achieved in this life, or only after this life. Many of the 108 Upanishads discuss amongst other things \"moksha\". These discussions show the differences between the schools of Hinduism, a lack of consensus, with a few attempting to conflate the contrasting perspectives between various schools. For example, freedom and deliverance from birth-rebirth, argues Maitrayana Upanishad, comes neither from the Vedanta school's doctrine (the knowledge of one's own Self as the Supreme Soul) nor from the Samkhya school's doctrine (distinction of the Purusha from what one is not), but from Vedic studies, observance of the \"Svadharma\" (personal duties), sticking to \"Asramas\" (stages of life).\n\nThe six major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy offer the following views on \"moksha\", each for their own reasons: the Nyaya, Vaisesika and Mimamsa schools of Hinduism consider \"moksha\" as possible only after death. Samkhya and Yoga schools consider \"moksha\" as possible in this life. In Vedanta school, the Advaita sub-school concludes \"moksha\" is possible in this life, while Dvaita and Visistadvaita sub-schools of Vedanta tradition believes that \"moksha\" is a continuous event, one assisted by loving devotion to God, that extends from this life to post-mortem. Beyond these six orthodox schools, some heterodox schools of Hindu tradition, such as Carvaka, deny there is a soul or after life \"moksha\".\n\nBoth Sāmkhya and Yoga systems of religious thought are \"mokshaśāstras\", suggests , they are systems of salvific liberation and release. Sāmkhya is a system of interpretation, primarily a theory about the world. Yoga is both a theory and a practice. Yoga gained wide acceptance in ancient India, its ideas and practices became part of many religious schools in Hinduism, including those that were very different from Sāmkhya. The eight limbs of yoga can be interpreted as a way to liberation (\"moksha\").\n\nIn Sāmkhya literature, liberation is commonly referred to as \"kaivalya\". In this school, kaivalya means the realization of \"purusa\", the principle of consciousness, as independent from mind and body, as different from \"prakrti\". Like many schools of Hinduism, in Sāmkhya and Yoga schools, the emphasis is on the attainment of knowledge, \"vidyā\" or \"jñāna\", as necessary for salvific liberation, \"moksha\". Yoga's purpose is then seen as a means to remove the \"avidyā\" - that is, ignorance or misleading/incorrect knowledge about one self and the universe. It seeks to end ordinary reflexive awareness (\"cittavrtti nirodhah\") with deeper, purer and holistic awareness (\"asamprājñāta samādhi\"). Yoga, during the pursuit of \"moksha\", encourages practice (\"abhyāsa\") with detachment (\"vairāgya\"), which over time leads to deep concentration (\"samādhi\"). Detachment means withdrawal from outer world and calming of mind, while practice means the application of effort over time. Such steps are claimed by Yoga school as leading to samādhi, a state of deep awareness, release and bliss called \"kaivalya\".\nYoga, or \"mārga\", in Hinduism is widely classified into four spiritual practices. The first mārga is Jñāna Yoga, the way of knowledge. The second mārga is Bhakti Yoga, the way of loving devotion to God. The third mārga is Karma Yoga, the way of works. The fourth mārga is Rāja Yoga, the way of contemplation and meditation. These mārgas are part of different schools in Hinduism, and their definition and methods to \"moksha\". For example, the Advaita Vedanta school relies on Jñāna Yoga in its teachings of \"moksha\".\n\nThe three main sub-schools in Vedanta school of Hinduism - Advaita Vedanta, Vishistadvaita and Dvaita - each have their own views about \"moksha\".\n\nThe Vedantic school of Hinduism suggests the first step towards mokṣa begins with \"mumuksutva\", that is desire of liberation. This takes the form of questions about self, what is true, why do things or events make us happy or cause suffering, and so on. This longing for liberating knowledge is assisted by, claims Adi Shankara of Advaita Vedanta, guru (teacher), study of historical knowledge and viveka (critical thinking). Shankara cautions that the guru and historic knowledge may be distorted, so traditions and historical assumptions must be questioned by the individual seeking \"moksha\". Those who are on their path to \"moksha\" (samnyasin), suggests Klaus Klostermaier, are quintessentially free individuals, without craving for anything in the worldly life, thus are neither dominated by, nor dominating anyone else.\n\nVivekachudamani, which literally means \"Crown Jewel of Discriminatory Reasoning\", is a book devoted to moksa in Vedanta philosophy. It explains what behaviors and pursuits lead to \"moksha\", as well what actions and assumptions hinder \"moksha\". The four essential conditions, according to Vivekachudamani, before one can commence on the path of \"moksha\" include (1) \"vivekah\" (discrimination, critical reasoning) between everlasting principles and fleeting world; (2) \"viragah\" (indifference, lack of craving) for material rewards; (3) \"samah\" (calmness of mind), and (4) \"damah\" (self restraint, temperance). The \"Brahmasutrabhasya\" adds to the above four requirements, the following: \"uparati\" (lack of bias, dispassion), \"titiksa\" (endurance, patience), \"sraddha\" (faith) and \"samadhana\" (intentness, commitment).\n\nThe Advaita tradition considers \"moksha\" achievable by removing avidya (ignorance). \"Moksha\" is seen as a final release from illusion, and through knowledge (\"anubhava\") of one's own fundamental nature, which is Satcitananda. Advaita holds there is no being/non-being distinction between \"Atman\", \"Brahman\", and \"Paramatman\". The knowledge of Brahman leads to \"moksha\", where Brahman is described as that which is the origin and end of all things, the universal principle behind and at source of everything that exists, consciousness that pervades everything and everyone. Advaita Vedanta emphasizes Jnana Yoga as the means of achieving \"moksha\". Bliss, claims this school, is the fruit of knowledge (vidya) and work (karma).\n\nThe Dvaita (dualism) traditions define \"moksha\" as the loving, eternal union with God (Vishnu) and considered the highest perfection of existence. Dvaita schools suggest every soul encounters liberation differently. Dualist schools (e.g. Vaishnava) see God as the object of love, for example, a personified monotheistic conception of Shiva or Vishnu. By immersing oneself in the love of God, one's karmas slough off, one's illusions decay, and truth is lived. Both the worshiped and worshiper gradually lose their illusory sense of separation and only One beyond all names remains. This is salvation to dualist schools of Hinduism. Dvaita Vedanta emphasizes Bhakti Yoga as the means of achieving \"moksha\".\n\nThe Vishistadvaita tradition, led by Ramanuja, defines avidya and \"moksha\" differently from the Advaita tradition. To Ramanuja, avidya is a focus on the self, and vidya is a focus on a loving god. The Vishistadvaita school argues that other schools of Hinduism create a false sense of agency in individuals, which makes the individual think oneself as potential or self-realized god. Such ideas, claims Ramanuja, decay to materialism, hedonism and self worship. Individuals forget \"Ishvara\" (God). Mukti, to Vishistadvaita school, is release from such avidya, towards the intuition and eternal union with God (Vishnu).\n\nAmong the Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hinduism, liberation and freedom reached within one's life is referred to as \"jivanmukti\", and the individual who has experienced this state is called \"jivanmukta\" (self-realized person). Dozens of Upanishads, including those from middle Upanishadic period, mention or describe the state of liberation, \"jivanmukti\". Some contrast \"jivanmukti\" with \"videhamukti\" (\"moksha\" from samsara after death). Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the liberated individual shows attributes such as:\n\nWhen a Jivanmukta dies he achieves Paramukti and becomes a Paramukta. Jivanmukta experience enlightenment and liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences enlightenment and liberation only after death.\n\nBalinese Hinduism incorporates \"moksha\" as one of five tattwas. The other four are: \"brahman\" (the one supreme god head, not to be confused with Brahmin), \"atma\" (soul or spirit), karma (actions and reciprocity, causality), \"samsara\" (principle of rebirth, reincarnation). \"Moksha\", in Balinese Hindu belief, is the possibility of unity with the divine; it is sometimes referred to as nirwana.\n\nIn Buddhism the term \"moksha\" is uncommon, but an equivalent term is \"vimutti\", \"release\". In the suttas two forms of release are mentioned, namely \"ceto-vimutti\", \"deliverance of mind,\" and \"panna-vimutti\", \"deliverance through wisdom\" (insight). \"Ceto-vimutti\" is related to the practice of dhyana, while \"panna-vimutti\" is related to the development of insight. According to Gombrich, the distinction may be a later development, which resulted in a change of doctrine, regarding the practice of dhyana to be insufficient for final liberation.\n\nWith release comes Nirvana (Pali: Nibbana), “blowing out”, \"quenching\", or “becoming extinguished” of the fires of the passions and of self-view. It is a \"timeless state\" in which there is no more becoming.\n\nNirvana ends the cycle of \"Dukkha\" and rebirth in the six realms of Saṃsāra (Buddhism). It is part of the Four Noble Truths doctrine of Buddhism, which plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism. Nirvana has been described in Buddhist texts in a manner similar to other Indian religions, as the state of complete liberation, enlightenment, highest happiness, bliss, fearless, freedom, dukkha-less, permanence, non-dependent origination, unfathomable, indescribable. It has also been described as a state of release marked by \"emptiness\" and realization of \"non-Self\". Such descriptions, states Peter Harvey, are contested by scholars because nirvana in Buddhism is ultimately described as a state of \"stopped consciousness (blown out), but one that is not non-existent\", and \"it seems impossible to imagine what awareness devoid of any object would be like\".\n\nIn Jainism, \"moksha\" and \"nirvana\" are one and the same. Jaina texts sometimes use the term \"Kevalya\", and call the liberated soul as \"Kevalin\". As with all Indian religions, \"moksha\" is the ultimate spiritual goal in Jainism. It defines \"moksha\" as the spiritual release from all karma.\n\nJainism is a Sramanic non-theistic philosophy, that like Hinduism and unlike Buddhism, believes in a metaphysical permanent self or soul often termed \"jiva\". Jaina believe that this soul is what transmigrates from one being to another at the time of death. The \"moksa\" state is attained when a soul (\"atman\") is liberated from the cycles of deaths and rebirths (\"saṃsāra\"), is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a \"siddha\". In Jainism, it is believed to be a stage beyond enlightenment and ethical perfection, states Paul Dundas, because they can perform physical and mental activities such as teach, without accruing karma that leads to rebirth.\n\nJaina traditions believe that there exist \"Abhavya\" (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain \"moksha\" (liberation). The \"Abhavya\" state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act, but Jaina texts also polemically applied \"Abhavya\" condition to those who belonged to a competing ancient Indian tradition called \"Ājīvika\". A male human being is considered closest to the apex of \"moksha\", with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. The ability of women to attain \"moksha\" has been historically debated, and the subtraditions with Jainism have disagreed. In the Digambara tradition of Jainism, women must live an ethical life and gain karmic merit to be reborn as a man, because only males can achieve spiritual liberation. In contrast, the Śvētāmbara tradition has believed that women too can attain \"moksha\" just like men.\n\nThe Sikh concept of mukti (\"moksha\") is similar to other Indian religions, and refers to spiritual liberation. It is described in Sikhism as the state that breaks the cycle of rebirths. Mukti is obtained according to Sikhism, states Singha, through \"God's grace\". According to the Guru Granth Sahib, the devotion to God is viewed as more important than the desire for \"Mukti\".\n\nSikhism recommends Naam Simran as the way to mukti, which is meditating and repeating the \"Naam\" (names of God).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52599", "title": "Monoculture", "text": "Monoculture\n\nMonoculture is the agricultural practice of producing or growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time. Polyculture, where more than one crop is grown in the same space at the same time, is the alternative to monoculture. Monoculture is widely used in both industrial farming and organic farming and has allowed increased efficiency in planting and harvest.\n\nContinuous monoculture, or monocropping, where the same species is grown year after year, can lead to the quicker buildup of pests and diseases, and then rapid spread where a uniform crop is susceptible to a pathogen. The practice has been criticized for its environmental effects and for putting the food supply chain at risk. Diversity can be added both in time, as with a crop rotation or sequence, or in space, with a polyculture. \nOligoculture has been suggested to describe a crop rotation of just a few crops, as is practiced by several regions of the world.\n\nThe term monoculture is frequently applied for other uses to describe any group dominated by a single variety, e.g. social monoculturalism, or in the field of musicology to describe the dominance of the American and British music-industries in Western pop music, or in the field of computer science to describe a group of computers all running identical software.\nThe term is used in agriculture and describes the practice of planting the same cultivar over an extended area. Each cultivar has the same standardized planting, maintenance and harvesting requirements resulting in greater yields and lower costs. For example, researchers have discovered a native plant to Senegal, called Guiera senegalensis, grown next to millet increased millet production roughly 900 percent.\n\nIt also is beneficial because a crop can be tailor-planted for a location that has special problems – like soil salt or drought or a short growing season.\n\nWhen a crop is matched to its well-managed environment, a monoculture can produce higher yields than a polyculture. In the last 40 years, modern practices such as monoculture planting and the use of synthesized fertilizers have reduced the amount of additional land needed to produce food. However, planting the same crop in the same place each year depletes the nutrients from the earth that the plant relies on and leaves soil weak and unable to support healthy plant growth. Because soil structure and quality is so poor, farmers are forced to use chemical fertilizers to encourage plant growth and fruit production. These fertilizers, in turn, disrupt the natural makeup of the soil and contribute further to nutrient depletion. Monocropping also creates the spread of pests and diseases, which have to be treated with yet more chemicals. The effects of monocropping on the environment are severe when pesticides and fertilizers make their way into ground water or become airborne, creating pollution.\n\nIn forestry, monoculture refers to the planting of one species of tree. Monoculture plantings provide greater yields and more efficient harvesting than natural stands of trees. Single-species stands of trees are often the natural way trees grow, but the stands show a diversity in tree sizes, with dead trees mixed with mature and young trees. In forestry, monoculture stands that are planted and harvested as a unit provide limited resources for wildlife that depend on dead trees and openings, since all the trees are the same size; they are most often harvested by clearcutting, which drastically alters the habitat. The mechanical harvesting of trees can compact soils, which can adversely affect understory growth. Single-species planting also causes trees to be more vulnerable when they are infected with a pathogen, or attacked by insects, or affected by adverse environmental conditions.\n\nExamples of monoculture include lawns and most fields of wheat or corn. The term is also used where a single breed of farm animal is raised in large-scale concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). In the United States, The Livestock Conservancy was formed to protect nearly 200 endangered livestock breeds from going extinct, largely due to the increased reliance on just a handful of highly specialized breeds.\nCrops used in agriculture are usually single strains that have been bred for high yield and for resistance to certain common diseases. Given that all plants in a monoculture are genetically similar, if a disease strikes to which they have no resistance, it can destroy entire populations of crops. Polyculture, the mixing of different crops, reduces the likelihood that one or more of the crops will be resistant to any particular pathogen. Studies have shown that planting a mixture of crop strains in the same field can combat disease effectively. Ending monocultures grown under disease conditions by introducing crop diversity has greatly increased yields. In one study in China, the planting of several varieties of rice in the same field increased yields of non-resistant strains by 89% compared to non-resistant strains grown in monoculture, largely because of a dramatic (94%) decrease in the incidence of disease, making pesticides less necessary. the wheat leaf-rust fungus occasioned a great deal of worry internationally, having already decimated wheat crops in Uganda and Kenya, and having started to make inroads into Asia as well. Given the very genetically similar strains of much of the world's wheat crops following the Green Revolution, the impacts of such diseases threaten agricultural production worldwide.\n\nIn Ireland, exclusive use of one variety of potato, the \"lumper\", led to the Great Famine of 1845-1849. Lumpers provided inexpensive food to feed the Irish masses. Potatoes were propagated vegetatively with little to no genetic variation. \nWhen \"Phytophthora infestans\" arrived in Ireland from the Americas in 1845, the lumper had no resistance to the disease, leading to the nearly complete failure of the potato crop across Ireland. Had the farmers used multiple varieties of potato, the famine might not have occurred.\n\nMany of today's livestock production systems rely on just a handful of highly specialized breeds. Focusing heavily on a single trait (output) may come at the expense of other desirable traits - such as fertility, resistance to disease, vigor, and mothering instincts. In the early 1990s a few Holstein calves were observed to grow poorly and died in the first 6 months of life. They were all found to be homozygous for a mutation in the gene that caused Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency. This mutation was found at a high frequency in Holstein populations worldwide. (15% among bulls in the US, 10% in Germany, and 16% in Japan.) Researchers studying the pedigrees of affected and carrier animals tracked the source of the mutation to a single bull that was widely used in the industry. Note that in 1990 there were approximately 4 million Holstein cattle in the US, making the affected population around 600,000 animals.\n\nHumans rely heavily on a relatively small number of food crops and farm animals for food. If disease hits a major food crop - as happened during the 19th-century Irish potato famine - food supplies for large populations could come under threat. Maintaining and increasing biodiversity in agriculture could help safeguard world food-supplies.\n\nMonocultural land-use can have effects at the level of society. Seasonal peaks in harvesting activity can place demands on labor availability.\n\nThe environmental movement seeks to change popular culture by redefining the \"perfect lawn\" to be something other than a turf monoculture, and seeks agricultural policy that provides greater encouragement for more diverse cropping systems. Local food systems may also encourage growing multiple species and a wide variety of crops at the same time and same place. Heirloom gardening and raising heritage livestock breeds have come about largely as a reaction against monocultures in agriculture.\n\n\n"}

It is spoken largely in Colombia, but is also the principal language of the Darien Gap in Panama.The Emberá language is divided into two branches: Northern and Southern. Two prominent Northern groups are Emberá Darien and Katio. The Katio language is spoken by 10,000 - 20,000 people, who's literacy rate is at 1%. The Darien Emberá language is spoken by 9,000-10,000 people.\n\nNorthern Emberá is a dialect that comes from Embera which is part of the Chocó family. The Chocó family includes two languages, Waunana and the group of the Emberá dialects. The Emberá dialects form a dialectal continuum with two geographically defined subgroups: the Northern branch contains the Proper Northern Emberá (referred to as ‘Northern Emberá’ in Mortensen 1999) and the Katío dialect.\n\nThe Waunanas and Emberás are the last remnants of a larger group of Pre-Columbian ethnies, such as the Orominas, the Chancos, the Guarras, the Burrumías, that were diminished during the Colonial period. Genetic findings show that the speakers of Chocó languages are genetically differentiated from the Chibcha speaking tribes of Northern Colombia and cluster with the Orinoquian and Amazonian indigenous populations. Waunana and Emberá share a large number of cognates (estimated to 50% by Loewen 1960: 12), which provide evidence for their common origin. However, there is no clear evidence in terms of a sufficient number of cognates for a common origin of Chocó with other South or Central American families.\n\nThe majority of the Katio language are found along the Upper Sinu, San Jorge, San Pedro and Murri Rivers of northwestern Colombia with a few living in Panama. The majority of Darien Embera speakers live in Panama with approximately 2,000 living in northwestern Colombia on the Atrato River.\n\nKatio's phoneme inventory contains 16 consonants (p, t, dɮ , t͡ʃʼ, k, b, d, g, s, h, m, n, r, u) and 6 vowels, both oral and nasal (a, e, i, o, u, ɨ). Darien Embera's phoneme inventory contains 17 consonants (p, t, k, b, d, dɮ, t͡ʃʼ, g, s, h, z, r, t, w, j) and 6 vowels, oral and nasal (a, e, i, o, u, ɨ).\n\nThe Chocó languages show the properties of head-final languages: OV order, postpositions, embedded verbs preceding matrix verbs. At the clausal level, the basic order is SOV with some flexibility used for discourse purposes.\n\nThe neutral order in the noun phrase is: [DP D [QP [AP [NP N] A ] Q ]. Determiners (D) precede the noun (N), while adjectives (A) and quantifiers (Q) are postnominal in the neutral configuration. Determiners include demonstratives, some indexical elements, as well as the definite determiner. The definite article is also used for the nominalization of non-nominal constituents.\n\nVerb clusters are linearized in a head-final pattern. The auxiliary follows the lexical verb, and the matrix verb follows the embedded verb. With non-verbal predicates, the auxiliary follows the predicative element. For example:\n\nNorthern Emberá:\n\n\"Ẽpẽrã-ra porekea b-ɯ-a.\"\n\nperson-ABS fat be-PRS-DECL\n\n‘\"The man is fat.’\"\n\nReduplication is very productive and may be total, or partial. It is frequently used for the derivation of adjectives, and verbs. Verbs formed through reduplication have an iterative or durative interpretation. Reduplication is used to lessen the intensity of both verbs and adjectives. \nIn Chocó languages, the nasal feature spreads throughout a nasal morpheme, affecting vowels, sonorants and voiced obstruents. In Northern Emberá, regressive nasalization is reported to appear only with some speakers. The domain of nasalization is blocked by voiceless obstruents as well as by the multiple vibrant /r/.\n\nNumber is marked on nouns and verbs. The singular is generally unmarked, while the plural is overtly marked. Within the noun phrase, plural is marked on the head, which is either a noun or a pronoun. Nominal plural is encoded by the morpheme -rã in Emberá. The plural suffix is highly integrated to the verbal inflection such that its form depends on tense; Northern Emberá -ta ‘PL’ in present/habitual and -da ‘PL’ in the past tense.\n\nNorthern Emberá and Katio make a clear distinction (immediate vs. unspecified temporal distance) in those tenses in which the event time point does not coincide with the speech time point (past and future)For example: Northern Emberá wã-toko-a (go-IMM_PST-DECL) ‘s/he just left’ vs. wã-podo-a (go-IMM_FUT-DECL) ‘s/he is about to leave’\n\nAguirre Licht, Daniel 2009. ‘Choco languages’, in Brown, Keith and Sarah Ogilvie (eds.).

{"id": "1538038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1538038", "title": "Performativity", "text": "Performativity\n\nPerformativity is language which effects change in the world and functions as a form of social action. The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields, such as linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, law, gender studies, performance studies, and economics.\n\nPerformativity was first defined by philosopher of language John L. Austin as the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be \"evaluated as true or false\".\n\nInfluenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler argued that gender is socially constructed through commonplace speech acts and nonverbal communication that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain identities. This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication. This view was also influenced by philosophers such as Michel Foucault and Louis Althusser.\n\nThe term derives from the founding work in speech act theory by ordinary language philosopher J. L. Austin, who did not use the word \"performativity\", but did, beginning in the 1950s, give the name performative utterances to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words \"I do.\" Breaking with analytic philosophy, Austin argued in \"How to Do Things With Words\" that a \"performative utterance\" cannot be said to be either true or false, as a constative utterance might be. It can only be judged either \"happy\" or \"infelicitous\", depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the pragmatics of language. Having shown that \"all\" utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between \"performative\" and \"constative\" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:\n\n\nFor example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.\n\nAustin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. Jacques Derrida, Shoshana Felman, Judith Butler, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of deconstruction, psychoanalysis, feminism, and queer theory. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of social change (Oliver 2003).\n\nThe concept of performativity has also been used in science and technology studies and in economic sociology. Andrew Pickering has proposed to shift from a \"representational idiom\" to a \"performative idiom\" in the study of science. Michel Callon has proposed to study the performative aspects of economics, i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).\n\nOther uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist Judith Butler has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of gender development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick describes queer performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define—and break—boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to affect theory. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls \"periperformativity\" (2003: 67–91), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.\n\nIn \"A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts\", John Searle takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague J. L. Austin. Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin’s theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: “In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin’s taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.”\n\nHis last key departure from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that four of his universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed. As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.”\n\nPhilosopher Jacques Derrida drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the \"force\" of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with Nietzsche's insights on language. \n\nIn \"Signature, Event, Context,\" Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker (\"signature\") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be \"cited\", put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [\"ancrage\"]. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called \"normal.\" What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions. \n\nPhilosopher and feminist theorist Judith Butler offered a new, more Continental (specifically, Foucauldian) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in linguistics and philosophy of language. She describes performativity as “that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.” She has largely used this concept in her analysis of gender development.\n\nThe concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse. Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition. The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).\n\nButler sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and that people, as actors who make a script a reality through repetition, come to perform in the mode of belief. “For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” (Felluga, 2006). Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does. Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of \"self-making\" through which subjects become socially intelligible. According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories. A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness” (Lloyd, 1999).\n\nThere are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity. The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration. These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness. Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration. (Lloyd, 1999)\n\nAnother criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject. It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a “real” existence and other times are socially active. Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)\n\nOthers criticize Butler for taking ethnomethodological and symbolic interactionist sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007). For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of Kessler and McKenna (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from Garfinkel (1967) and Goffman (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of \"doing\" masculinity and femininity in the performative interval. These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.\n\nIn \"\" (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist Jean-François Lyotard defined performativity as the defining mode of legitimation of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power. In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.\n\nLyotard uses Wittgenstein's notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: \"be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear\" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth. \n\nLyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In \"Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,\" historian Tony Judt cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize \"audit culture\" and \"global performativity.\" \n\nAgainst performativity and Jurgen Habermas' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by \"paralogy\", or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.\n\nTheories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist José Esteban Muñoz has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Muñoz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, \"The Transformation.\"\n\nAlthough historically and theoretically related to performance art, video art is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.\n\nIn economics, the “performativity thesis” is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory. The theory is debated in \"Do Economists Make Markets\" edited by Donald Angus MacKenzie, Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in \"Enacting Dismal Science\" edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova. \n\nThe German news anchorman Hanns Joachim Friedrichs once argued that a good journalist should never act in collusion with anything, not even with a good thing. In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the Berlin Wall, however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: \"The gates of the wall are wide open.\" („Die Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.“) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.\n\n"}

In his early life he had gone to Castile and entered the service of Don Juan de Guzmán, brother of Enrique de Guzmán, 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia. Later, when war broke out between Castile and Portugal, he returned to his own country, and attached himself, first as a groom, then as a squire, to Afonso V of Portugal and his successor John II of Portugal. In 1487, his overland expedition made its way to India, exploring trade opportunities with the Indians and Arabs, and winding up finally in Ethiopia. His detailed report was eagerly read in Lisbon, as Portugal became the world's best informed center for global geography and trade routes.\n\nKing John II put him in charge of diverse private missions, and finally, to use his knowledge of different languages, ordered him and Afonso de Paiva to undertake a mission of exploration in the Near East and the adjoining regions of Asia and Africa, with the special assignment to learn where cinnamon and other spices could be found, as well as of discovering the land of legendary Prester John, by overland routes. Bartolomeu Dias, at the same time, went out to by sea find the Prester's country, as well as the termination of the African continent and the ocean route to India.\n\nThe expedition started at Santarém, on 7 May 1487. Covilhã and Paiva were provided with a letter of credence for all the countries of the world and with a map for navigating, taken from the map of the world and compiled by Bishop Diogo, and doctors Rodrigo and Moisés. The first two of these were prominent members of the commission which advised the Portuguese government to reject the proposals of Christopher Columbus. The explorers started from Santarém and travelled by Barcelona to Naples, where their bills of exchange were paid by the sons of Cosimo de' Medici; from there they went to Rhodes, where they stayed with two other Portuguese, and so to Alexandria and Cairo, where they posed as merchants.\n\nIn company with Arabs from Fez and Tlemcen, they now went by way of El-Tor to Suakin and Aden, where, as it was now the monsoon, they parted. Covilhã proceeded to India and Paiva to Ethiopia. They agreed to meet again in Cairo. Covilhã thus arrived at Cannanore and Calicut, from where he retraced his steps to Goa and Hormuz, the Red Sea and Cairo, making an excursion on his way down the East African coast to Sofala.\n\nAt Cairo he heard of Paiva's death, and met with two Portuguese Jews: Rabbi Abraham of Beja, and José Sapateiro, a shoe-maker of Lamego who had been sent by King John with letters for Covilhã and Paiva. By Joseph of Lamego, Covilhã replied with an account of his Indian and African journeys, and of his observations on the cinnamon, pepper and clove trade at Calicut, together with advice as to the ocean way to India. He recommended that the Portuguese should sail south along the coast of Africa and the seas of Guinea. The first objective in the eastern ocean, he added, was Madagascar; from this island one could reach Calicut.\n\nWith this information Joseph returned to Portugal, while Covilhã, with Abraham of Beja, again visited Aden and Hormuz. At the latter he left the rabbi; and himself came back to Jeddah, the port of the Arabian holy land, and penetrated (as he told Francisco Álvares many years later) even to Mecca and Medina. Finally, by Mount Sinai, El-Tor and the Red Sea, he reached Zeila, whence he struck inland to the court of Prester John (Ethiopia).\n\nHere he was honorably received by the Emperor Eskender; lands and lordships were bestowed upon him, but Eskander refused to grant him permission to leave, and his successors evaded granting Covilhã permission. According to James Bruce, Covilhã maintained a correspondence with the king in Portugal, describing Ethiopia as \"very populous, full of cities both powerful and rich\".\n\nIn 1507, he was joined by João Gomes, a priest sent by Tristão da Cunha, who had reached Ethiopia by way of Socotra. When the Portuguese embassy under Rodrigo de Lima, which included Ethiopian ambassador Mateus and missionary Francisco Álvares, entered Ethiopia in 1520, Covilhã wept with joy at the sight of his fellow-countrymen. It was then forty years since he had left Portugal, and over thirty since he had been a prisoner of state in Ethiopia. Álvares, who professed to know him well, and to have heard the story of his life, both in confession and out of it, praises his power of vivid description as if things were present before him, and his extraordinary knowledge of all the spoken languages of Christians, Muslims and Gentiles. His services as an interpreter were valuable to Rodrigo de Lima's embassy. \nCovilhã was well treated, but was not allowed to leave the country until his death.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "170667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170667", "title": "Sarah Winnemucca", "text": "Sarah Winnemucca\n\nSarah Winnemucca Hopkins (born \"Thocmentony\", meaning \"Shell Flower; also seen as \"Tocmetone\" in Northern Paiute; – October 16, 1891) was a Northern Paiute author, activist and educator.\n\nReno was born near Humboldt Lake, Nevada, into an influential Paiute family who led their community in pursuing friendly relations with the arriving groups of Anglo-American settlers. She was sent to study in a Catholic school in Santa Clara, California. When the Paiute War erupted between the Pyramid Lake Paiute and the settlers, including some who were friends of the Winnemucca family, Sarah and some of her family traveled to San Francisco and Virginia City to escape the fighting. They made a living performing onstage as \"A Paiute Royal Family.\" In 1865, while the Winnemucca family was away, their band was attacked by the US cavalry, who killed 29 Paiutes, including Sarah's mother and several members of her extended family.\n\nSubsequently, Winnemucca became an advocate for the rights of Native Americans, traveling across the US to tell Anglo-Americans about the plight of her people. When the Paiute were interned in a concentration camp at Yakima, Washington after the Bannock War, she traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress and the executive branch for their release. She also served US forces as a messenger, interpreter, and guide, and as a teacher for imprisoned Native Americans.\n\nWinnemucca published \"\" (1883), a book that is both a memoir and history of her people during their first 40 years of contact with European Americans. It is considered the \"first known autobiography written by a Native American woman.\" Anthropologist Omer Stewart described it as \"one of the first and one of the most enduring ethnohistorical books written by an American Indian,\" frequently cited by scholars. Following the publication of the book, Winnemucca toured the Eastern United States, giving lectures about her people in New England, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. She returned to the West, founding a private school for Native American children in Lovelock, Nevada.\n\nSince the late 20th century, scholars have paid renewed attention to Winnemucca for her contributions. In 1993, she was inducted posthumously into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. In 2005, the state of Nevada contributed a statue of her by sculptor Benjamin Victor to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWinnemucca's legacy has been controversial. Some biographers have wished to remember her primarily for her activism and social work to better the conditions for her people, while others have criticized her for her tendency to exaggerate her social status among the Paiute. Among the Paiute, her assistance to the US military at a time when they were at war with the Paiute has been criticized, as has her advocacy for assimilation of Natives to Anglo-American culture. But the Paiute have also recognized her social work and activism for indigenous rights.\n\nBorn \"somewhere near 1844\" at Humboldt Lake in what is now western Nevada, Sarah Winnemucca was the daughter of Winnemucca (\"Poito\"), a Shoshone who had joined the Paiute through marriage, and his wife \"Tuboitonie\". Sarah had an older sister Mary, younger brother Natchez, and sister Elma. (Although Sarah later said that her father was chief of all of the Northern Paiute, the Paiute had no such centralized leadership. Her father, though influential, was the war chief of a small band of about 150 people.) The town of Winnemucca, Nevada was named after her father.\n\nSarah's grandfather, \"Tru-ki-zo\" or \"Truckee\" (meaning \"good\" in the Paiute language, or derived from \"Tro-kay\", which means \"hello\" ), had established positive relations with the European Americans who started exploring in the area. He guided Captain John C. Frémont during his 1843–45 survey and map-making expedition across the Great Basin to California. Later, Truckee fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), earning many white friends and leading the way for his extended family's relationships with European Americans.\n\nAt the age of six, Sarah traveled with her family to near Stockton, California, where the adults worked in the cattle industry. In 1857, their grandfather arranged for Sarah (then 13) and her sister Elma to live and work in the household of William Ormsby and his wife; he had a hotel and was a civic leader of Carson City, Nevada. The couple wanted a companion for their daughter, Lizzie. The Winnemucca girls also did domestic work in the house. They had a chance to improve their English and learn more about European-American ways. Sarah particularly began to be at ease in going back and forth between Paiute and European-American culture. She was one of the few Paiute in Nevada who knew how to read and write English, and her family all spoke English.\n\nWith the decreasing pressure of new migrants in the region attracted to the Washoe silver finds, Old Winnemucca arranged in 1859 to have his daughters returned to him again in Nevada. In 1860, open conflict occurred. The Paiute had killed two men who had kidnapped and abused two Paiute girls. Settlers and miners organized a militia, making Major Ormsby lead it by default. He was killed by the Paiute in a disciplined confrontation in the first event of the Pyramid Lake War. Settlers were alarmed at how well the Paiute fought and the ill-prepared miners could not hold their own. The Paiute and whites reached a truce by the end of the summer. Young Winnemucca, Sarah's cousin, led the Paiute as a war chief by then. In October 1860, their grandfather Truckee died of a tarantula bite.\n\nAs a mark of development, Nevada was established as a distinct US Territory, and James W. Nye was appointed as its first governor. When he came to the territory, he went to the Pyramid Lake Reservation, where he met Old Winnemucca, Young Winnemucca and the Paiute, who put on a grand display. For the next five years (1860–1865), Sarah and her family frequently traveled away from the reservation, performing on stage, either in Virginia City, Nevada at Maguire's Opera House, or in San Francisco. They were billed as the \"Paiute Royal Family.\" By this time, her father had taken a second, younger wife, with whom he had a young son.\n\nIn Nevada, US forces repeatedly acted against Native Americans to \"remind them of who was in charge.\" The Natives were repeatedly accused of raids and cattle stealing. In 1865 Captain Almond B. Wells led a Nevada Volunteer cavalry in indiscriminate raids across the northern part of the state, attacking Paiute bands. While Sarah and her father were in Dayton, Nevada, Wells and his men attacked Old Winnemucca's camp, killing 29 of the 30 persons in the band, who were old men, women and children.\n\nThe chief's two wives (including Sarah's mother) and infant son were killed. Although Sarah's sister Mary escaped from camp, she died later that winter due to the severe conditions. Her younger sister Elma was out of the area, as she had been adopted by a French family in Marysville, California. There Elma Winnemucca married John Smith, a white man, and moved with him to a white community in Montana and, later, Idaho.\n\nIn 1868 about 490 Paiute survivors moved to a military camp, which became known as Fort McDermitt, on the Nevada–Oregon border. They sought protection from the US Army against the Nevada Volunteers. In 1872 the federal government established the Malheur Reservation in eastern Oregon, designated by President Ulysses S. Grant for the Northern Paiute and Bannock peoples in the area. Three bands of Paiute moved there at the time. In 1875, Sarah, her brother Natchez and his family, and their father Old Winnemucca moved there, too.\n\nWinnemucca was invited to work as the interpreter at the Malheur Reservation by Indian Agent Samuel B. Parrish. She found in observing Parrish that he worked well with the Paiute; he encouraged them in learning some new ways and helped them plant crops that could support the people, establishing a well-managed agricultural program. He had a school built at the reservation, and Sarah became an assistant teacher.\n\nSarah married Edward Bartlett, a former First Lieutenant in the Army, on 29 January 1872 at Salt Lake City, Utah. He abandoned her, and she returned to Camp McDermitt. In 1876, after having moved to Malheur Reservation, she got a divorce and filed to take back her name of Winnemucca, which the court granted.\n\nAfter four years, Parrish was replaced in the summer of 1876 by agent William V. Rinehart. The Paiute were sorry to see Parrish leave.\n\nA proponent of extermination-style warfare, Rinehart emphasized keeping the Paiute under his thumb. He reversed many of the policies that Parrish had initiated, telling the Paiute the reservation land belonged to the government. He failed to pay their workers for agricultural labor in communal fields, and alienated many tribal leaders. Conditions at the Malheur Reservation quickly became intolerable.\n\nIn her 1883 book, Winnemucca recounted that Rinehart sold supplies intended for the Paiute people to local whites. Much of the good land on the reservation was illegally expropriated by white settlers. In 1878, virtually all of the Paiute and Bannock people left the reservation because of these abuses and their difficulties in living. The Bannock from southern Idaho had left the Fort Hall Reservation due to similar problems. They moved west, raiding isolated white settlements in southern Oregon and northern Nevada, triggering the Bannock War (1878). The degree to which Northern Paiute people participated with the Bannock is unclear. Winnemucca wrote that she and several other Paiute families were held hostage by the Bannock during the war.\n\nDuring the Bannock War, Winnemucca worked as a translator for General Oliver O. Howard of the U.S. Army, whom she had met during his visit to the reservation; she also acted as a scout and messenger. According to her account, the Bannock warriors and the Army soldiers liked each other so much that they rarely shot to kill. For whatever reason, casualties were relatively few. Winnemucca was highly regarded by the officers she worked for, and she included letters of recommendation from several of them in her 1883 book. Impressed by many of the officers, Winnemucca began to support the US Army's position to have the military take over administration of the Indian reservations, rather than political appointees. (Note: After the 1870 Marias Massacre by US Army forces in Montana, President Grant had promoted a peace policy, appointing Quaker leaders as Indian agents to reservations and intending to eradicate problems of corruption that way.)\n\nFollowing the Bannock War, the Northern Paiute bands were ordered from Nevada to the Yakama Indian Reservation (in eastern Washington Territory), where they endured great deprivation. A total of 543 Paiute were interned in what has been described as a \"concentration camp.\"\n\nWinnemucca accompanied them to serve as a translator. Since she had an official job, she was not required to live on a reservation. Outraged by the harsh conditions forced on the Paiute, she began to lecture across California and Nevada on the plight of her people. During the winter of 1879 and 1880, she, her father, and two other Winnemucca visited Washington, DC to lobby for release of the Paiute from the Yakama Reservation. They gained permission from Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz, for the Paiute to be allowed to return to Malheur, at their own expense. Instead, the government decided to \"discontinue\" the Malheur Reservation in 1879, closing it.\n\n\"Knowing the temper of the people through whom they must pass, still smarting from the barbarities of the war two years previous, and that the Paiutes, utterly destitute of everything, must subsist themselves on their route by pillage, I refused permission for them to depart . . . and soon after, on being more correctly informed of the state of affairs, the Hon. Secretary revoked his permission though no determination as to their permanent location was arrived at. This was a great disappointment to the Paiutes and the greatest caution and care was necessary in dealing with them.\"\n\nIn 1881 General Oliver O. Howard hired Sarah Winnemucca to teach Shoshone prisoners held at Vancouver Barracks. While there, she met and became close to Lieutenant Lewis H. Hopkins, an Indian Department employee. They married that year in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1883, the Hopkinses traveled east, where Sarah delivered nearly 300 lectures throughout major cities of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, seeking to heighten awareness of injustice against Native Americans. The press reported her talks and often referred to her as the \"Paiute Princess.\"\n\nIn Boston, she met the sisters Elizabeth Peabody and Mary Peabody Mann, married to the educator Horace Mann; they began to promote her speaking career. In addition, the two women helped her to compile and prepare her lecture materials for publication as \"Life Among the Piutes\". Her book was published in 1883, the \"first known autobiography written by a Native American woman\" and the first U.S. copyright registration secured by a Native American woman.\n\nSarah's husband had contributed to his wife's efforts by gathering material for the book at the Library of Congress. But he was suffering from tuberculosis, and Winnemucca learned that he was addicted to gambling; her earnings were eaten up by his needs.\n\nAfter returning to Nevada in 1884, Winnemucca spent a year lecturing in San Francisco. When she returned again to Pyramid Lake, she and her brother built a school for Indian children at Lovelock, Nevada, in order to promote the Paiute culture and language. The Peabody Indian School, named for their benefactor Mary Peabody Mann in Boston, operated for a couple of years. Changes in federal policy following what was considered the success of the Carlisle Indian School promoted the federal government to promote education for Native American children at English-language boarding schools. Winnemucca's school was closed in 1887 and the children transferred to a facility in Grand Junction, Colorado. Despite a bequest from Mary Peabody Mann and efforts to turn the school into a technical training center, Winnemucca was struggling financially by the time of her husband's death in 1887.\n\nThe Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 required allotment of communal lands on reservations to individual households to force assimilation of tribes.\n\nWinnemucca spent the last four years of her life retired from public activity. She died of tuberculosis at her sister, Elma Smith's home at Henry's Lake, Idaho.\n\n\n\n\n"}

So unaccustomed have modern consumers become that many (erroneously) view it as a fault. Many winemakers therefore take great pains to ensure that the great majority of wines made today (especially those designed to be drunk within their first few years) will remain free of sediment for this time. Wines designed for long bottle aging, on the other hand, frequently deposit crystals of tartrates, and in addition red wines deposit some pigmented tannins. Winemakers deliberately leave more tartrates and phenolics in wines designed for long aging in bottle so that they are able to develop the aromatic compounds that constitute bouquet.\n\n"}

Damodaran (; c. 1935 – 28 March 2012) was a screenwriter of Malayalam cinema. He scripted some of the biggest blockbusters in Malayalam cinema. Damodaran and director I. V. Sasi teamed up to produce many hit movies, including \"Angadi\", \"Eee Nadu\", \"Vartha\", \"Avanazhi\", \"Inspector Balram\", \"1921\", \"Adimakal Udamakal\", and \"Balram vs. Taradas\". He also teamed up with director Priyadarshan to produce many hit movies including Aryan, Advaitham, \"Abhimanyu\", and \"Kala Pani\".\n\nHis daughter, Deedi Damodaran, is also a screenwriter of Malayalam cinema. She made her debut with the film \"Gulmohar\".\n\nPopularly known as Damodaran Master, T. Damodaran began his career in cinema as a script writer in early 70s. A physical education teacher in a school at Kozhikode by profession, Damodaran became active in theatre by late sixties and got into the company of several theatre and cinema artists of the era including Thikkodiyan, Kuthiravattom Pappu, Hariharan, and Kunjandi. He was a part of the Slapstick Theatre, in which Kuthiravattom Pappu was a leading actor. He wrote and acted in several comedies and satires and his dramas were mainly packed with social issues. This was noticed by Hariharan, who forced Damodaran to enter into cinema making. Though, made his debut in 1973, Damodaran became active in cinema by late 70s, after joining with I. V. Sasi with whom he later made around fifty films. It was the huge success of \"Angaadi\" in 1980 that gave a break to the career of Damodaran. Directed by I. V. Sasi, Angadi had Jayan and Seema in leading roles and broke several collection records. This was followed by \"Meen\", Kanthavalayam, and \"Karimbana\", all super hits.\n\nIn the 1980s, the scripts of Damodaran created sensation and furore in theatres. The scripts were mainly socio-dramas, which often criticized the establishments and were packed with heavy punch dialogues. Mostly directed by Sasi, these films were well received by general public. \"Thadakam\", \"Thushaaram\", \"Ee Nadu\", \"Innalenkil Naale\", \"Iniyenkilum\", \"Vartha\", \"Angadikappurathu\", \"Avanazhi\", all were huge hits at box office. Apart from I. V. Sasi, T. Damodaran, also wrote scripts for directors like Priyadarshan, Anil, and Bharathan. Mani Ratnam's first and only film in Malayalam \"Unaru\" was based on the script by Damodaran in 1985. In the year 1988, Sasi directed a periodic drama based on the script by T. Damodaran, \"1921\", which was then the most expensive film in Malayalam. T. Damodaran has called this film as his dream project. Appearing Mammootty in leading, \"1921\" revolved around the Moppillai mutiny in Malabar in 1921 against British. This film was a huge hit at box office.\n\nThough, in 90s, Damodaran reduced the number of films, several hits were born from his pen. \"Inspector Balram\", \"Abhimanyu\", \"Advaitham\", and \"Kala Pani\" were some among them. His last release was \"Yes Your Honour\", directed by V. M. Vinu, starring Sreenivasan, Padmapriya, Innocent, and Saikumar, which also was a hit.\n\nApart from being a writer Damodaran has acted in quite a few films, most noted roles being Hajiyar with Kalandan in Kilichundan Mampazham and as K P Hamsa in to name a few.These roles were given to him both as an appreciation to his action abilities as well as the respective directors respect to him.\n"}

{"id": "1052470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052470", "title": "Vintage", "text": "Vintage\n\nVintage, in winemaking, is the process of picking grapes and creating the finished product—wine (see Harvest (wine)). A vintage wine is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily, grown and harvested in a single specified year. In certain wines, it can denote quality, as in Port wine, where Port houses make and declare vintage Port in their best years. From this tradition, a common, though incorrect, usage applies the term to any wine that is perceived to be particularly old or of a particularly high quality.\n\nMost countries allow a vintage wine to include a portion of wine that is not from the year denoted on the label. In Chile and South Africa, the requirement is 75% same-year content for vintage-dated wine. In Australia, New Zealand, and the member states of the European Union, the requirement is 85%. In the United States, the requirement is 85%, unless the wine is designated with an AVA, (e.g., Napa Valley), in which case it is 95%. Technically, the 85% rule in the United States applies equally to imports, but there are difficulties in enforcing the regulation.\n\nThe opposite of a vintage wine is a \"nonvintage\" wine (often seen on a wine list as NV), which is usually a blend from the produce of two or more years. This is a common practice for winemakers seeking a consistent style of wine, year on year.\n\nThe word vintage was first used in the early 15th century. It was taken from the Old French \"vendage\", meaning wine harvest. This word was taken from the Latin \"vinum\" (wine) and \"demere\" (to remove).\n\nThe importance of vintage, however, is both varied and disputed.\n\nIn wine produced on the colder limits of wine production, vintage is often very important, because some seasons will be much warmer and produce riper grapes and better wine. On the other hand, a poor growing season can lead to grapes low in sugar, which lowers the quality of the resulting wine.\n\nIn many wine regions, especially in the New World, growing seasons are much more uniform. In dry regions, the systematic and controlled use of irrigation also contributes to uniform vintages. However, such wines are regularly labeled by vintage because of consumer demand.\n\nWines of superior vintages from prestigious producers and regions will often command much higher prices than those from average vintages. This is especially the case if wines are likely to improve further with some age in the bottle. Some wines are only labeled with a vintage in better-than-average years, to maintain their quality and reputation, while the vast majority of wines are produced to be drunk young and fresh. In such cases, a vintage is usually considered less important. However, it can serve to protect consumers against buying a wine that would not be expected to improve with age and could be past its best, such as with Beaujolais nouveau, a wine style made to be consumed within months of its bottling.\n\nThe importance of vintage may sometimes be exaggerated. For example, \"New York Times\" wine columnist Frank J. Prial declared the vintage chart to be dead, writing that \"winemakers of the world have rendered the vintage chart obsolete\" (Prial), and Bill Marsano wrote that \"winemakers now have the technology and skills to make good and even very good wines in undistinguished years\" (Marsano). James Laube of \"Wine Spectator\" has asserted that \"even an average vintage can yield some grand wines\" (Laube).\nRoman Weil, co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US and professor at the University of Chicago, tested the controversial hypothesis that experienced wine drinkers \"cannot distinguish in blind tastings the wine of years rated high from those of years rated low, or, if they can, they do not agree with the vintage chart's preferences\" (Weil).\n\nWeil used wines ranging from four to 17 years beyond their vintage with 240 wine drinkers and found that the tasters could not distinguish between wines of good and bad vintages except for Bordeaux wines. Even when they could make a distinction, the match between the tasters' individual assessments and the charts' rankings were little better than tossing a coin. When the tests were replicated with wine experts, including French wine academics, the results were again the same as chance.\n\nWeil does not consider a vintage chart to be useless. He suggests using one to help \"find good buys in wine. Buy wine from the Appalling years,\" which may be priced far below actual quality.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Instituto for foreign languages. He wrote the novel \"Metropoliteno\". \n\nVarankin was born in Nizhny Novgorod, in an office worker's family. He was of Russian ethnicity. His father Valentin Jegorovich Varankin (died 1921), managed a savings bank until he was recruited into the Red Army. Varankin's mother, Nina Aleksejevna (died 1953), was a librarian. Besides Vladimir, the family had two other sons: Jurij (born 1906, died 1988) and Vjacheslav (born 1916), who was still alive several years ago.\n\nDuring his last year of study at the city high school (1919), he began learning Esperanto with several friends, boys and girls. Together with his equally young friends, he soon founded a little city circle of young Esperantists, which later transformed into the provincial (gubernia) circle. Both in the city and in the gubernia that union carried out an active program: in less than a year the union managed to organize six courses of Esperanto in the city itself, forty cells and little circles in the whole gubernia, and in addition, in several places, (with the help of local Esperanto instructors) even to teach the international language in the schools.\n\nFor one or two years he and his friends vastly developed their Esperanto activity. Starting then he began active, energetic, impetuous activity. Besides little circles, courses, and cells, he organized promotional spectaculars and put on sketches, whose text he wrote himself, or translated, or took from pre-revolutionary Esperanto reviews (for example, from \"La Ondo de Esperanto\" ~The Esperanto Wave). He himself began to publish a newspaper \"Ruĝa Esperantisto\" ~Red Esperantist. In this newspaper (under the pseudonym Vol-Volanto \n~Want-Wanter) the twenty-year-old Varankin published his verses and the verses of his \nfriends, articles, translations, announcements, survey results, and also calls to the national and foreign Esperanto community to help the hungry in the young soviet republic. However, at \nthat time he wrote in an Esperanto that was full of errors and very russesque.\n\nIn 1920 with several friends he even attempted to organize in Nizhny Novgorod the third PanRussian Esperantist Convention, but that failed because chaos and the difficult economic situation in the country did not yet permit organizing the arrangements. The convention came about one year later in Petrograd, and at the convention they founded Sovetlanda (later, sovetrespublikara) Esperantista Unio; young Vladimir Varankin was elected as a member of its central committee.\n\nAfter school young Vladimir worked for some time in an electric energy organization. But soon he enrolled in a cavalry school and served there as a political collaborator. At the same time he was a librarian and club director. In the autumn of 1922 he moved with the cavalry school to Tver and immediately began to work actively for Esperanto.\n\nHe progressed rapidly also within SEU. At the I-st SEU Convention (1923, Moscow) Varankin was elected a member of the managing board of the convention and reelected as a member of the central committee. At the end of 1925 the newspaper \"Mejxdunarodnyj Jazyk\" (~International Language) began to publish a series of his lessons and methods for the advertising of Esperanto, which continued through all of 1926. Among other things he put the main emphasis not just on advertising but on practical usage. The central committee of the SEU commissioned him to lead the publicity effort.\n\nAt the end of 1927 he moved to Moscow, after the nineteenth UK (World Convention of Esperanto) in Danzig. Among other things, the German veteran Esperantist Konstantin Behnert, who knew Varankin in Tver, tells that after the Danzig UK Varankin visited Germany without permission and later incautiously mentioned that - with the result that he had to report monthly to register with the police.\n\nIn 1929 he wrote the textbook \"Teorio de Esperanto\" (~Theory of Esperanto) and a year later also the textbook \"Esperanto por laboristoj\" (~Esperanto for Workers). Vladimir \nVarankin was elected from the beginning a member of the board of secretaries, later director of \nthe organizational department, vice president and finally general secretary of the All-Russia \ncommittee of SEU. He became a full-fledged member of the Language commission at SEU and \nmember of the Language committee at the Akademio de Esperanto (~Academy of Esperanto).\n\nIn 1932 in \"Nova Etapo\" (~New Stage) the appeared several chapters from \"Metropoliteno\" under the title \"Barikadoj\" (~barricades).\n\nMeanwhile, he completed his course at the faculty of social sciences at the Moscow State University the \nInstitute of Foreign Affairs and became director of the Technical College of Foreign Languages, where he also taught history.\n\nDuring the night of 7 February 1938 — 8 February 1938 Varankin was arrested. They condemned him as an active member of Union Center, which never existed; he was accused with spying and sabotage, anti-soviet propaganda, plotting to murder Joseph Stalin and the like.\n\nIn April 1989 the Procurator's Office of the Soviet Union officially released the following information: Vladimir Valentinovich Varankin, born in 1902 in Nizhny Novgorod, member of the Communist Party since 1925, expelled from it because of a criminal accusation, director before the arrest of the 2nd Moscow Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages, was sentenced by the Military college of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union to be executed by gunfire and to have all his possessions confiscated on the third of October 1938, for participation in a fascist spy organization \"Sojuznyj Centr\" (~Union Center), existing under the auspices of the Esperantist organization, with the aim of overthrowing Soviet power through espionage, sabotage, terrorist acts against the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. The verdict was carried out on the same day in Moscow without right of appeal or amnesty. All confiscated possessions, including manuscripts, letters, documents, archives, books were destroyed as \"ideologically unuseful\" and \"without any current or historical value\". The official answer says that \"the place of burial is not indicated in the file\".\n\nTwenty years later the Military college of the Supreme Court looked into the matter. The investigation revealed that V. Varankin was convicted totally without basis, and in connection with that the Military college of the Supreme court of the Soviet Union nullified the verdict on 11 May 1957 and threw out the accusation as having an absolute lack of criminal content. V. Varankin was fully exonerated.\n\n\nThe first version of this page is a translation from the entry on Vladimir Varankin in the Esperanto Vikipedio.\n\n"}

C. Wren and H. Martin. Written primarily for the children of British officers residing in India, these books were widely adopted by Indian and Pakistani schools in the post-colonial era and missionary schools in Burma. The books were published in 1935, with a discussion on composition added later. The content in the books is largely based on \"The Manual of English Grammar and Composition\" by J. C. Nesfield.\n\nOther books in this series are \"Elementary English Grammar\", \"A First Book of English Grammar and Composition\", \"High School English Grammar and Composition\" and \"A Final Course of Grammar & Composition\". The series of textbooks is still in use at many Indian schools. While semantic change has dated the original books, they continue to enjoy considerable popularity and updated versions are now in common use. Copies of the different versions of this series are available online.\n"}
