{"id": "169509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169509", "title": "Agnosia", "text": "Agnosia\n\nAgnosia is the inability to process sensory information. Often there is a loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is not defective nor is there any significant memory loss. It is usually associated with brain injury or neurological illness, particularly after damage to the occipitotemporal border, which is part of the ventral stream. Agnosia only affects a single modality, such as vision or hearing. More recently, a top-down interruption is considered to cause the disturbance of handling perceptual information.\n\nVisual agnosia is a broad category that refers to a deficiency in the ability to recognize visual objects. Visual agnosia can be further subdivided into two different subtypes: apperceptive visual agnosia and associative visual agnosia.\n\nIndividuals with apperceptive visual agnosia display the ability to see contours and outlines when shown an object, but they experience difficulty if asked to categorize objects. Apperceptive visual agnosia is associated with damage to one hemisphere, specifically damage to the posterior sections of the right hemisphere.\n\nIn contrast, individuals with associative visual agnosia experience difficulty when asked to name objects. Associative agnosia is associated with damage to both the right and left hemispheres at the occipitotemporal border. A specific form of associative visual agnosia is known as prosopagnosia. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces. For example, these individuals have difficulty recognizing friends, family and coworkers. However, individuals with prosopagnosia can recognize all other types of visual stimuli.\n\nSpeech agnosia, or auditory verbal agnosia, refers to \"an inability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production and reading ability\". Patients report that they do indeed hear sounds being produced, but that the sounds are fundamentally unrecognizable/untranslatable.\n\n\nDespite an inability to process what the speaker is saying, some patients have been reported to recognize certain characteristic information about the speaker's voice (such as being a man or woman).\n\nAgnosia can result from strokes, dementia, or other neurological disorders. It may also be trauma-induced by a head injury, brain infection, or hereditary. Additionally, some forms of agnosia may be the result of developmental disorders. Damage causing agnosia usually occurs in either the occipital or parietal lobes of the brain. Although one modality may be affected, cognitive abilities in other areas are preserved.\n\nPatients who experience dramatic recovery from blindness experience significant to total agnosia.\n\nThe effect of damage to the superior temporal sulcus is consistent with several types of neurolinguistic deficiencies, and some contend that agnosia is one of them. The superior temporal sulcus is vital for speech comprehension because the region is highly involved with the lexical interface. According to the 1985 TRACE II Model, the lexical interface associates sound waves (phonemes) with morphological features to produce meaningful words. This association process is accomplished by lateral inhibition/excitement of certain words within an individual's lexicon (vocabulary). For instance, if an experimenter were to say DOG aloud, the utterance would activate and inhibit various words within the subjects lexical interface:\nThe consistency of this model to agnosia is shown by evidence that bilateral lesions to the superior temporal sulcus produces 'pure word deafness' (Kussmaul, 1877), or as it's understood today—speech agnosia. Patients with pure word deafness demonstrate the inability to recognize and process speech sounds with normal auditory processing for non-speech sounds below the level of the cortex.\n\nIn order to assess an individual for agnosia, it must be verified that the individual is not suffering from a loss of sensation, and that both their language abilities and intelligence are intact. In order for an individual to be diagnosed with agnosia, they must only be experiencing a sensory deficit in a single modality. To make a diagnosis, the distinction between apperceptive and associative agnosia must be made. This distinction can be made by having the individual complete copying and matching tasks. If the individual is suffering from a form of apperceptive agnosia they will not be able to match two stimuli that are identical in appearance. In contrast, if an individual is suffering from a form of associative agnosia, they will not be able to match different examples of a stimulus. For example, an individual who has been diagnosed with associative agnosia in the visual modality would not be able to match pictures of a laptop that is open with a laptop that is closed.\n\nIndividuals with pure alexia usually have difficulty reading words as well as difficulty with identifying letters. In order to assess whether an individual has pure alexia, tests of copying and recognition must be performed. An individual with pure alexia should be able to copy a set of words, and should be able to recognize letters.\n\nIndividuals are usually shown pictures of human faces that may be familiar to them such as famous actors, singers, politicians or family members. The pictures shown to the patient are selected to be age and culture appropriate. The task involves the examiner asking the individual to name each face. If the individual cannot name whose face appears in the picture, the examiner may ask a question that would help to recognize the face in the picture.\n\nFor all practical purposes, there is no direct cure. Patients may improve if information is presented in other modalities than the damaged one. Different types of therapies can help to reverse the effects of agnosia. In some cases, occupational therapy or speech therapy can improve agnosia, depending on its cause.\n\nInitially many individuals with a form of agnosia are unaware of the extent to which they have either a perceptual or recognition deficit. This may be caused by anosognosia which is the lack of awareness of a deficit. This lack of awareness usually leads to a form of denial and resistance to any form of help or treatment. There are various methods that can be used which can help the individual recognize the impairment in perception or recognition that they may have. A patient can be presented with a stimulus to the impaired modality only to help increase their awareness of their deficit. Alternatively, a task can be broken down into its component parts so that the individual can see each part of the problem caused by the deficit. Once the individual acknowledges their perceptual or recognition deficit, a form of treatment may be recommended. There are various forms of treatment such as compensatory strategies with alternate modalities, verbal strategies, alternate cues and organizational strategies.\n\nUsing verbal descriptions may be helpful for individuals with certain types of agnosia. Individuals such as prosopagnosics may find it useful to listen to a description of their friend or family member and recognize them based on this description more easily than through visual cues.\n\nAlternate cues may be particularly useful to an individual with environmental agnosia or prosopagnosia. Alternate cues for an individual with environmental agnosia may include color cues or tactile markers to symbolize a new room or to remember an area by. Prosopagnosics may use alternate cues such as a scar on an individual's face or crooked teeth in order to recognize the individual. Hair color and length can be helpful cues as well.\n\nOrganizational strategies may be extremely helpful for an individual with visual agnosia. For example, organizing clothes according to different hangers provides tactile cues for the individual, making it easier to identify certain forms of clothing as opposed to relying solely on visual cues.\n\nThese strategies elicit the use of an unaffected modality. For example, visual agnosics can use tactile information in replacement of visual information. Alternatively, an individual with prosopagnosia can use auditory information in order to replace visual information. For example, an individual with prosopagnosia can wait for someone to speak, and will usually recognize the individual from their speech.\n\nThere are clinical trials being done to further research for treatments. At the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) they support research for rare diseases like agnosia. Some organizations that are recruiting for trials are using clincaltrials.gov and give status updates on the trials.\n\nThe term 'agnosia' comes from the Ancient Greek ἀγνωσία (\"agnosia\"), \"ignorance\", \"absence of knowledge\". It was introduced by Sigmund Freud in 1891: \"For disturbances in the recognition of objects, which Finkelnburg classes as asymbolia, I should like to propose the term 'agnosia'.\" Prior to Freud's introduction of the term, some of the first ideas about agnosia came from Carl Wernicke, who created theories about receptive aphasia in 1874. He noted that individuals with receptive aphasia did not possess the ability to understand speech or repeat words. He believed that receptive aphasia was due to lesions of the posterior third of the left superior temporal gyrus. Due to these lesions, Wernicke believed that individuals with receptive aphasia had a limited deafness for certain sounds and frequencies in speech.\n\nAfter Wernicke, came Kussmaul in 1877 who attempted to explain why auditory verbal agnosia, also known as word deafness, occurs. Contrary to Wernicke's explanations, Kussmaul believed auditory verbal agnosia was the result of major destruction to the first left temporal gyrus. Kussmaul also posited about the origins of alexia (acquired dyslexia) also known as word blindness. He believed that word blindness was the result of lesions to the left angular and supramarginal gyri.\n\nHeinrich Lissauer shared his ideas about agnosia after Wernicke and Kussmaul. In 1890, he theorized that there were two ways in which object recognition impairment could occur. One way in which impairment could occur was if there was damage to early perceptual processing or if there was damage to the actual object representation. If the actual object representation was damaged, this would not allow the object to be stored in visual memory, and therefore the individual would not be able to recognize the object. During the time of Wernicke, Kussmaul and Lissauer there was little known about the cerebral cortex. Today, with new neuroimaging techniques, we have been able to expand our knowledge on agnosia greatly.\n\n"}

{"id": "7954365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7954365", "title": "Blazon", "text": "Blazon\n\nIn heraldry and heraldic vexillology, a blazon is a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image. The verb \"to blazon\" means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag has traditionally had considerable latitude in design, but a verbal blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements. A coat of arms or flag is therefore primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though in modern usage flags are often additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). \"Blazon\" also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms.\n\nOther armorial objects and devices – such as badges, banners, and seals – may also be described in blazon.\n\nThe noun and verb \"blazon\" (referring to a verbal description) are not to be confused with the noun \"emblazonment\", or the verb \"to emblazon\", both of which relate to the graphic representation of a coat of arms or heraldic device.\n\nThe word \"blazon\" is derived from French \"blason\", \"shield\". It is found in English by the end of the 14th century.\n\nFormerly, heraldic authorities believed that the word was related to the German verb \"blasen\", \"to blow (a horn)\". Present-day lexicographers reject this theory as conjectural and disproved.\n\nBlazon is generally designed to eliminate ambiguity of interpretation, to be as concise as possible, and to avoid repetition and extraneous punctuation. English antiquarian Charles Boutell stated in 1864: \n\nHowever, John Brooke-Little, Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, wrote in 1985: \"Although there are certain conventions as to how arms shall be blazoned ... many of the supposedly hard and fast rules laid down in heraldic manuals [including those by heralds] are often ignored.\"\n\nA given coat of arms may be drawn in many different ways, all considered equivalent and faithful to the blazon, just as the letter \"A\" may be printed in many different fonts while still being the same letter. For example, the shape of the escutcheon is almost always immaterial, with very limited exceptions (e.g., the coat of arms of Nunavut, for which a round shield is specified).\n\nThe main conventions of blazon are as follows:\n\nBecause heraldry developed at a time when English clerks wrote in Anglo-Norman French, many terms in English heraldry are of French origin. Some of the details of the syntax of blazon also follow French practice: thus, adjectives are normally placed after nouns rather than before. \n\nA number of heraldic adjectives may be given in either a French or an anglicised form: for example, a \"cross pattée\" or a \"cross patty\"; a \"cross fitchée\" or a \"cross fitchy\". In modern English blazons, the anglicised form tends to be preferred.\n\nWhere the French form is used, a problem may arise as to the appropriate adjectival ending, determined in normal French usage by gender and number.\n\nJ. E. Cussans recommended spelling all French adjectives in the masculine singular, without regard to the gender and number of the nouns they qualify; but believed that a more usual convention was to adhere to the feminine singular form, for example: \"a chief undée\" and \"a saltire undée\", even though the French nouns \"chef\" and \"sautoir\" are in fact masculine.\n\nFull descriptions of shields range in complexity, from a single word to a convoluted series describing compound shields:\n \"Quarterly I. Azure three Lions' Heads affronté Crowned Or (for Dalmatia); II. chequy Argent and Gules (for Croatia); III. Azure a River in Fess Gules bordered Argent thereon a Marten proper beneath a six-pointed star Or (for Slavonia); IV. per Fess Azure and Or over all a Bar Gules in the Chief a demi-Eagle Sable displayed addextré of the Sun-in-splendour and senestré of a Crescent Argent in the Base seven Towers three and four Gules (for Transylvania); enté en point Gules a double-headed Eagle proper on a Peninsula Vert holding a Vase pouring Water into the Sea Argent beneath a Crown proper with bands Azure (for Fiume); over all an escutcheon Barry of eight Gules and Argent impaling Gules on a Mount Vert a Crown Or issuant therefrom a double-Cross Argent (for Hungary)\".\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the court of the Western Ganga dynasty of Talakad (in modern Karnataka, India). A person of many talents, in 982 he commissioned the construction of the monolithic statue of Bahubali, the Gomateshwara, at Shravanabelagola, an important place of pilgrimage for Jainism. He was a devotee of the Jain Acharya Nemichandra and Ajitasena Bhattaraka and was an influential person during the reigns of Marasimha II Satyavakya, (963–975). Rachamalla IV Satyavakya, (975–986) and Rachamalla V (Rakkasaganga), (986–999).\n\nA courageous commander with the title \"Samara Paraśurāma\" (\"lit\", \"Battle-Rama wielding an ax\"), he found time to pursue his literary interests as well and became a renowned writer in Kannada and Sanskrit. He wrote an important and existing prose piece called the \"Chavundaraya Purana\", also known as \"Trishasthi Lakshana Purana\", in Kannada (978) and the \"Cāritrasāra\" in Sanskrit. He patronised the famous Kannada grammarians Gunavarma and Nagavarma I and the poet Ranna whose writing \"Parusharama Charite\" may have been a eulogy of his patron. Because of his many lasting contributions, Chavundaraya is an important figure in the history of medieval Karnataka.\n\nIn his writing, he claims he was from the \"Brahmakshatriya\" \"Vamsa\" (Brahmin converted to the Kshatriya caste). The 10th century Algodu inscription of the Mysore district and the Arani inscription from the Mandya district provide more information on the family genealogy of Chavundaraya. It states that Chavundaraya was the grandson of Govindamayya who is praised for his knowledge and Dharma and was the son of Mabalayya, a subordinate of King Marasimha II. Mabalayya and his brother Isarayya are praised for their prowess in the inscription. It is believed that their political position under King Marasimha II may have led to a gradual adoption of Kshatriya status by this Brahmin family.\n\nAn inscriptional eulogy of Chavundaraya on the \"Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar\" at Shravanabelagola (which has beautiful engravings and relief representing Chavundaraya and his guru Nemichandra at the base) praises him thus,\n\nAs a commander for the Western Ganga feudatory of the Rashtrakutas, he fought many battles for their Rashtrakutas overlords, beginning in the days of the Rashtrakuta king, Khottiga Amoghavarsha. In fact, the Gangas supported the cause of the Rashtrakutas till the very end. During the last years of Rashtrakuta rule, the Gangas were also under constant threat of civil war and from invasions of the increasingly powerful Chola Dynasty. When a civil war broke out in 975, Chavundaraya supported the cause of Prince Rachamalla IV and installed him on the throne.\n\nChavundaraya suppressed a rebellion made by Panchaldeva Mahasamanta in 975 AD and slew Mudurachayya (who held the titles \"Chaladanka Ganga\" and \"Gangarabanta\") in the battle of Bageyur. He thus avenged the death of his brother Nagavarma by Mudurachayya. After these battles where Chavundaraya showed his gallantry, Rachamalla IV ascended the Ganga throne. For his exploits, Chavundraya earned the titles \"Samara Parsurama\", \"Vira Martanda\", \"Ranarangasimha\", \"Samara Dhurandhara\", \"Vairikula Kaladanda\", \"Bhuja Vikrama\" and \"Bhatamara\".\n\nChavundaraya's writing, \"Chavundaraya Purana\", is the second oldest existing work in prose style in Kannada and is a summary of the Sanskrit works, \"Adipurana\" and \"Uttarapurana\", written by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. The prose work, composed in lucid Kannada, was meant mainly for the common man and avoided any reference to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. In his writing, the influences of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna are seen. \"Trishashtilakshana purana\" narrates the legends of twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras, twelve \"Chakravartis\", nine \"Balabhadras\", nine \"Narayanas\" and nine \"Pratinarayanas\" – narrations on sixty-three Jain proponents in all.\n\nThe monolith Gomateshwara statue dedicated to the Jain saint, Bahubali, was commissioned by Chavundaraya and built on the Indragiri hill (also known as Vindhyagiri Hill) is a unique example of Western Ganga sculpture. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is 60 feet tall with the face measuring 6.5 feet. With the serene expression on the face of the image, its curled hair with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka. It is the largest monolithic statue in the world. The \"Chavundaraya basadi\" also in Shravanabelagola and built on the Chandragiri Hill is credited to him by some scholars while others argue it was built by his son Jinadevana. However, by the 12th century additions to the shrine were made by a later King Gangaraja by which time tradition held that the shrine was built by Chavundaraya. However another view holds that the original shrine itself was consecrated in the 11th century and built in memory of Chavundaraya.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5158850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5158850", "title": "Chine (boating)", "text": "Chine (boating)\n\nA chine in boating refers to a sharp change in angle in the cross section of a hull. A hull without chines has a gradually curving cross section. The term hard chine indicates an angle with little rounding, where a soft chine would be more rounded, but still involve the meeting of distinct planes. Chine log construction is a method of building hard chine boat hulls. Hard chines are common in plywood hulls, while soft chines are often found on fiberglass hulls.\n\nThe oldest type of engineered boats are dugout canoes, which were built by hollowing out a log. These designs generally had rounded bottoms, which made best use of the round shape of the logs. Traditional planked hulls in most cultures are built by placing wooden planks oriented parallel to the waterflow and attached to bent wooden frames. This also produced a rounded hull, generally with a sharp bottom edge to form the keel. Planked boats were built in this manner for most of history.\n\nThe first hulls to start incorporating hard chines were probably shallow draft cargo carrying vessels used on rivers and in canals. \n\nOnce sufficiently powerful marine motors had been developed to allow powerboats to plane, it was found that the flat underside of a chined boat provided maximum hydrodynamic lift and speed.\n\nThe scow in particular, in the form of the scow schooner, was the first significant example of a hard chine sailing vessel. While sailing scows had a poor safety reputation, that was due more to their typical cheap construction and tendency to founder in storms. As long as it sailed in the protected inland and coastal waters it was designed to operate in, however, the sailing scow was an efficient and cost effective solution to transporting goods from inland sources to the coast. A good example of this is the gundalow.\n\nWorking in the same inland waters as the sailing scows was the later river steamboat. River steamboats were often built using the same hard chined construction methods of the sailing scows, with a flat bottom, hard chine, and nearly vertical sides.\n\nThe punt is one of the older and simplest hard chine small boats. Consisting usually of a single plank for each side, with a square bow and stern, the punt was in essence a tiny scow.\n\nThe simplest type of chine construction is the single chine \"V\" shape, with two flat panels joined at the keel (A). This type of hull is among the simplest to build, but they lack stability on a narrow \"V\" and may lack freeboard on a wide \"V\". Single chine hulls are generally only seen on multihull sailboats, which often use two deep \"V\" shaped hulls connected by akas to provide mutual stability.\n\nThe two chine hull (B), with a flat bottom and nearly vertical sides, was the first hard chine design to achieve widespread use. This design provides far more stability than the single chine hull, with minimum draft and a large cargo capacity. These characteristics make the two chine hull popular for punts, barges, and scows.\n\nThe three chine hull (C) is probably the most common hard chine hull. Having a shallow \"V\" in the bottom and near-vertical panels above that, it approximates the shape of traditional rounded hull boats fairly well. This hull is common, even in fiberglass designs where employing chines offers no advantage in construction.\n\nDesigns with higher numbers of chines (D), often just called multichine hulls, are also common. By increasing the number of chines, the hull can very closely approximate a round bottomed hull. Kayaks, in particular, are often composed of many chines, required for the complex shapes needed to provide good performance under various conditions. \n\nIt is possible to refer to the different hulls by the numbers of the flat panels that make up the boat. Thus A is a two-panel boat, B is a three-panel boat, C is a four-panel boat and D is an eight-panel boat.\nPlank hulls use wooden supports placed along the chines called chine logs to provide strength where the chines joined. Beams are then attached to the chine log to support planks running parallel to the chine, while cross-planked sections such as a typical scow bottom may be attached directly to the chine log. This method of construction originated with the sailing scow and continues to be used today, primarily in home built boats. \n\nChine log construction works best for hulls where the sides join a flat bottom at a right angle, but it can be used for other angles as well with an appropriately angled chine log. Builders of small boats such as punts, where the plank thickness is large compared to the size of the hull, can dispense with the chine log and nail intersecting planks directly into one another.\n\nA chined hull built out of plywood will often be designed to keep most of the lengthwise joints between the plywood sheets at the chines, thus making the building process easier. While chine logs (often just called chines) can be used for plywood boats, another common technique replaces the chine logs with a fiberglass and epoxy fillet joint that provides both connection and stiffness to the joint; this method is most commonly called stitch and glue construction.\n\n"}

There are two types of Cofán: Aguarico (spoken in Ecuador) and San Miguel (primarily spoken in Colombia). Approximately 60% of Cofán speakers in Ecuador are literate in their own language.\n\nUse of Cofán in Ecuador is connected to the language in land property rights documents and in the bilingual access to the language in schools. In Colombia, Cofán is more endangered because of war, displacement, and intermarriage.\n\nCofán is a language isolate. Some scholars claim Cofán is not classified into a language family. The language does exhibit some lexical similarities to Chibchan, a geographically neighboring language. However, evidence of the lexical influence Chibchan has on Cofán does not prove any genetic relationship between the two languages.\n\nThere are ten vowels in Cofán: five oral vowels and their nasal counterparts.\n\nAs noted by Raphael Fischer and Kees Hengeveld, Cofán has a moderately large consonant inventory. A notable feature is the three-way voicing distinction for stops and affricates.\nWord order in Cofán is mostly free and flexible and is influenced by pragmatic factors. (Co)subordinate clauses, however, have a strong preference for being predicate-final.\n\nParagraphs are a distinct and important structure in Cofán grammar. There are fifteen different paragraph types used in Cofán narrative discourse. The narrative paragraph and simultaneous paragraph “form the backbone of narrative discourse.” The coordinate descriptive paragraph and deictic paragraph are used to portray character or participant identity development and to outline situations. Reason, contrast, and antithetical paragraphs are used to foster relationships and tension between speakers and events. Amplification paragraphs, contraction paragraphs, negated antonym paragraphs and cyclic paragraphs are used in “paraphrasing” particular information. Lastly, comment paragraphs and quote and dialogue paragraphs are used to add detail to a narrative.\n\nA written system of the Cofán has been devised by M. B. Borman. Some are simple letters, while others are compound. Nasalization on vowels is orthographically represented by placing after the vowel. (For example, // is written .) Prenasalization on stops and affricates is orthographically represented either by placing before bilabials (for example, for //) or by placing elsewhere (for example, for // and for //).\nCofán’s number system is a base-five system. Cofán speakers use Spanish numerals to count.\n\n\n"}

Like individual copywriters, copywriting agencies may offer writing on a for-hire or per-project basis.\n\nIn addition, because copywriting agencies often offer the services of many staff members, they may offer a broader range of services than can individuals. These services include but not limited to writing, editing, content or marketing consulting, branding, naming, scriptwriting, speechwriting, information architecture, print and web design and layout, software development, social networking consulting and implementation, and project management. An agency may also partner with other businesses—for example, design or advertising firms—or with in-house client teams. Depending on the project, agency staff may work onsite with the client, from the agency offices, or virtually from any location.\n\nCopywriting agencies may be designed on an employee model, with full- or part-time employees providing services to clients. Others may work with a regular team of trusted contractors, while still others function more like middlemen, connecting clients and editorial freelancers and taking a cut of the proceeds from each project.\n\nBusiness and nonprofit clients often hire copywriting agencies for larger projects that fall outside of existing skills and time or staffing needs, or for projects that require expertise in a specific discipline or area of knowledge. Many agencies specialize in one or more industries—doing work for clients, for example, in publishing, finance, technology, biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, the environment, engineering, government, the military, education, the arts, or the nonprofit world. Others employ writers, editors, etc. with varying specialties, so as to work for a variety of clients.\n\nAllowing for overall economic trends, job prospects for both individual copywriters and copywriting agencies expanded during the 1990s and 2000s, for reasons including an increased need for production and editing of online contentand an increase in business outsourcing and freelancing. As of 2012, employment for freelance writers is expected to continue to grow.\n\nApostrophe Copywriters"}

Boris Eichenbaum outlined principles of syntagmatic construction. (see: syntagmatic analysis) Syntagmatic analysis deals with sequence and structure, as opposed to the paradigm emphasis of paradigmatic analysis. The cinema, for Eichenbaum, is a “\"particular of figurative language,” the stylistics of which would treat filmic “syntax,” the linkage of shots in “phrases” and “sentences.\"”” \n\nEichenbaum and Tynyanov had two different approaches to interpreting the signs of film. \"\"Tynyanov spoke of the cinema as offering the visible world in the form of semantic signs engendered by cinematic procedures such as lighting and montage, while Eichenbaum saw film in relation to “inner speech” and “image translations of linguistic tropes.\"”\" \n\nThe film-language concept was explored more deeply in the 1960s when post-structuralist thinkers started to criticize structuralism. Also, semiotics became popular in academia. Early work in this field dealt with “\"contrasting arbitrary signs of natural language with the motivated, iconic signs of the cinema\"”.\n\n\nDenotation and connotation\n\nFilm communicates meaning denotatively and connotatively. What the audience sees and hears is denotative, it is what it is and they don’t have to strive to recognize it. At the same time these sounds and images are connotative and the way the scene is shot is meant to evoke certain feelings from the viewer. Connotation typically involves emotional overtones, objective interpretation, social values, and ideological assumptions. According to Christian Metz, “The study of connotation brings us closer to the notion of the cinema as an art (the “seventh art”).” Within connotations, paradigmatic connotations exist, which would be a shot that is being compared with its unrealized companions in the paradigm. A low angle shot of a rose conveys a sense that the flower is somehow dominant or overpowering because we unconsciously compare it with an overhead shot of a rose which would diminish its importance. Syntagmatic connotation would not compare the rose shot to other potential shots but compare it with actual shots that precede or follow it. The meaning adheres to it because its compared to other shots we actually see.\n\nNarrative\n\nNarrative is generally known as having two components; the story presented and the process of telling it, or narration, often referred to as narrative discourse. Film narrative theory seeks to uncover the apparently “motivated” and “natural” relationship between the signifier and the story-world in order to reveal the deeper system of cultural associations and relationships that are expressed through narrative form. As Roland Barthes has said, “narrative may be transmitted through oral or written language; through static or moving images, through gestures and through an organized mixture of all these substances. There is narrative in myth, legend, fables, fairytales, novellas, novels, history, novel, epos, tragedy, drama, comedy, pantomime, pictures, comics, events and conversation. In these unlimited forms, narrative exists at all times, in all corners of the earth, in all societies. Narrative begins with the history of mankind.” Films use a combination of dialog, sounds, visual images, gestures and actions to create the narrative. Narrators, usually in a voice-over format, are very popular in documentary film and greatly assist in telling the story while accompanying powerful shots.\n\nTropes\n\nMetonymy refers to the ability of a sign to represent something entirely, while literally only being a part of it. An example of this is the Eiffel Tower, which is a metonym for Paris. Film uses metonyms frequently because they rely on the external to reveal the internal. Another powerful semiotic tool for filmmaking is the use of metaphors, which are defined as a comparison between two things that are unrelated but share some common characteristics. In film, a pair of consecutive shots is metaphorical when there is an implied comparison of the two shots. For instance, a shot of an airplane followed by a shot of a bird flying would be metaphorical, implying that the airplane is (or is like) a bird.\n\nUmberto Eco’s \"Articulations of The Cinematic Code\" (1976)\n\nUmberto Eco’s research dealt with the semiology of visual codes using the work of Metz and Pasolini as a starting point. Eco viewed the task of semiology as important and radical. “\"Semiology shows us the universe of ideologies, arranged in codes and sub-codes, within the universe of signs, and these ideologies are reflected in our preconstituted ways of using the language.\"” \n\nTriple articulation codes consist of figures, signs and elements. Eco assumed that the cinematic codes are the only ones using triple articulation. Where current linguistic conventions might use two axes, the paradigmatic and the syntagmatic, the triple articulation can use kinesics to identify discrete units of time. Articulations are introduced into a code to communicate the maximum number of combinable elements. Because we normally experience non-articulated and double-articulated codes, running across a code with triple articulation can be overwhelming. “\"The contextual wealth of this combination makes the cinema a richer form of communication than speech.\"” \n\nSummary of codes\n\n1. Perceptive codes\n\n2. Codes of recognition\n\n3. Codes of transmission\n\n4. Tonal codes\n\n5. Iconic codes (figures, signs and semes)\n\n6. Iconographic codes\n\n7. Codes of taste and sensibility\n\n8. Rhetorical codes\n\n9. Stylistic codes\n\n10. Codes of the unconscious\n\nChristian Metz’s \"Film Language: A Semiotics of Cinema\" (1974)\n\nThis collection of Metz’s writings on cinematographic problems was informed by insights from structural linguistics.\n“\"The study of the cinema as an art – the study of cinematographic expressiveness – can therefore be conducted according to methods derived from linguistics...through its procedures of denotation, the cinema is a specific language\"” \n\nRobert Stam, Robert Burgoyne, and Sandy Flitterman-Lewis’s \"New Vocabularies in Film Semiotics: Structuralism, Post-structuralism, and Beyond\" (1992)\n\nThis work highlighted film semiotics as a new tool in art criticism. The book provided an overview of previous thinkers and defined terms critical to semiotic film theory. “\"This book is intended as a didactic introduction to the vocabulary of the field, not as a series of interventions in film theory\"” \n\nPart One \"The Origins of Semiotics\"\n\nSemiotics must be viewed through the broader context of the linguistic nature of contemporary thought.\n\n\"\"The overarching meta-discipline of semiotics...can be seen as a local manifestation of a more widespread \"linguistic turn,\" an attempt to reconceptualize the world \"through\" linguistics.\"\"\n\nPart Two \"Cine-semiology\"\n\nDealt with the cinematic sign, The Grand Syntagmatic, textual systems and analysis, semiotics of filmic sound, language in the cinema.\n\nPart Three \"Film-narratology\"\n\nTaking cues from structuralism and Russian Formalism, film narrative theory attempts to \"designate the basic structures of story processes and to define the aesthetic languages unique to film narrative discourse.\"\n\nPart Four \"Psychoanalysis\"\n\nThe relationship between human psyche and cinematic representation is explored. \"One of the aims, therefore, of psychoanalytic film theory is a systematic comparison of the cinema as a specific kind of spectacle and the structure of the socially and psychically constituted individual.\"\n\nPart Five \"From realism to intertextuality\"\n\nDescribes the evolution from an emphasis on realism in the 1950s to the intertextuality of the 1970s.\n\n"}

He held various offices in different institutions of the Government of Sri Lanka. At present he is the leader of Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Party. During the presidential elections of 1994 and 1999, he was the candidate of that party for this high office.\n\nHe is the compiler of the Practical Sinhala Dictionary (1982) and Gunasena Great Sinhala Dictionary, which are considered as the most comprehensive Sinhala-Sinhala dictionaries to date. Besides compiling these voluminous works of over 2000 pages, he also proposed scientific ideas to standardise the Sinhala alphabet.\n\nHis political philosophy \"Mahasammatavada\" ('Great Consensus' or comprehensive consultation) envisages consulting all people which he described \"as going beyond democracy\". He has also appeared for the rights of Sinhala Buddhists on various fora.\n\nHarischandra Wijayatunga was born in 1931 at Madamulla in Minuwangoda, Sri Lanka. His father, Wijayatunga Mudalige Don Bastian Wijayatunga, was an Ayurvedic eye physician, landed proprietor and a planter (coconut and paddy) and his mother was Amarawathie Jayasinghe. Wijayatunga was the fourth in a family of eight siblings.\n\nWijayatunga received his elementary education at the Government Bilingual School in Minuwangoda. When the Nalanda College Colombo was relocated to Minuwangoda during the World War II, as a security measure, his parents took the opportunity to shift him to that school. After the War Nalanda College Colombo was taken back to Colombo, and Wijayatnga continued his studies at Nalanda College Colombo. Some of Wijayatunga's notable classmates at Nalanda College were Karunaratne Abeysekera, Dr Hudson Silva, Hon. Dr Dharmasena Attygalle, Hon. Rupa Karunathilake, Ravindra Rupasena and Stanley Jayasinghe.\n\nIn 1952 he entered the University of Ceylon and in 1955 graduated with a bachelor's degree in science.\n\nFor his thesis \"Legal Philosophy in Medieval Sinhale\" he was awarded the PhD degree by the University of Kelaniya in 1990.\n\nImmediately after his University education, Wijayatunga joined the staff of Dharmaraja College, Kandy as a science teacher. In addition, he also taught Chemistry at the Mahamaya Girls' College, Kandy. It was during this time that he wrote his first book \"Miridiya Jivihu\" (Freshwater Life). In 1956 he was appointed as the Editor of the Science Section of the Sinhala Encyclopaedia, established at the University of Peradeniya. After some years of service there, he assumed the post of vice-Principal of his former work place, Dharmaraja College.\n\nIn 1965 he was appointed to the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) which started work in the same year. He was the first and the only member appointed to the staff, functioning as its Secretary. Under his supervision Divisional Committees on Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Agriculture and Chemicals, and Metrication of Sri Lanka were appointed.\n\nThe next step he took was to join the Sri Lanka Law College as a student. He took his oaths as an Attorney-at-Law in 1973.\n\nHe appeared for the accused in the 1971 insurrection before the Criminal Justice Commission. It is also noteworthy that he represented several parties at the Presidential Commission headed by the former Chief Justice Mr. M. C. Sansoni.\n\nThroughout the 1980s he held various offices such as Chief Editor of the tabloid \"Sinhala Bauddhya\" (The Sinhala Buddhist), director, Sri Lanka Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation and member of the Directorate of the Siddhayurveda College, Gampaha. During the years 1984–1990, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the Sinhalese Encyclopaedia as well as the Officer-in-Charge, Sinhala version of the Legislative Enactments of Sri Lanka.\n\nWijayatunga's political career goes back to his university days. He joined in the popular movement in 1950s to make Sinhala the Official Language of Sri Lanka, calling into life the \"Sinhala Union of the University of Ceylon\". During his stay in Kandy he associated himself with the work of Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Realising that none of the two major parties in Sri Lanka would espouse the rights of Sinhala Buddhists, which was uppermost in his mind, he established the Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya in 1990 with a group of intellectuals. He became the leader of this party and holds this position to this date.\n\nIn the third Sri Lankan presidential election, 1994, he was the candidate of his Party and polled 32,651 votes. Six years later, he contested again in the presidential elections of 1999, polling 35,854 votes. He also contested in the parliamentary elections of 2000, 2001 and 2004.\n\nWijayatunga was married to Kalukapuge Karuna Perera (B.A., Dip. Ed., Attorney-at-Law, Notary Public and Commissioner of Oaths) of Kiribathgoda, who died in 2000. Karuna's father, a Kalukapuge Bandaranaike, adopted the surname Perera during British colonial time. One of the descendent of the male lineage of the Kalukapuge Bandaranaike family is the fourth Prime Minister of Ceylon, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Karuna's both parents were school principals.\n\nWijayatunga and Karuna are the parents of three sons (Widyasagara, b. 1965, Chakrapani, b. 1967 and Chandrakeerthi, b. 1970) and a daughter (Shyama Kumari, b. 1969).

In 1990, it was estimated that more than 5,000 people could speak Hopi as a native language (approximately 75% of the population), but only 40 of them were monolingual in Hopi. The 1998 language survey of 200 Hopi people showed that 100% of Hopi elders (60 years or older) were fluent, but fluency in adults (40–59) was only 84%, 50% in young adults (20–39), and 5% in children (2–19).\n\nDespite the apparent decline, Hopi and Navajo both are supported by bilingual education programs in Arizona, and children acquire the Native American languages as their first language.\n\nMany Hopi children are being raised in the language. A comprehensive edited by Emory Sekaquaptewa and others has been published, and a group, the Hopi Literacy Project, has focused its attention on promoting the language. As of 2013, \"a pilot language revitalization project, the Hopi Lavayi Nest Model Program, for families with children birth through 5,\" is being planned for the village of Sipaulovi.\n\nIn 2004, Mesa Media, a nonprofit organization, was created to help revitalize the language.\n\nBenjamin Whorf identifies four varieties (dialects) of Hopi:\n\n\nFirst Mesa is spoken on First Mesa (which is the eastern mesa) in Polacca village in Walpi pueblo and in other neighboring communities. A community of Arizona Tewa live on First Mesa, and its members speak Tewa, in addition to a variety of Hopi and English and Spanish.\n\n\"Mishongnovi\" is spoken on Second Mesa (which is the central mesa) in Mishongnovi village. \"Mishongnovi\" has few speakers compared to First and Third Mesa dialects. Shipaulovi is also spoken on Second Mesa in Shipaulovi village, which is close to Mishongnovi village. Whorf notes that other villages on Second Mesa are of unknown dialectal affiliation.\n\nAn introductory textbook (Kalectaca 1978) has been written by a \"Shongopavi\" speaker. \"Shongopavi\" is another village on the Second Mesa, but its relation to other dialects has not been analyzed. The Third Mesa dialect is spoken on Third Mesa (which is the western mesa) at \"Oraibi\" village and in neighboring communities, as well as in \"Moenkopi\" village, which lies off Third Mesa and at a distance west of it.\n\nThe first published analysis of the Hopi language is Benjamin Whorf's study of Mishongnovi Hopi. His work was based primarily on a single off-reservation informant, but it was later checked by other reservation speakers. In his study, he states that Mishongnovi is the most archaic and phonemically complex of the dialects. The Third Mesa dialect preserves some older relics that have been lost in Mishongnovi.\n\nMalotki (1983) reports that Third Mesa speakers of younger generations have lost the labialization feature of \"w\" on the different subject subordinator \"-qw\" after the vowels \"a\", \"i\", \"e\", \"u\" where they have \"-q\" instead. This loss of labialization is also found on the simultaneity marker where younger speakers have \"-kyang\" against older \"-kyangw\". In words with \"kw\" or \"ngw\" in the syllable coda, the labialization is also lost: \"naksu\" (younger) vs. \"nakwsu\" (older) \"he started out\", \"hikni\" (younger) vs. \"kikwni\" (older) \"he will drink\", \"tuusungti\" (younger) vs. \"tuusungwti\" (older) \"he got frozen\".\n\nHopi is part of the Pueblo linguistic area (a Sprachbund) along with members of the Tanoan family, the Keresan languages, Zuni, and Navajo.\n\nHopi speakers have traditionally used Hopi as the language of communication with Zuni. They have also been in close contact with a Tanoan language for over 300 years since the Arizona Tewa, who speak Tewa, moved from the Galisteo Basin following the Pueblo Revolt to reside on First Mesa. The Arizona Tewa have traditionally acted as translators for the Hopi-speaking Tewa, Hopi, Navajo, Spanish, and English.\n\nThe Hopi had cursory contact with Spanish beginning with the explorers in 1540. In 1629 a small group of Franciscan missionaries started arriving in Hopi territory, building a church the following year. They remained there until 1680 when the Pueblo Revolt occurred and the Hopi expelled the Spanish from the region. Both the practices of the Spanish when there, and the stories of negative experiences of Puebloan refugees from the Rio Grande region, contributed to a Hopi attitude where acculturation was resisted or rejected.\n\nA number of studies have focused on loanwords borrowed into Hopi from other languages.\n\nThere are six basic vowels in Hopi:\n\nThe vowel letter represents a sound that is similar to the vowel (as in English \"pet\") but with rounded lips. This sound also occurs, among other languages, in French (\"deux\") and German (\"schön\").\n\nThe vowel letter represents a sound that is similar the vowel of English \"boot\", but without rounded lips and further forward in the mouth.\n\nHopi dialects differ in their number of consonants. Below are two separate inventories of the Third Mesa and Mishongnovi dialects. The Third Mesa inventory has orthographic symbols and IPA transcriptions of those symbols when the IPA symbol differs from the orthographic symbol.\n\nAs seen above, the Mishongnovi dialect has a larger number of consonants when compared with the Third Mesa dialect. The additional consonants are a series of preaspirated stops and a series of voiceless sonorants.\n\nThere is idiolectal free variation with the voiced labial fricative represented with , which varies between labiodental and bilabial . Before a consonant (word-medially) and at the end of words, it is not voiced although its realization is dependent upon dialect; Third Mesa speakers have while Mishongnovi speakers have .\n\nThe alveolar sibilants and are apical. In some Third Mesa speakers, they are palatalized to and , which can sound similar to and of English. In Mishongnovi, is palatalized when at the beginning of syllables and non-palatalized elsewhere.\n\nHopi has a number of stop contrasts at the velar place of articulation that occur before the low vowel . Elsewhere, the contrasts are neutralized. The velar in environments of neutralization is called \"neutral\" \"k\" by . Before the front vowels and , it is palatalized with a fronted articulation and following palatal glide . Thus, and are and , respectively. Before the non-front vowels and , it is a typical velar: is and is . Before the front rounded vowel , it has a backed articulation: is . Before , there is a phonemic contrast with fronted velar with following palatal glide and the backed velar. Complicating this pattern are words borrowed from Spanish that have a velar followed by a low vowel. With the addition of these loanwords, a third velar contrast has been introduced into Hopi. Words with this borrowed velar are \"neutral\" and typically velar in articulation. Thus, there is a distinction between and in native words both of which are distinct from in loanwords. \n\nThe precise phonetics of these \"k\" consonants is unclear due to vague descriptions in the literature. suggests that the fronted articulation represented by is distinguished more by presence of the palatal glide than by the difference in the articulatory position of the dorsal contact. He also mentions that the backed sound represented by is \"not-so-far-back\". This suggests that this sound is post-velar and not quite uvular. describes the fronted sound and the sound from Spanish loanwords as palatal while the backed ones are velar. describes the fronted form as palatal with palatal glide before some vowels, The form from Spanish loanwords as \"ordinary k\", and the backed form as velar. Whorf's letter to Clyde Kluckhohn in describes the backed velar as being like Arabic or Nootka , which suggests a uvular articulation. Whorf's phonemicization of Mishongnovi posits the fronted version occurring before all vowels but (with a fronted allophone before , , and ); the backed form occurring before non-high vowels (, , and ); and the form from Spanish loanwords before .\n\nSimilarly to the velar stops, Hopi has a fronted dorsal nasal and a backed dorsal nasal represented as and , respectively. The fronted nasal is palatal . The backed nasal is described as velar in Third Mesa speech and thus forms a \"neutral\" series with \"neutral\" \"k\". In Mishongnovi speech, Whorf describes the backed nasal as having the more rear articulation of the backed dorsal: .\n\nThe retroflex sound represented with varies between a retroflex fricative () and a flap , although the fricative realization is much more common. In Mishongnovi, this sound is only weakly fricative. In syllable coda position, it is devoiced to a voiceless fricative .\n\nThe preaspirated stops and voiceless sonorants of Mishongnovi only occur in syllable coda position. However, they do contrast with plain stops and voiced sonorants in this position. Whorf notes that the preaspirated stops also contrast with a similar sequence of + stop.\n\nHopi is written using the Latin alphabet. The vowel letters correspond to the phonemes of Hopi as follows: , , , , and . Long vowels are written double: , , , , , .\n\nConsonants are written: \n\nFalling accent is marked with a grave : \"tsirò\" 'birds'.\n\nTo distinguish certain consonants written as digraphs from similar looking phonemes meeting across syllable boundaries, a period is used: \"kwaahu\" ('eagle') but \"kuk.wuwàaqe\" ('to follow tracks').\n\nThe most common syllable clusters are CV and CVC.\n\nThe CVCC cluster is very rare due to limited number of CC combinations in the language. This also makes it unusual to find the intrasyllabic clusters C-C and CC-C.\n\nThe stress pattern in Hopi follows a simple rule that applies to nearly all words.\n\n\nSome exceptions to this rule are \"sikisve\" \"car\", \"wehekna\" \"spill\" and \"warikiwta\" \"\"running\". We would expect the second vowel to be stressed but in fact the first one is stressed in these examples.\n\nThe Third Mesa dialect of Hopi has developed tone on long vowels, diphthongs, and vowel + sonorant sequences. This dialect has either falling tones or level tones.\n\nThe falling tone (high-low) in the Third Mesa dialect corresponds to either a vowel + preaspirated consonant, a vowel + voiceless sonorant, or a vowel + \"h\" sequence in the Second Mesa dialect recorded by Whorf.\n\nHopi uses suffixes for a variety of purposes. Some examples are:\n\nHopi also has free postpositions:\n\nNouns are marked as oblique by either the suffixes \"-t\" for simple nouns or \"-y\" for dual nouns (those referring to exactly two individuals), possessed nouns or plural nouns.\n\nSome examples are shown below:\n\nVerbs are also marked by suffixes but these are not used in a regular pattern. For example, the suffixes \"-lawu\" and \"-ta\" are both used to make a simple verb into a durative one (implying the action is ongoing and not yet complete) but it is hard to predict which suffix applies to which verbs. Second language learners of Hopi usually simply learn this by rote.\n\nThere are some gender specific terms in Hopi:\n\n\nThe simplest type of sentence in Hopi is simply a subject and a predicate: 'Maana wuupa' (the girl is tall).\n\nHowever, many Hopi sentences also include an object, which is inserted between the subject and the verb. Thus, Hopi is a subject–object–verb language.\n\nNouns are marked as subject or oblique, as shown above.\n\nPronouns are also marked as either nominative or oblique. For example, the singular subject pronoun \"you\" in Hopi is \"um\", and the form for the singular object pronoun is \"ung\".\n\nDemonstratives are marked by case in Hopi, shown first in their nominative form and then in their oblique form:\n\n\"iˈ\"/\"it\" - this\n\n\"pam\"/\"put\" - he (closer object)\n\n\"miˈ\"/\"mit\" - to (further object)\n\n\"ima\"/\"imuy\" - these\n\n\"puma\"/\"pumuy\" - they (closer object)\n\n\"mima\"/\"mimuy\" - those (further object)\n\nHopi has plural verbs. Dual noun subjects take the dual suffix \"-vit\" but singular verbs. Hopi does not have dual pronouns; instead, the plural pronouns may be used with singular verbs for a dual meaning. Noun and verb plurality is indicated, among other devices, by partial reduplication, marked in the gloss below with a tilde (~).\n\nBenjamin Lee Whorf, a well-known linguist and still one of the foremost authorities on the relationships obtaining between southwestern and Central American languages, used Hopi to exemplify his argument that one's worldview is affected by one's language and vice versa. Among Whorf's best-known claims was that Hopi had \"no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time.'\" Whorf's statement has been misunderstood to mean that Hopi has no concept of duration or succession of time, but in fact, he meant only that the Hopi have no conception of time as an object or a substance that may be divided and subdivided. Furthermore, according to John A. Lucy, many of Whorf's critics have failed to read his writings accurately, preferring instead to proffer uncharitable caricatures of his arguments. The existence of temporal concepts in the Hopi language was extensively documented by Ekkehart Malotki, and other linguists and philosophers are skeptical of Whorf's broader argument and his findings on Hopi have been disputed or rejected by some.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5391206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5391206", "title": "Languages of Angola", "text": "Languages of Angola\n\nThe languages of Angola are predominantly Bantu and Portuguese, with a small minority of !Kung and Khoe speakers. About 39 languages are spoken in Angola.\n\nPortuguese is the sole official language. Due to cultural, social and political mechanisms which date back to the colonial history, the number of native Portuguese speakers is large and growing. A 2012 study by the Angolan National Institute for Statistics found that Portuguese is the mother tongue of 39% of the population. It is spoken as a second language by many more throughout the country, and younger urban generations are moving towards the dominant or exclusive use of Portuguese. The 2014 population census found that about 71% of the nearly 25.8 million inhabitants of Angola speak Portuguese at home.\n\nIn urban areas, 85% of the population declared to speak Portuguese at home in the 2014 census, against 49% in rural areas. Portuguese was quickly adopted by Angolans in mid-twentieth century as a lingua franca among the various ethnic groups. After the Angolan Civil War, many people moved to the cities where they learned Portuguese. When they returned to the countryside, more people were speaking Portuguese as a first language. The variant of the Portuguese language used in Angola is known as Angolan Portuguese. Phonetically, this variant is very similar to the Brazilian variant with some notable exceptions. In some respects, Angolan Portuguese resembles that of a pidgin.\n\nHowever, in Cabinda, wedged between two French-speaking countries — the DRC and the Congo — many people speak French as well as, or better than, Portuguese. In fact, of the literate population, 90 percent speak French while 10 percent speak Portuguese. Also, the Angolan Bakongo who were exiled in the Democratic Republic of the Congo usually speak better French and Lingala than Portuguese and Kikongo.\n\nWest Africans speak English or French and their native African languages and are usually learning at least some Portuguese. The foreign language mostly learned by Angolans is English, but among the Bakongo (in the Northwest and Cabinda) French is often more important. English will soon be a required subject in Angolan schools. French was previously widely offered as an elective.\n\nAll native languages of Angola are considered to be national languages. After independence, the government said it would choose six to be developed as literary languages. The six languages vary between government pronouncements, but commonly included are \nUmbundu, Kimbundu, Kikongo (presumably the Fiote of Cabinda), Chokwe, Kwanyama (Ovambo), and Mbunda (never clearly defined; may be Nyemba, Luchazi, or indeterminate). Angolan radio transmits in fourteen of the \"main\" national languages: Bangala, Cokwe, Fiote, Herero ('Helelo'), Kikongo, Kimbundu, Kwanyama, Lunda, Ngangela, Ngoya, Nyaneka, Ovambo ('Oxiwambo'), Songo, Umbundu. Some of the national languages are used in Angolan schools, including the provision of teaching materials such as books, but there is a shortage of teachers.\n\nUmbundu is the most widely-spoken Bantu language, spoken natively by about 23 percent of the population, about 5.9 million. It is mainly spoken in the center and south of the country. Kimbundu is spoken in Luanda Province and adjacent provinces. Kikongo is spoken in the northwest, including the exclave of Cabinda. About 8.24% of Angolans use Kikongo. Fiote is spoken by about 2.9%, mainly in Cabinda.\n\nThe San people speak languages from two families, the !Kung and Khoe, though only a few hundred speak the latter. The majority of San fled to South Africa after the end of the civil war. The extinct Kwadi language may have been distantly related to Khoe, and Kwisi is entirely unknown; their speakers were neither Khoisan nor Bantu.\n\nA (very small) number of Angolans of Lebanese descent speak Arabic and/or French. Due to increasing Angola-China relations, there is now a sinophone community of about 300,000.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33550863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33550863", "title": "Luchazi language", "text": "Luchazi language\n\nLuchazi (Lucazi, \"Chiluchazi\") is a Bantu language of Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Zambia. Luchazi is the principal language of the Ngangela Group. Ngangela is a term coined by the Vimbundu traders and missionaries in 18th century to describe the tribes occupying the area of eastern-central Angola. Ngangela simply means people of the east. Ethnically distinct varieties, many of which are subsumed under the generic term \"Ngangela\", are all \"fully intelligible\". These are: Luchazi itself, Nyemba, Mbwela of Angola (Ambuella, \"Shimbwera\", not to be confused with Mbwela of Zambia), Nkangala, Mbunda, Luimbi (Lwimbi), Yauma, Songo, Chimbandi and Ngondzela.\n\nThe following table displays all the consonants in Luchazi:\n\nThe position of the speech-organs in producing the consonants is different from the positions taken in producing the similar sounds in European languages. T and D, for example, are lower than in English but higher than in Portuguese. L is flatter-tongued than in either English or Portuguese. Practically all the consonants have similar differences. The language contains many consonantal glides, including the prenasalized plosives and the voiceless alveolar sibilant affricate (the ts sound).\n\nThe close front vowel (i), when occurring before another vowel, becomes a semi-consonant and is written y, unless it is immediately preceded by a consonant, when it remains i. Examples: yange, viange.\n\nThe vowels have the so-called Continental or Italian values. They are shorter when unstressed and are prolonged when doubled or when stressed at the end of a word.\n\nShort when unstressed or before two consonants or \"y\" or \"s\" and in monosyllabic adverbs, as \"a\" in \"tata, paya, asa, hanga\". Prolonged when doubled or stressed at the end of a word or syllable. Example: \"ku laako\".\n\nShort when unstressed, as \"a\" in \"hete, seze\".\nShort with the value of \"e\" in \"henga, lenda\" before two consonants. Exceptions are hembo and membo (due to coalescence of vowels). Many words derived from Portuguese have the short vowel though not followed by two consonants. Examples: \"pena, papelo, luneta, ngehena,\" etc. Prolonged when stressed at the end of a word.\n\nShort when unstressed or before two consonants, as \"e\" in \"citi, linga\". In monosyllabics it is short, as \"i\" in \"it\". Examples: ni, ndi. Prolonged when stressed. Examples: ti, fui.\n\nShort when unstressed, as \"o\" in \"soko, loto\".\nShort, with value of \"o\" in \"onga, yoya, kosa, luozi, ndo\", before two consonants or y or s, and sometimes before z and in some monosyllables. The o is long in \"zoza\" and \"ngozi\". Sometimes prolonged when stressed at the end of a word. Example: \"to\".\n\nShort, when unstressed or before two consonants or before s, as \"u\" in \"futuka, mbunga, kusa\".\n\nLuchazi is written using the Latin alphabet, with most characters representing the same sound as in English, with some exceptions. c is pronounced like \"ch\" in \"church\", n followed by k or g is always nasal like \"ng\" in \"ring\", the sound of v is bilabial instead of labiodental.\n\nThe Luchazi language, for reasons of greater speed in utterance and or economy of effort, has marked combinatory changes, that are harmonious to the ear of the Ngangela people. These changes are of three kinds: (1) coalescence of two vowels into one, (2) elision of a vowel or an entire syllable, and (3) umlaut (vowel mutation).\n\nCoalescence occurs when the inseparable pronoun (nominative or objective), or the tense particles \"na\" or \"ka\" precede a verb beginning with a vowel. The preposition \"na\" coalesces with the following pronoun if the latter begins with a vowel, and the negating particle \"ka\" coalesces with the inseparable pronoun of the third person singular. The general rules are:\n\nSome VaLuchazi tend to coalesce \"k\" and \"i\" forming \"c\", as \"landacana\" for \"landakiana\".\n\nA number of nouns beginning with \"li\" drop this prefix when preceded by the locatives \"ha, ku\" or \"mu\". Examples: \"hembo\" (\"ha limbo\"), \"kuihia\" (\"ku lihia\"), \"muzimo\" (\"mu lizimo\"), \"muilu\" (\"mu lilu\"), etc. Some nouns, which originally had the prefix \"li\", have lost it, but it reappears in the alliterative concord. Examples: \"sisa liange\" (originally \"lisisa liange\").\n\n\nThe personal pronoun, third person singular, is elided before the tense particle \"na\", but if the indicative pronoun precedes it, it reoccurs. Examples: \"na handeka\", but, \"vi a na handeka\".\n\n\nCoalescence and elision are also very common in the case of the personal possessive pronouns and certain nouns expressing relationships. Examples: \"tatetu\" (\"tata yetu\"), \"sukuluange\" (\"sukulu yange\"), \"kukueni\" (\"kuku yeni\"), \"muanetu\" (\"muana uetu\"), yaliange (\"yala yange\"), \"mpanjenu\" (\"mpanji yenu\"), etc. The copula is always suppressed after the noun \"muana\", and often after \"muntu\". Examples: \"muana mpanga\" (\"muana ua mpanga\"), \"Muntu cilema\" (\"Muntu ua cilema\"), etc.\n\nThe change of a root vowel sound by the influence of a vowel in a following syllable is noted when the negative particle \"ka\" precedes the inseparable pronoun \"u\", when the preposition \"na\" precedes a pronoun beginning with \"u\", and when the copulative particle is followed by a pronoun beginning with \"u\", etc. Examples: \"ko u hasa\" (\"ka u hasa\"), \"no uze\" (\"na uze\"), \"no ukeuo\" (\"na ukeuo\"), \"ndoho yo uze\" (\"ndoho ya uze\"), \"yo u keze\" (\"ya u keze\"), etc.\n\nIn most European languages stress is the chief element in accent and the elementary and secondary are the only ones usually indicated, and stress is therefore often made a synonym for accent. But in the treatment of the Luchazi language such usage is not sufficient. There are two kinds of accent:\n\nThe stress regularly falls upon the penultimate (next to the last) syllable, except in some foreign words. As a rule, the addition of a suffix causes the accent to move forward to the new penult. This is called rhythmic stress as compared with the former, which is called etymological stress. However, the addition of the locative and other enclitic suffixes does not change the stress except in the negative conjugation. In the latter the addition of the enclitics causes the stress to move to the preceding syllable. Example: \"Nja vuíleko — ka nja vuiléko\". In the case of monosyllabic verbs the accent falls upon the preceding monosyllable. Example: \"U ye\". The monosyllabic adverbs always receive the accent. Example: \"Ci vuka tó\".\n\nSemantic tone is a very important feature of the Luchazi language as it serves to distinguish homographs and tenses. Examples: \"kanda\", not yet; ku \"kanda\", to forbid; \"ku kanda\", to dig up peanuts (groundnuts); \"nja tava\", I assented (in the indefinite past); \"nja tava\", I assented (just now); \"nja ku panga\", I have worked habitually (past tense of frequentative mood); \"nja ku panga\", I shall work (immediate future tense of indicative mood).\n\nSometimes the stress accent and the musical accent fall on the same syllable but very often they are separated. When a strong musical accent falls on the antepenultima or preantepenultima, a weak musical accent usually falls on the ultima. Perhaps in time the scale of tone or pitch may be worked out so as to permit a scientific marking of its quality. If we take the homographs \"ku vumbika\" (to bury rubbish) and \"ku vumbika\" (to show honour or grace to), as examples, calling the united stress and musical accents of the first homograph \"1\" (as being the strongest), then in the second homograph the stress accent will be lower or \"2\", the strongest musical accent will be \"3\", the weak musical accent of the ultima will be \"4\" and the unaccented antepenultima will be \"5\".\n\nOne cannot overemphasize the importance of acquiring correct accentuation. Some words are highly accented, and as \"vuzaluke\" (madness) and \"ntsenkulu\" (ancient times); while others seem almost devoid of tone quality, as \"pandakanenuko\" (add to it) and \"vusikumukilo\" (descent).\n\nThe last syllable of verbs in the singular of the imperative mode is often accented, and so is the final syllable of demonstrative pronouns when the speaker wishes to indicate the more or less exact location of the object referred to. This is usually accompanied with a raising of the head and a pointing with the lips. Examples: \"panga\", \"linga\", \"kuze\", \"cize\".\n\nFor emphasis the final syllable of a verb may be changed to \"e\" and accented strongly, the tone being prolonged, as \"Tua pangele pange\" (We worked a very long time). In calling to someone the voice is raised on the last syllable. Often \"e\" is substituted for the final syllable or added to it. If the distance be great, \"ho\" is added (the voice being dropped on \"ho\").\n\nThe nouns are inflected by means of prefixes to show number or state. The noun consists of two parts: the root (or stem) and the prefix. There are eight main classes of nouns distinguished from one another by their singular and plural prefixes. This classification of nouns is an arbitrary division. Since classes 3, 4 and 5 take the same plural prefix in most cases, they might be looked upon as one class. Or, classes 4, 5 and 7 might be split up into six classes instead of three. Most nouns belonging to the eight classes and their subclasses have both singular and plural prefixes, but there are many nouns that have only the singular and others that have only the plural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the eight main classes and the subclasses there are the locative classes and the verbal noun class. These may be simple or be complex compounds as to structure.\n\n\nThere are many subclasses and these are classified according to their alliterative concord, but even in this there is a lack of homogeneity, as a number of these nouns will take two sets of harmonic particles, using one set with the possessive pronouns and another set with other modifiers. The leading subclasses are:\n\nThere are three parts namely: the Class Prefix, the Harmonic Copula, and the Adjective Prefix as seen in the tables below.\n\nSingular\nPlural\nThe classification is according to the structure of Luchazi and does not follow the European grammatical systems.\n\nIt may be used independently of the verb, after prepositions, when the verb is understood but not expressed, in a compound subject or object, in comparisons, for emphasis, and with the intensive pronoun \"self\". Examples: \"Yange\" (singular), \"Yetu\" (plural)\n\nIt is always used as the immediate subject of a verb and is never omitted except in the imperative mode. It may be used with the verb understood, viz \"Nji muntu\" (I am a person/human). The objective form of the pronoun is used in the accusative and also in the dative when no preposition is used. In the following table, of the three forms of the pronoun shown in the Nominative case, the first is the one used with most tenses whether past, present or future; the second is used with some past tenses, some present and future; the third is used in the habitual mood and the conditional.\n\nIt is conjunctive since it connects a clause to its antecedent. It is demonstrative in that its main force seems to be to point out or emphasize its antecedent.\n\nThe pronoun of Class 1 may be used for all persons. As to whether you should use the simpler form (\"i, u, vu, li\") or the form with \"-a\" (\"ya, ua, vua, lia\"), depends on the speaker.\n\nIt is often followed by the interrogative pronouns \"iya\" (who) or \"-ka\" (which, what) with the prefix of the class referred to. With the preposition \"nga\", the negative indicative pronoun forms \"ants\" etc., which is used in conditional verbal construction.\n\nIt is made up of the indicative pronoun plus the particle \"o\", except in the singular of Class 1, which is irregular.\n\nThere is a general enclitic \"-ndzo\", which may be suffixed to nouns, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, etc., to give the meaning of \"then\" with strong emphasis. Examples: \"angendzo\", \"vikandzo.\"\n\nThe rule is: the enclitic pronoun of the possessor follows the copula of the thing possessed. \"-ange\" (singular) \"-etu\" (plural), \"-ove\" (singular) \"-enu\" (plural), \"-eni\" (singular) \"-avo\" (plural). For the remaining classes the possessive is the same as the enclitic.\n\nIt consists of the indicative pronoun plus the constant \"vene\". This pronoun is also used with a noun or the enclitic pronoun to show possession, as \"ivenevio, vaveneneco, ivene, vavene\". An \"a\" is often added to the stem when it shows possession, as \"ivenea, vaveneaco,\"\n\nLi is not a pronoun but a particle prefixed to verbs to give them a reflexive or reciprocal meaning.\n\nThe Pronoun is \"mukua\" (Plural \"vakua\"), some grammarians consider it a demonstrative pronoun.\n\nThe interrogative pronouns, who, which, and what, are rendered by \"iya\" (plural \"veya\") and \"vika\". Others are \"lika, muka, ueya, vueya\".\n\nThe indefinite pronoun include \"vose, uose, viose, vamo, umosi, nkala, ku, uahi, viahi, cipue\"\n\nThere are four groups of simple demonstrative pronoun with their corresponding plural.\nAs a rule the demonstrative pronoun follows the noun it modifies, as \"cifuti cino, muti ou\", but sometimes for emphasis it is placed before, as \"uno muaka, eli litangua\".\n"}

In 1914, he graduated from the Teacher’s Seminary in Lviv. He was a Ukrainian storywriter and playwright who moved for a time from Europe to North America, and continued to write about his European experiences while in the new world. He was also editor of a number of publications in Europe and Canada.\n\nThe first story he wrote was at the age of 17 entitled \"Meeting\" (Зустріч) using the penname Irchan. His first collection of sketches and short stories was titled \"Nirvana’s Laughter\" (Сміх Нірвани), a condemnation of war.\n\nHe became a soldier in the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen and the Ukrainian Galician Army shortly after the outbreak of World War I. He fought in three different armies:Austro-Hungarian, Galician, and the Red Army of Ukraine. When he ended up in the ranks of the Red Ukrainian Galician Army, he edited its periodical \"Red Archer\" (Червоний Стрелец). He wrote two plays about the Ukrainian Civil War in the middle of the war. \nThe first of these plays was \"The Rebel\" (Бунтар), begun in the Polish–Soviet War in April 1920, and completed January 12, 1921 in Uman. It received 26 performances in eight months throughout Kiev Oblast and Podolia. Printed by Kultura publishers in 1922, 3,000 of its 10,000 copies were distributed in North America. It is set in a Galician city early in 1920, as the Red Army offensive against Poland was stalling, and tells of a failed insurrection organized by pro-Soviet Ukrainian activists in the workers movement.\n\nFollowing the end of the civil war, Irchan settled in Kiev where he met and married his wife Zdenka. She was the daughter of a Czech doctor, and when her parents returned to Prague in 1922, the young couple followed them. In Prague, Irchan enrolled at Charles University and participated in Ukrainian student activities. He was well known as a writer by this time, and continued to publish articles and stories, some of which were printed in North America.\n\nIn 1923, Irchan was invited to come to Canada through ULTA (Ukrainian Labour Temple Association) to edit their journal \"Working Woman\" (Робітниця), to which he had already contributed articles. At this time Canadian Immigration only accepted immigrants as labourers, so he and his wife were invited to come to Canada by a Canadian farmer, in Gonor, Manitoba, where they lived for a time and he continued his literary activities.\n\nIn Canada, he was to experience the most creative literary period of his life, as editor, poet, storywriter, and playwright.\n\nThe first play he wrote in Canada was \"The Family of Brushmakers\" (Родина щіткарів). In all cases where the drama of the doubting and confused mind is Irchan's interest, his work takes on a rich texture and offers many possible readings and many complex interpretations. \"The Family of Brushmakers\", in four acts, written between 1923–24, tells the story of a family of four people – three of whom at the outset of the play are blind. Only the son can see. In Irchan’s own words, “In 1915, while I was lying ill in a German hospital in the Austrian capital Vienna, I read in a German newspaper a story in a small corner of its last page that a blind brushmaker and musician living in Germany had a blind wife and daughter. His only son, who had vision, was conscripted into the German army. In time, the son returned home, but to the glory of the Kaiser and the great German Empire, he had given up his eyesight. He had lost it during a poisonous attack at the front. So the only member of the family with sight, the son, was now blind in a blind family.” The play was a great success, staged 74 times from Montreal to Vancouver, and even the English Press had something to say about this “dangerous production”.\n\nThe reasons for his departure from Canada are manifold. First, his wife Zdenka who was in poor health, with their daughter, Maya, returned to her parents in Prague. Secondly, the organizational activities which entangled him more and more with ULTA in Winnipeg left him little opportunity to develop as a writer. Finally, some of the membership of ULTA may have encountered problems with his work, possibly finding it too much that of the expression of an individual rather than of their organization. Whatever the reasons, on May 22, 1929, he left Winnipeg on his journey back to Europe.\n\nIrchan returned to Ukraine at a time when Stalin’s repression of artists, academics, and gifted individuals in all fields was intensifying.\n\nIrchan moved to Kharkiv, at that time the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city had writers’ organizations and publishers, and he had friends here in the writing community. In 1934, he was one of many writers arrested by the State Political Administration. His wife and daughter joined him in Omsk, Siberia, though it is unclear whether Zdenka did this voluntarily. In a letter she wrote to a friend in Winnipeg, she says, “Please do not send me anymore newspapers, and notify New York to do the same thing, because they are causing me unpleasantness. Some day I will write more. Greetings to all. Zdenka.” But nothing more was heard.\n\nThirty-four years after Irchan’s official rehabilitation in the Soviet Union, which was the result of Khrushchev’s report revealing the criminal activity under Stalin’s direction, the detail of Irchan’s fate was made public. Irchan was interrogated by Pavel Postyshev who is considered to be one of the principal architects of the famine of 1932–1933, known in Ukraine as Holodomor. Irchan was accused of “belonging” to the nationalist Ukrainian counter-revolutionary organization, which worked to overthrow Soviet rule in Ukraine by military means. It now seems he was shot with so many other Ukrainian intellectuals on 3 November 1937 at Sandarmokh in Karelia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4722099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4722099", "title": "On Denoting", "text": "On Denoting\n\n\"On Denoting\" is an essay by Bertrand Russell. It was published in the philosophy journal \"Mind\" in 1905. In it, Russell introduces and advocates his theory of denoting phrases, according to which definite descriptions and other \"denoting phrases ... never have any meaning in themselves, but every proposition in whose verbal expression they occur has a meaning.\" This theory later became the basis for Russell's descriptivism with regard to proper names, and his view that proper names are \"disguised\" or \"abbreviated\" definite descriptions.\n\nIn the 1920s, Frank P. Ramsey referred to the essay as \"that paradigm of philosophy\". In the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" entry \"Descriptions\", Peter Ludlow singled the essay out as \"\"the\" paradigm of philosophy\", and called it a work of \"tremendous insight\"; provoking discussion and debate among philosophers of language and linguists for over a century.\n\nFor Russell, a denoting phrase is a singular noun phrase, preceded by a quantifier, whose predicate term is satisfied by some particular. Such phrases do not contribute objects as the constituents of the singular propositions in which they occur. Denotation, in other words, is a semantically inert property, in this view. Whereas Frege held that there were two distinct parts (or aspects) of the meaning of every term, phrase, or sentence (its \"Sinn\" and \"Bedeutung\"), Russell explicitly rejects the notion of sense (\"Sinn\") and replaces it with the idea of a propositional function (i.e., a function from objects to abstract propositions that are the contents of sentences). This is so because, for Russell, propositions must have concrete, really existing entities as their constituents. Russell provides several clear examples of the sort of thing that he had in mind: \"a man, any man, every man, the present King of France... the centre of mass of the Solar System, ...\" So, for Russell, a denoting phrase can be either a definite description (i.e., a singular noun phrase with the determinative article \"the\" at the beginning), which \"does not denote anything\" (meaning designate any specific object) or a definite description that does denote a specific object or, finally, an indefinite description that denotes \"ambiguously\". Russell, as will be shown later, believes that definite descriptions are not referring expressions but rather, to borrow a term later coined by Keith Donnellan, they have \"attributive\" uses only. They are to be interpreted as strictly logical quantificational formulas that are \"general\" in nature. At least this has been the general interpretation of Russell among philosophical logicians for nearly a century.\n\nHowever, at the very beginning of the article, Russell distinguishes between cases where \"a phrase may be denoting and yet not denote anything (e.g. 'the present King of France')\" and cases where they may denote \"one definite object (such as 'the present King of England')\". If this passage is interpreted as saying that descriptions may \"refer\" to one definite object, then it could be that Russell actually recognised the two distinct uses of definite descriptions (attributive and referential) that Donnellan later proposed.\n\nIn any case, after clarifying the sense of the term \"denoting phrase\" and providing several examples to illustrate the idea, Russell explains the epistemological motivations for his theory. Russell believes at this point that there are essentially two modes of knowing: knowledge by description and knowledge by (direct) acquaintance. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to the sense data of the phenomenal world and to one's own private inner experiences, while knowledge of everything else (other minds, physical objects, and so on) can only be known by way of general descriptions.\n\nRussell starts out by defining the \"fundamental\" notion of a \"propositional function\". This is basically a modified version of Frege's idea of \"unsaturated concepts\". Hence, \"\"C\"(\"x\") stands for a proposition in which \"x\" is a constituent and where \"x\", the variable, is essentially and wholly undetermined.\" The notions of \"everything\", \"nothing\" and \"something\" (\"the most primitive of denoting phrases\") can then be defined as follows:\n\nwhere \"E\" stands for everything, \"N\" stands for nothing and \"S\" stands for something. \"All\" is taken as primitive and indefinable and the others are defined in terms of it. Russell emphasises that these notions can have no meaning apart from that which is assigned to them within the propositions in which they occur, all of which are meaningful. This is the foundation of Russell's theory of descriptions as he proceeds to illustrate.\n\nThe phrase \"the father of Charles II (F) was executed (E)\" is interpreted as the following quantificational assertion:\n\nIn other words, there is one and only one thing x such that x is the father of Charles II and x was executed.\n\nSo, if C represents any statement at all about the father of Charles II, the statement 'C (the father of Charles II)' always implies:\n\nIt follows that if there is not one and only one entity that satisfies the above, then every proposition that contains the descriptions in a primary occurrence is false. (If the mother of Charles II was ‘unfaithful’ the statement may be false.) In this way, Russell points out, it will turn out that all statements containing non-referring descriptions (e.g. \"The present king of Samothrace is\na great writer\") are false. Russell's theory reduces all propositions that contain definite descriptions into forms that do not.\n\nHe then criticises Meinong's theory of objects which, according to Russell, is ontologically promiscuous and self-contradictory. Both of these criticisms stem from Meinong's theory that there is an object, whether it exists or subsists, for every set of properties. Therefore, there is an object that is both round and not round, or round and square. Russell argues that Meinong's theory entails conclusions such as \"the present King of France\" both exists and does not exist. However, Meinong does not attribute existence (or any other sort of being) to \"non-existent objects\". Russell also accuses Meinong of violating the law of non-contradiction by asserting that the \"round square\" is both round and not round. Meinong, on the other hand, maintains that the laws of logic do not apply to such phenomena as \"impossible\" objects that have no being.\n\nOne of the fundamental puzzles that Russell hopes to resolve with the theory of descriptions is the problem of non-referring expressions or, as they are now called, negative existentials. He finally explains how his theory resolves this problem after invoking a distinction between what he calls \"primary\" and \"secondary\" occurrences of denoting phrases.\n\nSince definite descriptions are just quantificational devices on Russell's view they can enter into scope relations with other logical operators. In the case of negative existentials, there is an ambiguity between two different (primary and secondary) readings of the quantificational assertion. For example, Russell uses the case of \"the present King of France is not bald.\" Here the two possible readings are:\n\nIn the first case, the statement is false because it quantifies over non-existent entities. In the second case, the statement is true because it is not the case that there is a present King of France. \"Thus all propositions in which 'the King of France' has a primary occurrence are false: the denials of such propositions are true, but in them 'the King of France' has a secondary occurrence.\" Contemporarily, it is customary to discuss Russell's primary/secondary distinction in the more logically exact terms of wide and narrow scope. The scope distinction regards the operator that, on one reading, modifies \"only\" the subject, and on the other, modifies the entire sentence.\n\nRussell resolves the problem of ambiguity in propositional attitude reports in a similar manner. He refers to an example similar to Frege's puzzle about identity: \"George IV wondered whether Scott is the author of \"Waverley\".\" In this case, it is obvious that King George is not wondering whether Scott is identical to Scott. Russell rejects Frege's solution of distinguishing between sense and reference. Quantificational descriptions are sufficient for him to handle the \"de dicto\" / \"de re\" ambiguities. So, for example, in the general case, the sentence \"George IV wondered whether Scott is Sir Walter\" can be interpreted as:\n\nwhere \"...\" stands for some definite description such as \"the clever fellow who wrote Ivanhoe\" and ...stands for something like \"the elegant gentleman seated next to the Princess\". In the \"de re\" case, the above sentence can be interpreted as follows instead:\n\nFinally, Russell suggests that fictional names such as \"Apollo\" can be treated as abbreviated definite descriptions that refer to nothing. All propositions that contain names of such fictional entities are to be treated in the same manner as the negative existentials described above.\n\nIn his essay, \"On Referring\", P. F. Strawson criticised Russell's characterisation of statements where the object does not exist, such as \"the present King of France\", as being false. Such statements, Strawson held, are neither true nor false but, rather, absurd. Strawson believed that, contrary to Russell, use does determine the meaning of a sentence. To give the meaning of an expression is to \"give general directions for its use.\" Because of this, Strawson argued that, were someone to say the King of France was wise, we would not say their statement is true or false, but, rather, decide they must be under a misapprehension since, normally, the question would not arise as there is no King of France.\n\nStrawson also argued that we often need to know the use of a word to understand its meaning, such as in statements of the form, \"The table is covered with books.\" In normal use, the expression would be referring to one particular table. It is false, Strawson believed, to think, as Russell, that the phrase will only have meaning insofar as there is only one table and no more. The phrase has application in virtue of the fact that one table and no more is what is being referred to, and it is understood that the table is what is being referenced.\n\n\n"}

Developed by Western missionaries working among the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia in the 19th century and refined by missionaries working in Xiamen and Tainan, it uses a modified Latin alphabet and some diacritics to represent the spoken language. After initial success in Fujian, POJ became most widespread in Taiwan and, in the mid-20th century, there were over 100,000 people literate in POJ. A large amount of printed material, religious and secular, has been produced in the script, including Taiwan's first newspaper, the \"Taiwan Church News\".\n\nDuring Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), the use of Pe̍h-ōe-jī was suppressed and it faced further countermeasures during the Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after the establishment of the People's Republic of China (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use \"Pe̍h-ōe-jī\". Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used. Versions of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.\n\nThe name \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" () means \"vernacular writing\", written characters representing everyday spoken language. The name \"vernacular writing\" could be applied to many kinds of writing, romanized and character-based, but the term \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" is commonly restricted to the Southern Min romanization system developed by Presbyterian missionaries in the 19th century.\n\nThe missionaries who invented and refined the system used, instead of the name \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\", various other terms, such as \"Romanized Amoy Vernacular\" and \"Romanized Amoy Colloquial.\" The origins of the system and its extensive use in the Christian community have led to it being known by some modern writers as \"Church Romanization\" () and is often abbreviated in POJ itself to \"Kàu-lô\". () There is some debate on whether \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" or \"Church Romanization\" is the more appropriate name.\n\nObjections to \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" are that it can refer to more than one system and that both literary and colloquial register Southern Min appear in the system and so describing it as \"vernacular\" writing might be inaccurate. Objections to \"Church Romanization\" are that some non-Christians and some secular writing use it. One commentator observes that POJ \"today is largely disassociated from its former religious purposes.\" The term \"romanization\" is also disliked by some, who see it as belittling the status of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" by identifying it as a supplementary phonetic system instead of a fully-fledged orthography. Sources disagree on which of the two is more commonly used.\n\nThe history of Peh-oe-ji has been heavily influenced by official attitudes towards the Southern Min vernaculars and the Christian organizations that propagated it. Early documents point to the purpose of the creation of POJ as being pedagogical in nature, closely allied to educating Christian converts.\n\nThe first people to use a romanized script to write Southern Min were Spanish missionaries in Manila in the 16th century. However, it was used mainly as a teaching aid for Spanish learners of Southern Min, and seems not to have had any influence on the development of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\". In the early 19th century, China was closed to Christian missionaries, who instead proselytized to overseas Chinese communities in South East Asia. The earliest origins of the system are found in a small vocabulary first printed in 1820 by Walter Henry Medhurst, who went on to publish the \"Dictionary of the Hok-këèn Dialect of the Chinese Language, According to the Reading and Colloquial Idioms\" in 1832.\n\nThis dictionary represents the first major reference work in POJ, although the romanization within was quite different from the modern system, and has been dubbed \"Early Church Romanization\" by one scholar of the subject. Medhurst, who was stationed in Malacca, was influenced by Robert Morrison's romanization of Mandarin Chinese, but had to innovate in several areas to reflect major differences between Mandarin and Southern Min. Several important developments occurred in Medhurst's work, especially the application of consistent tone markings (influenced by contemporary linguistic studies of Sanskrit, which was becoming of more mainstream interest to Western scholars). Medhurst was convinced that accurate representation and reproduction of the tonal structure of Southern Min was vital to comprehension:\nThe system expounded by Medhurst influenced later dictionary compilers with regard to tonal notation and initials, but both his complicated vowel system and his emphasis on the literary register of Southern Min were dropped by later writers. Following on from Medhurst's work, Samuel Wells Williams became the chief proponent of major changes in the orthography devised by Morrison and adapted by Medhurst. Through personal communication and letters and articles printed in \"The Chinese Repository\" a consensus was arrived at for the new version of POJ, although Williams' suggestions were largely not followed.\n\nThe first major work to represent this new orthography was Elihu Doty's \"Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect\", published in 1853. The manual can therefore be regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's \"Manual\" survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.\n\nIn 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded, which included among its provisions the creation of treaty ports in which Christian missionaries would be free to preach. Xiamen (then known as Amoy) was one of these treaty ports, and British, Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants. These missionaries, housed in the cantonment of Gulangyu, created reference works and religious tracts, including a bible translation. Naturally, they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen, which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien Sprachraum, most notably Taiwan. The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries, and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field, usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language.\n\nQuanzhou and Zhangzhou are two major varieties of Southern Min, and in Xiamen they combined to form something \"not Quan, not Zhang\" – i.e. not one or the other, but rather a fusion, which became known as \"Amoy Dialect\" or \"Amoy Chinese\". In Taiwan, with its mixture of migrants from both Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, the linguistic situation was similar; although the resulting blend in the southern city of Tainan differed from the Xiamen blend, it was close enough that the missionaries could ignore the differences and import their system wholesale.\n\nThe fact that religious tracts, dictionaries, and teaching guides already existed in the Xiamen tongue meant that the missionaries in Taiwan could begin proselytizing immediately, without the intervening time needed to write those materials.\n\nMissionary opinion was divided on whether POJ was desirable as an end in itself as a full-fledged orthography, or as a means to literacy in Chinese characters. William Campbell described POJ as a step on the road to reading and writing the characters, claiming that to promote it as an independent writing system would inflame nationalist passions in China, where characters were considered a sacred part of Chinese culture. Taking the other side, Thomas Barclay believed that literacy in POJ should be a goal rather than a waypoint:\nA great boon to the promotion of POJ in Taiwan came in 1880 when James Laidlaw Maxwell, a medical missionary based in Tainan, donated a small printing press to the local church, which Thomas Barclay learned how to operate in 1881 before founding the Presbyterian Church Press in 1884. Subsequently, the \"Taiwan Prefectural City Church News\", which first appeared in 1885 and was produced by Barclay's Presbyterian Church of Taiwan Press, became the first printed newspaper in Taiwan.\n\nAs other authors made their own alterations to the conventions laid down by Medhurst and Doty, \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" evolved and eventually settled into its current form. Ernest Tipson's 1934 pocket dictionary was the first reference work to reflect this modern spelling. Between Medhurst's dictionary of 1832 and the standardization of POJ in Tipson's time, there were a number of works published, which can be used to chart the change over time of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\":\nCompetition for POJ was introduced during the Japanese era in Taiwan (1895–1945) in the form of Taiwanese kana, a system designed as a teaching aid and pronunciation guide, rather than an independent orthography like POJ. From the 1930s onwards, with the increasing militarization of Japan and the movement encouraging Taiwanese people to \"Japanize\", there were a raft of measures taken against native languages, including Taiwanese. While these moves resulted in a suppression of POJ, they were \"a logical consequence of increasing the amount of education in Japanese, rather than an explicit attempt to ban a particular Taiwanese orthography in favor of Taiwanese kana\".\n\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War beginning in 1937 brought stricter measures into force, and along with the outlawing of romanized Taiwanese, various publications were prohibited and Confucian-style \"shobō\" () – private schools which taught Classical Chinese with literary Southern Min pronunciation – were closed down in 1939. The Japanese authorities came to perceive POJ as an obstacle to Japanization and also suspected that POJ was being used to hide \"concealed codes and secret revolutionary messages\". In the climate of the ongoing war the government banned the \"Taiwan Church News\" in 1942 as it was written in POJ.\n\nInitially the Kuomintang government in Taiwan had a liberal attitude towards \"local dialects\" (i.e. non-Mandarin varieties of Chinese). The National Languages Committee produced booklets outlining versions of Bopomofo for writing the Taiwanese tongue, these being intended for newly arrived government officials from outside Taiwan as well as local Taiwanese. The first government action against native languages came in 1953, when the use of Taiwanese or Japanese for instruction was forbidden. The next move to suppress the movement came in 1955, when the use of POJ for proselytizing was outlawed. At that point in time there were 115,000 people literate in POJ in Taiwan, Fujian, and southeast Asia.\n\nTwo years later, missionaries were banned from using romanized bibles, and the use of \"native languages\" (i.e. Taiwanese Hakka, Hakka, and the non-Sinitic Formosan languages) in church work became illegal. The ban on POJ bibles was overturned in 1959, but churches were \"encouraged\" to use character bibles instead. Government activities against POJ intensified in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when several publications were banned or seized in an effort to prevent the spread of the romanization. In 1964 use of Taiwanese in schools or official settings was forbidden, and transgression in schools punished with beatings, fines and humiliation. The \"Taiwan Church News\" (printed in POJ) was banned in 1969, and only allowed to return a year later when the publishers agreed to print it in Chinese characters.\n\nIn 1974, the Government Information Office banned \"A Dictionary of Southern Min\", with a government official saying: \"We have no objection to the dictionary being used by foreigners. They could use it in mimeographed form. But we don't want it published as a book and sold publicly because of the Romanization it contains. Chinese should not be learning Chinese through Romanization.\" Also in the 1970s, a POJ New Testament translation known as the \"Red Cover Bible\" (\"Âng-phoê Sèng-keng\") was confiscated and banned by the Nationalist regime. Official moves against native languages continued into the 1980s, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior decided in 1984 to forbid missionaries to use \"local dialects\" and romanizations in their work.\n\nWith the ending of martial law in 1987, the restrictions on \"local languages\" were quietly lifted, resulting in growing interest in Taiwanese writing during the 1990s. For the first time since the 1950s, Taiwanese language and literature was discussed and debated openly in newspapers and journals. There was also support from the then opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, for writing in the language. From a total of 26 documented orthographies for Taiwanese in 1987 (including defunct systems), there were a further 38 invented from 1987 to 1999, including 30 different romanizations, six adaptations of \"bopomofo\" and two hangul-like systems. Some commentators believe that the Kuomintang, while steering clear of outright banning of the native language movements after the end of martial law, took a \"divide and conquer\" approach by promoting Taiwanese Language Phonetic Alphabet (TLPA), an alternative to POJ, which was at the time the choice of the majority inside the nativization movement.\n\nNative language education has remained a fiercely debated topic in Taiwan into the 21st century and is the subject of much political wrangling.\n\nThe current system of \"pe̍h-ōe-jī\" has been stable since the 1930s, with a few minor exceptions (detailed below). There is a fair degree of similarity with the Vietnamese alphabet, including the distinction and the use of in Vietnamese compared with in POJ. POJ uses the following letters and combinations:\n\nChinese phonology traditionally divides syllables in Chinese into three parts; firstly the \"initial\", a consonant or consonant blend which appears at the beginning of the syllable, secondly the \"final\", consisting of a \"medial vowel\" (optional), a \"nucleus vowel\", and an optional \"ending\"; and finally the tone, which is applied to the whole syllable. In terms of the non-tonal (i.e. phonemic) features, the \"nucleus vowel\" is the only required part of a licit consonant in Chinese varieties. Unlike Mandarin but like other southern varieties of Chinese, Taiwanese has final stop consonants with no audible release, a feature that has been preserved from Middle Chinese. There is some debate as to whether these stops are a tonal feature or a phonemic one, with some authorities distinguishing between as a tonal feature, and , , and as phonemic features. Southern Min dialects also have an optional nasal property, which is written with a superscript and usually identified as being part of the vowel.\n\nA legitimate syllable in Hokkien takes the form codice_1, where items in parenthesis indicate optional components.\n\nThe initials are:\n\nVowels:\n\nCoda endings:\nPOJ has a limited amount of legitimate syllables, although sources disagree on some particular instances of these syllables. The following table contains all the licit spellings of POJ syllables, based on a number of sources:\n\nIn standard Amoy or Taiwanese Hokkien there are seven distinct tones, which by convention are numbered 1–8, with number 6 omitted (tone 6 used to be a distinct tone, but has long since merged with tone 2). Tones 1 and 4 are both represented without a diacritic, and can be distinguished from each other by the syllable ending, which is a vowel, , , or for tone 1, and , , , and for tone 4.\n\nSouthern Min dialects undergo considerable tone sandhi, i.e. changes to the tone depending on the position of the syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.\n\nThere is some debate as to the correct placement of tone marks in the case of diphthongs and triphthongs, particularly those which include and . Most modern writers follow six rules:\n\n\nA single hyphen is used to indicate a compound. What constitutes a compound is controversial, with some authors equating it to a \"word\" in English, and others not willing to limit it to the English concept of a word. Examples from POJ include \"forty\", \"circus\", and \"recover (from illness)\". The rule-based sandhi behaviour of tones in compounds has not yet been clearly defined by linguists. A double hyphen is used when POJ is deployed as an orthography (rather than as a transcription system) to indicate that the following syllable should be pronounced in the neutral tone. It also marks to the reader that the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi, as it would were the following syllable non-neutral. Morphemes following a double hyphen are often (but not always) grammatical function words.\n\nIn addition to the standard syllables detailed above, there are several regional variations of Hokkien which can be represented with non-standard or semi-standard spellings. In the Zhangzhou accent, spoken in Zhangzhou and parts of Taiwan, particularly the northeastern coast around Yilan City, the final is replaced with , for example in \"egg\" and \"cooked rice\" . The /ɛ/ vowel is written as or (with a dot above right, by analogy with ).\n\nDue to POJ's origins in the church, much of the material in the script is religious in nature, including several Bible translations, books of hymns, and guides to morality. The Tainan Church Press, established in 1884, has been printing POJ materials ever since, with periods of quiet when POJ was suppressed in the early 1940s and from around 1955 to 1987. In the period to 1955, over 2.3 million volumes of POJ books were printed, and one study in 2002 catalogued 840 different POJ texts in existence. Besides in the orthography, there are teaching materials, religious texts, and books about linguistics, medicine and geography.\n\nPOJ was initially not well supported by word-processing applications due to the special diacritics needed to write it. Support has now improved and there are now sufficient resources to both enter and display POJ correctly. Several input methods exist to enter Unicode-compliant POJ, including OpenVanilla (OS X and Microsoft Windows), the cross-platform Tai-lo Input Method released by the Taiwanese Ministry of Education, and the Firefox add-on Transliterator, which allows in-browser POJ input. When POJ was first used in word-processing applications it was not fully supported by the Unicode standard, thus necessitating work-arounds. One employed was encoding the necessary characters in the \"Private Use\" section of Unicode, but this required both the writer and the reader to have the correct custom font installed. Another solution was to replace troublesome characters with near equivalents, for example substituting for or using a standard followed by an interpunct to represent . With the introduction into Unicode 4.1.0 of the combining character codice_2 (U+0358) in 2004, all the necessary characters were present to write regular POJ without the need for workarounds. However, even after the addition of these characters, there are still relatively few fonts which are able to properly render the script, including the combining characters. Some of those which can are Charis SIL, DejaVu, Doulos SIL, Linux Libertine, and Taigi Unicode.\n\nOne of the most popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography called Hàn-lô (; literally \"Chinese-Roman\"), and sometimes \"Han-Romanization mixed script\", a style not unlike written Japanese or (historically) Korean. In fact, the term Hàn-lô does not describe one specific system, but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization. That romanization is usually POJ, although recently some texts have begun appearing with Taiwanese Romanization System (Tâi-lô) spellings too. The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes (estimated to be around 15 percent of running text) which are not definitively associated with a particular character. Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue, including creating new characters, allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings (but dissimilar etymology) to represent the missing characters, or using romanization for the \"missing 15%\". There are two rationales for using mixed orthography writing, with two different aims. The first is to allow native speakers (almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters) to make use of their knowledge of characters, while replacing the missing 15% with romanization. The second is to wean character literates off using them gradually, to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text.\nExamples of modern texts in Hàn-lô include religious, pedagogical, scholarly, and literary works, such as:\n\nPOJ has been adapted for several other varieties of Chinese, with varying degrees of success. For Hakka, missionaries and others have produced a Bible translation, hymn book, textbooks, and dictionaries. Materials produced in the orthography, called Pha̍k-fa-sṳ, include:\nA modified version of POJ has also been created for Teochew.\n\nMost native Southern Min speakers in Taiwan are unfamiliar with POJ or any other writing system, commonly asserting that \"Taiwanese has no writing\", or, if they are made aware of POJ, considering romanization as the \"low\" form of writing, in contrast with the \"high\" form (Chinese characters). For those who are introduced to POJ alongside Han-lo and completely Chinese character-based systems, a clear preference has been shown for all-character systems, with all-romanization systems at the bottom of the preference list, likely because of the preexisting familiarity of readers with Chinese characters.\n\nPOJ remains the Taiwanese orthography \"with the richest inventory of written work, including dictionaries, textbooks, literature [...] and other publications in many areas\". A 1999 estimate put the number of literate POJ users at around 100,000, and secular organizations have been formed to promote the use of romanization among Taiwanese speakers.\n\nOutside Taiwan, POJ is rarely used. For example, in Fujian, Xiamen University uses a romanization known as Bbánlám pìngyīm, based on Pinyin. In other areas where Hokkien is spoken, such as Singapore, the Speak Mandarin Campaign is underway to actively discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non-Mandarin varieties in favour of switching to Mandarin instead.\n\nIn 2006, Taiwan's Ministry of Education chose an official romanization for use in teaching Southern Min in the state school system. POJ was one of the candidate systems, along with Daighi tongiong pingim, but a compromise system, the Taiwanese Romanization System or \"Tâi-Lô\", was chosen in the end. Tâi-Lô retains most of the orthographic standards of POJ, including the tone marks, while changing the troublesome character for , swapping for , and replacing in diphthongs with . Supporters of Taiwanese writing are in general deeply suspicious of government involvement, given the history of official suppression of native languages, making it unclear whether Tâi-Lô or POJ will become the dominant system in the future.\n\nGeneral\n\nInput methods\n\nPOJ-compliant fonts\n\nTexts and dictionaries\n\n"}
{"id": "2847115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2847115", "title": "Playoff format", "text": "Playoff format\n\nThere are a number of formats used in various levels of competition in sports and games to determine an overall champion. Some of the most common are the \"single elimination\", the \"best-of-\" series, the \"total points series\" more commonly known as \"on aggregate\", and the \"round-robin tournament\".\n\nA Single elimination (\"knockout\") playoff pits the participants in one-game matches, with the loser being dropped from the competition. Single elimination tournaments are much more common in individual sports like tennis. In most tennis tournaments, the players are seeded against each other, and the winner of each match continues to the next round, all the way to the final.\n\nOf the big four American sports leagues, only the National Football League uses this system for all rounds of its postseason. This works for the NFL because its regular seasons are much shorter (16 games) than those in the other sports (from 82 to 162 games), and the difference in quality between teams is believed to be more quickly discernible. The rigors of individual games, held only once per week, also preclude the possibility of longer playoff series. Since the 1990 season six teams are seeded from each conference, with the top two getting a first-round \"bye\". The remaining teams pair off, with the higher-seeded team hosting. The winners of those games then play the higher-seeded teams that received byes in elimination playoffs, and then the winners of those matches face each in another in elimination playoffs to determine who will represent each conference in the Super Bowl. The winner of that game wins the championship.\n\nUntil the late 1960s, the only regular post-season fixtures in U.S. professional football were the league Championship Games. Divisional playoffs were only held in the event of a tie in the division standings. Divisional playoffs as a regularly scheduled event were not introduced in the NFL and rival American Football League until the seasons immediately preceding the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.\n\nLike the NFL, the Canadian Football League also uses one game playoffs, and has used them almost exclusively since the 1973 season. In the CFL, six teams qualify for the playoffs, divided into two divisional brackets of three teams each. The second place teams in each division host the Division Semi-Final, while the division winners each receive a bye to the Division Final. The Division Final winners play in the Grey Cup. Unlike the NFL, divisional playoffs have been a regular fixture in professional Canadian football since the 1930s. The main rationale for their introduction was that Canadian football clubs were (and, to a considerable extent, still are) more heavily dependent on a steady stream of gate receipts compared to their NFL counterparts, largely due to their playing in relatively small markets and smaller stadiums compared to NFL teams. A more inclusive playoff structure was therefore seen as necessary to ensure as many games as possible up to the end of the season were \"meaningful\" so as to encourage fans to attend games.\n\nThe only exception to a strict single-elimination format since the early 1970s was in 1986 when the league amended its playoff format to allow a fourth place team in one division to qualify in place of a third place team with a worse record. That year, when only two East Division teams qualified compared to four Western teams, the rules mandated the two Eastern teams play a two-game total points series over two weekends while the four Western teams played a single elimination playoff over the same time frame. The CFL eventually amended this format into the present \"crossover rule\" so as to allow a qualifying fourth place team to compete as the third place team in the other divisional bracket, thereby preserving the first place byes. Prior to 1973, the CFL used two game and three game playoffs in its divisional rounds, as discussed below.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Major League Baseball expanded its playoffs from 8 teams to 10, adding a second wild card in each league. The wild card teams now play a one-game playoff to determine which club advances to the best-of-five division series to meet the team with the best overall record in that particular league.\n\nIn both the men's and women's NCAA college basketball tournaments, 64 teams are seeded into four brackets of 16 teams each. (From 2011, the men's tournament will feature a \"First Four\", with the four lowest-ranked conference champions and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams playing single games to enter the 64-team draw.) The #1 team plays the #16 team in each bracket, the #2 plays the #15, and so on. Theoretically, if a higher-ranked team always beats a lower-ranked team, the second game will be arranged #1 vs. #8, #2 vs. #7, etc.; the third will be arranged #1 vs. #4, #2 vs. #3; the fourth will be arranged #1 vs. #2. If for instance #9 beats #8 in the first game, the #9 will simply take the theoretical spot of #8 and play #1. Winners advance through each round, changing cities after every two rounds. The Final Four teams, one from each bracket, play each other in the last weekend, with the winner of the final two being awarded the championship.\n\nNational association football competitions usually don't have playoffs, but when employed, use single-elimination formats to determine finalists and winners. The Major League Soccer playoffs use such a format; since 2012, the first round in each conference and the championship final, known as the MLS Cup, are conducted as single games, while the conference semifinals and conference finals are two-legged matches determined on total goals scored. Liga MX in Mexico, which splits its season into two phases, uses playoffs known as the \"Liguilla\" to determine the champions of each phase. Unlike the MLS system, all \"Liguilla\" matches are two-legged ties. Australia's A-League introduced a six-team knockout playoff, known locally as a \"finals series\", in the 2012–13 season. Unlike the MLS playoffs or Liga MX \"Liguilla\", the A-League finals series uses one-off matches throughout, culminating in the A-League Grand Final. This format is a departure from norms in football codes in Australia; previously, the A-League used a hybrid elimination system that allowed top teams in the regular season to lose one finals match but still win the tournament. The FIFA World Cup tournament also uses knockout rounds after a group stage of 32 teams divided into 8 groups of 4 determines who advances to them.\n\nSome knockout tournaments may also include a third place playoff, a single match to decide which competitor or team will be credited with finishing third and fourth place. The teams that compete in such third place games are usually the two losing semifinalists in a particular tournament. Although these semifinalists are still in effect \"eliminated\" from contending for the championship, they either may be competing for a bronze medal like some tournaments in the Olympic Games or basically just to salvage some pride in a consolation match, like in the FIFA World Cup or Rugby World Cup.\n\nWhen a playoff of this type involves the top four teams, it is sometimes known as the Shaughnessy playoff system, after Frank Shaughnessy, who first developed it for the International League of minor league baseball. Variations of the Shaughnessy system also exist, such as in the promotion playoffs held by League 1 of British rugby league. The League 1 playoff does not involve the top four teams; the team that tops the table after the Super 8s phase (which follows a single round-robin phase involving all league teams) is crowned champion and receives automatic promotion to the second-tier Championship, while the next four teams contest a knockout playoff for the second promotion place. A nearly identical format, with the only difference being that the knockout stage followed a full home-and-away league season, was used by the second level of France's rugby union system, Pro D2, through the 2016–17 season. Since then, Pro D2 uses a six-team playoff with the winner earning automatic promotion to the Top 14 and the runner-up entering a playoff with the 13th-place team in Top 14 for the final place in the next season's Top 14.\n\nAs it was used in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup knockout stage:\nThe \"stepladder\", named so as the bracket resembles a step ladder is a variation of the single-elimination tournament; instead of, in a 16-team tournament, the #1 seed facing the #16 seed in the first round, the bracket is constructed as to give the higher seeded teams byes, where the #1 seed has bye up to the third round, playing the winner of game between the #8 seed the #9 vs. #16 winner. This setup is seldom used best-of-\"x\" series as this may yield long waiting times for the teams afforded the bye, while the teams that played in the earlier rounds would be spent when they reach the latter rounds.\n\nThe Big East Men's Basketball Tournament used this format in a 16-team, 5-round format. The PBA Tour uses the 4-player, 3-round format (sometimes a 5-player, 4 round format). The University Athletic Association of the Philippines Basketball Championship uses this format (4-teams, 3-rounds) only if there's an undefeated team, otherwise it uses a single-elimination format.\n\nWhile Nippon Professional Baseball's Climax Series has been called a \"stepladder\" playoff with only three participating teams (2 rounds), it functions mostly as a single-elimination tournament with 3 teams, and is structurally the same with a 6-team, 3-round playoff. The KBO League's Korean Series, on the other hand, is considered a stepladder system - the teams that finish third and fourth place play a best-of-3 series (with the third place team automatically a 1-0 series lead), whose winner then plays the second-place team in a best-of-5, whose winner in turn plays the first-place team in a best-of-7 for the title.\n\nWNBA has their playoffs done this way: the 5-8 and 6-7 seeds play in the first round. The top two seeds get double byes and the next two seeds 1st-round byes. The first two rounds are single-elimination; all others are best-of-5.\n\nLeague of Legends competition often uses the stepladder system. The League of Legends Pro League uses a double stepladder for its playoffs, giving the first seeds of the Western and Eastern Conferences a bye to the semifinals, the second seeds a bye to the quarterfinals, and the third seeds a one-game advantage against the fourth seeds in the first round. The League of Legends Pro League, League of Legends Championship Series, and League of Legends Master Series also use a stepladder bracket (in this case referred to as \"The Gauntlet\") to determine each league's third representative at the League of Legends World Championship.\n\nAs it was used in the 2012 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament:\n\nA \"double elimination\" format is used in most NCAA and high school baseball and softball tournaments in the United States. Starting in 2010, the Little League World Series in baseball also adopted this format. Teams are eliminated from contention after incurring two losses in each round of play.\n\nThe format changes depending on the number of teams per bracket, but most major collegiate baseball conferences with the format send only the top eight teams, or a mix of top teams plus the winners of a single elimination qualifier tournament, to their conference tournament.\n\nThe NCAA baseball and softball tournaments have used the format since its inception for regional and College World Series play.\n\nIn the current NCAA tournament format for four teams, the #1 seed plays the #4 seed (\"Game 1\"), and the #2 seed plays the #3 seed (\"Game 2\") on the first day of regional tournaments, and the first and second days of the College World Series (where the second bracket games are known as \"Game 3\" and \"Game 4\", respectively).\n\nOn the second day or series (third and fourth days at the College World Series), the losers play in the morning to determine who is eliminated (\"Game 3\" in regional, \"Games 5\" and \"Game 7\" in College World Series play), and who advances to the third game of the day. The winners (\"Game 4\" in regional, \"Game 6\" and \"Game 8\" in College World Series) play to determine who advances to the final on the third day.\n\nIn NCAA regional games, the loser of this game plays the winner of the morning game that evening (\"Game 5\") to determine who plays in the final.\n\nIn College World Series play, because the bracket teams play on alternating days, these games (\"Game 9\" and \"Game 10\") are played on the fifth day.\n\nIn NCAA regional games, the third day will feature the regional championship (\"Game 6\"). If the winner of Game 4 defeats the winner of Game 5, the winner advances to the Super Regional. Until the 2005 tournament, if the winner of Game 5 defeats the winner of Game 4, the two teams would meet again in Game 7 thirty minutes later to determine which team advances to the Super Regional.\n\nHowever, with a concern that some teams were playing four games in two days, the NCAA made a rule change in 2005 to equalize the disadvantage of the winner of Game 5 by stating should the winner of Game 5 win Game 6, Game 7 would be played on a fourth day.\n\nIn the College World Series, on the sixth day, the winner of Game 9 plays the winner of Game 7 (\"Game 11\"), and the winner of Game 10 plays the winner of Game 8 (\"Game 12\"). If the winner in Game 7 wins Game 11, and/or the winner of Game 8 wins Game 12, such winners advance to the best-of-three final. If the winner of Game 9 defeats the winner of Game 7, and/or the winner of Game 10 defeats the winner of Game 8 the two teams would play again on the seventh day in Games 13 and 14, respectively, if they are needed, to determine who advances to the final.\n\nStarting with the 2010 edition, the Little League World Series adopted a new format that involves four double-elimination brackets. In 2010, the U.S. and International divisions were split into two four-team pools, with each pool conducting a double-elimination tournament to determine its winner. After the end of double-elimination play, the U.S. pool winners play one another in single games, as do the International pool winners, with the losers playing a third-place game and the winners playing a championship game. This was altered in 2011 so that all eight US team and all eight international teams played in one large bracket each, with each bracket's winner playing each other for the championship and each bracket's runner-up playing each other for third-place. In another new feature, all teams are guaranteed at least three games; the first team eliminated from each pool plays a \"crossover game\" that matches an eliminated U.S. team with an eliminated International team.\n\nMany esports, most notably Counter-Strike and StarCraft, use a double-elimination bracket to determine the top two teams in a four team group. In this usage, the format is referred to as \"GSL\", after the Global StarCraft II League. Dota 2 competitions often use a GSL or round robin group stage to seed teams into a double-elimination bracket. Super Smash Bros. tournaments, as well as other fighting game competitions, typically use an open double-elimination bracket with no preceding group stage or qualifiers.\n\nAs it was used in the Mideast regional of the 1975 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament:\nFor an example of the Little League variation, see 2010 Little League World Series.\n\nSome playoff systems combine the features of single- and double-elimination tournaments. In these systems, one or more higher-ranked teams have an opportunity to skip a round of the playoffs by winning their first match. Even if they lose that match, they can still advance to the championship final. Lower-ranked teams receive no such break.\n\nThese are variations of systems developed by Australian lawyer Ken McIntyre for the Victorian Football League (VFL), the historic predecessor to today's Australian Football League (AFL), starting in 1931.\n\nThis system, also bearing the name of its promoter Percy Page, is a four-team playoff first developed for Australian rules football. It has been used in many competitions in that sport and in rugby league, but is most prominent in softball and curling (which use the name \"Page playoff system\"). The Indian Premier League in Twenty20 cricket uses this system as well.\n\nIn this system, the first round (sometimes called the \"quarterfinals\") matches #1 against #2 and #3 against #4. The winner of the 1–2 match advances directly to the final. The next round, known as the semifinal, pits the loser of the 1–2 match against the winner of the 3–4 match.\n\nAs used in the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier, Canada's national men's curling championship:\n\nMcIntyre's first modification was an expansion to five teams. In this format, the first round matches #2 v #3 and #4 v #5, with the #1 seed receiving a bye into the second round. The 4–5 match is played to eliminate one team, while the 2–3 match is played to determine which match they will play in the second round.\n\nIn the second round, the loser of the 2–3 match plays the winner of the 4–5 match, while the winner of the 2–3 match plays the #1 seed. From this point forward, the tournament is identical to the Page playoff system.\n\nWhile no major league uses this system today, it has been used in the past by the VFL and several rugby league competitions, most notably the short-lived Super League of Australia and the present-day European Super League. Many lower-level leagues in both Australian rules and rugby league still use the system.\n\nAs used in the 2006 Bartercard Cup, the championship of New Zealand rugby league:\n\nMcIntyre next developed two slightly different systems for six-team playoffs. In each system, the #1 and #2 seeds played to determine the specific semifinal match in which they would compete, while the other four teams played knockout matches in the first week to eliminate two teams and determine the other two semifinal participants. The semifinal in which the winner of the 1–2 match competes directly determines one place in the championship final (often called a \"Grand Final\", especially in Australia). The other semifinal is an elimination match, with the winner advancing into a \"Preliminary Final\" to determine the other Grand Final place.\n\nThis system was further tweaked into the top-six system used by the Championship and League 1 of European rugby league until being abandoned from the 2015 season forward. A slightly modified version of this system was used in the A-League of Australian soccer starting in 2010 before a pure knockout format was adopted beginning in 2013.\n\nIn the modern top-six system, the first round consists of knockout matches involving #3 vs #6 and #4 vs #5, with the #1 and #2 teams receiving a bye into the next round. After those matches, the format is identical to the Page playoff system.\n\nThe A-League's former system had the top two teams participating in a two-legged match instead of the single-elimination matches that the other four teams faced. It did not affect the teams' eventual playoff paths.\n\nAs used in the 2010–11 A-League:\n\nMcIntyre's final development expanded the concept to an eight-team playoff. This expansion meant that no team received a \"second chance\" after the first week of the playoffs.\n\nThe original McIntyre Final Eight system is notable in that it uses the regular-season league table to eliminate two teams in the first week of the playoffs. The procedure is:\n\n\nThe fates of the teams in this round depend on whether they won or lost their Qualifying Final, and on their regular-season position. The four winners and the two losers that finished highest on the regular-season table advance to later rounds, with the two other losers eliminated.\n\n\nThe two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to Week 3.\n\n\nThe two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to the Grand Final.\n\n\nDue to perceived weaknesses of this system, the AFL adopted a modified top-eight playoff in 2000. The National Rugby League (NRL), Australia's top rugby league competition (also with a team in New Zealand), used this system from 1999 through 2011, after which it changed to the AFL system.\n\nThe current AFL finals system breaks up the eight participants into four groups of two teams, ranked by their league position after regular-season play. Each group receives an advantage over the teams directly below it on the league table. These advantages are the so-called \"double-chance\", where a loss in the first week will not eliminate a team from the finals, and home ground finals. Note, however, that \"home\" designations are often irrelevant if a finals match involves two teams from the same state. \nThe finals format operates as follows:\n\nThe top four teams play the two Qualifying Finals. The winners get a bye through to Week 3 of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week 2. The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week 2 away games and the losers' seasons are over.\n\n\n\n\nThe specific advantages gained by finishing in higher positions on the league table are as follows:\n\nFirst and second — These teams receive the double-chance, and play their first two finals matches at home—their Qualifying Final, and then either a Semi-final (should they lose the QF) or Preliminary Final (should they win the QF). They must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final.\n\nThird and fourth — Like the top two teams, they receive the double-chance, and must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final. However, they only get to play one finals match at home—a Semi-final if they lose their QF, or Preliminary Final if they win the QF.\n\nFifth and sixth — These teams do not receive a double-chance. They must win three matches to reach the Grand Final—an Elimination Final, Semi-final, and Preliminary Final. They do get to host their EF.\n\nSeventh and eighth — These teams receive neither a double-chance nor a home finals match, and must also win three finals matches to reach the Grand Final.\n\nThe National Rugby League and Victorian Football League operate the same finals system.\n\nFrom 2009 through to 2014, the Super League used a top-eight playoff system. The expansion to an eight-team bracket coincided with the league's expansion from 12 to 14 teams. Like the AFL system, the Super League system eliminated two teams in each week leading up to the Grand Final. However, it had a number of differences from the AFL system, most notably the feature known as \"Club Call\" (explained below).\n\nAs in the AFL, the participants were ranked by league position in the regular season. Unlike in the AFL, the team receiving home advantage in each match leading up to the Grand Final was guaranteed the right to host the match at a ground of its choosing, either its regular home stadium or (rarely) a larger nearby alternative.\n\nThe winners of these matches advanced directly to Week 3, in which they received home advantage. The higher-seeded winner received Club Call immediately after Week 2. The losers had another chance in Week 2, when they were at home to the winners of the Week 1 Elimination Play-Offs.\nThe winners of these matches advanced to Week 2, with the losers being eliminated.\n\nThe winners of these matches advanced to Week 3 and Club Call, with the losers being eliminated.\n\nClub Call, a unique feature of the Super League system, took place on the second weekend of the playoffs, shortly after the winners of the two PSFs were known. The highest-seeded winning club from Week 1 was required to choose which of the two PSF winners they would play in Week 3.\n\nThe winners advanced to the Grand Final the following week.\n\n\nSuper League XX in 2015 introduced a radical change to the league system, under which the 24 clubs in Super League and the second-tier Championship are split into three groups of eight after each club has played 22 matches. The top eight clubs in Super League at that point will enter a new play-off structure, beginning with a single round-robin mini-league followed by a Shaughnessy play-off involving the top four teams.\n\nThe \"best-of\" formats refers to a head-to-head competition where the two competitors compete to first win the majority of the games allotted to win the \"series\". If a competitor wins a majority of the games, the remaining games may be discarded. This is a modification of the single-elimination tournament to allow more matches to be held. Moreover, if it can be said that if one competitor has a higher probability of winning a single game (and game results are i.i.d.), the likelihood that this competitor wins the series increases when more games are played. For example, if team A has a seventy percent chance of defeating team B in a single game, its probability of winning a best-of-three series against B is 78.4 percent, and its probability of winning a best-of-seven series is about 87.4 percent.\n\nA best-of-three playoff is a head-to-head competition between two teams in which one team must win two games to win the series. Two is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played; if one team wins both of the first two games, the third game is not played.\n\nOften, when a best-of-series tied with each team having won an even number of games, the bracket is said to be a \"best-of-(number of games left).\" This is because for all practical purposes the teams are starting over. If a best-of-7 series is deadlocked at 2-2, the bracket is then referred to as a \"best-of-3\", since the reality is that the first team to win 2 games advances.\n\nIn tennis, matches are usually decided with a best-of-3-sets format. Some major tournaments are played in a best-of-5-sets format, most notably the Grand Slam men's singles and doubles. Also, the 35 and over Gentlemen's Invitation Doubles and the 35 and over Ladies' Invitation Doubles of the Wimbledon are both round-robin tournaments.\n\nThe first use of the best-of-three playoff was in Major League Baseball; the National League authorised such a playoff to be held if two teams ended the season in a tie for first place; the American League used a single game in this situation. Since both leagues have used only a one-game playoff for all playoff positions which are tied if only one team can advance to the playoffs. Since , a tie-breaker based on season performance can be used only to seed teams.\n\nBoth the NBA and NHL once used best-of-three playoffs (often referred to as \"mini-series\"), but today neither league does: Pro basketball first adopted the best-of-three playoff for first-round play starting with its inception as the Basketball Association of America in 1946 (changing its name to the NBA three years later) and retaining it through the 1959–60 season; the league resumed its use of the best-of-three first-round series in 1974–75, but abolished it again in 1983–84 when the number of teams qualifying for its postseason tournament was increased to 16 (ten teams had qualified during the first two years of the aforementioned period, this number being expanded to twelve in 1976–77; in both instances some of the highest-ranking teams did not participate in the best-of-three round, drawing byes and automatically advancing to the second round, which was best-of-seven, as were all subsequent rounds).\n\nIn ice hockey, the best-of-three format was one of two possible types of series that could be held to determine the winner of the Stanley Cup (the other being a two-legged playoff series), and it was used in lower rounds in the National Hockey League up until the Original Six era. The best-of-three series in the modern era was first used in the first-round of the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning with the 1974–75 season; at that time, the number of NHL playoff teams had been increased to twelve from the previous eight. The format which then took effect called for the first three finishers in each of the league's four divisions to enter the postseason, but the first-place teams drew byes and did not play any best-of-three series; the postseason then proceeded as the NBA's did, with the second and all later rounds being best-of-seven. This remained the case until the 1979–80 season, when the NHL expanded its playoff field to 16 after absorbing four teams from the defunct World Hockey Association in a semi-merger, whereupon the byes were abolished and all 16 qualifying teams participated in the first round, which was lengthened to best-of-five. In both the NBA and NHL, the team with the higher finish during the regular season played the first and (if necessary) the third games of the series at home, with the lower-ranked team hosting the second game.\n\nThe World Cup of Hockey, organized by the NHL, used a best-of-three format in the final round in 1996 and 2016, as did the Canada Cup. \n\nUntil 2009, the WNBA forced the team with the higher record to travel to the lower seed's home court for game 1, then played the final game(s) at home. Because of this perceived inequity, in 2010, the league switched to a more traditional 1-1-1 format, where the higher seed would play the first and (if needed) third games at home. Also, in 2005, the league switched the WNBA Finals to a best-of-five playoff format. By 2016 the league semifinals matched this format.\n\nNCAA Division I baseball uses the best-of-three format in the second round and the final round of its 64-team championship tournament. Starting in 1999, when the tournament expanded from 48 teams (eight regionals of six teams each) to 64 teams (sixteen regionals of four teams each), the NCAA introduced the \"super regional\", in which the 16 regional winners play in 8 best-of-three series, with the 8 series winners advancing to the College World Series. If a regional winner is also a national seed (top eight seeds of the 64 first-round teams), it is guaranteed to host the super regional; if no national seed makes a particular super regional, the NCAA puts hosting rights up for bidding between the competing schools. In 2003, the College World Series changed from a one-game final to a best-of-three series.\n\nFrom approximately the founding of the Western Interprovincial Football Union in 1936 until the early 1970s, multi-game playoffs series were a regular fixture of professional Canadian football playoffs. Over the years, both the WIFU (later the Western Football Conference) and the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (later the Eastern Football Conference) used a combination of best-of-three series, three game total points series and two game total points series to determine both conference final participants and conference champions. The Grey Cup itself has always consisted of a single game.\n\nThe last best-of-three playoff series in what by then had evolved into a Canadian Football League consisting of two autonomous conferences was the 1971 Western Conference Final. Since 1972, the West has used one game playoffs. The Eastern Conference (which by that time had abolished the best-of-three format in favour of two game total points series) adopted one game playoffs for the 1973 season.\n\nThe National Football League has always used one-game playoffs.\n\nThe Euroleague, the primary Europe-wide club competition in basketball, introduced a quarterfinal round for the 2004–05 season which originally employed a best-of-three format; starting with the 2008–09 season, the quarterfinal round became best-of-five. This is the only point in the Euroleague where a playoff series is used; all earlier rounds are conducted in a league format, and the quarterfinal winners advance to the Final Four, where all games are one-off knockout matches.\n\nIn the FIBA Oceania Championship, the best-of-three series is used if only both Australia and New Zealand play in the tournament. If a team wins the first two games, the last game may still be played. If other teams participate, a regular round-robin or multi-stage tournament is used. In 2009, a two-legged tie was used, but it was reverted to a best-of-3 series in 2011.\n\nThe best-of-3 playoff system was also used in the Brazilian Football League for the 1998 and 1999 seasons quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. The Brazilian model was unique in that extra time was not used (meaning matches could end in a draw) therefore, this system had a few modifications. If no team could win two games, the team with most victories would qualify. If the two teams had one victory, the team with the best goal difference would qualify. If the goal difference was the same, the team with the best regular season campaign would qualify. An interesting fact is that during the 1998 season, all the rounds were decided in three games.\n\nIn a modification of the best-of-3 format, the leagues in the Philippines awards a \"twice to beat advantage\" to the top seeds; in this case, the team with the twice to beat advantage needs to be beaten twice by its opponent, while it only has to win once, in a \"de facto\" 1–0 lead in a best-of-3 series. First applied in the semifinals of the scholastic UAAP Basketball Championship, it has been adopted by the other scholastic competitions. The professional Philippine Basketball Association has adopted the format in the early rounds of its playoffs.\n\nAn amendment to the rules in 2008 gave the undefeated team of the season in the UAAP (the team that won all elimination round games) a bye up to the finals possessing an automatic 1–0 lead in a best-of-5 series, or the \"thrice to beat advantage\". This has since been adopted by the NCAA in 2009 and abolished in 2016, when the undefeated team has a final berth, but played in a common best-of-three format\n\nA best-of-five playoff is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win three games to win the series. Three is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won three games before all five games have been played, all other games are omitted.\n\nAt present, only one American men's professional sports body - Major League Baseball - makes use of the best-of-five playoff, doing so in its second round, known as the Division Series. At one time, however, the League Championship Series was best-of-five, from its birth with both leagues' realignment into two divisions in , and continuing until this round was lengthened to best-of-seven in . (This change would have immediate ramifications: In the American League, in each of the first two years where the LCS used the best-of-seven format, the Kansas City Royals in 1985 and the Boston Red Sox in 1986 fell behind 3-1 - which previously would have eliminated them - before coming back to win the series.) When the wild card was first used in (it was created for the season, but that year's entire postseason was canceled due to a players' strike), the best-of-five format was authorized for the new Division Series, in which eight teams participated.\n\nDuring the time that the League Championship Series was best-of-five, a \"2-3\" format was used, with one team hosting the first two games, the other the last three (these respective roles alternating between the Eastern and Western Division champions regardless of which one finished with the better regular-season record). This procedure was repeated at first when the best-of-five Division Series was added in 1995 (except that two of each league's now three division winners hosted three games and the wild card could never do so), but starting in the home-field advantage was awarded to the two division winners in each league that had the best records; also in 1998, the \"2-2-1\" format was instituted, the team with the home-field advantage being given the first, second and fifth games at home instead of the third, fourth and fifth. For the 2012 postseason, the Division Series reverted to \"2-3\". With the addition of a second Wild Card team and subsequent Wild Card Game, a decision not made until well after the season schedule had been created, this was done to minimize the disruption of the schedule by giving the Division Series one off day instead of two. With the Wild Card playoff now established and schedules adjusted accordingly, the \"2-2-1\" format was restored since 2013.\n\nThe National Basketball Association and National Hockey League both formerly used best-of-five series, the NBA in its second round prior to the season, and in the first round from through , and again from until lengthening it to best-of-seven starting in , and the NHL for its first-round series beginning with the season and lasting until that league increased its first round to best-of-seven in . Unlike in baseball, in both NBA and NHL best-of-five series the higher regular-season finisher always hosted the first, second, and (if necessary) fifth games.\n\nAs of 2005, the Women's National Basketball Association now uses a best-of-five format for its championship series. The league semifinals matched this format starting in 2016.\n\nHistorically, most European domestic basketball leagues have used a best-of-five format in their championship series. The main long-standing exceptions are the Israeli and French leagues, which have historically used one-off finals; the Adriatic League (former Yugoslavia), which has changed from a one-off final to a best-of-three final back to a one-off final in recent years; and the Lithuanian, Polish and Turkish leagues, which use a best-of-seven format. Italy has gone to a best-of-seven final effective with its 2008–09 season. The Euroleague quarterfinal round expanded to best-of-five from best-of-three starting in the 2008-09 season. France changed its final from a one-off match to a best-of-5 series in 2012–13.\n\nThe Ashes, a cricket series played between Australia and England is a five-match series. All games are held, and the team with the most wins the trophy. If the series is tied, the team holding the trophy keeps until the next series. Most test cricket matches are played under this format; others extend up to seven matches. Test cricket is typically hosted by one team throughout the entire series. While series such as this have five matches, it's not exactly \"best-of-five\", as draws, and other results, are possible.\n\nA best-of-seven playoff is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win four games to win the series. Four is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won four games before all seven games have been played, all other games are omitted.\n\nIt is not necessary for the four games to be consecutively won. Draws are not permitted, even in sports where they usually would be - play continues until there is a clear winner (except in Japanese professional baseball, where a standard (12-inning) draw is permitted at the stepladder league playoff (higher seed wins if series tied after the five or seven game series ends), and a 12-inning draw is permitted in the Japan Series in all but the eighth game, played only if the series is tied, 3-3-1, after seven games). This ensures that a series will never require more than seven games to conclude. Before the advent of lighting in ballparks ballgames often ended tied because it was too dark to play, a much less common way of ending a ballgame is going past the curfews. Tied games can result in series lasting eight games, which has happened, as in the 1912 World Series and the 1986 Japan Series. This format is currently used in the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League for all their playoff series. Major League Baseball uses this format only for the League Championship Series since 1985 and the World Series from 1905 to 1918 and since 1922, using the \"2-3-2\" format, with two games at the home stadium of one team, the next three games (the fifth, if necessary) at the home stadium of the other team, and the final two games (if necessary) at the home stadium of the first. (The first round Wild Card Game is a single game; the second round Division Series use a five-game series format.)\n\nThe National Hockey League uses this format for its league championship Stanley Cup playoffs, but uses the \"2-2-1-1-1\" format, alternating the first two games at the home-ice team's home rink, the next two at the second team, and then alternating venues for the fifth, sixth and seventh games (if necessary).\n\nThe National Basketball Association has this format, too, with \"2-2-1-1-1\" for all playoff rounds, and also the Finals; originally the championship round was \"2-2-1-1-1\" as well (except 1971, 1975, 1978-1979), but was changed to \"2-3-2\" from 1985-2013 to cut down on travel expenses, as the league's \"East-West\" divisional alignment means the two teams are usually separated by great distances - indeed, the cities represented in the Finals' most frequent matchup, Los Angeles and Boston, are almost 3,000 miles apart.\n\nThe \"2-3-2\" format, the \"2-2-1-1-1\" format, and the \"1-1-1-1-1-1-1\" format are situated such that if a team \"sweeps\" the series (wins 4-0), it will win two games at home, and two games away. They are also set up such that the team with home advantage for the series plays at home for the first game and the seventh game if necessary. As previously stated, the \"2-3-2\" format reduces travel between the two venues, but it then gives the team \"without\" home advantage three consecutive home games. The \"1-1-1-1-1-1-1\" format is mainly used in the postseason tournaments of the Liiga in Finland and the Swedish Hockey League.\n\nThe AHL and the ECHL do not use a set playoff format for their league championship playoff tournaments due to scheduling conflicts. For example, in the 2016 Calder Cup playoffs, due to scheduling conflicts in both arenas, the Pacific Division finals between the Ontario Reign and the San Diego Gulls used the \"1-1-1-1-1-1-1\" playoff format, with Ontario hosting the first, third, fifth, and seventh game.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Chinese, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish and Turkish basketball leagues use a best-of-seven format in their championship series. The Turkish playoff has one unique feature. If one team in the championship series (or, for that matter, in \"any\" playoff series) defeated its final opponent in both of their regular-season games, the winning team is granted a 1-0 lead in the series, and the series starts with Game 2. The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), aside from using the best-of-7 series in its finals series, has also used it on most its semifinals since 2005.\n\nOccasionally, WWE uses this format in some of their matches, like the feud between Chris Benoit and Booker T in 2005, for the WWE United States Championship, or Cesaro's rivalry against Sheamus, with their first match at August pay-per-view Summerslam 2016.\n\nA best-of-nine playoff pits two teams head-to-head which must win five games to win the series. Five is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played. Whoever has won five games before all nine games have been played, all other games are omitted.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, the World Series was conducted as a best-of-nine playoff in its first year of existence in 1903, then again for three years beginning in 1919, the year of the \"Black Sox scandal.\"\n\nThe Western Hockey League used the best-of-nine playoff series for the Western Division playoffs from the 1983-84 season through the 1990-91 season because of the unequal division alignment of the league at this time. The Eastern division had eight teams: six of which qualified for the playoffs. The Western division only had six teams: four of which made the playoffs. Because of this, Eastern division had 3 rounds of playoffs (two teams receive a first round bye), while the Western division only had two rounds of playoffs. The east played a best-of-five, best-of-seven, best-of-seven format for the three rounds while both rounds in the Western division playoffs were best-of-nine. This was used so that both divisions would finish their playoffs at approximately the same time. The WHL Championship Series was a best-of-seven. These best-of-nine series went the full nine games on two occasions, with Portland defeating New Westminster in 1984 and Spokane in 1986.\n\nThe Quebec Major Junior Hockey League used the best-of-nine playoff series for the 1986 playoffs.\n\nIn snooker, a player must win a certain number of frames to win a match, often nine (best-of-17) or more. Again, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted. The world championship final is currently decided in a best-of-35 match.\n\nIn 9-ball, a player must win a certain number of racks to win a match. In the WPA World Nine-ball Championship, nine racks are needed to win in the early stages, ten to eleven in the latter stages, and 17 in the final. As with snooker, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted.\n\nVarious playoff formats, including two-legged ties and total points series pair off participants in a number of games (often two), with the winner being determined by aggregate score: the winner being the one who scores the most points/goals etc. over the series of games. Two-legged ties are common in association football, and were used in NHL playoff series until 1937. It currently used in North America in the MLS Cup Playoffs. \n\nIn 2004, NASCAR adopted a total points playoff of a different stripe, creating a \"Chase for the Cup\" that allowed a golf-style cut of the high ten or 400 points of the leader, whichever is greater, to compete for the championship in the last ten races. The Chase format has changed several times since its creation:\n\nRegardless of the exact format, the driver in the Chase group with the most points after the final ten races wins the Monster Energy Cup.\n\nIn November 2005, the PGA Tour announced that a similar total points playoff would be used to lead up to the PGA Championship, starting in 2007. The player with the most points at the end of the year would take home the FedEx Cup.\n\nPrior to the 1986 Playoffs, the Canadian Hockey League (especially the Ontario Hockey League) used the point series, to determine, which team would advance. In those situation, where the higher seeded host in odd number of game (game #1, 3, 5, 7), while the other team host the even number (game #2, 4, 6, 8). There would be no overtime, except for the deciding game, because a tie in the last game, of the series would not declare a series winner, so should that happens, there would be a sudden-death overtime, with the winner getting 2 points, and the losing team get nothing.\n\nThe game shows \"Jeopardy!\", \"Wheel of Fortune\", and \"The Challengers\" have used two-game series in the final rounds of most of the tournaments that they held during their history. Each game is played separately (i.e., money from day one cannot be wagered on day two), and the money is added together to determine the winner. The only exception to this was in the \"Jeopardy!\" Ultimate Tournament of Champions, when the two semifinal matches were both two-game series, and the final was a three-game series. If any ties remain, sudden death was played to determine the champion.\n\nAs it was used in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League knockout stage:\n\"Bayern Munich 4–4 Real Madrid on aggregate. Bayern Munich won on away goals (BM 2–1 RM).\"\n\nIn a round-robin tournament, all playoff contenders play each other an equal number of times, usually once or twice (often called a \"double round-robin\"). This is a common format for association football. In the FIFA World Cup, teams are organized into eight pools of four teams, playing each other once and ranked by points earned through wins (3 points) and draws (1 point). The top two teams advance out of each pool to the knockout phase where the top team from each pool face a second-placed team from a different pool.\n\nContinental club football tournaments have included round robin formats, such as the Copa Libertadores from the 1966 season, UEFA Champions League from the 1992/93 season, UEFA Cup from 2004/05, and the Asian and African Champions Leagues. Teams are seeded such that strongest teams should not meet until the end. In the UEFA Champions League, 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four. The group winners and runners-up advance to a two-game, total goals round, the eight third-placed teams move into the UEFA Cup third round, and the eight fourth-placed teams are eliminated.\n\nIn basketball, the Olympics also uses a round robin of the same nature, going to single elimination after the first round. The Euroleague has two double round-robin phases. The first is a \"Regular Season\" in which the 24 teams are divided into four groups of six (as of the 2008-09 season). The four top teams in each group advance to a \"Top 16\" phase in which the teams are divided into four groups of four each. The top two teams from each Top 16 group are then paired in four best-of-five quarterfinal series, with the winners advancing to the single-elimination Final Four.\n\nRound-robin tournaments are also used in rugby union, curling, and many amateur or lower-division basketball, football, and hockey tournaments.\n\nIn 1992, the Little League World Series in youth baseball went to a round-robin tournament in the first round instead of single-elimination. In 2001, the tournament expanded to 16 teams and stayed with a round-robin for the first round, but cross-bracketed single elimination for the second round before the two winners of those games advanced to the region final. Little League used this format through 2009.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, the term \"round robin\" was used with regard to the possibility of a 3-way tie for the National League pennant in 1964. The Philadelphia Phillies had had a 6½ game lead with 12 games left in their regular schedule, but then lost 10 games in a row, so that the season went into its last day with 3 teams still having a chance for the NL pennant. As it turns out, the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the New York Mets on that day to take the NL pennant with no playoff; the reverse of that outcome would have left the Cardinals, the Phillies, and the Cincinnati Reds in a 3-way tie.\n\nAs it was used in the \"Super Six\" round of the 1999 Cricket World Cup:\n\nTeams in shaded in blue advance to the knockout stage.\n\nAs discussed above, leagues also offer innovations in order to give advantage to teams that performed better in the regular season, such as reseeding and home advantage.\n\nIn tournaments where participants are seeded, in order to ensure that the strongest remaining team faces the weakest team, the participants are \"reseeded\" at each round; the tournament bracket is not fixed, where potential matchups can be readily determined up to the final. For example, in a regular 8-team bracket, the teams that will meet at the second round will be the winner of the #1 vs. #8 going up against the winner of #4 and #5, and the winner of #2 and #7 going up against the winner of #3 and #6. If the #5 and the #7 teams won in the first round, the second round matchups will be #1 vs. #7 and #3 vs. #5, instead of #1 vs. #5 and #3 vs. #7.\n\nThe only notable tournaments that employ this rule are the NFL Playoffs, WNBA Playoffs and the MLS Cup Playoffs. The Stanley Cup Playoffs had used that rule from 1994-2013. Note that reseeding does not come into play if there are only 2 rounds of competition.\n\nAs it was used in the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs (scores in the bracket shown indicate the number of games won in each seven-game series):\nIn team sports, the \"hometown advantage\" refers to the phenomenon when certain teams (usually the higher-seeded teams) are afforded more games that can be played at their home arena/stadium than their opponent's. This is predominant in the best-of series where there are more games played in a team's arena/stadium than the other, and in single-elimination tournaments where the single game is disputed in a team's stadium. In a best-of series, a team can \"lose\" their home advantage if the visiting team wins the first game. Home advantage can be regained or lost in the course of the series.\n\nAs discussed above, a team can clinch the \"home advantage\" in a variety of ways:\n\nIn best-of series, the order of arenas/stadiums in which the games are played at also affects the home advantage. In the NBA and the NHL, all rounds are done in a 2-2-1-1-1 format, that is, the team with home advantage plays games 1-2, 5 and 7 (latter two games if needed). This ensures that the team with home advantage never trails assuming every game is won by the home team. From 1985 to 2013 the NBA Finals had utilised the 2-3-2 format (the team with the home court advantage plays games 1-2 and 6-7 in their home court), which can theoretically allow the team with the home court advantage to trail in the series (although that will require the team with the home court advantage to lose the middle three games, which has only happened thrice).\n\nIn NHL's Stanley Cup Finals, NBA Finals, and MLB's World Series, the teams with the higher regular season record receives the home advantage. The NFL's Super Bowl is held at a predetermined site regardless of which teams reach the game, which usually means there is no home advantage but it is still possible for the host city's team to play in the Super Bowl. Until 2016, In MLB's World Series, the team that came from the league that won the All-Star Game is awarded with the home field advantage.\n\nIn two-legged ties such as the UEFA Champions League, although it is said that the two teams play an equal number of games in their home stadium, the team playing the second game in their home stadium has a distinct advantage, such as the resolution of ties will be at their stadium.\n\nIn games done on neutral venues, a team may still be afforded the privileges of the \"home team\" such as selecting which side to play first or choosing the side of the coin in coin flips. In most instances, this privilege is determined either by a drawing of lots (UEFA Champions League) or by rotation among the groupings of the different teams (NFL).\n\nIn the Nippon Professional Baseball's postseason games (excluding Japan Series) since 2004, the team having a better position in regular position will be hosting all the games. In addition, since 2008, the League Champion will have a 1-win advantage in the 2nd stage of Climax Series (best-of-7 which actually played for 6 games).\n\n"}
{"id": "3600412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3600412", "title": "Political lesbianism", "text": "Political lesbianism\n\nPolitical lesbianism is a phenomenon within feminism, primarily second-wave feminism and radical feminism; it includes, but is not limited to, lesbian separatism. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a political and feminist choice, and advocates lesbianism as a positive alternative to heterosexuality for women as part of the struggle against sexism.\n\nPolitical lesbianism originated in the late 1960s among second wave radical feminists as a way to fight sexism and compulsory heterosexuality. Sheila Jeffreys helped to develop the concept when she co-wrote in 1981 \"Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism\" with the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group. They argued that women should abandon support of heterosexuality and stop sleeping with men, while encouraging women to rid men \"from your beds and your heads\". While the main idea of political lesbianism is to be separate from men, this does not necessarily mean that political lesbians \"have\" to sleep with women; some choose to be celibate or identify as asexual. The Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group definition of a political lesbian is \"a woman identified woman who does not fuck men\". They proclaimed men the enemy and women who were in relationships with them collaborators and complicit in their own oppression. Heterosexual behavior is seen as the basic unit of the patriarchy's political structure, lesbians who reject heterosexual behavior therefore disrupt the established political system.\n\nTi-Grace Atkinson, a radical feminist who helped to found the group The Feminists, is credited with the phrase that came to embody the movement: 'Feminism is the theory; lesbianism is the practice.'\n\nNew wave feminism provided a platform for some women to come out of a perceived suffocating shell of heterosexual norms, traditional sexuality, marriage and family life, a life viewed by some feminists as one of hard labor with little consideration and a system that subordinates women. By coming out of dominating heterosexual relationships, women are given an opportunity to declare themselves as lesbians with shared interests. As a result, feminism would be able to provide an environment in which lesbianism was less about personal pain or anguish but an important political issue.\n\nIn a broad sense, political lesbianism entails the political identification of women with women, it encompasses a role beyond sexuality but supports eschewing forming relationships with men. It is partly based on the idea that women sharing and promoting a common interest creates a positive and needed energy which is necessary to enhance and elevate the role of women in the society, a development which will be curtailed by the institutions of heterosexuality and sexism if women choose the traditional norms.\n\nThough there was some discrimination against lesbians within the feminist movement, it ended up providing a needed political platform for them. In its wake, it also expanded and introduced divergent views of sexuality.\n\nSeparatist feminism is a form of radical feminism that holds that opposition to patriarchy is best done through focusing exclusively on women and girls. Some separatist feminists do not believe that men can make positive contributions to the feminist movement and that even well-intentioned men replicate the dynamics of patriarchy.\n\nCharlotte Bunch, an early member of The Furies Collective, viewed separatist feminism as a strategy, a \"first step\" period, or temporary withdrawal from mainstream activism to accomplish specific goals or enhance personal growth. \"The Furies\" recommended that Lesbian Separatists relate \"only (with) women who cut their ties to male privilege\" and suggest that \"as long as women still benefit from heterosexuality, receive its privileges and security, they will at some point have to betray their sisters, especially Lesbian sisters who do not receive those benefits\".\n\nSome feminist theory on sexuality evaded biological fixation and embraced social construction as the basis of sexuality. However, this idea posed further questions on the subject of sexuality and lesbianism. If sexuality could be a construction of human nature then little room is given to understanding the nature of the historical formation of human nature, especially, if the historical nature of man or woman enhanced heterosexuality. A lack of theoretical clarity of lesbianism and sexuality becomes more profound as sexuality is viewed as much more than choice. Also, if lesbianism becomes a social institution, the avenue for a dominant persona in the relationships may also pose challenge to the original intention of political lesbianism.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "994997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=994997", "title": "Reforms of French orthography", "text": "Reforms of French orthography\n\nThe orthography of French was already more or less fixed and, from a phonological point of view, outdated when its lexicography developed in the late 17th century and the Académie française was mandated to establish an \"official\" prescriptive norm.\n\nStill, there was already much debate at the time opposing the tenets of a traditional, etymological orthography, and those of a reformed, phonological transcription of the language.\n\nCésar-Pierre Richelet chose the latter option when he published the first monolingual French dictionary in 1680, but the chose to adhere firmly to the tradition, \"that distinguishes men of letters from ignoramuses and simple women\", in the first edition of its dictionary (1694).\n\nSpelling and punctuation before the 16th century was highly erratic, but the introduction of printing in 1470 provoked the need for uniformity.\n\nSeveral Renaissance humanists (working with publishers) proposed reforms in French orthography, the most famous being Jacques Peletier du Mans who developed a phonemic-based spelling system and introduced new typographic signs (1550). Peletier continued to use his system in all his published works, but his reform was not followed.\n\nThe third (1740) and fourth (1762) editions of the Académie dictionary were very progressive ones, changing the spelling of about half the words altogether.\n\nAccents, which had been in common use by printers for a long time, were finally adopted by the Académie, and many mute consonants were dropped.\n\nMany changes suggested in the fourth edition were later abandoned along with thousands of neologisms added to it.\n\nVery importantly too, subsequent 18th century editions of the dictionary added the letters \"J\" and \"V\" to the French alphabet in replacement of consonant \"I\" and \"U,\" fixing many cases of homography.\n\nMany changes were introduced in the sixth edition of the Académie dictionary (1835), mainly under the influence of Voltaire. Most importantly, all \"oi\" digraphs that represented were changed to \"ai,\" thus changing the whole imperfect conjugation of all verbs. The borrowing of \"connoisseur\" into English predates this change; the modern French spelling is \"\".\n\nThe spelling of some plural words whose singular form ended in \"D\" and \"T\" was modified to reinsert this mute consonant, so as to bring the plural in morphological alignment with the singular. Only \", \" retained the old form, because it was perceived that the singular and the plural had different meanings. The Académie had already tried to introduce a similar reform in 1694, but had given up with their dictionary's second edition.\n\nWith important dictionaries published at the turn of the 20th century, such as those of Émile Littré, Pierre Larousse, Arsène Darmesteter, and later Paul Robert, the Académie gradually lost much of its prestige.\n\nHence, new reforms suggested in 1901, 1935, and 1975 were almost totally ignored, except for the replacement of apostrophes with hyphens in some cases of (potential) elision in 1935.\n\nSince the 1970s, though, calls for the modernisation of French orthography have grown stronger. In 1989, French prime minister Michel Rocard appointed the Superior Council of the French language to simplify the orthography by regularising it.\n\nThe Council, with the help of some Académie members and observers from Francophone states, published reforms that it called \"\" on 6 December 1990.\n\nThose \"rectifications\", instead of changing individual spellings, published general rules or lists of modified words. In total, around 2000 words have seen their spelling changed, and French morphology was also affected.\n\nNumerals are joined with hyphens:\n\nElements of compound nouns are fused together:\n\nLoan compounds are also fused together:\n\nCompound nouns joined with hyphens (or fused) make their plural using normal rules, that is adding a final \"s\" or \"x\", unless the modifier is an adjective (in which case both elements must agree), or the head is a determined noun, or a proper noun:\n\nLoanwords also have a regular plural:\n\nThe \" (known as a diaeresis in English) indicating exceptionally that the \"u\" is not silent in \" + vowel\" combinations is to be placed on the \"u\" instead of on the following vowel. Also, trémas are added to such words where they were not previously used:\n\nA is also added to a \"u\" following an \"\" added to soften a \"g\", to prevent the \"eu\" combination being read as :\n\nVerbs with their infinitive in \"éCer\" (where C can be any consonant) change their \"é\" to \"è\" in the future and conditional:\n\nAdditionally, verbs ending in \"e\" placed before an inverted subject \"je\" change their \"e\" to \"è\" instead of \"é\":\n\nCircumflex accents are removed on \"i\" and \"u\" if they are not needed to distinguish between homographs. They are retained in the simple past and subjunctive of verbs:\n\nWherever accents are missing or wrong because of past errors or omissions or a change of pronunciation, they are added or changed:\n\nAccents are also added to loanwords where dictated by French pronunciation:\n\nIn verbs with an infinitive in ' or ', the opening of the schwa could previously be noted either by changing the \"e\" to \"è\" or by doubling the following \"l\" or \"t\", depending on the verb in question. With this reform, only the first rule shall be used except in the cases of ', ', and their derivatives (which continue to use \"ll\" and \"tt\" respectively).\n\nThis applies also when those verbs are nominalized using the suffix \":\n\nNotwithstanding the normal rules (see French verbs), the past participle \" followed by an infinitive never agrees with the object:\n\nThis is an alleged simplification of the rules governing the agreement as applied to a past participle followed by an infinitive. The participle \"\" already followed an identical rule.\n\nMany phenomena were considered as \"anomalies\" and thus \"corrected\". Some \"families\" of words from the same root showing inconsistent spellings were uniformized on the model of the most usual word in the \"family\".\n\nThis rule was also extended to suffixes in two cases, actually changing them into totally different morphemes altogether:\n\nIsolated words were adjusted to follow older reform where they had been omitted:\n\nLastly, some words have simply seen their spelling simplified, or fixed when it was uncertain:\n\nThese \"rectifications\" were supposed to be applied beginning in 1991 but, following a period of agitation and the publication of many books such as the Union of copy editors' attacking new rules one by one, André Goosse's defending them, or Josette Rey-Debove's accepting a few (that have been added, as alternative spellings, to Le Robert), they appeared to have become, for a while, dead proposals.\n\nIn 2004, an international institutional effort to revive the 1990 spelling reforms arose. Notably, a French-Belgian-Swiss association was set up to promote reform. In July of the same year, Microsoft announced that the French version of their applications would soon comply with the new spelling rules. On 23 March 2005, a version of Encarta was published using the new spelling, and, on 14 April 2005, an update of Microsoft Office was offered.\n\nOfficially, French people, including public workers, are free for an undetermined length of time to continue using the old spelling. The new spelling is \"recommended\", but both old and new are considered correct.\n\nIn Quebec, the , which was reluctant at first to apply what it prefers to call the \"modernisation\", because of the opposition it received in France, announced that it was now applying its rules to new borrowings and neologisms.\n\nMore and more publications are modernizing spelling. Le Forum, from the Université de Montréal, and Les Éditions Perce-Neige have adopted the new spelling.\n\nIn 2009, several major Belgian publishing groups began applying the new spelling in their online publications.\n\nThe 2009 edition of the incorporates most of the changes. There are 6000 words that have both the traditional and alternative spellings. The 2011 edition of the Dictionnaire Larousse incorporates all of the changes.\n\nOn February 3, 2016, a report by French television channel TF1 that the reforms would be applied from the next school year caused wide outrage.\n\nCurrently, there is a movement driven by the linguist Mickael Korvin who battles to radically simplify French, first by eliminating accents, punctuation and capital letters, then attacking the French literary establishment, and in 2016 inventing a new way to spell French called nouvofrancet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "358808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358808", "title": "Taa language", "text": "Taa language\n\nTaa , also known as ǃXóõ (ǃKhong, ǃXoon – , ), is a Tuu language notable for its large number of phonemes, perhaps the largest in the world. Most speakers live in Botswana, but a few hundred live in Namibia. The people call themselves ǃXoon (pl. ǃXooŋake) or ʼNǀohan (pl. Nǀumde), depending on the dialect they speak. The Tuu languages are one of the three traditional language families that make up the Khoisan languages.\n\n\"Taa\" is the word for 'human being'; the local name of the language is \"Taa ǂaan\", from \"ǂaan\" 'language'. \"ǃXoon\" (ǃXóõ) is an ethnonym used at opposite ends of the Taa-speaking area, but not by Taa speakers in between. Most living Taa speakers are ethnic ǃXoon (plural \"ǃXooŋake\") or 'Nǀohan (plural \"Nǀumde\").\n\nTaa shares a number of characteristic features with West ǂ’Amkoe and Gǀui, which together are considered part of the Kalahari Basin sprachbund.\n\nUntil the rediscovery of a few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s, Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family.\n\nThere is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as a dialect continuum than as a single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups, suggesting a historical spread from west to east:\n\n\nTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon, and the DoBeS project is working with ’Nǀohan (in East Taa) and West ǃXoon.\n\nǀ’Auni and Kiǀhazi, previously considered dialects of Taa, were more divergent than the dialects here, and are now classified as a distinct language, Lower Nossob.\n\nThe various dialects and social groups of the Taa, their many names, the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature, and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified, has resulted in a great deal of confusion. Traill (1974), for example, spent two chapters of his \"Compleat Guide to the Koon\" [sic] disentangling names and dialects.\n\nThe name \"ǃXoon\" (more precisely \"ǃXóõ)\" is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia, around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked, and at Dzutshwa (Botswana). It is, however, used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled \"ǃxō, ǃkɔ̃ː, ǃko/ǃkõ, Khong,\" and the fully anglicized \"Koon\".\n\nBleek's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled \"ǀNuǁen, ǀNuǁe:n, Ngǀuǁen, Nguen, Nǀhuǁéi, ŋǀuǁẽin, ŋǀuǁẽi, ŋǀuǁen, ǀuǁen.\" It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term \"Nǀusan (Nǀu-san, Nǀūsā, Nǀuusaa, Nǀhusi),\" sometimes rendered \"Nusan\" or \"Noosan\", which has been used for other languages in the area. A subgroup was known as \"Koon\" . This dialect is apparently extinct.\n\nBleek recorded another now-extinct variety at the town of Khakhea, and it is known in the literature as \"Kakia\". Names with a tee: \"Katia, Kattea, Khatia,\" and \"Xatia,\" are apparently spelling variants of \"Kakia\", though this is not certain. \"Vaalpens\", \"ǀKusi\", and \"ǀEikusi\" evidently refer to the same variety as Xatia.\n\nWestphal studied a variety rendered \"ǀŋamani, ǀnamani, Ngǀamani, ǀŋamasa\". This dialect is apparently also now extinct.\n\nWestphal also studied ǂHuan (ǂhũa) dialect (or \"ǂHũa-ʘwani\"), and used this name for the entire language. However, the term is ambiguous between Taa (Western ǂHũa) and ǂ’Amkoe (Eastern ǂHũa), and for this reason Traill chose to call the language \"ǃXóõ\".\n\nTsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan, and like \"ǂHuan,\" the name is used ambiguously for a dialect of ǂ’Amkoe. This is a Tswana name, variously rendered \"Tshasi, Tshase, Tʃase, Tsase,\" \"Sasi\", and \"Sase\".\n\nThe Tswana term for Bushmen, \"Masarwa\", is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are \"Magon (Magong)\" and the \"Tshasi\" mentioned above.\n\nThe Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples, they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in (plain people, river people, etc.), and also by direction. Traill reports the following:\n\nHeinz reports that \"\" is an exonym given by other Bushmen, and that the Taa call themselves \".\"\n\nThe Taa refer to their language as ' \"people's language\". Westphal (1971) adopted the word ' \"person\" as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family, which is now called \"Tuu\". The East ǃXoon term for the language is \"ǃxóɲa ǂâā\" .\n\nTaa has at least 58 consonants, 31 vowels, and four tones (Traill 1985, 1994 on East ǃXoon), or at least 87 consonants, 20 vowels, and two tones (DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon), by many counts the most of any known language. These include 20 (Traill) or 43 (DoBeS) click consonants and several vowel phonations, though opinions vary as to which of the 130 (Traill) or 164 (DoBeS) consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters.\n\nTraill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect: high , mid , low , and mid-falling . Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high, mid-mid, mid-mid-falling, and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes, high and low, for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic, Traill's four tones are mapped onto [áá], [àá], [àà], and [áà]. Unlike Traill, Naumann does not find a four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern !Xoõ data. \n\nIn addition to lexical tone, Traill describes East !Xoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs: either level (Tone Class I) or falling (Tone Class II). Transitive object nouns from Tone Class I trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs, while Tone Class 2 objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern 'N|ohan dialect.\n\nTaa has five vowel qualities, . The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels; it is not clear if this reflects a dialectal difference or a difference of analysis.\n\nTraill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain , murmured , or glottalized . may also be both glottalized and murmured , as well as pharyngealized / or strident /. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized , for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length.\n\nMurmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants, and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants, so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation.\n\nVowels may be long or short, but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation, are .\n\nAll plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized, but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of a sequence (\"long vowel\" or \"diphthong\"). These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is, the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally , and this in turn may be phonemically , since does not occur word-finally. However, this cannot explain the short nasal vowels, so Taa has at least 31 vowels.\n\nA long, glottalized, murmured, nasalized \"o\" with falling tone is written . A long, strident nasalized \"o\" with low tone is written , since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. (Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations.)\n\nDoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain, \"a e i o u;\" nasalized, \"an en in on un;\" epiglottalized or pharyngealized, \"aq eq iq oq uq;\" strident, \"aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh;\" and glottalized or 'tense', \"aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ.\"\n\nTaa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been called \"prevoiced\", but they actually appear to be consonant clusters. When homorganic, as in [dt], such clusters are listed in the chart below.\n\nTaa consonants are complex, and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis.\n\nMarginal or rare consonants are in parentheses. Asterisks mark consonants added in 1994, which are likely also marginal or rare. A parenthetical alternative is the analysis of Miller (2011).\n\nThe nasal only occurs between vowels, and only word finally (and then only in some dialects), so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position.\n\nThe mixed-voice consonants have long been puzzling. Miller-Ockhuizen (2003) analyzes them as breathy voiced, attributing the medial voicelessness to a larger glottal opening gesture than is found in Hindustani breathy-voiced consonants. The same four-way contrast in phonation is found in the pulmonic contour clicks. Taa is typologically unusual regardless in having mixed-voice ejectives. However, Juǀʼhoansi, which is part of the same \"Sprachbund\" as Taa, truly does have mixed voicing in .\n\nOf the velar and uvular series, Miller (2011) only reports ; the others in the table are marked (?). There are additional consonant clusters, though these can also be analyzed as uvularized consonants: .\n\nTaa may have as few as 83 click sounds, if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants, it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However, there is some debate whether these are actually clusters; all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like \"r, l, w, j\" (as in English \"tree, sleep, quick, cue\"), and this does not occur in Taa.\n\nThere are five click types: bilabial, dental, lateral, alveolar, and palatal. There are seventeen series, differing in phonation, manner, and complexity (what were traditionally considered uvular clicks, but that are now analyzed either as clusters or as airstream contours). These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa, and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position.\n\nThe DoBeS project takes Traill's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis, voiced, nasal, and voiceless nasal clicks are basic, with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with and either or . Recent work on Taa's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have a uvular or rear articulation, and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced' consonants of Taa, including prevoiced clicks, can also be analysed as contour consonants, in this case with voicing contours.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>There is a misalignment in the source tables: DoBeS has 17 series, Miller (2011) 19, with the additional distinctions apparently being vs. and vs. .\n\nAll nasal clicks have twin airstreams, since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However, the series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic \"ingressive\" nasal airflow. Ladefoged & Maddieson (1996:268) state that \"This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world's languages that, even in the middle of a sentence, it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow.\" Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated clicks (Miller 2011).\n\nWest ǃXoon has 164 consonants in a strict unit analysis, including 111 clicks in 23 series, which under a cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants, including 43 clicks.\n\nThese are written in the practical orthography (Naumann 2008). Marginal consonants are not marked as such.\n\nVowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora (in CCVV etc. syllables), as it is a phonetic effect of clicks such as on the first mora. does not make the following vowel breathy, maintaining a contrast between and . Likewise, while does make the following vowel creaky, there is a delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization is less than that of with a phonemically creaky vowel.\n\nIn an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible, the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are (using the palatal clicks as examples) the pre-glottalized nasal clicks, \"ʼnǂ,\" which Traill had analyzed as , and the voiced aspirated clicks, \"gǂh,\" which Traill had analyzed as .\n\nThe expectation, from the morphology of ǃXoon, for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. (This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on.) Thus for Trail's \"ǂqh,\" the DoBeS team distinguishes two phonemes, \"ǂqh\" and \"ǂh,\" and for Traill's \"ǂʼ,\" they have \"ǂ\"\" and \"ǂʼ.\" It also led to the discovery of voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all, namely \"nǂ\", nǂhh, gǂʼ,\" and \"gǂqʼ.\"\n\nUnder the contour analysis of Miller (2009), the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters, apart from the last four rows (ǂ\", nǂ\", ǂhh, nǂhh), which are considered to be simple clicks.\n\nThe Taa syllable structure, as described by DoBeS, may be one of the following:\n\n\nwhere C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and N is a nasal stop. There is a very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second (C) position and only certain vowel sequences (VV and V…V) occur. The possible consonant clusters (CC) is covered above; C may be .\n\nTaa is a subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives, adjectives, relative clauses, and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns, transitive verbs (with the object), adjectives, prepositions, and some particles.\n\nThe phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill:\n\n"}
{"id": "38592442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38592442", "title": "Textual criticism of the New Testament", "text": "Textual criticism of the New Testament\n\nTextual criticism of the New Testament is the analysis of the manuscripts of the New Testament, whose goals include identification of transcription errors, analysis of versions, and attempts to reconstruct the original.\n\nThe New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800 Greek manuscripts, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including Syriac, Slavic, Ethiopic and Armenian. There are approximately 300,000 textual variants among the manuscripts, most of them being the changes of word order and other comparative trivialities.\n\nThe sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, chiefly in that it makes stemmatics in many cases impossible, because many copyists used two or more different manuscripts as sources. Consequently, New Testament textual critics have adopted eclecticism after sorting the witnesses into three major groups, called text types (also styled hyphenated: text-types). The most common division today is as follows:\n\nThe New Testament portion of the English translation known as the King James Version was based on the Textus Receptus, a Greek text prepared by Erasmus based on a few late medieval Greek manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type (1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 7, 817). For some books of the Bible, Erasmus used just single manuscripts, and for small sections made his own translations into Greek from the Vulgate. However, following Westcott and Hort, most modern New Testament textual critics have concluded that the Byzantine text-type was formalised at a later date than the Alexandrian and Western text-types. Among the other types, the Alexandrian text-type is viewed by some as more pure than the Western and Byzantine text-types, however, this view is held by the minority of scholars, and so one of the central tenets in the current practice of New Testament textual criticism is that one should follow the readings of the Alexandrian texts unless those of the other types are clearly superior. Most modern New Testament translations now use an Eclectic Greek text (UBS5 and NA 28) that is closest to the Alexandrian text-type. The \"United Bible Societies's Greek New Testament\" (UBS5) and Nestle Aland (NA 28) are accepted by most of the academic community as the best attempt at reconstructing the original texts of the Greek NT.\n\nA minority position represented by \"The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text\" edition by Zane C. Hodges and Arthur L. Farstad argues that the Byzantine text-type represents an earlier text-type than the surviving Alexandrian texts. This position is also held by Maurice A. Robinson and William G. Pierpont in their \"The New Testament in the Original Greek: Byzantine Textform\", and the King James Only Movement. The argument states that the far greater number of surviving late Byzantine manuscripts implies an equivalent preponderance of Byzantine texts amongst lost earlier manuscripts. Hence, a critical reconstruction of the predominant text of the Byzantine tradition would have a superior claim to being closest to the autographs.\n\nAnother position is that of the Neo-Byzantine School. The Neo-Byzantines (or new Byzantines) of the 16th and 17th centuries first formally compiled the New Testament Received Text under such textual analysts as Erasmus, Stephanus (Robert Estienne), Beza, and Elzevir. The early 21st century saw the rise of the first textual analyst of this school in over three centuries with Gavin McGrath (b. 1960). A religiously conservative Protestant from Australia, his Neo-Byzantine School principles maintain that the representative or majority Byzantine text, such as compiled by Hodges & Farstad (1985) or Robinson & Pierpont (2005), is to be upheld unless there is a \"clear and obvious\" textual problem with it. When this occurs, he adopts either a minority Byzantine reading, a reading from the ancient Vulgate, or a reading attested to in the writings of an ancient Church Father (in either Greek or Latin) by way of quotation. The Neo-Byzantine School considers that the doctrine of the Divine Preservation of Scripture means that God preserved the Byzantine Greek manuscripts, Latin manuscripts, and Greek and Latin church writers' citations of Scripture over time and through time. These are regarded as \"a closed class of sources\" i.e., non-Byzantine Greek manuscripts such as the Alexandrian texts, or manuscripts in other languages such as Armenian, Syriac, or Ethiopian, are regarded as \"outside the closed class of sources\" providentially protected over time, and so not used to compose the New Testament text.\nOther scholars have criticized the current categorization of manuscripts into text-types and prefer either to subdivide the manuscripts in other ways or to discard the text-type taxonomy.\n\nTextual criticism is also used by those who assert that the New Testament was written in Aramaic (see Aramaic primacy).\n\nIn attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as interpolations. In modern translations of the Bible such as the New International Version, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. Previously, translations of the New Testament such as the King James Version had mostly been based on Erasmus's redaction of the New Testament in Greek, the Textus Receptus from the 16th century based on later manuscripts.\n\nAccording to Bart D. Ehrman, \"These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries,\" he adds. And because the King James Bible is based on later manuscripts, such verses \"became part of the Bible tradition in English-speaking lands.\"\n\nMost modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate passages that have disputed source documents. Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail.\n\nThese possible later additions include the following:\n\n\nOpinions are divided on whether Jesus is referred to as \"unique [or only-begotten: Gk. \"monogenes\"] Son\" or \"unique [\"monogenes\"] God\", in \n\n. Gordon Fee regards the instruction for women to be silent in churches as a later, non-Pauline addition to the Letter, more in keeping with the viewpoint of the Pastoral Epistles (see 1 Tim 2.11–12; Titus 2.5) than of the certainly Pauline Epistles. A few manuscripts place these verses after 40\n\nVarious groups of highly conservative Christians believe that when Ps.12:6–7 speaks of the preservation of the words of God, that this nullifies the need for textual criticism, lower, and higher. Such people include Gail Riplinger, Peter Ruckman, and others. Many theological organisations, societies, newsletters, and churches also hold to this belief, including \"AV Publications\", Sword of The LORD Newsletter, The Antioch Bible Society and others. On the other hand, Reformation biblical scholars such as Martin Luther saw the academic analysis of biblical texts and their provenance as entirely in line with orthodox Christian faith.\n\n"}
{"id": "216226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216226", "title": "Vegetation", "text": "Vegetation\n\nVegetation is an assemblage of plant species and the ground cover they provide. It is a general term, without specific reference to particular taxa, life forms, structure, spatial extent, or any other specific botanical or geographic characteristics. It is broader than the term \"flora\" which refers to species composition. Perhaps the closest synonym is plant community, but \"vegetation\" can, and often does, refer to a wider range of spatial scales than that term does, including scales as large as the global. Primeval redwood forests, coastal mangrove stands, sphagnum bogs, desert soil crusts, roadside weed patches, wheat fields, cultivated gardens and lawns; all are encompassed by the term \"vegetation\".\n\nThe vegetation type is defined by characteristic dominant species, or a common aspect of the assemblage, such as an elevation range or environmental commonality. The contemporary use of \"vegetation\" approximates that of ecologist Frederic Clements' term earth cover, an expression still used by the Bureau of Land Management. Natural vegetation refers to plant life undisturbed by humans in its growth and which is controlled by the climatic conditions of that region.\n\nThe distinction between vegetation (the general appearance of a community) and flora (the taxonomic composition of a community) was first made by Jules Thurmann (1849). Prior to this, the two terms (vegetation and flora) were used indiscriminately, and still are in some contexts. Augustin de Candolle (1820) also made a similar distinction, but he used the terms \"station\" (habitat type) and \"habitation\" (botanical region). Later, the concept of vegetation would influence the usage of the term biome, with the inclusion of the animal element.\n\nOther concepts similar to vegetation are \"physiognomy of vegetation\" (Humboldt, 1805, 1807) and \"formation\" (Grisebach, 1838, derived from \"Vegetationsform\", Martius, 1824).\n\nDeparting from Linnean taxonomy, Humboldt established a new science, dividing plant geography between taxonomists who studied plants as taxa and geographers who studied plants as vegetation. The physiognomic approach in the study of vegetation is common among biogeographers working on vegetation on a world scale, or when there is a lack of taxonomic knowledge of some place (e.g., in the tropics, where biodiversity is commonly high).\n\nThe concept of \"vegetation type\" is more ambiguous. The definition of a specific vegetation type may include not only physiognomy, but also floristic and habitat aspects. Furthermore, the phytosociological approach in the study of vegetation relies upon a fundamental unit, the plant association, which is defined upon flora.\n\nAn influential, clear and simple classification scheme for types of vegetation was produced by Wagner & von Sydow (1888). Other important works with a physiognomic approach includes Grisebach (1872), Warming (1895, 1909), Schimper (1898), Tansley and Chipp (1926), Rübel (1930), Burtt Davy (1938), Beard (1944, 1955), André Aubréville (1956, 1957), Trochain (1955, 1957), Küchler (1967), Ellenberg and Mueller-Dombois (1967) (see vegetation classification).\n\nThere are many approaches for the classification of vegetation (physiognomy, flora, ecology, etc.). Much of the work on vegetation classification comes from European and North American ecologists, and they have fundamentally different approaches. In North America, vegetation types are based on a combination of the following criteria: climate pattern, plant habit, phenology and/or growth form, and dominant species. In the current US standard (adopted by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), and originally developed by UNESCO and The Nature Conservancy), the classification is hierarchical and incorporates the non-floristic criteria into the upper (most general) five levels and limited floristic criteria only into the lower (most specific) two levels. In Europe, classification often relies much more heavily, sometimes entirely, on floristic (species) composition alone, without explicit reference to climate, phenology or growth forms. It often emphasizes indicator or diagnostic species which may distinguish one classification from another.\n\nIn the FGDC standard, the hierarchy levels, from most general to most specific, are: \"system, class, subclass, group, formation, alliance, \"and\" association\". The lowest level, or association, is thus the most precisely defined, and incorporates the names of the dominant one to three (usually two) species of a type. An example of a vegetation type defined at the level of class might be \"\"Forest, canopy cover > 60%\"; at the level of a formation as \"Winter-rain, broad-leaved, evergreen, sclerophyllous, closed-canopy forest\"; at the level of alliance as \"Arbutus menziesii\" forest\"; and at the level of association as \"\"Arbutus menziesii-Lithocarpus densiflora\" forest\", referring to Pacific madrone-tanoak forests which occur in California and Oregon, USA. In practice, the levels of the alliance and/or association are the most often used, particularly in vegetation mapping, just as the Latin binomial is most often used in discussing particular species in taxonomy and in general communication.\n\nVictoria in Australia classifies its vegetation by ecological vegetation class.\n\nLike all the biological systems, plant communities are temporally and spatially dynamic; they change at all possible scales. Dynamism in vegetation is defined primarily as changes in species composition and/or vegetation structure.\n\nTemporally, a large number of processes or events can cause change, but for sake of simplicity they can be categorized roughly as either abrupt or gradual. Abrupt changes are generally referred to as disturbances; these include things like wildfires, high winds, landslides, floods, avalanches and the like. Their causes are usually external (exogenous) to the community—they are natural processes occurring (mostly) independently of the natural processes of the community (such as germination, growth, death, etc.). Such events can change vegetation structure and composition very quickly and for long time periods, and they can do so over large areas. Very few ecosystems are without some type of disturbance as a regular and recurring part of the long term system dynamic. Fire and wind disturbances are particularly common throughout many vegetation types worldwide. Fire is particularly potent because of its ability to destroy not only living plants, but also the seeds, spores, and living meristems representing the potential next generation, and because of fire's impact on fauna populations, soil characteristics and other ecosystem elements and processes (for further discussion of this topic see fire ecology).\n\nTemporal change at a slower pace is ubiquitous; it comprises the field of ecological succession. Succession is the relatively gradual change in structure and taxonomic composition that arises as the vegetation itself modifies various environmental variables over time, including light, water and nutrient levels. These modifications change the suite of species most adapted to grow, survive and reproduce in an area, causing floristic changes. These floristic changes contribute to structural changes that are inherent in plant growth even in the absence of species changes (especially where plants have a large maximum size, i.e. trees), causing slow and broadly predictable changes in the vegetation. Succession can be interrupted at any time by disturbance, setting the system either back to a previous state, or off on another trajectory altogether. Because of this, successional processes may or may not lead to some static, final state. Moreover, accurately predicting the characteristics of such a state, even if it does arise, is not always possible. In short, vegetative communities are subject to many variables that together set limits on the predictability of future conditions.\n\nAs a general rule, the larger an area under consideration, the more likely the vegetation will be heterogeneous across it. Two main factors are at work. First, the temporal dynamics of disturbance and succession are increasingly unlikely to be in synchrony across any area as the size of that area increases. That is, different areas will be at different developmental stages due to different local histories, particularly their times since last major disturbance. This fact interacts with inherent environmental variability (e.g. in soils, climate, topography, etc.), which is also a function of area. Environmental variability constrains the suite of species that can occupy a given area, and the two factors together interact to create a mosaic of vegetation conditions across the landscape. Only in agricultural or horticultural systems does vegetation ever approach perfect uniformity. In natural systems, there is always heterogeneity, although its scale and intensity will vary widely.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
