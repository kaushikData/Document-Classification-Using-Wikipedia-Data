Also called a lightwell, it often provides access to the house for tradesmen and deliveries to vaults under the pavement; it stores coal and ash.\n\nThe term is most commonly applied to urban houses of the Georgian period in the UK, where it was normal for the service rooms, such as the kitchen, scullery and laundry, to be in the basement. Areas were commonly enclosed for safety reasons by wrought iron or cast iron railings, which became one of the principal decorative features of the astylar terraced houses of this period. Areas are also found in the English and French country house, where basements were popular in the 18th century as a way of accommodating service functions while allowing all four faces of a symmetrical Classical building to relate directly to its landscape setting, as at Mereworth Castle in Kent or The Abbey, Skirwith in Cumberland. Basements, and consequently areas, decreased in popularity in the 19th century, as attitudes to servants changed, although they continued to be constructed as service accommodation in urban settings where land was at a premium until the early 20th century. A suburban residential application can be seen at the Gamble House in Pasadena, California, to light the laundry and service areas of the expansive basement.\n\nIn early 18th-century house descriptions, the area was usually called the \"airy\", which suggests that its primary function was ventilation, needed to prevent cooking smells from percolating upstairs to the rooms above. This implies that the term \"area\" was a corruption of \"airey\" rather than vice versa.\n\nIn North London, it was known colloquially as \"the airey\". It is a subject of an old-time children's ball-bouncing rhyme, which begins: \n\"One, two, three, alairy <br>\nMy ball is down the airey <br>\nDon't forget to give it to Mary<br>\nEarly in the morning\".\n\n\n"}

It is a member of the Surmic cluster and is also known as Suri, evoking an ethnonym that embraces the Tirma, Chai (or T'id), and Baale communities. There are currently 9,000 native speakers of Baleesi, 5,000 in South Sudan and in Ethiopia; almost all of these are monolingual.\n\nBaleesi can be alternately referred to as Baalesi, Baale, Bale, Baaye, Dok, Kacipo-Balesi, Kachepo, Silmamo, Tsilmano, Zelmamu, Zilmamu and Zulmamu.\n\nThere are no known dialects of Baleesi, but it is closely related to the Didinga-Murle cluster, which consists of Didinga, Tennet, and Larim in Sudan, and Murle in both Sudan and Ethiopia. It shares 40%-54% lexical similarity with Murle and 35% lexical similarity with Mursi.\n\nIt is spoken in Rumeat, Upper Boma, and Mewun villages, Pibor County, Boma State, located near the Ethiopian border. It is also spoken in the northwestern corner of East Equatoria State.\n\nThe Baleesi counting system is based on twenty and uses the same quinary system as does the Didinga-Murle cluster. The word for \"1,000\" literally means \"plenty,\" and everything greater than 100 is referred to as \"a lot.\"\n\nWhile the Tirma, Chai, and Baale people form an ethnic unit called Suri, sharing similar age-set systems, common ceremonies, and material cultures, their languages are only distantly related.\n\nThere is no known writing system for Baleesi and it is regarded as an unwritten language. The language status is classified as vigorous, meaning that it is unstandardized and in use by all ages. However, it may still be considered an endangered language due to the relatively small population of native speakers in existence.\n\nThe Baale have a positive attitude towards their language, and use it in most areas of life besides the market. Some Baale people can speak Tirma or Chai along with Baleesi, and a few also speak Dizi or Amharic. \n\nSpeakers of Baleesi include non-native individuals as well. In Jeba town, there are Dizi people who speak Baleesi as a second language, and often serve as intermediaries between local or regional traders and the Baale people when they come to the market. \n\nThe literacy rate of both first-language and second-language speakers is below 1%.\n\nThe Baale share many aspects of culture with their fellow Suri people. For example, a practice common among the tribes of the Surma (including the Baale), is the insertion of a clay plate into the bottom lip of young girls and women.\nAnother ritual the Suri take part in is called the Donga, which involves champions of teams from different clans and villages fighting in pairs using long wooden sticks. The ritual is used as a way to resolve conflicts on either an individual or higher level.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8953822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8953822", "title": "Contrastive rhetoric", "text": "Contrastive rhetoric\n\nContrastive rhetoric is the study of how a person's first language and his or her culture influence writing in a second language or how a common language is used among different cultures. The term was first coined by the American applied linguist Robert Kaplan in 1966 to denote eclecticism and subsequent growth of collective knowledge in certain languages. It was widely expanded from 1996 to today by Finnish-born, US-based applied linguist Ulla Connor, among others. Since its inception the area of study has had a significant impact on the exploration of intercultural discourse structures that extend beyond the target language's native forms of discourse organization. The field brought attention to cultural and associated linguistic habits in expression of English language. This acceptance of dialect geography was especially welcomed in the United States on ESL instruction, as an emphasis on particular style in spoken-language and writing skills was previously dominated in both English as a second language (ESL) and English as a foreign language (EFL) classes.\n\nSince 1966, when Kaplan’s original work on contrastive rhetoric appeared, and 1996, when Ulla Connor’s book on contrastive rhetoric reinvigorated interest in the area, new trends have appeared in research approaches and methods. The change has been affected by three major developments—the acknowledgment of more genres with specific textual requirements, increased awareness of the social contexts of writing, and the need for an alternative conceptual framework that takes a more critical perspective of contrastive rhetoric—have motivated scholars of contrastive rhetoric to adjust and supplement research approaches in their work.\n\nFirst, there was a marked increase in the types of written texts considered the purview of second language writing around the world. English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes teach other types of writing besides the student essay required in college classes. Other important genres are the academic research article, research report, and grant proposal. Writing for professional purposes, such as business, is also now considered a legitimate type of second language writing and worthy of research and teaching.\nSecond, in addition to the expansion of the genre, textual analysis has moved contrastive rhetoric to emphasize the social situation of writing. Today, writing is increasingly regarded as being socially situated; each situation may entail special consideration to audience, purposes, level of perfection, and correspondingly may require varying amounts of revision, collaboration, and attention to detail. The expectations and norms of discourse communities or communities of practice (cultural and disciplinary) may shape these situational expectations and practices. This is where contrastive rhetoric overlaps with social constructionism, which sees approaches to textual meaning as dynamic, socio-cognitive activities. Instead of analyzing what texts \"mean,\" the interest is to understand how they construct meaning. Bazerman and Prior (2004, p. 6) pose three questions to guide the analysis of writing:\n\n\nThird, in response to criticisms that challenge traditional contrastive rhetoric, an alternative conceptual framework known as \"critical contrastive rhetoric\" has been established that maintains a critical understanding of the politics of cultural difference. Critical contrastive rhetoric explores issues such as critical thinking in teaching situations that challenge essentialism. It takes into consideration poststructuralist, postcolonial, and postmodern critiques of language and culture, in order to reconceptualize cultural difference in rhetoric. In practice, it \"affirms multiplicity of languages, rhetorical forms, and students’ identities, while problematizing the discursive construction of rhetoric and identities, and thus allowing writing teachers to recognize the complex web of rhetoric, culture, power, and discourse in responding to student writing.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, some postmodern and critical pedagogy writers in the second language writing field, began referring to contrastive rhetoric as if it had been frozen in space. Over the years, the term contrastive rhetoric had started to gain a negative connotation, even negatively affecting writing in a second language. Understood by many as Kaplan’s original work, contrastive rhetoric was increasingly characterized as static, and linked to contrastive analysis, a movement associated with structural linguistics and behavioralism. Many of the contributions made to contrastive rhetoric from the late 1960s to the early 1990s have been ignored. In a 2002 article, Connor attempted to address these criticisms and to offer new directions for a viable contrastive rhetoric. In addressing the critiques, she aimed to draw attention to the broad scope of contrastive rhetoric and determined that a new term would better encompass the essence of contrastive rhetoric in its current state. To distinguish between the often-quoted “static” model and the new advances that have been made, Connor suggests it may be useful to begin using the term intercultural rhetoric instead of contrastive rhetoric to refer to the current models of cross-cultural research.\n\nAccording to Connor, the term \"intercultural rhetoric\" better describes the broadening trends of expression across languages and cultures. It preserves the traditional approaches that use textual analysis, genre analysis, and corpus analysis, yet also introduces ethnographic approaches that examine language in interactions. Furthermore, it connotes the analysis of texts that allows for dynamic definitions of culture and the inclusion of smaller cultures (e.g., disciplinary, classroom) in the analysis.\n\nWhile Connor continues to use the term \"intercultural rhetoric\", scholars outside the United States looking at specific language differences (e.g. English and Japanese and English and Spanish) consider this to be a loaded label and continue to use the term \"contrastive rhetoric\" for the distinctiveness the theory shows and for the freedom of using tools to assess and understand the field in a non-restrictive manner.\n\n"}

Larsson was one of the foremost experts in Sweden on anti-democratic, extreme right-wing, and neo-Nazi movements. Gabrielsson says she and Larsson never married because he had believed his anti-fascist work could have put her at risk if there was a paper trail linking them legally or financially. Because they were never married and Larsson died without leaving a will, his estate went to his father and brother, in accordance with Swedish law. Larsson was somewhat estranged from his father Erland and his brother Joakim because nine years of his childhood were spent happily living with his grandparents in the northern country of Sweden. “It is as if my identity has been erased. It’s like being dispossessed,” Gabrielsson said to a reporter in 2010.\n\nSince shortly after his death, Gabrielsson has been negotiating with Joakim and Erland Larsson over control of Larsson's work. At one point, Larsson's father and brother offered Gabrielsson roughly $3.3 million, but she continues to fight for the literary rights of Larsson's work. One source interviewed a friend who said that Gabrielsson \"will not be bought\".\n\nGabrielsson's memoir, \"\"There Are Things I Want You to Know\" About Stieg Larsson and Me\", chronicles their life together and puts Larsson's often chaotic life into context. Gabrielsson, in one interview, explains that she did not start the memoir with the intention of writing a book; rather, it all stemmed from diary entries that Gabrielsson was writing in order to deal with the grief of losing her partner. The title of her book comes from a love letter that Larsson wrote to Gabrielsson when he thought he might die during a trip to Africa in 1977. The letter is included in the memoir along with the details of Larsson's trip to Africa.\n\nHer partner, she says, was a feminist, a hopeless businessman, a journalist who could not hold down a staff job, and a passionate fighter and investigator for social causes and against the Far Right. The memoir also details how the couple met and their struggles together at \"Expo\", the anti-fascist publication Larsson founded in 1995. According to Gabrielsson, Larsson had written 200 pages of a fourth novel in his internationally successful \"Millennium\" series before he died; she has been seeking the legal authority to be in charge of what will happen to these 200 pages, as well as to exercise control over all Larsson's literary work, although so far Larsson's family has refused to give her such rights. If granted the literary rights of the series, however, Gabrielsson explains that she is not sure that it is fair for a ghostwriter to complete the work that Larsson had started.\n\nAs a writer, in addition to working with Stieg Larsson on his literary projects, she is the coauthor of several books, including a monograph on the subject of cohabitation in Sweden, a Swedish government study on how to create more sustainable housing, and a forthcoming study on the Swedish urban planner Per Olof Hallman. She has also translated Philip K. Dick's \"The Man in the High Castle\" into Swedish. As an activist, she works to end violence against women.\n\nPeople who knew Stieg Larsson, such as his friend Kurdo Baksi and Anders Hellberg, a colleague of Larsson's in the 1970s and 1980s, were surprised that he wrote the Millennium novels. Hellberg went so far as to suspect that Larsson is not the sole author of the series, reasoning that Larsson was simply not a good enough writer. Gabrielsson has been named as the most likely candidate, due to her chosen wording during at least one interview that seemed to imply co-authorship, although she later claimed she had been misquoted. In 2011 Gabrielsson expressed anger at such accusations and clarified \"The actual writing, the craftsmanship, was Stieg's. But the content is a different matter. There are a lot of my thoughts, ideas and work in there.\" As an example she said he used her unfinished book about architect Per Olof Hallman to research locations for the Millennium series and that the two of them physically checked places together and discussed where the characters would live.\n\nHer architectural practice is currently involved in housing and office construction and heading a European Union initiative to create sustainable architecture in the Dalecarlia region.\n\n"}

The barrels can be created in many different sizes and designs; some have finger grips of rubber or plastic. The size of the nib or pen tip ranges from to .\n\nCompared to other inks, gel ink has higher viscosity, which supports a higher proportion of pigments in the medium.

The pigments are opaque, and gel pens are available in several bright and pastel colours, as well as opalescent, metallic, and glittery colours which show up clearly on dark paper. Many gel inks are water resistant, and are not washed away by water once the ink has dried.

Developed jointly by the Georgetown University and IBM, the experiment involved completely automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English.\n\nConceived and performed primarily in order to attract governmental and public interest and funding by showing the possibilities of machine translation, it was by no means a fully featured system: It had only six grammar rules and 250 lexical items in its vocabulary (of stems and endings). This complete dictionary was never fully shown (only the extended one from Garvin's article). Apart from general topics, the system was specialised in the domain of organic chemistry. The translation was carried out using an IBM 701 mainframe computer (launched in April 1953). Sentences had to be punched onto cards.\n\nThe Georgetown-IBM experiment is the best-known result of the MIT conference in June 1952 to which all active researchers in the machine translation field were invited. At the conference, Duncan Harkin from US Department of Defense suggested that his department would finance a new machine translation project. Jerome Weisner supported the idea and offered finance from the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT. Leon Dostert had been invited to the project for his previous experience with the automatic correction of translations (back then 'mechanical translation'); his interpretation system had a strong impact on the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. The linguistics part of the demonstration was carried out for the most part by linguist Paul Garvin who had also good knowledge of Russian.\n\nOver 60 Romanized Russian statements from a wide range of political, legal, mathematical, and scientific topics were entered into the machine by a computer operator who knew no Russian, and the resulting English translations appeared on a printer.\n\nThe sentences to be translated were carefully selected. Many operations for the demonstration were fitted to specific words and sentences. In addition, there was no relational or sentence analysis which could recognize the sentence structure. The approach was mostly 'lexicographical' based on a dictionary where a specific word had a connection with specific rules and steps.\n\n\nWell publicized by journalists and perceived as a success, the experiment did encourage governments to invest in computational linguistics. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation could well be a solved problem. However, the real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that the ten years of long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding was reduced dramatically.\n\nThe demonstration was given widespread coverage in the foreign press, but only a small fraction of journalists drew attention to previous machine translation attempts.\n\n"}

Examples of frequently encountered grammatical categories include tense (which may take values such as present, past, etc.), number (with values such as singular, plural, and sometimes dual, trial and paucal) and gender (with values such as masculine, feminine and neuter).\n\nAlthough terminology is not always consistent, a distinction should be made between these grammatical categories (tense, number, etc.) and lexical categories, which are closely synonymous with the traditional \"parts of speech\" (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), or more generally syntactic categories. Grammatical categories are also referred to as (grammatical) features.\n\nThe name given to a grammatical category (as an uncountable noun) is generally also used (as a countable noun) to denote any of the possible values for that category. For example, the values available in a given language for the category \"tense\" are called \"tenses\", the values available for the category \"gender\" are called \"genders\", and so on.\n\nA phonological manifestation of a category value (for example, a word ending that marks plurality on a noun) is sometimes called an exponent.\n\nA given constituent of an expression can normally take only one value from a particular category. For example, a noun or noun phrase cannot be both singular and plural, since these are both values of the category of number. It can, however, be both plural and feminine, since these represent different categories (number and gender).\n\nCategories may be described and named with regard to the type of meanings that they are used to express. For example, the category of tense is considered to serve to express time of occurrence (as in past, present or future). However, purely grammatical features do not always correspond simply or consistently to elements of meaning, and different authors may take significantly different approaches in their terminology and analysis. For example, the meanings associated with the categories of tense, aspect and mood are often bound in up verb conjugation patterns that do not have separate grammatical elements corresponding to each of the three categories; see Tense–aspect–mood.\n\nCategories may be marked on words by means of inflection. In English, for example, the number of a noun is usually marked by leaving the noun uninflected if it is singular, and by adding the suffix \"-s\" if it is plural (although some nouns have irregular plural forms). On other occasions, a category may not be marked overtly on the item to which it pertains, being manifested only through other grammatical features of the sentence, often by way of grammatical agreement.\n\nFor example:\n<poem>The bird can sing.\nThe birds can sing.</poem>\nIn the above sentences, the number of the noun is marked by the absence or presence of the ending \"-s\".\n<poem>The sheep is running.\nThe sheep are running.</poem>\nIn the above, the number of the noun is not marked on the noun itself (\"sheep\" does not inflect according to the regular pattern), but it is reflected in agreement between the noun and verb: singular number triggers \"is\", and plural number \"are\".\n<poem>The bird is singing.\nThe birds are singing.</poem>\nIn this case the number is marked overtly on the noun, and is also reflected by verb agreement.\n\nHowever:\nThe sheep can run.\nIn this case the number of the noun (or of the verb) is not manifested at all in the surface form of the sentence, and thus ambiguity is introduced (at least, when the sentence is viewed in isolation).\n\nExponents of grammatical categories often appear in the same position or \"slot\" in the word (such as prefix, suffix or enclitic). An example of this is the Latin cases, which are all suffixal: \"rosa, rosae, rosae, rosam, rosā\" (\"rose\", in the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and ablative).\n\nCategories can also pertain to sentence constituents that are larger than a single word (phrases, or sometimes clauses). A phrase often inherits category values from its head word; for example, in the above sentences, the noun phrase \"the birds\" inherits plural number from the noun \"birds\". In other cases such values are associated with the way in which the phrase is constructed; for example, in the coordinated noun phrase \"Tom and Mary\", the phrase has plural number (it would take a plural verb), even though both the nouns from which it is built up are singular.\n\nIn traditional structural grammar, grammatical categories are semantic distinctions; this is reflected in a morphological or syntactic paradigm. But in generative grammar, which sees meaning as separate from grammar, they are categories that define the distribution of syntactic elements. For structuralists such as Roman Jakobson grammatical categories were lexemes that were based on binary oppositions of \"a single feature of meaning that is equally present in all contexts of use\". Another way to define a grammatical category is as a category that expresses meanings from a single conceptual domain, contrasts with other such categories, and is expressed through formally similar expressions. Another definition distinguishes grammatical categories from lexical categories, such that the elements in a grammatical category have a common grammatical meaning – that is, they are part of the language's grammatical structure.\n\n"}

While estimates vary slightly, the inscription is often dated to between 450 CE - 500 CE. The inscription was discovered in 1936 by Dr. M. H. Krishna, the Director of Archaeology of the (princely) State of Mysore (present-day Karnataka region of India), in Halmidi, a village in the Hassan district.\n\nThe original inscription is kept in the Office of the Director of Archaeology and Museums, Govt. of Karnataka, Mysore, and a fibreglass replica has been installed in Halmidi.\n\nIn a report published in a Mysore Archaeological Department Report (MAR) in 1936, Krishna dated the inscription to 450 AD, on paleographical grounds. Later scholars have variously dated the inscription to 450 AD, 470 AD, 500 AD, \"about 500\", and \"end of the fifth century A. D. or the beginning of the 6th century A.D.\" Epigraphist, D. C. Sircar has dated the inscription to \"about the end of the 6th century.\"\n\nEpigraphist, K. V. Ramesh has written about the differing estimates:\n\nHe also hypothesized that, compared to possibly contemporaneous Sanksrit inscriptions, \"Halmidi inscription has letters which are unsettled and uncultivated, no doubt giving an impression, or rather an illusion, even to the trained eye, that it is, in date, later than the period to which it really belongs, namely the fifth century A.D.\"\n\nEpigraphist G. S. Gai however disagrees with the view that Halmidi is a record of the Kadamba dynasty identified with King Kadamba Kakusthavarman. According to , the inscription, which is dedicated to, \"Kadambapan Kakustha-Bhaṭṭōran,\" refers to another ruler, Kakustha of the Bhaṭāri family, who is explicitly identified in line 13, \"baṭāri-kuladōn=āḷu-kadamban;\" in addition, the inscription does not \"include any of the epithets like \"Mānavya-gōtra\", \"Hāritī-putra\", and most important \"Dharma-maharājā\"\" that are a part of all Kadamba inscriptions.\n\nThe inscription is in verse form indicating the authors of the inscription had a good sense of the language structure. The inscription is written in pre-old Kannada (\"Puruvada-hala Kannada\"), which later evolved into old Kannada, middle Kannada and eventually modern Kannada. The Halmidi inscription is the earliest evidence of the usage of Kannada as an administrative language.\n\nThe pillar on which the inscription was written stands around high. The following lines are carved on the front of the pillar:\n\n1. jayati śri-pariṣvāṅga-śārṅga vyānatir-acytāḥ dānav-akṣṇōr-yugānt-āgniḥ śiṣṭānān=tu sudarśanaḥ \n2. namaḥ śrīmat=kadaṁbapan=tyāga-saṁpannan kalabhōranā ari ka- \n3. kustha-bhaṭṭōran=āḷe naridāviḷe-nāḍuḷ mṛgēśa-nā- \n4. gēndr-ābhiḷar=bhbhaṭahar=appor śrī mṛgēśa-nāgāhvaya- \n5. r=irrvar=ā baṭari-kul-āmala-vyōma-tārādhi-nāthann=aḷapa- \n6. gaṇa-paśupatiy=ā dakṣiṇāpatha-bahu-śata-havan=ā- \n7. havuduḷ paśupradāna-śauryyōdyama-bharitōn=dāna pa- \n8. śupatiyendu pogaḷeppoṭṭaṇa paśupati- \n9. nāmadhēyan=āsarakk=ella-bhaṭariyā prēmālaya- \n10. sutange sēndraka-bāṇ=ōbhayadēśad=ā vīra-puruṣa-samakṣa- \n11. de kēkaya-pallavaraṁ kād=eṟidu pettajayan=ā vija \n12. arasange bāḷgaḻcu palmaḍiuṁ mūḷivaḷuṁ ko- \n13. ṭṭār baṭāri-kuladōn=āḷa-kadamban kaḷadōn mahāpātakan \n14. irvvaruṁ saḻbaṅgadar vijārasaruṁ palmaḍige kuṟu- \n15. mbiḍi viṭṭār adān aḻivornge mahāpatakam svasti\n\nThe following line is carved on the pillar's left face:\n\n16. bhaṭṭarg=ī gaḻde oḍḍali ā pattondi viṭṭārakara\n\nಜಯತಿ ಶ್ರೀ ಪರಿಷ್ವರ್ಙ್ಗ ಶ್ಯಾರ್ಙ್ಗ [ವ್ಯಾ]ನತಿರ್ ಅಚ್ಯುತಃ ದಾನಕ್ಷೆರ್ ಯುಗಾನ್ತಾಗ್ನಿಃ [ಶಿಷ್ಟಾನಾನ್ತು ಸುದರ್ಶನಃ ನಮಃ ಶ್ರೀಮತ್ ಕದಂಬಪನ್ ತ್ಯಾಗ ಸಂಪನ್ನನ್ ಕಲಭೋg[ನಾ] ಅರಿ ಕಕುಸ್ಥಭಟ್ಟೋರನ್ ಆಳೆ ನರಿದಾವಿ[ಳೆ] ನಾಡುಳ್ ಮೃಗೇಶನಾಗೇನ್ದ್ರಾಭೀಳರ್ ಭ್ಭಟಹರಪ್ಪೋರ್ ಶ್ರೀ ಮೃಗೇಶ ನಾಗಾಹ್ವಯರ್ ಇರ್ವ್ವರಾ ಬಟರಿ ಕುಲಾಮಲ ವ್ಯೋಮತಾರಾಧಿನಾಥನ್ ಅಳಪ ಗಣ ಪಶುಪತಿಯಾ ದಕ್ಷಿಣಾಪಥ ಬಹುಶತಹವನಾಹವದು[ಳ್] ಪಶುಪ್ರದಾನ ಶೌರ್ಯ್ಯೋದ್ಯಮ ಭರಿತೋ[ನ್ದಾನ]ಪಶುಪತಿಯೆನ್ದು ಪೊಗೞೆಪ್ಪೊಟ್ಟಣ ಪಶುಪತಿ ನಾಮಧೇಯನ್ ಆಸರಕ್ಕೆಲ್ಲಭಟರಿಯಾ ಪ್ರೇಮಾಲಯಸುತನ್ಗೆ zಸೇನ್ದ್ರಕ ಬಣೋಭಯ ದೇಶದಾ ವೀರಪುರುಷಸಮಕ್ಷದೆ ಕೇಕಯ ಪಲ್ಲವರಂ ಕಾದೆಱದು ಪೆತ್ತಜಯನಾ ವಿಜ ಅರಸಂಗೆ ಬಾಳ್ಗೞ್ಚು ಪಲ್ಮಡಿಉಂ ಮೂೞುವಳ್ಳಿಉಂ ಕೊಟ್ಟಾರ್ ಬಟಾರಿ ಕುಲದೊನಳ ಕದಂಬನ್ ಕೞ್ದೋನ್ ಮಹಾಪಾತಕನ್ ಸ್ವಸ್ತಿ ಭಟ್ಟರ್ಗ್ಗೀಗೞ್ದೆ ಒಡ್ಡಲಿ ಆ ಪತ್ತೊನ್ದಿ ವಿಟ್ಟಾರಕರ\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41241080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41241080", "title": "History of advertising", "text": "History of advertising\n\nThe history of advertising can be traced to ancient civilizations. It became a major force in capitalist economies in the mid-19th century, based primarily on newspapers and magazines. In the 20th century, advertising grew rapidly with new technologies such as direct mail, radio, television, the internet and mobile devices.\n\nBetween 1919 and 2007 advertising averaged 2.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product in the United States.\n\nEgyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters. Commercial messages and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of Pompeii and Arabia. Lost and found advertising on papyrus was common in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian rock art paintings that date back to 4000 BC.\n\nIn ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the Classic of Poetry (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the Song dynasty used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with \"Jinan Liu's Fine Needle Shop\" and \"We buy high quality steel rods and make fine quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time\" written above and below. is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.\n\nIn Europe, as the towns and cities of the Middle Ages began to grow, and the general populace was unable to read, instead of signs that read \"cobbler\", \"miller\", \"tailor\", or \"blacksmith\" would use an image associated with their trade such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers (town criers) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in \"Les Crieries de Paris\" (Street cries of Paris), a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve. \n\nThree major forms of advertisement existed during the pre-printing period (before the 15th-century); those forms were trademarks (moon, stars etc.), town criers and sign boards:\n\n\nModern advertising began to take shape with the advent of newspapers and magazines in the 16th and 17th centuries. The very first weekly gazettes appeared in Venice in the early 16th-century. From there, the concept of a weekly publication spread to Italy, Germany and Holland. In Britain, the first weeklies appeared in the 1620s, and its first daily newspaper was the \"The Daily Courant\" published from 1702 to 1735. Almost from the outset, newspapers carried advertising to defray the cost of printing and distribution. The earliest commercial advertisements were for books and quack medicines, but by the 1650s, the variety of products being advertised had increased markedly.\n\nAdvances in printing allowed retailers and manufacturers to print handbills and trade cards. For example, Jonathon Holder, a London haberdasher in the 1670s, gave every customer a printed list of his stock with the prices affixed. At the time, Holder's innovation was seen as a \"dangerous practice\" and an unnecessary expense for retailers. The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. By the 18th century, however, they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen's name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.\n\nIn June 1836, Émile de Girardin editor of the Paris newspaper \"La Presse\" was the first to rely on paid advertising to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its profitability. His formula was soon copied by all titles.\n\nEarly print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the printing press; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as modern people rejected traditional cures. However, false advertising and \"Quackery\" became common. British newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s appealed to the increasingly affluent middle-class that sought out a variety of new products. The advertisements announced new health remedies as well as fresh foods and beverages. The latest London fashions were featured in the regional press. The availability of repeated advertising permitted manufacturers to develop nationally known brand names that had a much stronger appeal than generic products.\n\nA leadership position in British advertising was held by Cope Bros & Co tobacco company, founded in Liverpool in 1848 by Thomas and George Cope. Smoking, of course, had been common for centuries, but the innovations consisted in brand names, heavy advertising, and market segmentation according to class. An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class men promised that \"smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs.\" A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors, while \"delicately fragrant\" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life; lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.\n\nIn London Thomas J. Barratt was hailed as \"the father of modern advertising\". Working for the Pears Soap company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, \"Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?\" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.\n\nAn advertising tactic that he used was to associate the Pears brand with high culture and quality. Most famously, he used the painting \"Bubbles\" by John Everett Millais as an advertisement by adding a bar of Pears soap into the foreground. Barratt continued this theme with a series of adverts of well groomed middle-class children, associating Pears with domestic comfort and aspirations of high society.\n\nBarratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that \"tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste.\"\n\nIn the United States around 1840, Volney B. Palmer set up the first advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded in New York. It planned, created, and executed complete advertising campaigns for its customers. It created a number of memorable slogans for firms such as De Beers, AT&T and the U.S. Army.\n\nBy 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.\n\nThe amount of space available in newspapers grew rapidly. The \"Boston Transcript\" published in 19,000 \"agate lines\" Of advertising in 1860, 87,000 in 1900, and 237,000 in 1918.\n\nIn 1893, 104 companies spent over $50,000 each on national advertising; most sold patent medicines, which faded away after the federal food and drug legislation of the early 20th century. Seven innovators had emerged in the big time: Quaker Oats, Armour meat, Cudahy meat, American Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard tobacco, Remington Typewriters, and Procter & Gamble soap. By 1914, two thirds of the top advertisers came from just five industries: 14 food producers, 13 in automobiles and tires, nine in soap and cosmetics, and four in tobacco.\n\nAgencies were forever breaking up and reforming, especially when one executive would split taking with him a major client and his team of copywriters.\n\nIn the late 19th century in France, Charles-Louis Havas extended the services of his news agency, Havas to include advertisement brokerage, making it the first French group to organize.\n\nAdvertising in the developing world was dominated by agencies in the imperial powers, especially from London and Paris. J. Walter Thompson became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899. It expanded across the globe, becoming one of the first American agencies in Egypt, South Africa and Asia. Much of the pressure to expand came from General Motors, which wanted to export its automobiles worldwide. Ford turned to N.W. Ayer, which began its expansion in Europe and Latin America in the 1930s. The typical policy was to put an American manager in charge, and hire a staff drawn from locals who had a better understanding of the language and the culture. In 1941-42, however, Ayer closed its foreign offices and decided to concentrate on the American market.\n\nIn 2011, spending on advertising reached $143 billion in the United States and $467 billion worldwide.\n\nToday, internationally, the largest (\"big four\") advertising conglomerates are Interpublic, Omnicom, Publicis, and WPP.\n\nAdvertising increased dramatically in the United States after 1870 as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products to a very large market. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale. Total advertising volume in the United States grew from about $200 million in 1880 to nearly $3 billion in 1920.\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, many ad men believed that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – \"sublimated\" into the desire to purchase commodities. Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, promoted the approach making him a pioneer of modern cigarette advertising. Glantz argues, \"it was really the tobacco industry, from the beginning, that was at the forefront of the development of modern, innovative, advertising techniques.\"\n\nIn the 1920s, under Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life.\" In October 1929, the head of the U.S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Julius Klein, stated \"Advertising is the key to world prosperity.\" This was part of the \"unparalleled\" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.\n\nAdvertising was a vehicle for cultural assimilation, encouraging immigrants to exchange their traditional habits and tastes in favor of a modern American lifestyle. An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.\n\nIn 1900, most Canadian newspapers were local affairs, designed primarily to inform local partisans about the provincial and national political scene. The publishers depended on loyal partisan subscribers, as well as contracts for public printing controlled by the political parties. With the rise of national advertising agencies after 1900, a major transformation was underway. The advertisers wanted them to reach the maximum possible circulation, regardless of partisanship. The result was a series of consolidations yielding much larger, largely nonpartisan newspapers, which depended more heavily on advertising revenue than on subscriptions from loyal party members. By 1900, three-fourths of the revenue of Toronto newspapers came from advertising. About two thirds of the newspapers' editorial pages loyally supported either the Conservative or the Liberal party, while the remainder were more independent. Across the board, the news pages increasingly featured more objectivity and bipartisanship, and the publishers were mostly focused on advertising revenues that were proportionate to overall circulation. A newspaper that appealed only to one party cut its potential audience in half. Simultaneously, the rapid growth of industry in Ontario and Quebec, coupled with the rapid settlement of the prairies, produced a large more affluent newspaper-reading population. The result was a golden age for Canadian newspapers peaking about 1911. Many papers failed during the war era. Advertising agencies in 1915 gained a major advantage with the arrival of the Audit Bureau of Circulations, which for the first-time provided reliable data on circulation, as opposed to the partisan boasting and exaggeration that had been the norm. the agencies now had a stronger hand in bargaining for lower advertising rates. The 1920s became a time of consolidation, budget-cutting and dropping of traditional party affiliation. By 1930 only 24% of Canada's dailies were partisan, 17% were \"independent\" partisan, and the majority, 50%, had become fully independent.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. Helen Lansdowne Resor at J. Walter Thompson Agency, was one of the pioneers.\n\nIn 1911, the Woodbury Soap Company became the first to use images of sexual contact to sell a product. Their ad slogan, created by Helen Lansdowne, claimed that women who used the soap would have \"Skin You Love To Touch\". Her copy promised the soap would increase the beauty of one's skin; it offered a color print and a week's supply of the soap for 10 cents. The slogan became so popular that Woodbury used it until the 1940s. Albert Lasker said the ad's use of sex appeal made it one of three great landmarks in advertising history. It was ranked 31st on \"Advertising Age's\" list of the top 100 campaigns of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1936, Woodbury was one of the first companies to use nudity in its advertisements. The ad, known as \"The Sun Bath\", was photographed by Edward Steichen and showed a nude woman lying on stairs on her side with her back to the camera. The text advertised that Woodbury Soap was now enriched with \"filter sunshine\". Many celebrities appeared in advertisements for Woodbury Soap.\n\nIn international perspective, a 2008 comparison of nudity in advertising in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States reveals that China and the United States have the most demure ads, while Germany and Thailand exposed more of the female body. There is little variation in male undress.\n\nIn the early 20th century, psychologists Walter D. Scott and John B. Watson contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, \"Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible\". He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer. The former chair at Johns Hopkins University, John B. Watson was a highly recognized psychologist in the 1920s. After leaving the field of academia he turned his attention towards advertising where he implemented the concepts of behaviorism into advertising. This focused on appealing to the basic emotions of the consumer: love, hate, and fear. This type of advertising proved to be extremely effective as it suited the changing social context which led to heavy influence of future advertising strategy and cemented the place of psychology in advertising.\n\nChicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry. Albert Lasker, known as the \"father of modern advertising,\" made Chicago his base 1898–1942. As head of the Lord and Thomas agency, Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked Lucky Strikes they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.\n\nLasker had an inquiring mind about what advertising was and how it worked. Lasker believed that advertising consisted of news and information was news, He changed his mind when a colleague Johnny Kennedy told him, \"News is a technique of presentation, but advertising is a very simple thing. I can give it to you in three words, it is 'salesmanship in print'\". Lasker and Kennedy used this concept with the 1900 Washer Co. (later Whirlpool). Their campaign was so successful that, within four months of running the first ad, they attracted additional clients and their \"advertising spend\" went from $15,000 a year to $30,000 a month. Within six months, their firm was one of the three or four largest advertisers in the nation.\n\nIn 1908 Lasker recruited Claude C. Hopkins to the firm, specifically to work on the Van Camp Packaging Company (Van Camp's) account. The relationship lasted for 17 years. Lasker helped create America's infatuation with orange juice. Lord & Thomas acquired the Sunkist Growers, Incorporated account in 1908, when the citrus industry was in a slump. Lasker created campaigns that not only encouraged consumers to eat oranges, but also to drink orange juice.\n\nAmong Lasker's pioneering contributions was the introduction into public schools of classes that explained to young girls about puberty and menstruation (done to promote Kotex tampons). He is also credited as the creator of the soap opera genre, and using radio and television as media driven by advertising. Lasker took time off from business to help the presidential campaign of Republican Warren Harding in 1920, using high-powered advertising techniques that helped produce a massive landslide.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. Madison Avenue early on recognized the importance of radio as a new advertising medium. Advertising provided the major funding for most stations. United States, never had a licensing fee for set users. Great Britain Use the mandatory fee on set owners to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation, Which to this day operates without commercials or advertising. However, the government permitted\ncommercial television in 1954 and commercial radio in 1972.\n\nPublic service advertising, non-commercial advertising, public interest advertising, cause marketing, and social marketing are different terms for (or aspects of) the use of sophisticated advertising and marketing communications techniques (generally associated with commercial enterprise) on behalf of non-commercial, public interest issues and initiatives.\n\nIn the United States, the granting of television and radio licenses by the FCC is contingent upon the station broadcasting a certain amount of public service advertising. To meet these requirements, many broadcast stations in America air the bulk of their required public service announcements during the late night or early morning when the smallest percentage of viewers are watching, leaving more day and prime time commercial slots available for high-paying advertisers.\n\nPublic service advertising in the United States reached its height during the world wars. During WWII President Roosevelt commissioned the creation of The War Advertising Council (now known as the Ad Council) which is the United States' largest developer of PSA campaigns on behalf of government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the longest-running public service campaign, Smokey Bear.\n\nAdvertising came under heavy pressure in the 1930s. The Great Depression forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The New Deal furthermore aggressively promoted consumerism, and minimized the value or need of advertising. Historian Jackson Lears argues that \"By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics.\" They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own market research, as well has the key to understanding politics. George Gallup, the vice president of Young and Rubicam, and numerous other advertising experts, led the way. Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the \"American Way of Life\" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. \"Advertisers,\" Lears concludes, \"played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society.\"\n\nIn the prosperous postwar era, millions of Americans moved into new housing, especially in the rapidly growing suburbs. They spent heavily on housing, appliances, furniture, clothing and automobiles. The coming of television in the 1950s dramatically enlarged the arena for advertising. With most families having automobiles, and more leisure time, travel holidays became much more common, and the motel and tourism industries eagerly supported large-scale advertising.\n\nIn the public service arena, the Ad Council aggressively promoted Americanism as a Cold War strategy, with campaigns such as the Freedom Train, the Crusade for Freedom, Religion in American Life, Adams for Piece, and Peoples Capitalism. The new Brand Names Foundation sponsored conferences, local campaigns, and educational programs to promote brand loyalty, as well as free enterprise.\n\nIn \"The Hidden Persuaders\" (1957) popular writer Vance Packard exposes the use of consumer motivational research and other psychological techniques, including depth psychology and subliminal tactics. They had been used to manipulate expectations and induce desire for products since the 1920s, but the popular audience was caught by surprise. He identified eight \"compelling needs\" that advertisers promise products will fulfill. According to Packard these needs are so strong that people are compelled to buy products to satisfy them. The book questions the morality of using these techniques.\n\nBefore the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, black people were largely missing from mainstream white advertising. Those who did appear typically followed the long-standing \"hierarchy of skin color\" whereby those with lighter skin tones were seen as being more socially and culturally acceptable than dark-skinned black people.\n\nMost national corporations before the 1960s ignored the black market, and paid little attention to working with black merchants or hiring blacks for responsible positions. Pepsi-Cola was a major exception, as the number two brand fought for parity with Coca-Cola. The upstart soda brand hired black promoters who penetrated into black markets across the South and the urban North. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s: \nPepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted one-dimensional Aunt Jemimas and Uncle Bens whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead it portrayed black customers as self-confident middle-class citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.\n\nBy the late 1960s, more than a few token blacks were hired at advertising agencies, and the sensitivity to the problem increased. The leading black magazines \"Essence\" and \"Jet\" routinely deplored racism in mainstream media, especially in the negative depictions of black men and women. However \"Essence\" and \"Jet\" in the 21st century themselves ran about a dozen ads a year, especially for skin lighteners, that were pervaded with \"racism and White supremacy.\"\n\nBy the 1950s, fears of cancer from tobacco smoking caused consternation in the tobacco industry, which turned to advertisers for help in avoiding falling consumer demand and increased regulation. British and American agencies separately arrived at similar solutions. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee in the United States and the Tobacco Manufacturers' Standing Committee in Britain each assuaged public anxieties and encouraged the misperception that the cigarette makers were resolving the issues through filters and low tar formulations. The public relations approach was successful in the short run, but the accumulation of medical evidence led to a fall in smoking, heavier taxation, and increased regulation. The agencies responded with sophisticated advertising strategies designed to encourage adolescent smokers as well as to recruit new smokers in less-developed foreign markets.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly MTV. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in \"for\" the advertising message, rather than it being a by-product or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, specialty channels emerged, including channels entirely devoted to advertising, such as QVC, Home Shopping Network, and ShopTV Canada.\n\nWith the advent of the ad server, marketing through the Internet opened new frontiers for advertisers and contributed to the \"dot-com\" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from coupons to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, a number of websites, including the search engine Google, started a change in online advertising by emphasizing contextually relevant ads based on an individual's browsing interests. This has led to a plethora of similar efforts and an increasing trend of interactive advertising.\n\nThe share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media. For example, in the US in 1925, the main advertising media were newspapers, magazines, signs on streetcars, and outdoor posters. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.\n\nThe advertising business model has also been adapted since the 1990s. In media for equity, advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for equity. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.\n\nChinese advertising is moving heavily to the smartphone, leaving television behind. Companies in China are increasingly more focused on mobile advertisements than on television advertisements. Central roles are played by Chinese-based social networking sites Weixin (also known as WeChat), and Sina Weibo, and the efforts of Western companies, including Coca-Cola, Burberry, and North Face, to market to Chinese consumers through their smartphones.\n\nSince the 1950s, the industry itself, or the government, has imposed some restrictions on advertising certain types of products, especially liquor and cigarettes. Tobacco bans exist in many major countries across the world and cover 2.3 billion people. In the 1990s Quebec banned some advertising directed at children. The restrictions have hindered competition in the breakfast cereal market when compared with the rest of Canada.\n\nJ. Walter Thompson became the first American agency to expand internationally with the opening of J. Walter Thompson London in 1899.\n\nMarcel Bleustein-Blanchet (1906-1996) was the most prominent leader of French advertising in the 20th century. He founded Publicis. After 1945 his little-known Paris-based advertising agency grew rapidly, becoming the world's fourth largest agency. It was a leader in promoting France's post-war economic boom, especially the expansion of the advertising industry. It was successful because of its close ties with top officials of the French government, its clever use of symbols to promote itself, and its ability to attract clients from widely diverse growing industries.\n\nThe question of whether advertising reflects society or shapes society, can be seen in European models that diverged from the American style. In France, Michelin dominated the tire industry and was one of the leading advertisers; to this day its famous guidebooks are very widely used by upscale travelers. From 1894 to the present its symbol was Bibendum (the \"Michelin Man\" made of tires). He was a lord of industry, a master of all he surveyed, and a patriotic expounder of the French spirit. In the 1920s, Bibendum urged Frenchmen to adopt America's superior factory system, but to patriotically avoid using the \"inferior\" products of those factories. As automobiles diffused to the middle classes, Michelin advertising likewise shifted downscale, and its restaurant and hotel guides covered a broader range of price categories.\n\nJ Walter Thompson expanded successfully in many countries, but France was not one of them. French businessmen did not like the American tone, and were fearful of Americanization. The French market was heavily regulated and protected to repel foreign interests, and the American admen in Paris were not good at hiding their condescension and insensitivity.\n\nAs millions of American soldiers passed through Britain during the Second World War, there were fearsof an \"Americanization\" of British commerce and culture. The Marshall Plan explicitly required and upgrading of the marketing and organizational skills of British industry. There were fears among the leaders of the London advertising world of what the brash, rich Americans would do to them. Radio and television was off limits to advertising, because BBC relied on fees paid by owners of radio receivers. The question was whether the heavily funded American methods would prove irresistible. JWT London was an American owned advertising agency controlled by J. Walter Thompson in New York City. JWT London avoided being the bold apostle of the American style. Instead it is relied on soft persuasion, shedding its Americanness to adapt to the British understated style.\n\nIn the 1920s, most advertising was handled by manufacturing companies in-house. Numerous small advertising agencies handled purchase of space in the media, but did not design campaigns or the ads themselves. An important role was played by travelling salesmen in promoting products to wholesalers and retailers and providing feedback from the market to the producer.\n\nDuring the Nazi era (1933–45), the advertising industry expelled its Jews, and came under the supervision of the \"Ad Council for the German Economy,\" a department of the propaganda ministry of Joseph Goebbels. The relationship was friendly, For the industry learned a great deal from the Nazi propaganda techniques. The industry promoted Hitler's favorite products, such as the promised Volkswagen automobile for the people, and the construction of autobahns. It emphasized the availability of trusted brands despite growing shortages after the war began in 1939. It helped support the regime, articulating a vision of consumption that was well aligned with the Nazi spirit. In some environments and social movements, such as with post-WW2 East Germany Stasi's zersetzung, criminology theorists estimated advertisement was used as a means to crime, the nature of the crime was the intentional exploitation of an individual to cause damage to the individual's ability to form social bonds and appropriate perceptions of the world. This is especially true in the case of manipulation, people take advantage of their underdeveloped social skills and exploit them for selfish gain, this was later criticized to be adopted by turpitude agents of modern advertising. Many major brands were off the market by 1944, because of severe shortages. When they returned after the war, they were welcomed as an index of normality and were not associated with Nazism.\n\nBy the 1950s, German advertising agencies were starting to mimic American methods. Coca-Cola was advising \"Mach mal Pause\" (\"Take a Rest!), and conservative Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was running for reelection with the slogan \"Keine Experimente!\" (\"No Experiments!\"). \nThe German agencies have always remained small and limited in scope, even after the unification of East Germany and West Germany in 1991. After unification, Germany became the third largest ad market in the world, with $18 billion in total ad spending in 1994.\n\nThe American influence became strong in Italy after 1945. The high risk of communist success led the American government to invest heavily in propaganda activities. Several American firms opened offices, including Young & Rubicon and Ogilvy & Mather. Italian graphic designers, most prominently Armando Testa, were inspired by modernist aesthetics and thinking brought in by the American advertising agencies and techniques in Italy. The advertising industry helped transform Italy into a consumer-oriented society. \nA dramatic example of how advertising nudged the Italian middle-class into modern consumer society appears in the heavily advertised automatic washing machine. It appeared on the Italian market in 1958 and by 1965, 23% of families had purchased one, reaching 42% by 1970. Advertisers hailed the mechanization of domestic tedium as the advent of a new women's \"liberation.\" Commentary appeared everywhere, from advertisements to the specialized press, to women's reviews. Architects and designers made room for the new marvel, as the promotional language celebrating the device became a chorus of praise for domestic appliances as the secret of \"progress\" and \"freedom\" and \"liberation.\" On the other hand, husbands still insisted on driving the family automobile; it was off-limits to the liberated female.\nArmando Testa Set up a full-service advertising agency in 1956, specializing in the new medium of television advertising. He was inspired by Eastern European animation techniques, and often use simple graphics like the blue hippo. His son Marco Testa, trained at Benton & Bowles in New York, and maintained the fast-paced, witty style. Emmanuelle Pirella, who trained at the Italian offices of Young & Rubicon and Ogilvy & Mather, emerged as a leading copywriter.\n\nBenetton gained worldwide attention for its saucy advertising, inspired by its art director Oliviero Toscani. He started with multicultural themes, tied together under the campaign \"United Colors of Benetton\" then became increasingly provocative with interracial groupings, and unusual sexual images, such as a nun kissing a priest.\n\nDentsu is the dominant firm in Japan thanks to its origins as a media representative. It produced Japan's first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials. It was established in 1901 as Japan Advertising Ltd. and Telegraphic Service Co. by Hoshiro Mitsunaga. In 1936, it sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency, to focus on advertising. In 1946, it purchased 16 small companies and set up operational bases in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyūshū. Dentsu company now offers a range of services, from traditional and creative marketing to specialty disciplines such as sports marketing, investing in feature film production and acquiring broadcasting rights, PR, digital contents, and a growing range of communications services.\n\nIn the first 20 years of communist control of China (1947 to 1966) Mao Zedong tried to reverse the long-standing advertising practices of Chinese newspapers, considering it a capitalist infringement on the goals of socialism. Consumerism, which had been highly developed in Shanghai, was anathema, to Mao's peasant-based communist perspective. The regime emphasized maximum production rather than optimal consumption. The approach worsened the massive famines that happened when national resources were devoted to a highly inefficient factory production at the cost of basic food output. On the other hand, propaganda was highly developed art in the Communist Party, and so a sort of compromise was reached. Socialist-oriented advertising emphasized the collective good, rather than the benefits of products for the individual consumer. Since 1980, the strength of the private economy, and advertising, has grown dramatically. By the 1980s much emphasis was placed on the role of advertising in promoting the Four Modernizations emphasized by Deng Xiaoping. Lip service is still paid to old Maoist ideals by recycling images of historic places and episodes, but it does not inhibit the growth of consumerism.\n\nSince Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, its advertising industry has fundamentally changed. It has become the world's fastest-growing advertising market and the country with the largest pool of netizens. Major changes have come in terms of shifting cultural values, the growing role of brand names, the attractiveness of English-language titles to the younger generation, the redefinition of acceptable/offensive advertising, the very rapid growth of new media (especially the Internet and smart phones), the emergence of on-line shopping in a country with an underdeveloped system of department stores in shopping centers, and much more advanced techniques of managing advertising agencies.\n\nMany elements of Indian culture and industry have British roots, so that British advertising models usually work well. In 1991, the government dramatically liberalized Indian economy, opening it to international business. The emergence of a moderately affluent middle-class numbering in the hundreds of millions attracts multinational corporations and international advertisers. Advertising in India operates at two levels. Ads for high-value products appear in English-language papers such as \"The Hindu\" and \"The Madras Mail,\" which targeted Europeans and high-status Indians. By contrast, ads for low-value products are typically placed in vernacular papers and are aimed at a lower middle class with highly restricted spending power. The working class and peasant populations, with very low disposable incomes, are seldom targeted by the advertising agencies. Local merchants might use signs and posters to reach them. Cricket is one sport where the Indians have had an international success, so that cricket stars are prominent endorsers in national advertising.\n\nSubtle cultural norms can be easily transgressed. In 2002, widespread protests forced Hindustan Lever Ltd. (the Indian subsidiary of London-based Unilever) to cancel a television ad campaign for its fairness cream because of its portrayal of women. The campaign was built around the theme of a father lamenting \"If only I had a son\" while showing his problem: a dark-skinned, unattractive daughter. Fast-forward. She uses the Fair & Lovely cream and has become a gorgeous light-skinned beauty. Clad in a stylish miniskirt, she is a successful airline flight attendant and takes her proud father to dine at a five-star hotel. The All India Women's Democratic Association (AIDWA), a far left political organization, lodged a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in New Delhi. It argued endorsing the traditional preference for sons strengthens gender discrimination, which is a major problem in India. Furthermore, said AIDWA, the ad perpetuated a culture of discrimination in a society where \"fair skin\" is synonymous with \"beautiful.\" The government's Ministry of Information and Broadcast sided with AIDWA and directed stations not to air the ads because they violated the Cable and Television Networks Act of 1995 which states that no advertisement shall be permitted which \"derides any race, caste, color, creed and nationality\" and furthermore states that, \"Women must not be portrayed in a manner that emphasizes passive, submissive qualities and encourages them to play a subordinate secondary role in the family and society.\" The minister told Parliament that if broadcasters do not regulate ad content the government will be forced to do so. The Mumbai-based Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a body of advertisers and media agencies, insisted that it should do the regulating not the government. ASCI had already told Hindustan Lever that its ad campaign was offensive and it was ended.\n\nDuring the decolonization era from the late 1940s to the 1970s, British and French firms operating in Africa and Asia at first largely ignored local, nationalistic aspirations. However they learned to adjust to exploit the new spirit of independence that was shaping consumer attitudes. The new emergence of a middle class was the target audience. Their advertising abandoned the traditional paternalistic attitude toward the natives. Instead there was a portrayal of locals as up-and-coming middle class men in control of developing their nations. These more positive images assisted business operations during spells of military dictatorship, economic nationalism, and expropriation of foreign assets. Tobacco advertising was especially important. For example, in Egyptian popular culture the cigar was associated with elites, the water pipe with a lower-class and traditional lifestyle, and the cigarette with the new middle class which was striving to make the transition to modernity. It was the third group that the cigarette industry targeted.\n\nBrazil is the largest country in Latin America, and number five in the world in terms of population. Its economy grew rapidly in the 21st century, until it began to stall in 2010. At that time it was the world's sixth-biggest advertising market, at $US 14.2 billion. Brazil in 2010 ranks #1 in deodorants, #2 in children's products, #3 in cosmetics, and #4 in automobile sales\n\nThe start in 1994 of the North American Free Trade Agreement had a dramatic impact on the adveritising industry in Mexico, with its 130 full service agencies and 270 smaller operations under the auspisces of the Mexican Association of Advertising Agencies. The flood of American brand-name products greatly expanded the scope of the advertising industry, and the Mexican agencies faced new competition from branch offices of international firms.\n\nA key to the new market was that upscale consumers in Mexico typically display \"malinchismo\", which is a preference for imported American brands rather than local Mexican brands. As a result, American products are sold mostly to the middle class market, and their advertising agencies generally avoid working class and rural areas. They concentrate their efforts instead on Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara, which purchase 70 percent of the American imports. Advertising battles in Mexico, include not only issues of quality, but issues of national authenticity. For example, in Mexico in the 1990s, two American exporters Procter & Gamble and Frito-Lay fought an advertising battle concerning whose potato chips are tastier, more natural, and more Mexican. Procter & Gamble challenged Frito-Lay's Sabritas which controls 80 percent of the $1 billion chip market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21335877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21335877", "title": "Jointness (psychodynamics)", "text": "Jointness (psychodynamics)\n\nJointness is a term (R. Solan 1991) in psychoanalysis and psychodynamic theory, describing a new look at normal object relation that takes place from the beginning of life. Till nowadays symbiosis (propounded by Margaret Mahler 1968, 1975) is the common term for a normal object relation, while Ronnie Solan emphasizes that symbiosis represents impairment in object relation.\n\nJointness is defined as a dynamic process representing an emotional system for attachment and for communication between separate individuals who jointly approach each other in a third, joint, virtual space. Jointness represents an encounter between mother and infant, psychotherapist and patient, or any partners experiencing simultaneously mutual intimacy, while concomitantly safeguarding separateness.\n\nThe newborn, very early in life, perceives the other, even his mother, as a \"not-I\" (it indicates a psychic process to safeguard one's own self), and is attached to the \"not-I mother\" by an intimate acquaintance with her through his/her senses. When both, mother and baby, devote themselves to intimacy, that temporarily blurs the boundaries between them, separateness can be safeguarded. As a result, baby might gradually develop his/her own boundaries and acknowledge those of his or her object and might invest their own innate abilities to participate in human interactions and enjoy relationships (\"motivational systems,\" Emde, 1988).\n\nThe development of this basic process of jointness between baby and mother depends on mother's capacity to tolerate separateness. It is the mother who imprints the quality and the intensity of the rapprochement-separation balancing process in their relationship, while both of them are fully invested in each other.\n\nThe unique jointness and the unique communication, in a unique psychic virtual space are created by the sharing of interests (emotional or cognitive), and by the mutual investment of partners in a joint phenomenon, object, or idea, meaningful to both. All vital human communication represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space. Thus, \"jointness\" elicits the triadic (triangulation) object relations (mother's space – \"virtual transitional space\" – baby's space).\n\nIn this type of transitional space baby and mother, lovers, or partners of a common task, are jointly determine the extent of rapprochement between themselves, the extent of safeguarding separateness and also the moment to separate. Each of them is sensorily attentive to the strangeness and the separateness of the “non-I” that the other represents for him. Such a dynamic process of jointness, represents healthy development from birth, paves the way to a sense of individuation and culminates to establish the valuable communication with others relating to their otherness, while preserving separateness and self integrity.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between jointness and symbiosis. Both may commence with the beginning of life; they may seem similar, and yet they are widely different experiences. In symbiosis, baby and mother behave and function as though they were \"an omnipotent system - a dual unity within one common boundary\" (Margaret Mahler, 1968, p. 201). Partners of symbiosis can be fully satisfied as long as there is no hint of separateness. Jointness, on the other hand, represents both the separateness of the two (or more) individuals and their joining in a third virtual space.\n\nThe development of this basic process (between baby and mother) in symbiosis depends on mother's inability to endure separateness while both of them are fully invested in each other. It is the mother who imprints on their encounter her need to contain herself with her baby in one unit and to prevent the encouragement of separateness in favor of the boundaries of their unity. Both partners will be motivated, through life, by a powerful need for merging and they will remain almost addicted to finding another object to merge with and attach their symbiotic needs, even at the expense of sacrificing their individuation, their true-self and their self-esteem. Such an encounter fosters only a dyadic relation where the \"transitional virtual space\" between them is missing.\n\nHence, symbiosis is a dyadic pathological process, even from the beginning of life that results in self fragility, narcissistic disturbances and in an immature personality; while jointness represents a triadic healthy development that depends on healthy narcissism and generates separation-individuation, communication and relationship.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1139755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1139755", "title": "José Craveirinha", "text": "José Craveirinha\n\nJosé Craveirinha (28 May 1922 - 6 February 2003) was a Mozambican journalist, story writer and poet, who is today considered the greatest poet of Mozambique. His poems, written in Portuguese, address such issues as racism and the Portuguese colonial domination of Mozambique. A supporter of the anti-Portuguese group FRELIMO during the colonial wars, he was imprisoned in the 1960s. He was one of the African pioneers of the Négritude movement, and published six books of poetry between 1964 and 1997. Craveirinha also wrote under the pseudonyms Mário Vieira, José Cravo, Jesuíno Cravo, J. Cravo, J.C., Abílio Cossa, and José G. Vetrinha.\n\nBorn in Maputo, Mozambique (then Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique), the child of a Portuguese father and a black mother of the Ronga ethnicity, Craveirinha was raised in the language and culture of Portugal.\n\nAs a journalist, he contributed to numerous Mozambican magazines and newspapers, including \"O Brado Africano\" (1918–74), \"Notícias\", \"Tribuna\", \"Notícias da Tarde\", \"Voz de Moçambique\", \"Notícias da Beira\", \"Diário de Moçambique\", and \"Voz Africana\". He became familiar with other poets of the period through his journalism, notably Rui de Noronha (1909–1943), Marcelino dos Santos (1929– ), and Noemia de Sousa (1926–2003). His works were primarily political in nature. Consistent themes in his work were African self-determination, images of the African landscape, and writing that reflected the influence of African languages.\n\nCraveirinha began his political activity at the Lourenço Marques African Association in the 1950s, an organization tolerated by the colonial Portuguese government, and later became its chairperson. He became involved in clandestine politics in this period, and became a member of a cell of FRELIMO, the leading movement for the liberation of Mozambique from Portuguese rule. He was imprisoned in solitary confinement by the fascist Portuguese PIDE régime in 1965, a year after his publication of his first collection of poetry, \"Chigubo\". He was released from prison in 1969.\n\nWhen FRELIMO seized power in 1974, was appointed vice-director of the national press. He was the first president of Association of Mozambican Writers (\"Associação dos Escritores Moçambicanos\"), and served from 1982 and 1987. The association established the José Craveirinha Prize for Literature (\"Prémio José Craveirinha de Literatura\") in 2003. Craveirinha was awarded the Prémio Camões, the world's highest honour for Lusophone literature, in 1991. He is noted as the first African writer to win the prize. He was considered several times for the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 2003, Craveirinha was declared a \"national hero\" by President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who praised Craveirinha's literary contribution to the fight against colonialism.\n\nDespite his literary acclaim, Craveirinha was hesitant to have his works appear in print, and a large body of his work from the pre- and post-colonial periods remains unpublished. His wife Maria died in October 1977. Craveirinha wrote numerous poems after her death that were first published under the title \"Maria\" in 1988, and in a much fuller form in a second edition in 1998.\n\nCraveirinha also played football and coached other athletes. He arranged an athletic scholarship in the United States for Maria de Lurdes Mutola, who won a gold medal in track and field at the Olympics in 2000, and his son Stelio also held the national long jump record.\n\nCraveirinha died at the age of 80 while undergoing treatment in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2003.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7380029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7380029", "title": "Kim Tu-bong", "text": "Kim Tu-bong\n\nKim Tu-bong (February 16, 1889 – March 1958 or later) was the first Chairman of the Workers' Party of North Korea from 1946 to 1949. He was known in Korean history as a linguist, scholar and politician. His most famous work was under Ju Sigyeong; later, after participating in the March 1st Movement, he with other Korean leaders of the time established a provisional government-in-exile in China, and because of his communist beliefs he played an important role in the early North Korean communist government. \n\nHe and other members of the Yan'an faction formed the New People's Party when they returned from exile. After the New People's Party merged into the Workers Party of North Korea (WPNK) in 1946 at the 1st WPNK Congress, he became WPNK Chairman. He was the first head of state (Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly) of North Korea from 1948 to 1957. He is most remembered in South Korea for his efforts in establishing the Korean linguistic field and especially that of Hangul. Much of his work both political and linguistically was done while living in China with the exiled government of Korea. He is also known by his pen name Baekyeon. He was purged by Kim Il-sung in 1957.\n\nBorn on February 2, 1889, in South Korea's South Gyeongsang Province, near modern-day Pusan, he spent his early years being homeschooled during the time of imperial rule. He would move to Seoul at the age of 20 (1908) to attend both Geho School and Baechae School and in that same year graduate from Bogo High School. While he was in Seoul he would join the Korea Youth organization in 1913 and the following year (1914) leave Baechae School. He was also an editor for the So nyoun magazine.\n\nAfter graduating from Bosungkobo (Bosung College) in 1908, Kim Tu-bong worked closely with a Linguistic professor from Bosungkobo named Ju Sigyeong who was at that time beginning his work in the study of Hangul for which his name would later be known for as he would dedicate his life to bring it about (the Korean script made by King Sae Jeong during the 15th century). He also worked as a teacher. In 1916 he spent a majority of his time working on compiling MalMooe, the first Korean dictionary.\n\nAfter the March 1st Movement (March 1, 1919) he and other members of the independence club fled into China and in April 1919 set up a provisional government in Shanghai. During which he was first exposed to Communism and eventually accepted it in 1920 after first supporting the Democratic Party. In 1924 he was entrusted with the department of children education and schooling where he served as the president and also taught both Korean and Korean History. After the Japanese invaded China he and other members of the Korean government in Shanghai fled to Yan'an, and there Kim would become the head of the independence club and became a very important figure in combining the conflicting views of both communist and democratic ideas.\n\nThe December following World War II and the Japanese's surrender (August 15, 1945) Kim Tu-bong and other members returned to the then-divided Korea. Like many other Communist-minded people of the time, Kim Tu-bong and other Communist leaders took residence in what is now North Korea under the Soviet occupation. In February 1946 Kim Tu-bong became the chairman of the new People's Party. Later that year in August it merged to form the Workers' Party. He would become the chairman in 1948, though from the outset the real power was held by Premier Kim Il-sung. Kim Tu-bong designed the new flag that is still used in North Korea today in an effort to throw off what he saw as feudal rule.\n\nKim Il-sung became chairman of the Workers' Party after it merged with its southern counterpart in 1949, thus becoming in name as well as in fact the country's leader. In most Communist states, the party leader is understood to be the most powerful man in the country. \n\nAfter the Korean War Kim Tu-bong had served his usefulness in the government, and, whether real or imagined, many scholars believe at this point he now became a perceived threat to Kim Il-sung's dictatorship. Rumors began that it had to do with a scandal, as he had married a much younger woman later in life. Whatever the reason, he was purged in March 1958, accused of involvement in the 1956 August Faction Incident. Like many others of Kim Il-sung's political opponents, he disappeared with no records to indicate whether he had been sentenced to hard labor or exile. He is believed to have either been executed, or to have died some time in the 1960s in internal exile.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17163", "title": "Knockout", "text": "Knockout\n\nA knockout (abbreviated to KO or K.O.) is a fight-ending, winning criterion in several full-contact combat sports, such as boxing, kickboxing, muay thai, mixed martial arts, karate, some forms of taekwondo, and other sports involving striking, as well as fighting-based video games. A full knockout is considered any legal strike or combination thereof that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting.\n\nThe term is often associated with a sudden traumatic loss of consciousness caused by a physical blow. Single powerful blows to the head (particularly the jawline and temple) can produce a cerebral concussion or a carotid sinus reflex with syncope and cause a sudden, dramatic KO. Body blows, particularly the liver punch, can cause progressive, debilitating pain that can also result in a KO.\n\nIn boxing and kickboxing, a knockout is usually awarded when one participant falls to the canvas and is unable to rise to their feet within a specified period of time, typically because of exhaustion, pain, disorientation, or unconsciousness. For example, if a boxer is knocked down and is unable to continue the fight within a ten-second count, they are counted as having been knocked out and their opponent is awarded the KO victory.\n\nIn mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions, no time count is given after a knockdown, as the sport allows submission grappling as well as ground and pound. If a fighter loses consciousness (\"goes limp\") as a result of legal strikes it is declared a KO. Even if the fighter loses consciousness for a brief moment and wakes up again to continue to fight, the fight is stopped and declared a KO. As many MMA fights can take place on the mat rather than standing, it is possible to score a KO via ground and pound, a common victory for grapplers. \n\nIn fighting-based video games, such as \"Street Fighter\" and \"Tekken\", a player scores a knockout by fully depleting the opponent's health bar, which awards the round to the winning player. The player who wins the most rounds (by scoring the most knockouts or by having more vitality remaining when time expires during each round) wins the match. This is different from real-life combat sports, where a knockout would end the match immediately.\n\nA technical knockout (TKO or T.K.O.), or stoppage, is declared when the referee or official ring physician decides during a round that a fighter cannot safely continue the match for any reason, without the need for an intervening count. In most regions, a TKO is declared when a fighter is knocked down three times in one round. Other reasons for stopping a fight include severe facial lacerations and a fighter's inability to put up a sufficient defense following a knockdown. \n\nA TKO only occurs if the fight is stopped during a round. If a fighter or his/her cornerman decides to end the fight between rounds, it is ruled a corner retirement or \"referee technical decision\" (RTD). Both TKO's and corner retirements are counted as knockouts in a fighter's record. \n\nIn MMA bouts, the referee may declare a TKO if a fighter cannot intelligently defend him/herself while being repeatedly struck. \n\nA double knockout, in both real life combat sports and fighting-based video games, is when both fighters trade blows and knock each other out simultaneously, and are both unable to continue fighting. In such cases, the match is declared a draw. In fighting games such as \"Street Fighter\" and \"Tekken\", a draw is counted as a loss for both players. \n\nLittle is known about what exactly causes one to be knocked unconscious, but many agree it is related to trauma to the brain stem. This usually happens when the head rotates sharply, often as a result of a strike. There are three general manifestations of such trauma:\n\nA basic principle of boxing and other combat sports is to defend against this vulnerability by keeping both hands raised about the face and the chin tucked in. That could still be ineffective if the opponent punches effectively to the solar plexus.\n\nA fighter who becomes unconscious from a strike with sufficient knockout power is referred to as having been \"knocked out\" or \"KO'd\" (\"kay-ode\"). Losing balance without losing consciousness is referred to as being \"knocked down\" (\"down but not out\"). Repeated blows to the head, regardless whether they cause loss of consciousness, are known to gradually cause permanent brain damage. In severe cases this may cause strokes or paralysis. This loss of consciousness is commonly known as becoming \"punch drunk\" or \"shot\". Because of this, many physicians advise against sports involving knockouts.\n\nFighters who lose by knockout (either by ten count or technical) are automatically suspended for 30 days, three months if it is the second knockout within three months, or one year if it is the third knockout within one year.\n\nA knockdown occurs when a fighter touches the floor of the ring with any part of the body other than the feet following a hit, but is able to rise back up and continue fighting. The term is also used if the fighter is hanging on to the ropes, caught between the ropes, or is hanging over the ropes and is unable to fall to the floor and cannot protect himself. A knockdown triggers a count by the referee (normally to 10); if the fighter fails the count, then the fight is ended as a KO.\n\nA flash knockdown is a knockdown where the fighter hits the canvas but recovers quickly enough that a count is not started.\n\n\nInactive National Boxing Association, World Colored Boxing Championship as well as list on List of current world boxing champions and European Boxing Union.\n\n\n\nFighters from inactive Pride Fighting Championships and active UFC/Bellator plus champions and former champions from other organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The languages spoken there reflect ancient settlement patterns, migrations, and its long history. \"Ethnologue\" counts more than 80 languages. Of these, French is the official language and Bambara is the most widely spoken. Altogether 13 of the indigenous languages of Mali have the legal status of national language.\n\nFrench, which was introduced during the colonial period, was retained as the official language at independence and is used in government and formal education. Estimates of the number of people who actually speak French are low. Figures estimated in 1986 give a number of 386,000 speakers of French in Mali, derived from the numbers of school attendees. This would mean roughly 21% of the population speak French, by 1986 figures, a number considerably lower than those who speak Bambara. \n\nAlmost all people who speak French in Mali speak it as a second language. 1993 estimates are that there are only around 9,000 Malian speakers of French as a first language. French is more understood in urban centres, with 1976 figures showing a 36.7% \"Francophone\" rate in urban areas, but only an 8.2% rate in rural areas. French usage is gender weighted as well, with 1984 figures showing 17.5% percent of males speaking French, but only 4.9% of women.\n\nBambara (), a Manding language (in the Mande family) is said to be spoken by 80% of the population as a first or second language. It is spoken mainly in central and Southern Mali. Bambara and two other very closely related Manding languages Malinke or Maninkakan in the southwest and Kassonke (in the region of Kayes in the west), are among the 13 national languages. Bambara is used as a trade language in Mali between language groups.\n\n(Bambara is also very close to the Dyula language ( or ; ), spoken mainly in Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. The name \"Jula\" is actually a Manding word meaning \"trader.\") \n\nOther Mande languages (not in the Manding group) include Soninke (in the region of Kayes in western Mali), Dogon languages (of \"Pays Dogon\" or Dogon country in central Mali), the Bozo languages (along the middle Niger).\n\nOther languages include Senufo in the Sikasso region (south), Fula (; ) as a widespread trade language in the Mopti region and beyond, the Songhay languages along the Niger, Tamasheq in the eastern part of Mali's Sahara and Arabic in its western part. \n\nThirteen of the most widely spoken indigenous languages are considered \"national languages.\" \n\nMost formal education for the deaf in Mali uses American Sign Language, introduced to West Africa by the deaf American missionary Andrew Foster. There are two other sign languages in Mali. One, Tebul Sign Language, is found in a village with a high incidence of congenital deafness. Another, Bamako Sign Language, developed in the after-work tea circles of the cities; it is threatened by the educational use of ASL.\n\nMost of the languages of Mali are among the Mande languages, which is generally accepted as a branch of Niger–Congo, Africa's largest language family. Non-Mande languages include the Dogon languages, perhaps another Niger–Congo branch, and the Senufo languages, which are unquestionably part of that family. \n\nMande, Senufo, and Dogon stand out among Niger–Congo because of their deviant SOV basic word order. The Gur languages are represented by Bomu on the Bani River of Mali and Burkina Faso. Fulfulde, spoken throughout West Africa, is a member of the Senegambian branch.\n\nOther language families include Afro-Asiatic, represented by the Berber language Tamasheq and by Arabic, and the Songhay languages, which have traditionally been classified as Nilo-Saharan but may constitute an independent language family.\n\nThe following table gives a summary of the 63 spoken languages reported by \"Ethnologue\" (there are also 3 sign languages):\n\nFrench is the official language. According to the Loi 96-049 of 1996 thirteen indigenous languages are recognised by the government as national languages: Bamanankan, Bomu, Bozo, Dɔgɔsɔ, Fulfulde, Hassaniya Arabic, Mamara, Maninkakan, Soninke, Soŋoy, Syenara, Tamasheq, Xaasongaxanŋo. This superseded the Decree 159 PG-RM of 19 July 1982 (Article 1).\n\nFrench is part of the standard school curriculum.

He studied in the school of the \"Escolapios\", and began to write at 15 years of age. After finalising the COU (pre-university course) he left for Madrid, where he started his university studies of Political Sciences and Sociology. After a stay in Monforte working in the family company, devoted to the glass industry, he returned to Madrid to study English, French and German. There he founded the magazine \"Loia\" with , Manuel Rivas and his brother Xosé Manuel Pereiro.\n\nIn 1981 he went to live in A Coruña, where he joined the magazine \"La Naval\". At that time he came into contact with a group of poets: , and , participating in several anthologies such as \"De amor e desamor\" (1984) and \"De amor e desamor II\" (1985), and collaborating in magazines like \"La Naval\", \"Trilateral\", \"Anima+l\" and \"Luzes of Galiza\". He published in 1997, in the magazine \"Luzes of Galiza\", the eight chapters of the short novel \"Náufragos do Paradiso\".\n\nBetween 1983 and 1987 he travelled with Fernando Saco in Europe. He worked translating German, French and English for cinema dubbing and, especially, in television, dubbing as much conventional series (episodes of \"Dallas\" and \"Kung fu\") as pornographic film.\n\nHe only published two collections of poems in his life, \"Poemas 1981/1991\" (1992) and \"Poesía última de amor e enfermidade\" (1995). In 1996, the year of his death, \"Poemas para unha Loia\", came to light which collected together works of his Madrid period, published in the magazine \"Loia\", and included the essay \"Modesta proposición para renunciar a facer xirar a roda hidráulica dunha cíclica historia universal da infamia\", published in the 27th volume of \"Luzes de Galiza\".\n\nWith regard to the cause of the death of Pereiro, in spite of suffering AIDS, it was an accumulation of illnesses that finished with liver failure.

However, retailers may choose to sell products for less than the MRP. MRP differs from systems using a recommended retail price because in those systems the price calculated by the manufacturer is only a recommendation, not enforceable by law.\n\nAll retail products in India must be marked with MRP. Shops cannot charge customers over the MRP. Some shops may charge slightly below MRP to draw more customers to their stores. In some remote areas, tourist spots, and in situations where a product is difficult to obtain, consumers are often charged illegally over the MRP.\n\nIn April 2015, it was reported that milk vendors in Mumbai were threatening a boycott after it was discovered they had been charging above MRP and the Maharashtra state government threatened to intervene.\n\nThe concept of Maximum Retail Price has been criticised as incompatible with the free market system, because it involves manufacturers deciding what profit retailers will make. It is easy to get around the MRP by charging for 'services' on top of the item price, such as a 'cooling charge' for cold drinks, or by manufacturers setting the MRP at up to ten times the expected sale price. The MRP also hurts consumers in rural areas because if retailers cannot charge a higher price to make up for the higher price of transportation and distribution to those areas, they may simply not stock many items.\n\n"}

However, it is traditionally assigned to the Occitan language.\n\nThe Mentonasc dialect bears strong similarities with the common alpine dialects, such as, Royasque or Pignasque. It differs quite significantly especially in the ear from Ligurian coastal dialects (Northern Italian), like those of Ventimiglia (Intemelio dialect) or Monaco.\n\nWhen the area of Menton was part of the Republic of Genoa and later of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Mentonasc was used in all of the coastal area between Monaco and Ventimiglia, and in the hinterland. \n\nIn the 19th century Mentonasc was used in the territories of the \"Free Cities of Menton & Roquebrune\", an independent statelet created in connection with the Italian Risorgimento.\n\nWhen France annexed the Free Cities in 1861, Mentonasc began its decline, substituted by the French language.\n\nThe Mentonasc dialect is currently spoken by about 10% of the population in Menton, Roquebrune, and the surrounding villages (Castellar, Castillon, Gorbio, Sainte-Agnès, Moulinet and Sospel).

Her novel \"La plaça del diamant\" ('The diamond square', translated as \"The Time of the Doves\", 1962) has become the most popular Catalan novel to date and has been translated into over 30 languages. Some critics consider it to be one of the best novels published in Spain after the Spanish Civil War.\n\nShe was born at 340 \"carrer de Balmes, Barcelona\", in 1908.

In 1928, just 20 years old, she married her uncle Joan Gurguí, 14 years her senior, and in 1929 she had her only child, Jordi. She began her writing career with short stories in magazines, as an escape from her unhappy marriage. She then wrote psychological novels, including \"Aloma\" which won the Crexells Prize, but even with the success this novel enjoyed, Rodoreda decided to remake and republish it some years later since she was not fully satisfied with this period of her life and her works at that time.\n\nAt the start of the Spanish Civil War, she worked for the \"Generalitat de Catalunya\", the autonomous Government of Catalonia.\n\nShe was exiled in France and later Switzerland, where in 1957 she broke her silence with the publication of her book \"Twenty-Two short stories\", which earned her the Víctor Català Prize.

For example, in the noun string “U.S. energy consumption” the nouns \"U.S.\" and \"energy\" modify the final noun \"consumption.\" Noun strings are frequently used in technical writing but appear in other general business contexts as well.\n\nSince connecting elements such as prepositions or apostrophes are omitted from noun strings, readers must infer the relationship between the words. If the string is fairly short and the reader is already familiar with the field, he or she will probably be able to interpret a noun string without too much difficulty. When strings become longer than three words, they can make readers labor. This is particularly true when the reader is not already familiar with the subject or technical domain. \n\nBecause of this problem, overly long noun strings are increasingly recognized as a problem in technical and business writing. For instance, a noun string like \"Municipal Solid Waste Classification Methodology\" though not incomprehensible, is at least irritating to most readers. According to Burnett, strings of five words or more are open to several different interpretations and can be indecipherable. Because of these problems, most guides to technical writing advise writers to either limit the length of nouns strings or to avoid them altogether.\n\nTo make long noun strings easier to understand, hyphenation can often help, as can using prepositions to show the relationship between the words, and converting the noun that hides the key action to a verb.

Because his work focused more on mood than plot, he became known as \"the Yiddish Maeterlinck\". His work as a playwright and through his own short-lived but influential troupe, laid much of the groundwork for the second golden age of Yiddish theater that began shortly after the end of World War I. The dialogue of his plays is consistently vivid, terse, and naturalistic. Unusually for a Yiddish playwright, most of his works have pastoral settings: he had grown up the son of a miller, and made several attempts at farming.\n\nHe was born in Grodno Governorate (present-day Podlaskie Voivodeship, Poland) where he was educated initially by local tutors, before he eventually made his way to Grodno and then Vilna, where he joined a circle of yeshiva students who studied the Bible, Hebrew grammar, and Jewish history together. Hirshbein began giving Hebrew lessons to support himself while publishing Hebrew poetry and writing Yiddish stories. He also began to shift from writing lyrical poetry to naturalist drama, starting with \"Miryam\" (1905), which he first wrote in Hebrew, later translated into Yiddish, and later still revised in Yiddish under the title \"Barg arop\" (Downhill). During the early 1900s, Hirshbein continued writing naturalist dramas in Hebrew, including \"Nevelah\" (Carcass), which in Yiddish (\"Di neveyle\") became one of Hirshbein's most successful works. \"Olamot bodedim\" (Lonely Worlds; 1906) marked a new symbolist phase in his career, as well as the end of his practice of writing originally in Hebrew. His symbolist Yiddish plays of this period include the one-act \"Kvorim-blumen\" (Grave Blossoms), \"Di erd\" (The Earth), \"In der finster\" (In the Dark), and \"Der tkies-kaf\" (The Handshake). He was instrumental in the revival of Yiddish theater in Russia shortly after the 1904 lifting of the 1883 ban on theatrical performances in that language. Prior to his involvement in Yiddish theater, he wrote several plays in Hebrew; these were published in the periodical \"Hazman\", but there was no audience at that time for Hebrew-language theater.\n\nIn 1908 Hirshbein moved to Odessa, where he wrote the drama \"Yoyel\" (Joel). Soon afterward, \"Af yener zayt taykh\" (On the Other Side of the River), his first Yiddish drama, was produced in Russian in Odessa. In autumn of the same year, Hirshbein, encouraged by Bialik and by students from an acting conservatory in Odessa, founded the theater company that became known as the Hirshbein Troupe. It was the first Yiddish company to devote itself exclusively to \"better\" Yiddish theater. The troupe toured through Imperial Russia for two years, staging his own plays, as well as works by Sholem Asch, David Pinski, Sholem Aleichem, and Jacob Gordin, as well as translations of plays by Semen Iushkevich and Herman Heijermans. The troupe's high literary standards and high standards of ensemble acting strongly influenced the later Vilna Troupe and Maurice Schwartz's New York-based Yiddish Art Theater.\nThe troupe disbanded in 1910 for financial reasons, at which point Hirschbein published what Jacob Glatshteyn (\"In tokh genumen\" [Sum and Substance], 1976, p. 77) has called \"the four greatest plays in the Yiddish repertoire\": \"A farvorfn vinkl\" (A Forsaken Corner; 1912), \"Di puste kretshme\" (The Empty [Deserted] Inn; 1913, written in America), \"Dem shmids tekhter\" (The Blacksmith's Daughters; 1918) and \"Grine felder\" (Green Fields; 1916). In these and other dramas, Hirshbein abandoned symbolism and returned to his rural roots, dramatizing the lives and loves of rural Jews. The understated quality of these works appealed to directors including Maurice Schwartz and Jacob Ben-Ami, and they became regular productions in the repertoire of artistically ambitious Yiddish theaters. His popularity extended to other cultures and genres, and his plays were performed in Russian, Hebrew, English, German, Spanish, and French. Indeed, the 1937 American film \"Grine felder\" (Green Fields), based on Hirshbein's play, is among the most beloved of all Yiddish films, and the play continues to be often anthologized and staged.\n\nHirshbein traveled extensively; in 1911 alone, he visited Vienna, Paris, London, and New York City. For a while in 1912, he tried farming in New York's Catskills (later, home to the Borscht Belt); he then returned briefly to Russia, and went from there to Argentina for another attempt at farming, this time in a Jewish agricultural colony. At the start of World War I he was \"en route\" to New York on a British ship, which was sunk by a German cruiser. He was briefly taken captive, then let off in Brazil, from where he eventually reached New York. He spent the succeeding decades traveling, accompanied by his wife, Yiddish poet Esther Shumiatcher-Hirschbein, and publishing both fiction and nonfiction based on his trips.\n\nHirschbein's son, Omus Hirschbein, a classical music administrator, was born in New York in 1934 just before the family moved to Los Angeles. Hirschbein suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease) for the last three years of his life. He died August 16, 1948 in Los Angeles.\n\nYiddish-language plays, unless otherwise noted. \n\n\n"}

It is generally estimated to have been spoken around 2,500 to 3,000 years ago, but on the question of where it was spoken, there is less agreement. The Algonquian family, which is a branch of the larger Algic language family, is usually divided into three subgroups: Eastern Algonquian, which is a genetic subgroup, and Central Algonquian and Plains Algonquian, both of which are areal groupings. In the historical linguistics of North America, Proto-Algonquian is one of the best studied, most thoroughly reconstructed proto-languages. It is descended from Proto-Algic.\n\nMost Algonquian languages are similar enough that their relatedness has been recognized for centuries and was commented on by the early English and French colonists and explorers. For example, in 1787 (over a decade before Sir William Jones' famous speech on Indo-European), the theologian and linguist Jonathan Edwards Jr. deduced that the Algonquian languages of the eastern and central United States were \"radically the same\" ('radically' meaning having a common 'root', since \"radix\" is Latin for 'root'), and contrasted them with the neighboring Iroquoian languages. The earliest work on reconstructing the Algonquian proto-language was undertaken by the linguists Truman Michelson and Leonard Bloomfield. In 1925 Bloomfield reconstructed what he called \"Primitive Central Algonquian\", using what were at the time the four best-attested Algonquian languages: Fox, Ojibwe, Menominee, and Plains Cree. Following his initial reconstructions, investigations of other languages revealed that his \"Primitive Central Algonquian\" was essentially equivalent to Proto-Algonquian. Bloomfield wrote a refinement and expansion of his reconstruction in 1946, and his two papers remain the starting point for all research and reconstructions of Proto-Algonquian. In the years since there has been an enormous amount of comparative work undertaken on the Algonquian family.\n\nThere remains some disagreement over the Algonquian \"Urheimat\" (homeland of the protolanguage). The initial theory, first put forth by Frank T. Siebert, Jr. in 1967 based on examining of the ranges of numerous species of plants and animals for which reliable Algonquian cognates existed, holds that Proto-Algonquian was spoken between Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario, in Ontario, Canada, and at least as far south as Niagara Falls. Research a generation later suggests that in fact it was spoken farther west than this, perhaps \"somewhere immediately west of Lake Superior.\"\n\nProto-Algonquian had four basic vowels, \"*i\", \"*e\", \"*a\", \"*o\", each of which had a long counterpart (commonly written \"*i·\", \"*e·\", \"*a·\", \"*o·\"), for a total of eight vowels. The same inventory of eight vowels was found in Proto-Algic, but Proto-Algonquian did not inherit its inventory directly from Proto-Algic. Rather, several sound changes left pre-Proto-Algonquian without short *\"i\" and *\"o\". It is not clear that they had redeveloped by the time of Proto-Algonquian. All instances in which Bloomfield reconstructed \"*o\" can now be reconstructed as \"*we\" based on evidence from some of the Eastern languages (for example, Bloomfield's \"*nekotwi\" \"one\" is now reconstructed as \"*nekwetwi\" based on forms like Munsee \"nkwúti\"). There are still a handful of instances where \"*o\" can be reconstructed, usually as the result of a morphophonological process of vowel shortening. Goddard concludes that \"an independent phoneme \"*o\" is of no great antiquity in Proto-Algonquian\", but recommends continuing to use it in reconstructions. Likewise, Berman states that \"PA \"*i\" is probably also of recent origin\", derived from earlier (pre-Proto-Algonquian) \"*ye\" sequences and morphophonological shortening.\n\nProto-Algonquian had a smaller number of consonants than Proto-Algic. The reconstructed consonants are as follows (given in the Americanist phonetic notation common in the literature):\nThe phoneme given in the table as ⟨r⟩ was reconstructed by Bloomfield as \"*l\", but Goddard has more recently argued that it should be reconstructed as \"*r\", largely because the earliest attestations of the majority of languages show some sort of rhotic as its reflex, which in many languages subsequently changed to a lateral within the historical period. The precise pronunciation of the phoneme written ⟨θ⟩ is unknown. It has merged with the reflex of \"*r\" in all Algonquian languages except for Cree and the Arapahoan languages. Leonard Bloomfield originally suggested that it could have been either an interdental fricative or a lateral fricative. One piece of evidence for the interdental fricative is that this is the reflex it has in Arapaho. However, other researchers have argued for its reconstruction as a lateral fricative, , in part because of the aforementioned merger in most languages with the phoneme traditionally reconstructed as \"*l\".\n\nAs with \"*i\" and \"*o\", it is unclear whether \"*č\" was an independent phoneme in Proto-Algonquian. Almost all instances where \"*č\" is reconstructed are before \"*i\", \"*i·\", or \"*y\", where it does not contrast with \"*t\" (see below), or are cases of diminutive consonant symbolism. However, Goddard recommends continuing to write it in reconstructions, since it seems to have been present in the clusters \"*čp\" and \"*čk\"; since it can be reconstructed before \"*a\" in the term \"*čapo·nk-\" \"splash\"; and since \"*t\" does appear before \"*i·\" in some reconstructions of the onomatopoeic noun \"ti·nti·wa\" \"blue jay\" (however, see Wiktionary for more).\n\nReconstruction of the consonant clusters has been relatively difficult, and the paths the clusters take in their evolutions to the daughter languages have been complex. The current view is that the permissible consonant clusters were (first member on the left, second member across the top):\n\nIn several cases the actual phonetic identity of the first member of the clusters was unknown, and Bloomfield's choice of symbols to represent them was purely arbitrary. Thus, ⟨x⟩ does not represent *[x], ⟨ç⟩ does not represent *[ç], and ⟨ʔ⟩ does not necessarily represent *[]. Goddard argues that Bloomfield's arbitrary symbol ⟨x⟩ be reconstructed as \"*s\", and Bloomfield's ⟨ç⟩ be reconstructed as \"*r\". While a glottal stop phoneme is not otherwise reconstructed, given that Bloomfield's ⟨ʔ⟩ in clusters seems to represent the neutralization of \"*p\" and \"*k\" and its realization in Menominee and Cheyenne is a glottal stop, it probably was indeed phonetically . The cluster written ⟨Hm⟩ shows up as \"p\" or \"m\" in most of the daughter languages, but as \"hm\" in Munsee (for example, PA \"*wi·kiwa·Hmi\" \"house\" becomes Ojibwe \"wiigiwaam\", Fox \"wîkiyâpi\", and Munsee \"wíikwahm\"). The first member of the cluster may have been either *h or .\n\nThe clusters \"*št\" and \"*hr\" are each reconstructed on the basis of only a single correspondence set (\"*št\" in \"*weštikwa·ni\", \"his/her head\"; and \"*hr\" in \"*re·hre·wa\", \"s/he breathes\") and may not have been part of Proto-Algonquian. David Pentland, for example, argued that Ojibwe \"oshtigwaan\", claimed as the only form requiring the reconstruction of \"*št\", is a borrowing from Cree. However, evidence from Munsee and Blackfoot seem to also point toward \"*št\" as a valid separate cluster in PA (Munsee \"wìilùshtíikan\", Blackfoot \"mo’tokááni\", \"head, hair\").\n\nFinally, all consonants and consonant clusters could be followed by \"*w\" or \"*y\" (although the sequences \"*čw\" and \"*hy\" did not occur; and \"*t\" and \"*θ\" were regularly replaced before \"*y\", for which see below).\n\nSeveral allophonic processes, morphophonemic processes, and phonological constraints can be reconstructed. Among the most significant of these processes was that \"*t\" and \"*θ\" became \"*č\" and \"*š\" respectively before \"*i\", \"*i·\", and \"*y\". For example, the initial \"*went-\" \"from there\" (as in \"*wentenamwa\" \"s/he takes it from there\") is realized as \"*wenč-\" in the word \"*wenči·wa\" \"s/he comes from there\", since it precedes \"*i·\".\n\nThere were several restrictions on phonotactics and the shape of the PA word that can be reconstructed. All words began with a single consonant (other than \"*h\") or vowel, or with a consonant plus \"*w\" or \"*y\"; there were no sequences of consecutive vowels; and the word always ended in a short vowel. The vowels \"*i\" and \"*o\" never occurred in initial syllables. A sequence of consonant+semivowel could not be followed by \"*o\" or \"*o·\". There was also a restriction which prevented two-syllable nouns from ending in a sequence of short vowel + consonant + short vowel.\n\nIn most cases, when the pronominal prefixes \"*ne-\" (first person), \"*ke-\" (second person), and \"*we-\" (third person) were added to a vowel-initial stem, an epenthetic \"*-t-\" was inserted between the prefix and the stem. Thus, the prefixes became \"*net-\", \"*ket-\", and \"*wet-\" respectively. For example, \"*ne-\" + \"*-ehkwa-\" = \"*netehkwa-\" \"my louse\". This feature goes back to Proto-Algic (compare Wiyot \"du-\" + \"híkw\" = \"dutíkw\" \"my louse\"). There were a handful of irregular exceptions to this pattern, however. For example, the prefixes lost their vowels before several kinship terms, as in \"*ne-\" + \"*-o·hkomehsa\" = \"*no·hkomehsa\" \"my grandmother.\"\nSeveral rules for internal sandhi in morpheme combinations can be reconstructed. The most basic was the insertion of a \"connective i\" between two consonants. For example, \"*po·n-\" \"cease\" + \"*-m\" \"act by speech on an animate object\" = \"*po·nime·wa\" \"s/he stops talking to him/her.\" In a few idiosyncratic cases, however, this rule did not operate, and instead the consonants were changed in various ways. For instance, the combination \"θ+p\" produced when the root \"*eθ-\" \"thither, thus\" was added to the final \"*-pahto·\" \"run\" simplified to \"*xp\": \"*expahta·wa\" \"s/he runs thither.\" One regular exception to the \"connective i\" rule was when the conjunct suffix \"*-ki\" was added to a verb stem ending in a consonant, for example \"*ki·šekat-\" \"be day\" + \"*-ki\" = \"*ki·šekaxki\" \"when it is day.\" Note that Bloomfield here actually reconstructed this word as \"*ki·šekaθki\", but evidence from other Algonquian languages has shown that the cluster should be reconstructed as \"*xk\". When two vowels became contiguous, if one was a long vowel and one was short, the short vowel dropped: \"*naka·-\" \"stop\" + \"*-en\" \"by hand\" = \"*naka·ne·wa\" \"s/he stops him/her by hand.\" If both were long, an epenthetic \"*y\" was inserted between the two.\n\nProto-Algonquian nouns had an animate/inanimate contrast: nouns representing animate beings (and some traditional items viewed as having spiritual powers) were classed as \"animate\", while all other nouns were \"inanimate\". The plural marker differed in form depending on whether the noun was animate or inanimate: animate nouns took a plural suffix \"*-aki\", while inanimate nouns took a plural suffix \"*-ari\". Another important distinction involved the contrast between nouns marked as \"proximate\" and those marked as \"obviative\". Proximate nouns were those deemed most central or important to the discourse, while obviative nouns were those less important to the discourse. When two third person participants appeared in a sentence, one was marked as proximate and the other as obviative, in order to distinguish which one was the subject and which was the object (since verbs inflected for whether they had a proximate or obviative subject and a proximate or obviative object). In a given stretch of discourse, there will not be two proximate or two obviative participants.\n\nThere were personal pronouns which distinguished three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), inclusive and exclusive first person plural, and proximate and obviative third persons. Demonstrative pronouns have been more difficult to reconstruct, as many of the daughter languages have innovated a great deal.\n\nPA had four classes of verbs: transitive verbs with an animate object (abbreviated TA), transitive verbs with an inanimate object (TI), intransitive verbs with an animate subject (AI), and intransitive verbs with an inanimate subject (II). Transitive verbs had two paradigms, termed \"objective\" and \"absolute\". Objective verbs were used when the object of the verb was not present as an overt noun elsewhere in the sentence, while absolute verbs were used when the object of the verb \"was\" marked with an overt noun in the sentence. Objective verbs could also be used when an object was present, and in such cases indicated that the object was definite, as opposed to indefinite.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7859156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7859156", "title": "Release print", "text": "Release print\n\nA release print is a copy of a film that is provided to a movie theater for exhibition.\n\nRelease prints are not to be confused with other types of print used in the photochemical post-production process:\n\n\nIn the traditional photochemical post-production workflow, release prints are usually copies, made using a high-speed continuous contact printer, of an internegative (sometimes referred to as a 'dupe negative'), which in turn is a copy of an interpositive (these were sometimes referred to as 'lavender prints' in the past), which in turn is a copy, optically printed to incorporate special effects, fades, etc., from the cut camera negative. In short, a typical release print is three generations removed from the cut camera negative.\n\nThe post-production of many feature films is now carried out using a digital intermediate workflow, in which the uncut camera negative is scanned, editing and other post-production functions are carried out using computers, and an internegative is burnt out to film, from which the release prints are struck in the normal way. This procedure eliminates at least one generation of analogue duplication and usually results in a significantly higher quality of release prints. It has the further advantage that a Digital Cinema Package can be produced as the final output in addition to or instead of film prints, meaning that a single post-production workflow can produce all the required distribution media.\n\nAs of March 2015, Eastman Kodak is the only remaining manufacturer of colour release print stock in the world. Along with Kodak, ORWO of Germany also sells black-and-white print stock. Other manufacturers, principally DuPont of the United States, Fujifilm of Japan (the penultimate company to discontinue colour print stock), Agfa-Gevaert of Germany, Ilford of the United Kingdom and Tasma of the Soviet Union competed with Kodak in the print stock market throughout most of the twentieth century.\n\nThe person operating the printer on which the release print is struck must take several factors into consideration in order to achieve accurate color. These include the stock manufacturer, the color temperature of the bulbs in the printer, and the various color filters which may have been introduced during initial filming or subsequent generation of duplicates.\n\nAt the theater, release prints are projected through an aperture plate, placed between the film and the projector's light source. The aperture plate in combination with a prime lens of the appropriate focal distance determines which areas of the frame are magnified and projected and which are masked out, according to the aspect ratio in which the film is intended to be projected. Sometimes a hard matte is used in printing to ensure that only the area of the frame shot in the camera that is intended to be projected is actually present on the release print. Some theaters have also used aperture plates that mask away part of the frame area that \"is\" supposed to be projected, usually where the screen is too small to accommodate a wider ratio and does not have a masking system in front of the screen itself. The audience may be confused when significant action appears on the masked-off edges of the picture. Director Brad Bird expressed frustration at this practice, which some theaters applied to his film \"The Incredibles\".\n\nRelease prints are generally expensive. For example, in the United States, it is not unusual for each one to cost around $1,500 to print and ship to theaters around the country. The cost of a release print is determined primarily by its length, the type of print stock used and the number of prints being struck in a given run. Laser subtitling release prints of foreign language films adds significantly to the cost per print. Due to the fear of piracy, distributors try to ensure that prints are returned and destroyed after the movie's theatrical run is complete. However, small numbers of release prints do end up in the hands of private collectors, usually entering this market via projectionists, who simply retain their prints at the end of the run and do not return them. A significant number of films have been preserved this way, via prints eventually being donated to film archives and preservation masters printed from them. The polyester film base is often recycled. \n\nEKs (showprints) are even more expensive as they are almost completely made by hand and to much higher quality standards. Perhaps only five EKs will be made of a widely distributed feature, compared to thousands of standard prints. They are intended primarily for first-run and Academy-consideration theatrical runs in Los Angeles and New York City. This accounts for two of the typically five produced. Two EKs are usually reserved for the film's producer. The remaining EK is usually archived by the film's distributor.\n\nConventional release prints, which are made from timed internegatives, usually contain black motor and changeover cue marks as the printing internegatives are \"punched\" and \"inked\" for this specific purpose. Showprints, being made from the composited camera negatives, which are never \"punched\" or \"inked\", have white motor and changeover cue marks as these marks are punched (or scribed) directly on the prints by hand, in the lab.\n\n"}
{"id": "25431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25431", "title": "Russian language", "text": "Russian language\n\nRussian () is an East Slavic language, which is official in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as being widely spoken throughout Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, the Caucasus and Central Asia. It was the \"de facto\" language of the Soviet Union until its dissolution on 25 December 1991.\n\nRussian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages, one of the four living members of the East Slavic languages, and part of the larger Balto-Slavic branch. Written examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onward.\n\nIt is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages and the largest native language in Europe, with 144 million speakers in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Russian is the eighth most spoken language in the world by number of native speakers and the seventh by total number of speakers. The language is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Russian is also the third most widespread language on the Internet after English and German, respectively.\n\nRussian distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without, the so-called \"soft\" and \"hard\" sounds. Almost every consonant has a hard or a soft counterpart, and the distinction is a prominent feature of the language. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels. Stress, which is unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically though an optional acute accent may be used to mark stress, such as to distinguish between homographic words, for example (zamók, meaning \"a lock\") and (zámok, meaning \"a castle\"), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names.\n\nRussian is an East Slavic language of the wider Indo-European family. It is a lineal descendant of the language used in Kievan Rus', a loose conglomerate of East Slavic tribes from the late 9th to the mid 13th centuries. From the point of view of spoken language, its closest relatives are Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn, the other three languages in the East Slavic languages. In many places in eastern and southern Ukraine and throughout Belarus, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures such as Surzhyk in eastern Ukraine and Trasianka in Belarus. An East Slavic Old Novgorod dialect, although vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common Church Slavonic influence on both languages, as well as because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, although Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian. In the 19th century (in Russia until 1917), the language was often called \"Great Russian\" to distinguish it from Belarusian, then called \"White Russian\" and Ukrainian, then called \"Little Russian\".\n\nThe vocabulary (mainly abstract and literary words), principles of word formations, and, to some extent, inflections and literary style of Russian have been also influenced by Church Slavonic, a developed and partly russified form of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic language used by the Russian Orthodox Church. However, the East Slavic forms have tended to be used exclusively in the various dialects that are experiencing a rapid decline. In some cases, both the East Slavic and the Church Slavonic forms are in use, with many different meanings. \"For details, see Russian phonology and History of the Russian language.\"\n\nOver the course of centuries, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have also been influenced by Western and Central European languages such as Greek, Latin, Polish, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English, and to a lesser extent the languages to the south and the east: Uralic, Turkic, Persian, and Arabic, as well as Hebrew.\n\nAccording to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, Russian is classified as a level III language in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers, requiring approximately 1,100 hours of immersion instruction to achieve intermediate fluency. It is also regarded by the United States Intelligence Community as a \"hard target\" language, due to both its difficulty to master for English speakers and its critical role in U.S. world policy.\n\nThe standard form of Russian is generally regarded as the \"modern Russian literary language\" (). It arose in the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of Peter the Great, and developed from the Moscow (Middle or Central Russian) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century's Russian chancellery language.\n\nMikhail Lomonosov first compiled a normalizing grammar book in 1755; in 1783 the Russian Academy's first explanatory Russian dictionary appeared. During the end of the 18th and 19th centuries, a period known as the \"Golden Age\", the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation of the Russian language was stabilized and standardized, and it became the nationwide literary language; meanwhile, Russia's world-famous literature flourished.\n\nUntil the 20th century, the language's spoken form was the language of only the upper noble classes and urban population, as Russian peasants from the countryside continued to speak in their own dialects. By the mid-20th century, such dialects were forced out with the introduction of the compulsory education system that was established by the Soviet government. Despite the formalization of Standard Russian, some nonstandard dialectal features (such as fricative in Southern Russian dialects) are still observed in colloquial speech.\n\nIn 2010, there were 259.8 million speakers of Russian in the world: in Russia – 137.5 million, in the CIS and Baltic countries – 93.7 million, in Eastern Europe – 12.9 million, Western Europe – 7.3 million, Asia – 2.7 million, Middle East and North Africa – 1.3 million, Sub-Saharan Africa – 0.1 million, Latin America – 0.2 million, U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand – 4.1 million speakers. Therefore, the Russian language is the 7th largest in the world by number of speakers, after English, Mandarin, Hindi-Urdu, Spanish, and Arabic.\n\nRussian is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Education in Russian is still a popular choice for both Russian as a second language (RSL) and native speakers in Russia as well as many of the former Soviet republics. Russian is still seen as an important language for children to learn in most of the former Soviet republics. Samuel P. Huntington wrote in the \"Clash of Civilizations\", \"During the heyday of the Soviet Union, Russian was the \"lingua franca\" from Prague to Hanoi.\"\n\nIn Belarus, Russian is co-official alongside Belarusian per the Constitution of Belarus. 77% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 67% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.\n\nIn Estonia, Russian is spoken by 29.6% of the population according to a 2011 estimate from the World Factbook. and is officially considered a foreign language.\n\nIn Latvia, Russian is officially considered a foreign language. 55% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 26% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work. On 18 February 2012, Latvia held a constitutional referendum on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language. According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%.\n\nIn Lithuania, Russian is not official, but it still retains the function of a \"lingua franca\". In contrast to the other two Baltic states, Lithuania has a relatively small Russian-speaking minority (5.0% as of 2008).\n\nIn Moldova, Russian is considered to be the language of inter-ethnic communication under a Soviet-era law. 50% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 19% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census in Russia, Russian language skills were indicated by 138 million people (99.4% of the population), while according to the 2002 census – 142.6 million people (99.2% of the population).\n\nIn Ukraine, Russian is seen as a language of inter-ethnic communication, and a minority language, under the 1996 Constitution of Ukraine. According to estimates from Demoskop Weekly, in 2004 there were 14,400,000 native speakers of Russian in the country, and 29 million active speakers. 65% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 38% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.\n\nIn the 20th century, Russian was a mandatory language taught in the schools of the members of the old Warsaw Pact and in other countries that used to be satellites of the USSR. According to the Eurobarometer 2005 survey, fluency in Russian remains fairly high (20–40%) in some countries, in particular those where the people speak a Slavic language and thereby have an edge in learning Russian (namely, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Bulgaria).\n\nSignificant Russian-speaking groups also exist in Western Europe. These have been fed by several waves of immigrants since the beginning of the 20th century, each with its own flavor of language. The United Kingdom, Germany, Finland, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Norway, and Austria have significant Russian-speaking communities.\n\nIn Armenia, Russian has no official status, but it is recognized as a minority language under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. 30% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 2% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, Russian has no official status, but is a \"lingua franca\" of the country. 26% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 5% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.\n\nIn China, Russian has no official status, but it is spoken by the small Russian communities in the Northeastern Heilongjiang province.\n\nIn Georgia, Russian has no official status, but it is recognized as a minority language under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Russian is the language of 9% of the population according to the World Factbook. Ethnologue cites Russian as the country's de facto working language.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, Russian is not a state language, but according to article 7 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan its usage enjoys equal status to that of the Kazakh language in state and local administration. The 2009 census reported that 10,309,500 people, or 84.8% of the population aged 15 and above, could read and write well in Russian, as well as understand the spoken language.\n\nIn Kyrgyzstan, Russian is an official language per article 5 of the Constitution of Kyrgyzstan. The 2009 census states that 482,200 people speak Russian as a native language, or 8.99% of the population. Additionally, 1,854,700 residents of Kyrgyzstan aged 15 and above fluently speak Russian as a second language, or 49.6% of the population in the age group.\n\nIn Tajikistan, Russian is the language of inter-ethnic communication under the Constitution of Tajikistan and is permitted in official documentation. 28% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 7% used it as the main language with family, friends or at work. The World Factbook notes that Russian is widely used in government and business.\n\nIn Turkmenistan, Russian lost its status as the official \"lingua franca\" in 1996. Russian is spoken by 12% of the population according to an undated estimate from the World Factbook.\n\nIn Uzbekistan, Russian is de facto the second official language. Has some official roles, being permitted in official documentation and is the lingua franca of the country and the language of the élite. Russian is spoken by 14.2% of the population according to an undated estimate from the World Factbook. \n\nIn 2005, Russian was the most widely taught foreign language in Mongolia, and was compulsory in Year 7 onward as a second foreign language in 2006.\n\nRussian is also spoken in Israel. The number of native Russian-speaking Israelis numbers around 1.5 million Israelis. The Israeli press and websites regularly publish material in Russian.. With Israel Plus, there is an Israeli TV channel mainly broadcasting in Russian. See also Russian language in Israel.\n\nRussian is also spoken as a second language by a small number of people in Afghanistan.\n\nThe language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 18th century. Although most Russian colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left. Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in North America, especially in large urban centers of the U.S. and Canada, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Toronto, Baltimore, Miami, Chicago, Denver, and Cleveland. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in New York City were Russian-speaking Jews. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the United States Census, in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.\n\nRussian is one of the official languages (or has similar status and interpretation must be provided into Russian) of the following:\n\nThe Russian language is also one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station – NASA astronauts who serve alongside Russian cosmonauts usually take Russian language courses. This practice goes back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.\n\nIn March 2013 it was announced that Russian is now the second-most used language on the Internet after English. People use the Russian language on 5.9% of all websites, slightly ahead of German and far behind English (54.7%). Russian is used not only on 89.8% of .ru sites, but also on 88.7% of sites with the former Soviet Union domain .su. The websites of former Soviet Union nations also use high levels of Russian: 79.0% in Ukraine, 86.9% in Belarus, 84.0% in Kazakhstan, 79.6% in Uzbekistan, 75.9% in Kyrgyzstan and 81.8% in Tajikistan. However, Russian is the sixth-most used language on the top 1,000 sites, behind English, Chinese, French, German and Japanese.\n\nRussian is a rather homogeneous language, in terms of dialectal variation, due to the early political centralization under Moscow's rule, compulsory education, mass migration from rural to urban areas in the 20th century, as well as other factors. The standard language is used in written and spoken form almost everywhere in the country, from Kaliningrad and Saint Petersburg in the West to Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the East, notwithstanding the enormous distance in between.\n\nDespite leveling after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, \"Northern\" and \"Southern\", with Moscow lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, Northern, Central (or Middle) and Southern, with Moscow lying in the Central region. All dialects also divided in two main chronological categories: the dialects of \"primary formation\" (the territory of Muscovy, roughly consists of the modern Central and Northwestern Federal districts); and \"secondary formation\" (other territory). Dialectology within Russia recognizes dozens of smaller-scale variants. The dialects often show distinct and non-standard features of pronunciation and intonation, vocabulary and grammar. Some of these are relics of ancient usage now completely discarded by the standard language.\n\nThe Northern Russian dialects and those spoken along the Volga River typically pronounce unstressed clearly, a phenomenon called okanye (). Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have high or diphthongal in the place of and in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian and . An interesting morphological feature is a post-posed definite article \"-to\", \"-ta\", \"-te\" similarly to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.\n\nIn the Southern Russian dialects, instances of unstressed and following palatalized consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced in such positions (e.g. is pronounced , not ) – this is called yakanye ().\nConsonants include a fricative, a semivowel and , whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants , , and final and , respectively.\nThe morphology features a palatalized final in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects). Some of these features such as akanye and yakanye, a debuccalized or lenited , a semivowel and palatalized final in 3rd person forms of verbs are also present in modern Belarusian and some dialects of Ukrainian (Eastern Polesian), indicating a linguistic continuum.\n\nThe city of Veliky Novgorod has historically displayed a feature called chokanye or tsokanye ( or ), in which and were switched or merged. So, ('heron') has been recorded as . Also, the second palatalization of velars did not occur there, so the so-called ě² (from the Proto-Slavic diphthong *ai) did not cause to shift to ; therefore, where Standard Russian has ('chain'), the form is attested in earlier texts.\n\nAmong the first to study Russian dialects was Lomonosov in the 18th century. In the 19th, Vladimir Dal compiled the first dictionary that included dialectal vocabulary. Detailed mapping of Russian dialects began at the turn of the 20th century. In modern times, the monumental \"Dialectological Atlas of the Russian Language\" ( ), was published in three folio volumes 1986–1989, after four decades of preparatory work.\n\n\nRussian is written using a Cyrillic alphabet. The Russian alphabet consists of 33 letters. The following table gives their upper case forms, along with values for each letter's typical sound:\nOlder letters of the Russian alphabet include , which merged to ( or ); and , which both merged to (); , which merged to (); , which merged to (); , which merged to ( or ); and and , which later were graphically reshaped into and merged phonetically to or . While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The yers and originally indicated the pronunciation of \"ultra-short\" or \"reduced\" , .\n\nBecause of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, ('frost') is transliterated \"moroz\", and ('mouse'), \"mysh\" or \"myš\"'. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of Unicode character encoding, which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet. Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.\n\nThe Russian alphabet has many systems of character encoding. KOI8-R was designed by the Soviet government and was intended to serve as the standard encoding. This encoding was and still is widely used in UNIX-like operating systems. Nevertheless, the spread of MS-DOS and OS/2 (IBM866), traditional Macintosh (ISO/IEC 8859-5) and Microsoft Windows (CP1251) created chaos and ended by establishing different encodings as de facto standards, with Windows-1251 becoming a de facto standard in Russian Internet and e-mail communication during the period of roughly 1995–2005.\n\nAll the obsolete 8-bit encodings are rarely used in the communication protocols and text-exchange data formats, having been mostly replaced with UTF-8. A number of encoding conversion applications were developed. \"iconv\" is an example that is supported by most versions of Linux, Macintosh and some other operating systems; but converters are rarely needed unless accessing texts created more than a few years ago.\n\nIn addition to the modern Russian alphabet, Unicode (and thus UTF-8) encodes the Early Cyrillic alphabet (which is very similar to the Greek alphabet), as well as all other Slavic and non-Slavic but Cyrillic-based alphabets.\n\nRussian spelling is reasonably phonemic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonemics, morphology, etymology, and grammar; and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points. A number of rigid spelling rules introduced between the 1880s and 1910s have been responsible for the former whilst trying to eliminate the latter.\n\nThe current spelling follows the major reform of 1918, and the final codification of 1956. An update proposed in the late 1990s has met a hostile reception, and has not been formally adopted. The punctuation, originally based on Byzantine Greek, was in the 17th and 18th centuries reformulated on the French and German models.\n\nAccording to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional acute accent () may, and sometimes should, be used to mark stress. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: – (\"lock\" – \"castle\"), – (\"worthwhile\" – \"standing\"), – (\"this is odd\" – \"this is marvelous\"), – (\"attaboy\" – \"fine young man\"), – (\"I shall learn it\" – \"I recognize it\"), – (\"to be cutting\" – \"to have cut\"); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names (, , , , ), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence ( \"Was it \"you\" who ate the cookie? – Did you \"eat\" the cookie? – Was it the \"cookie\" that you ate?\"). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.\n\nThe phonological system of Russian is inherited from Common Slavonic; it underwent considerable modification in the early historical period before being largely settled around the year 1400.\n\nThe language possesses five vowels (or six, under the St.Petersburg Phonological School), which are written with different letters depending on whether the preceding consonant is palatalized. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called \"hard\" and \"soft.\" (The \"hard\" consonants are often velarized, especially before front vowels, as in Irish). The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels tend to be reduced to near-close vowels or an unclear schwa. (See also: vowel reduction in Russian.)\n\nThe Russian syllable structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the structure can be described as follows:\n\nClusters of four consonants are not very common, however, especially within a morpheme. Some examples are: (, 'glance'), (, 'of the states'), (, 'of the constructions').\n\nRussian is notable for its distinction based on palatalization of most of the consonants. While do have palatalized allophones , only might be considered a phoneme, though it is marginal and generally not considered distinctive. The only native minimal pair that argues for being a separate phoneme is (, 'it weaves') (, 'this cat'). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of and , the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian ць, дзь, or Polish ć, dź). The sounds are dental, that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the alveolar ridge.\n\nRussian has preserved an Indo-European synthetic-inflectional structure, although considerable levelling has taken place.\nRussian grammar encompasses:\n\nThe spoken language has been influenced by the literary one but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.\n\nThe Church Slavonic language was introduced to Moskovy in the late 15th century and was adopted as official language for correspondence for convenience. Firstly with the newly conquered south-western regions of former Kyivan Rus and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, later, when Moskovy cut its ties with the Golden Horde, for communication between all newly consolidated regions of Moskovy.\n\nIn terms of actual grammar, there are three tenses in Russian - past, present and future - and each verb has two aspects (perfective and imperfective). Russian nouns each have a gender - either feminine, masculine or neutral, indicated by spelling at the end of the word. Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six cases: Nominative (for the subject of the sentence), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession), Instrumental (to indicate 'with' or 'by means of') and Prepositional (used after a preposition). Verbs of motion in Russian - such as 'go', 'walk', 'run', 'swim' and 'fly' - use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of prefixes to add more meaning to the verb.\n\nSee History of the Russian language for an account of the successive foreign influences on Russian.\n\nThe number of listed words or entries in some of the major dictionaries published during the past two centuries, and the total vocabulary of Alexander Pushkin (who is credited with greatly augmenting and codifying literary Russian), are as follows:\n\nThe history of Russian language may be divided into the following periods:\n\nJudging by the historical records, by approximately 1000 AD the predominant ethnic group over much of modern European Russia, Ukraine and Belarus was the Eastern branch of the Slavs, speaking a closely related group of dialects. The political unification of this region into Kievan Rus' in about 880, from which modern Russia, Ukraine and Belarus trace their origins, established Old East Slavic as a literary and commercial language. It was soon followed by the adoption of Christianity in 988 and the introduction of the South Slavic Old Church Slavonic as the liturgical and official language. Borrowings and calques from Byzantine Greek began to enter the Old East Slavic and spoken dialects at this time, which in their turn modified the Old Church Slavonic as well.\nDialectal differentiation accelerated after the breakup of Kievan Rus' in approximately 1100. On the territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine emerged Ruthenian and in modern Russia medieval Russian. They became distinct since the 13th century, i.e. following the division of that land between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Poland and Hungary in the west and independent Novgorod and Pskov feudal republics plus numerous small duchies (which came to be vassals of the Tatars) in the east.\n\nThe official language in Moscow and Novgorod, and later, in the growing Muscovy, was Church Slavonic, which evolved from Old Church Slavonic and remained the literary language for centuries, until the Petrine age, when its usage became limited to biblical and liturgical texts. Russian developed under a strong influence of Church Slavonic until the close of the 17th century; afterward the influence reversed, leading to corruption of liturgical texts.\n\nThe political reforms of Peter the Great (Пётр Вели́кий, \"Pyótr Velíkiy\") were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke French daily, and German sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19th century, e.g. Leo Tolstoy's (Лев Толсто́й) \"War and Peace\", contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.\n\nThe modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of Alexander Pushkin () in the first third of the 19th century. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called — \"high style\") in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin's texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19th century, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (), Nikolai Gogol (), Aleksander Griboyedov (), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.\n\n<poem> \n\nThe political upheavals of the early 20th century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the spelling reform of 1918. Political circumstances and Soviet accomplishments in military, scientific and technological matters (especially cosmonautics), gave Russian a worldwide prestige, especially during the mid-20th century.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the official language only in 1990. Following the break-up of the USSR in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.\n\nThe Russian language in the world declined after 1991 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and decrease in the number of Russians in the world and diminution of the total population in Russia (where Russian is an official language), however this has since been reversed.\n\nAccording to figures published in 2006 in the journal \"\" research deputy director of Research Center for Sociological Research of the Ministry of Education and Science (Russia) Arefyev A. L., the Russian language is gradually losing its position in the world in general, and in Russia in particular. In 2012, A. L. Arefyev published a new study \"Russian language at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries\", in which he confirmed his conclusion about the trend of weakening of the Russian language after the Soviet Union's collapse in various regions of the world (findings published in 2013 in the journal \"\"). In the countries of the former Soviet Union the Russian language was being replaced or used in conjunction with local languages. Currently the number speakers of Russian language in the world depends on the number of Russians in the world and total population in Russia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3124804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3124804", "title": "Tate conjecture", "text": "Tate conjecture\n\nIn number theory and algebraic geometry, the Tate conjecture is a 1963 conjecture of John Tate that would describe the algebraic cycles on a variety in terms of a more computable invariant, the Galois representation on étale cohomology. The Tate conjecture is a central problem in the theory of algebraic cycles. It can be considered an arithmetic analog of the Hodge conjecture.\n\nLet \"V\" be a smooth projective variety over a field \"k\" which is finitely generated over its prime field. Let \"k\" be a separable closure of \"k\", and let \"G\" be the absolute Galois group Gal(\"k\"/\"k\") of \"k\". Fix a prime number ℓ which is invertible in \"k\". Consider the ℓ-adic cohomology groups (coefficients in the ℓ-adic integers Z, scalars then extended to the ℓ-adic numbers Q) of the base extension of \"V\" to \"k\"; these groups are representations of \"G\". For any \"i\" ≥ 0, a codimension-\"i\" subvariety of \"V\" (understood to be defined over \"k\") determines an element of the cohomology group\n\nwhich is fixed by \"G\". Here Q(\"i\" ) denotes the \"i\"th Tate twist, which means that this representation of the Galois group \"G\" is tensored with the \"i\"th power of the cyclotomic character.\n\nThe Tate conjecture states that the subspace \"W\" of \"W\" fixed by the Galois group \"G\" is spanned, as a Q-vector space, by the classes of codimension-\"i\" subvarieties of \"V\". An algebraic cycle means a finite linear combination of subvarieties; so an equivalent statement is that every element of \"W\" is the class of an algebraic cycle on \"V\" with Q coefficients.\n\nThe Tate conjecture for divisors (algebraic cycles of codimension 1) is a major open problem. For example, let \"f\" : \"X\" → \"C\" be a morphism from a smooth projective surface onto a smooth projective curve over a finite field. Suppose that the generic fiber \"F\" of \"f\", which is a curve over the function field \"k\"(\"C\"), is smooth over \"k\"(\"C\"). Then the Tate conjecture for divisors on \"X\" is equivalent to the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for the Jacobian variety of \"F\". By contrast, the Hodge conjecture for divisors on any smooth complex projective variety is known (the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem).\n\nProbably the most important known case is that the Tate conjecture is true for divisors on abelian varieties. This is a theorem of Tate for abelian varieties over finite fields, and of Faltings for abelian varieties over number fields, part of Faltings's solution of the Mordell conjecture. Zarhin extended these results to any finitely generated base field. The Tate conjecture for divisors on abelian varieties implies the Tate conjecture for divisors on any product of curves \"C\" × ... × \"C\".\n\nThe (known) Tate conjecture for divisors on abelian varieties is equivalent to a powerful statement about homomorphisms between abelian varieties. Namely, for any abelian varieties \"A\" and \"B\" over a finitely generated field \"k\", the natural map\n\nis an isomorphism. In particular, an abelian variety \"A\" is determined up to isogeny by the Galois representation on its Tate module \"H\"(\"A\", Z).\n\nThe Tate conjecture also holds for K3 surfaces over finitely generated fields of characteristic not 2. (On a surface, the nontrivial part of the conjecture is about divisors.) In characteristic zero, the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces was proved by André and Tankeev. For K3 surfaces over finite fields of characteristic not 2, the Tate conjecture was proved by Nygaard, Ogus, Charles, Madapusi Pera, and Maulik.\n\nLet \"X\" be a smooth projective variety over a finitely generated field \"k\". The semisimplicity conjecture predicts that the representation of the Galois group \"G\" = Gal(\"k\"/\"k\") on the ℓ-adic cohomology of \"X\" is semisimple (that is, a direct sum of irreducible representations). For \"k\" of characteristic 0, showed that the Tate conjecture (as stated above) implies the semisimplicity of formula_3 For \"k\" finite of order \"q\", Tate showed that the Tate conjecture plus the semisimplicity conjecture would imply the strong Tate conjecture, namely that the order of the pole of the zeta function \"Z\"(\"X\", \"t\") at \"t\" = \"q\" is equal to the rank of the group of algebraic cycles of codimension \"j\" modulo numerical equivalence.\n\nLike the Hodge conjecture, the Tate conjecture would imply most of Grothendieck's standard conjectures on algebraic cycles. Namely, it would imply the Lefschetz standard conjecture (that the inverse of the Lefschetz isomorphism is defined by an algebraic correspondence); that the Künneth components of the diagonal are algebraic; and that numerical equivalence and homological equivalence of algebraic cycles are the same.\n\n\n"}
